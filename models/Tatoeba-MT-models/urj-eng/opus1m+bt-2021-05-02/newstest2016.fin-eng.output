He's all right, and now we're starting a follow-up.
The boy was found in the vicinity of the house. Dad told me.

Cristiano Ronaldo hit five goals in the Spanish league in the weekend and continued his factory in the league of the Masters.
The competition between Lionel Mess and Cristiano Ronaldo for at least a moment turned to the latter's advantage.
Real Madrid’s Rondom alone moved to the top of all time goal-makers’ statistics when he shot the visitor, Shahtar Donetsk’s network, two hits of penalty and one play situation.

The Juventus has, since early in the Italian football league in Serena A, but in the league D of the Masters, it started with a strong 2-1 visit from Manchester City.
The winning painting was done ten minutes before the end of Juventus Alvaro Morata.
The city's attack was bored by the absence of a knee-sucking Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, injured in the weekend election game, only came to the field with the last ten minutes.
Manchester's second company United also experienced hard work in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after having suffered 1-2 drops.
Luke Shaw, a 20-year-old wingman, was only able to take a watch hour.
The dangerous slide contrast of the PSV Hector Moreno hit the target of the attacked ManU package so badly that Shaw probably broke his leg.
Shaw lay on Eindhoven's home stadium for about ten minutes before the medical staff left to take him to hospital care.

The Opposition Party immediately called for a distinction - the President gave the wrong speech
Robert Mugabe, President of Zimbabwe, gave the same speech that he had spoken about a month ago.
The President of Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, has once again held the same speech in Parliament that he held at the end of last month.
Mugabe did not seem to have the same speech during his 25-minute speech.
The speech raised doubts as to whether Mugabe, who was 91, was in full power of life.
The MDC requested Mugabe to resign from his mission because this is too old to rule.
Mugabe’s assistants urged to say that the confusion had occurred only in Mugabe’s staff and that the President had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech dealt with earlier and now China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria want an extraordinary summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have presented an extra EU leadership summit next week because of the refugee crisis.
Donald Tusk, President of the European Council, will assess the request.
According to the German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel, the heads of state should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how more effective registration will be made in Europe.
According to Merkel, negotiations on quotas for asylum seekers are at the table of the ministers of the Interior.
The teacher admits that he shot his girlfriend during the emergency call.
It's just a little bit of a colourful university teacher, Shannon Lamb, telling the police during the emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police have to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his, uh, dear dog, was alive and probably shocked, and said that the contact details of the woman who died were found on this phone.
In the house, the police found Amy Prentiss' body and the message written on the green page: “I am so sorry that I could cancel this beloved Amy and she’s the only woman who ever loved me,” said the letter that experts said Lamb signed.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Cleveland Delta State University, had already traveled nearly 500 kilometers to the school campus where the police believe he had shot and killed a respected history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, to the door of this office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford told the university staff about the shooting at 10.18.
She said Lamb called a fatal emergency call a while after that.
By the end of the day, the number of dead rose again: Lamb committed suicide when the police surrounded by the hut.
The authorities were still trying to figure out Lamb's motives the day after students and staff had to hide behind locked doors because of the shooting.
Scientists on both sides of the state have published information that students and staff described Lamb as a gifted teacher, but possibly having problems.
The students told me they were waiting for him for hours.
The Prentis State of Death, Gautier, the police say that Lamb had no violent past or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb’s book, in which he thanked “great people, ” with whom he shared the life of academics.
Both were taught by the Institute of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 members of staff together, and many students participated in the courses of both men.
On the other hand, there were some signs of problems.
The student named Brandon Beavers complimented Lamb, but said he also seemed nervous and restless, as if something had been wrong.
The second student, Mikel Sykes, told Lamb that he had a lot of stress at the end of 2014-15.
Lamb had previously asked for a hospital at Delta State University, saying he had some kind of health problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's remuneration principles meant that even though Lamb had worked hard for his doctorate, it did not reverse his automatic career development and assistant professorship.
The director of the University William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that clearly there was something in Lamb's mind.
Lamb can no longer answer these questions.
After Lamb had fled the campus, the police got to him when he moved back to Mississippi from the state of Arkansas.
Before he was arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-calibre pistol in the backyard of a house about a half-mile south of his parents' house in the suburbs of Mississippi Greenville, told Methel Johnson, the Washington County Killer.
Lamb's car was still in the yard.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, even though Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the University of 2009 and taught geography and educational science. The University has 3500 students and it is located in a city with about 12 000 inhabitants.
Lamb performed a doctoral degree in educational science in the spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as intelligent, charismatic, and funny.
Carla Hairston told me he was 15 years old and Lamb was 20 when they met through friends together.
Her friend was in high school, and Lamb was a funny older guy who tried to teach her to play guitar for many years.
He was quite a wretched in those days.
All the girls were floating in wax when he was here, now told me about 40-year-old Hairston, who lives in Jackson's suburbs in Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had been seeing each other for some time.
In an emergency call, Lamb told me he killed his wife, but their marriage has no evidence.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them at the riverfront's brick house in Gautier.
The police told me the dog was fine.
The former husband, Shawn O'Steen, told me that they had resigned 15 years ago, but remained friends, and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
\"He's really upset,\" O'Steen described his daughter.
He was her best friend.
O'Steen told me she hadn't met Lamb, but she had heard from her daughter Abigail that she was interested in music and she was playing blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both present on the summer market three years ago.
Later, they called together with some gigs.
O'Steen told me that his daughter does and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for a number of network companies.
In the dark bar near Gautier, the Julep Room barmaid and the timed entertainment director Mike Shaffer tells us that he saw Lamb and Prentis last night against September 5 when Lamb had finished his guitar and lip-fight performance for a rare number of audiences.
Nothing seemed wrong.
- Only a happy couple, he said.
We were playing games and throwing whispers on each other.
So they were both pretty clever.
Dead teacher Schmidt led the first year's student seminar program and was specialized in Indians and the history of the country, told the school English teacher Don Allan Mitchell.
Schmidt was married, and he had three little children.
He studied at Kansas Empire State University and was speaking director of his brotherhood and student government.
On Tuesday evening, at Cleveland Delta State, a candle charter was held, involving about 900 people, including educational and other staff, students and members of the Community.
Schmidt's wife Liz and Brother Jeff Schmidt also took part in the fair, during which the university choir sang songs at Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
The teaching goes on Wednesday.
We're trying to get our students back, LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time for recovery.
Amy and Rogelio Solis report to Mississippi about Cleveland.
The Associated Press writer, Emily Wagster Pettus Mississippi Greenville, and Rebecca Santana New Orleans, took part in the report.
The case has been corrected to say that the police are now saying that Lamb called the emergency call after Schmidt was shot, and that, while Lamb was referring to Prentis as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to hire less employees for the holiday period
Toys R Us says that it does not employ as many employees as it did last year, but the dealer of toys and baby products says that more hours are given to current regular and seasonal workers.
According to the company, it plans to hire 40 000 people to work in shops and distribution centres across the country, while the number of people employed during the 2014 holiday period was 45 000.
Most of the work is part-time.
The company said that the interviews for applicants start this month, and the number of staff will rise from October to December.
Although there are months of holiday time, Christmastime is approaching, companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to help in the occupation of shoppers and in the sale, dispatch and delivery of products.
Michael J. Fox is joking about his \"treffie\" Princess Diana.
The first night of the future movie was a huge moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
“We were sitting at the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized that I was sitting next to me was empty, and then I realized that Princess Diana was next to me,” she said, coming with a documentary film back in Time’s trailer.
The movie starts, and I think I'm just about to be on the road and stretching my hand away from the date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary of the Palu future film that was interviewed by Foxi, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and production director Steven Spielberg.
The return to the future took place 30 years ago.
Spielberg told me: “To me, it’s the most beautiful image of all time.
Back in Time is available as an order video, DVD and some cinemas in October.
The UN leader says that the situation in Syria will not be solved by armed means.
The answer of the Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Russia's increased military support for Syria is that this nearly five-year conflict will not be solved in armed terms, and more arms will only exacerbate violence and suffering millions of people.
The UN leader once again called on all parties, including the United Nations Security Council, to join and support non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
At the press conference in the middle of the week, Ban reported that he was going to meet with five permanent Member States - the United States, Russia, China, the British and the French ministers of the General Assembly later this month to discuss Syria.
He expressed regret that the situation of the Council, the Syrian people and the regional force forces could not be resolved.
Ban called on five permanent Member States to demonstrate the Syrian crisis by addressing the solidarity and consensus they showed when negotiating the Iranian nuclear programme.
8 Out of the suffering test results that show that Donald Trump is serious
Some have tried to stamp him into a windmill.
Others just think he's a joke.
Some of them are waiting for the fall.
Although some Republicans have tried to slow Donald Trumpi off the top of the suffering shells, it has not succeeded.
Of the last 11 national questionnaires, ten Donald Trump has been in charge of the two-digit century, and some have been seriously considering what this means for the title possibilities of a real estate.
Of course, the election period is only in the early stages.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to be the candidate for Republicans.
The commentators point out that at this stage in 2011, Rick Perry was losing his leadership to Herman Cain, which neither of which received any state in the appointment process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in general elections.
However, external groups, such as the Jeb Bush Super PAC and the conservative Economic Association Club for Growth, have taken note of Trump's pliability and began to use his funds to cover him.
The following recent suffering surveys suggest that the real estate king is not just a passing phase:
Trump's favorite figures have been completely translated.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University’s distress test showed that only two Republicans in ten were positive to the real estate king.
By mid-July, the figure was 40%.
At the beginning of August, the figure was 52 per cent.
At present, six out of ten Republicans welcome Donald Trump.
About three out of ten says that they are negative.
These figures are also true in the first presidencies.
At the quinn market university in Iowa last week, 60% of Republicans said that they welcome Trump.
Two-thirds of the Republican voters would be pleased if Trump was a candidate.
At CNN/ORC last week, 67% of Republicans said that they would be either \"influenced or satisfied\" if Trump was a candidate.
Only two out of ten said they'd be shocked if he were a candidate.
Only Ben Carson will achieve the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43%-inclusive – vs. Trump’s 40%).
Next most enthusiastic?
Marco Rubio's only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of the Republican voters would be unsatisfied or unsuspected if they were to be a candidate for Jeb Bush.
The nature of Trump's fires is not a problem for most of the Republicans.
Although Donald Trumpia has been widely criticised for his powerful speeches and violations, on Monday, ABC News/Washington Post survey shows that 52 per cent of the Republican voters at national level think that the real estate king has a suitable character for the President.
According to a survey of the Quinn market last week, in the first party state of Iowa, the figure is the same: 52% of Republicans think that Trump has the same character as the director.
However, according to ABC/Posti survey, 44 per cent thinks that his character is not an application for the President's operation, and almost six out of ten feel that his character is not part of the White House.
Republican speakers are using the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think that Trump is a real alternative.
According to the CNN/ORC survey, four out of ten were considered the most likely option for Trump when asked who was most likely to be the candidate for Republicans.
At the end of July, four out of ten were in favour of Jeb Bush.
Information release: Republican voters have not always had the brightest possible crystal ball in place.
During the last parliamentary term, four out of ten Republicans felt that Rick Perry was a candidate and only 28% of the final candidate, Mitt Romney.
In any event, this shows that the majority of the Republican voters consider Trump's campaign credible.
Even if Republicans were to support another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have pointed out that the circus field is likely to have contributed to Trump’s leadership, as the support against Trump has been divided between many other candidates.
However, the survey of Monmouth University at the beginning of September showed that in a hypothetical bilateral race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump receives a majority of support in almost all cases.
He runs Carly Fiorina at 13 points, Marco Rubio at 14 points, Walker at 15 points, Jeb Bush at 19 points and Rand Paulia, John Kasich and Chris Christie at 33 points.
He's on the plane with Ted Cruz.
The only one who wins Trump?
If they were put up against them, Ben Carson would win the business man Trump with a big 18-point difference.
Just and just the majority of Donald Trump's supporters have told us that they have taken a decision.
The new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the Members who support Trumpi have decided to vote.
Of course, the situation can change, and no one can be absolutely sure to say that it would never change his mind.
46% said that they might be able to change candidates.
In any case, Trump's biggest competitor at the moment is another unlikely winner, neurosurgery Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made a decision are twice more likely on Trump's side.
Six of the ten Republicans say Trump agrees with immigration.
Since the two months ago, Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants ‘raisers’ in his campaign analysis speech, immigration has been at the centre of the debate in 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump's capacity to drive Latin voters further from the Republican Party and harms re-branding companies.
According to a new ABC/Post survey published on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the centre of things, so is also Donald Trump.
A fall in the government has reached a new top.
The support of Donald Trump and Ben Carson now covers about half of the Republican voters, largely out of their position.
Six out of ten Republicans said on Monday at ABC/Post-sex that they prefer to choose a non-political person rather than a government experience.
They're also angry with the federal government.
Two-weekly Des Moines Register/Blomberg's survey of Iowa showed that three out of four Republicans are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54% are unsatisfied and 21% angry.
Jeremy Corbyn's first session at Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first session at the Question Time has been eagerly awaited since his choice
For the first time, Jeremy Corby, new director of the Labour Labour Party, will meet David Cameron at the Prime Minister's Question class.
Corby will rise to ask about his first six questions shortly after a half day, and most likely both the media and the representatives of the Labour Party were closely monitoring his performance.
Corby's been calling for this weekly show... less theater and more facts...
He has also said that he could leave some of the opportunities for his colleagues to handle.
This is the first parliamentary trial for the leadership of Corbyn after he was appointed to the shadow government and spoke at the annual meeting of the Centre of Trade Associations on Tuesday.
At the same time, during the national song, the President of the Labour Party’s decision to stand silently at the Memorial Service, which was held at the Battle of Britain on the 75th anniversary of the World War, has raised criticism of the conservative party’s representatives and appeared on several front page cases.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national song has attracted attention
The representative of Corbyn said that he was a man of honor to his state, and that he acknowledged that “the bravery of the Royal Air Forces in the Great Britain Air War...
Mr. Corbyn's shadow government member, Owen Smith, said to the BBC Twon Newsnight programme that he would have called on the Labour Party's leader to sing the national song, despite his view that the King's Room should cease.
Almost a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be involved in the Corbyn's inner circle, calling for differences in economic, defence and external affairs, and in the beginning, less than one sixth of Parliament's party supported him as the leader.
The BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says that the differences in terms of the status of the party in the European Union and the government's aid ceiling have been \"exploited – including within the Labour Party following the appointment of Corbyn.
Corbyn said at the meetings of the Centre of Trade Associations that the Labour Party would present an amendment that would remove the whole roof.
A few hours later, Mr Smith, Secretary of Labour and Pensions of the shadow government, said that the party was clear, and that they only opposed the government's plans to fall from 26,000 to 23 0000.
Corbyn becomes the fifth leader of the Labour Party, which David Cameron has met in the last decade, when he has been the head of the Conservative Party.
The Director-General of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics, and now he says that he has \"grouped\" ideas to the Prime Minister and has received more than 30 000 proposals.
Mr Corbyn, member of the Islington North region, said that the nature of the Prime Minister's Question Time is too controversial and that he intends to abstain from both shyness and suffocating, instead, to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that the shadow government secretary Angela Eagle is acting as her substitute for questioning when Corby does not take part - for example when Cameron is abroad.
Corby has also proposed that other colleagues should also sometimes speak, and he has said that he has approached the President of the House, John Bercowi, the subject.
When Cameron came to the lead in 2005, he said that he wanted to move further from a political theater often linked to the surveys of the Prime Minister, but later he had to admit that he had failed.
Since the start of television in 1990, the Prime Minister’s Question Time has been an important measure in assessing the leadership’s discretion, his control of the sub-room, and his position with other representatives, even though critics have criticised Question Times that they have become only an open picture that requires far-reaching reforms.
Photographed in Joburg: Young homeless people are trained as photographers
It's a difficult place to be homeless in Johannesburg.
However, a group of former street children have found a way to learn skills and make living.
'I was shot in Joburg' is an unprofitable studio where homeless young people are taught how to take photos of their neighborhood and gain victory from it.
BBC News met one of the young people who completed the first project.

The price rises as the UK wage rises
The value of the frame jumped up after the numbers appeared to rise in the UK wage increase, while the FTSE 100 index rose with the offer goal of SABMiller.
During the period between May and July, UK wages, including bonuses, rose by 2.9 per cent compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth was fastest after 2009, and it was considered to be accompanied by an estimate of the increase in courses.
The price increased by over one per cent to USD 1,5505 and EUR 0.84 per cent to EUR 1.3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed at 1.49 per cent to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinct share of the market and rose by 20 per cent after the competitor AB InBev approached it on offer.
The agreement would bring together two world's largest brewery and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's share rose by 0.9 per cent after a competing luxury group from Richmont received encouraging news.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected, and they also showed that sales in China, which is the key market for Burberry, had started to grow again.
Glencore's shares rose by 5 per cent after the miner told me that it had raised $2.5 billion by calculating shares as part of its debt reduction strategy.
The pack and paper group Mondi's shares were the largest writeouts of the index by 4.3% after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation to the form of ‘sales’.
JD Sports rose by 3.1 per cent after the sport survey company published information on its half-year income before taxes: 83 per cent increase to GBP 46.6 million.
According to JD Sports, higher wages can harm enlargement
The President of JD Sports, Peter Bowgill, says that if the minimum wage for workers is raised in Great Britain, it may mean that:
However, this purchasing power is not likely to exceed the higher labour costs for the company, which is said to be made by Bowgill.
The costs could be linked to the company's plans for enlargement, he added, which would mean less extra jobs.
Metcash starts a grass root campaign against Aldin's intruder.
Metcash is trying to protect his IGA stores from Ald's attack in South and West Australia.
Metcash, a food wholesaler, has launched a grass root campaign to defend the market share of IGA traders in South and West Australia before Aldin's $700 million attack.
Aldi prepares two distribution centres and the opening of the first trade in early next year to South and West Australia, which are coming up to 120 trades. At the same time, Metcash and IGA will strengthen their relations with local food intermediaries and build IGA brands through the marketing of power and social media and through events such as the Adelaide show.
IGA traders and buyers have jumped along, and brands like Simmo's ice cream maker from Dunsborough offer taste in IGA stores, and shop owners sell discount tickets to their customers in Australian football matches.
Metcashin is expected to reveal more details about his defence strategy on 29 September when this wholesaler of food, alcohol and iron goods organises annual investor strategy date.
There is a great deal in the game, since South and West Australia accounts for almost 30 % of the IGA trading area in Metcash, which is higher than the IGA network in the Eastern States of Metcash.
In South and West Australia, visitors are known to be cornered, and IGA dealers have a much greater market share than New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland: more than 30% in the south and 24% in the West compared to 14% in the Eastern States.
Analysts, as Morgan Stanley believes, are about 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening up the first movement, which is made available from all operators, but mainly from independent dealers.
In this week's report by Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealers can lose $360 million annually in sales and Metcash could lose $ 250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open up in the south next year 25 and in the West 30 movements, which will generate a turnover of USD 500 and USD 600 million in these regions.
Food and food sales and quantities loss at Metcash high fixed costs can cost Metcash about $13 million of operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash will lose market share in the Eastern States, mainly for Ald and Coles, although the recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA's customers were most loyal to all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and food sales will fall by 3.8 per cent in 2016; 4,1 per cent in 2017 and 2,1 per cent in 2018 so that its market share will fall from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10,3 per cent in 2020.
Last week the manager of the investment fund and the founder of the Magellan Financial Group Hamish Douglass said at the business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could be lost in a decade.
Metcash has refused to respond publicly to Douglas' comments.
However, it has been understood that a member of the Board of Metcash would have contacted Douglas last week.
The market share of IGA has decreased from 18% to 14% since 2010 and the outputs of Metcash's food and food business, which conveys products to some 1200 IGA dealers, have decreased by 43% since 2012.
However, the wholesaler has maintained its half and has invested more than 150 million dollars annually in reducing the prices of hundreds of products per week to the same level as Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA dealers to repair stores by adding faster growing fresh food, and by making the market a better choice of private brands.
Ian Morrice, Director General of Metcash, says that the price calculation and the improvement of sales have increased the attraction, and he hopes that the wholesaler will return to the road of growth in 2017 for the first time for four years.
Steve Healy, President of the Australian tennis union, supports Thanasi Kokkinakis
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more respect than criticism of his conduct
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered by side in the recent storm, who has been waving around his friend Nick Kyrgios. He deserves more respect than criticism of his own conduct, says Steve Healy, Chairman of the Australian tennis union.
“The gifted two-year-old member Kokkinakis, called the Social Ks, was unwittingly caught up in the public case where Kyrgios was annoying Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters competition.
Soon after this, in an ancient Carnation in Cincinnati, the judge twice had to separate the Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison when Harrison declared: “Wawrinkan should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that cockaroo.
Even though Kokkinakis was last seen breaking up his mail after the crash ruined his potential victory from Richard Gasquet in US Open, Healy has been a prisonerless defender of Kokkinakis.
Right now, a young man in Glasgow is competing with Sam Groth from the second place in the doubles with Bernard Tomic in Davis Cup's semifinal against Britain.
“I feel quite strongly that Thanasi has just been drawn to the ground, ” Healy said.
He broke his mail when he was destroyed because of the crash in US Open, but he's not the first player to break his mail in frustration, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he has behaved very well, also in some provocative situations at US Open Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves praise.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a nice family around him, and I think he's been treated a little hard.
He is very mature in 19 years old, he works hard, fits into the team and so on, and he has never had problems with other players. He is highly valued in the dressing room, he practices hard, is in good condition and is quite calm and mature young man, and I think he should be evaluated according to his merit.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgio in the important games that start on Friday, I described this joint decision as a solution to everyone, but still supporting the canberraan return to the team's stability.
“We want the team to be fully focused on the games, not everything around [Kyrgios]. Healy said.
And Nick has risen very quickly, for example, as Federer and Murray have pointed out, and has made some terrible mistakes in the public and deserves all the criticism they have received. However, we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I believe that it is best for both the team and for him if he spends some time away from the public thinking about these consequences.
Europe's immigration crisis: Hungary declares an emergency, closes borders, arrests immigrants
Hungary declared an exception and closed its southern border against Serbia by arresting those who tried to enter the country illegally, with the aim being to flee the flow of migrants to the country.
The border followed chaos when hundreds of migrants gathered in a neutral area, and the Serbian authorities responded with a knockout.
The people who fled the violence of their own countries have now set up their tents and set themselves for an indefinite period between the inspection stations of two countries.
However, the decline grew.
As the cop's helicopter remained above them, immigrants were playing \"Open the border and shouting insults to Hungarian mercenaries.
Some refused food and water as a protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it was impossible to accept the return of migrants from Hungary when they were constantly coming from Macedonia and Greece.
-(Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not to cause damage to civilians.
The debate will have to be held in the next few days with other countries and Brussels, said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The confusion between Hungary and Serbia arose after the 28 national groups failed to establish a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed on the division of responsibility for 40 000 people who have now taken over Italy and Greece. Ministers were hoping to reach a final agreement - next month or at the end of next year - about which EU countries will take 120 000 additional refugees, including some of Hungary.
The German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria will require an extra EU summit on Tuesday next week, which will discuss the migration crisis in the continent.
However, Hungary does not hope that its neighbours or Brussels will act in the near future.
Tuesday's emergency situation in the two southern regions gave the authorities greater powers to take action in the crisis and to enable you to be closed and asylum cases to be speeded up.
At the same time, the Hungarian Foreign Minister, Peter Szijjarto, said that, now that the aid is ready for Serbia's border, the country will also set up a border against Romania in order to stop immigrants from coming through the country.
The CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Aga reported that even prisoners had been recruited to finalize the barbed wire between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the last few months, Hungary has become the largest bottle neck and arrival point for refugees from the European Union, many of which are in the war from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are seeking a better life for economic refugees, and that those who escape from the war are entitled to protection - this view is strongly in conflict with other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary are now defining as a crime the company crosses or damages from a 4-metre (13 feet) barbed wire fence built by the government on a southern border against Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for convicted human traffickers.
“In view of the situation caused by mass immigration, the Hungarian government announces an emergency,” told journalists in the south of Szeged city by the government’s informant Zoltan Kovac.
We are very clear: crossing the border is a crime.
Parliament still needs to formally accept the deployment of the military forces expected for the next week, but the suppliers of Associated Press at the border have seen, for some time, heavily armed military staff with their vehicles and dogs.
Gyorgy Bakosi, a national security advisor in Orban, said that the authorities had captured 45 people in their efforts to cross the border, as well as 15 buildings already in the country.
They got over the fence by hurting them, are now a police prisoner, and they are accused of any new violations defined in the laws.
The authorities will fix the fence quickly.
In Tuesday morning, Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven crossing points from the border against Serbia after they sent a train hidden on a track to close one of these places.
The main border crossing site near Roszke, Hungary, was covered in chaos when Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for people's handling and the crowds infiltrated the intrude.
About 20 got in, but thousands got out.
A group of immigrants blocked the main motorways between Serbia and Hungary, saying that they refuse to eat and drink until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 elections: According to a national survey, Hillary Clinton's leadership in Bernie Sanders has narrowed side
Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Hillary Clinton will continue in a two-digit lead in the title race of the Democrats, but Senator Bernie Sanders will blackmail him.
Clintonia now supports 47% of democratic voters (calculated from 58%) and 27% of the second Sanders (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will join the presidential race, but he will be in favour of 15% of the democratic voters.
More than five months before the start of the pre-elections, most of the democratic voters say that it is still too early to say that they would have decided who to vote on.
However, Clinton’s supporters stand behind their own choices more strictly than those of other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has decreased in several population groups since the CBS News Poll survey last month, while Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is strongly led by women and moderates, but his leadership has narrowed.
His popularity among men has decreased considerably, and Sanders is just 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's first trip to the group of democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, and now he's at levels with Sanders.
However, Clinton clearly leads to older voters.
In the last month, Clinton led Sanders in a double-digital century with liberals, but now Sanders is running this group by five percentage points.
About half of the country's democratic voters say that they are eager to support Clinton if he becomes a candidate for a party.
The fourth says that he supports him with certain reservations, and 15% would only support him because he is a candidate.
Six percent wouldn't support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton’s current supporters are very likely to be eager to support him.
The minds are more confused with those who are currently not in favour of Clinton - only one quarter would be eager to support him.
Where 48% of democratic voters say that they are eager to support Clinton, the Republican Oneman, Donald Trump, is the same as said by a rare Republican voter (35%).
When asked Clinton’s supporters in an open question why they wanted him to be a candidate, the most popular response was that he had an appropriate experience (16%), and the most popular answers were that it is now time for female residents (13%) and that he is the best candidate for the task (10%).
Clinton's supporters also mentioned his connection to Bill Clinton (9 per cent).
The same opinions as well as the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
As the Vice-President seems to have an impact on the possible presidential candidate, 57% of the democratic voters would like to see him in the race - although the third one disagrees.
When asked by democratic voters who would be elected second party appointment, Biden is the most popular choice.
Among Clinton's supporters, more than half says they would choose Biden, which is much more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to pursue the democratic candidate, Hilary Clinton's leadership will grow from Sanders. If Biden leaves, the management will be 20 percentage points, but if he fails, the figure will be 30.
55% of democratic voters believe that Clinton has the best chance to win the presidential elections, but this figure has fallen from 78% last month.
With this measure, Biden will remain far away, but the proportion of those who hold him more silent has grown.
When it was asked by democratic voters, which is the most important candidate, they raised their opinions to the advantage of vote.
In the last month, too, no democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered impossible for these voters.
Candidates of Democrats or potential candidates will be able to do well in certain key issues among their party voters.
Most consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be honest, reliable and strong leaders.
Biden can do the best of the triangles in honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
30 per cent of democratic voters say that Clinton does not regard it as honest and reliable, which is twice as much as Sanders (15%), but 27 per cent says they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
Democrat speakers also generally believe that Clinton, Sanders and Biden agree on an ideological basis.
When all these things are considered, about a quarter of the democratic voters say that they do not have an opinion on Sanders.
While Hillary Clinton's personal e-mail address and server use, as Foreign Minister, still raises questions, the majority of democratic voters are satisfied with his explanation of the matter and says that it did not affect their general interest in him.
However, it is different to consider America as a whole.
Half of the Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third of them are satisfied.
In March, the opinion of the people was distributed shortly after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say that e-mail polemis did not have an impact on their overall preferences from Clinton, although 36% say that their opinion on him has deteriorated.
More than six of the ten Republicans say that their opinion on Clinton has become worse.
Although Clinton's own party voters consider him to be honest and reliable, this is still a problem for him among all the registered voters. Only 32 per cent consider him honest and reliable, and this figure has decreased by 8 percentage points since last month and by 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say that Clinton does not regard it as honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55% of the registered voters in the whole country do not regard Trumpi as honest and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump are considered to be very leading.
Of the six candidates involved in the study, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered to be the most honest.
Sanders are generally considered honest, but many people have no opinion about him, just like Carson.
The error margin in a study involving 351 democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trumia at national survey
Ben Carson is coming to Donald Trump's latest CBS News/New York Times survey
In a new survey, two candidates collected half of all votes leaving others to fight for their feet.
The Republican voters, through the country, are still strongly in favour of Trumpia, whose support has risen from 23% of the CBS survey of last month's Fox News elections on Tuesday to 27%.
However, Carson rose from 6% to 23% at the same time.
The survey also found that Carson is doing well with the various demographic groups and is removing Trump from higher educationed Republican voters.
The rest of the fields have been left behind, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich. The support of Governor Scott Walker has fallen most since last month's 10% to the current 2%.
Former governor of Florida, Jeb Bush, former governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, and Senator Marco Rubio of Florida are at levels of 6 percent.
The error margin in the sample of this latest survey of 376 Republican voters in September is +/- 6 %.
Last week's CNN/ORC survey showed Carson's rise in the survey: he has 19% of his support for Republicans, and Trump is 32% above him.
Also, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post survey, Trump was significantly above Carson.
At Carson's favour last week, Trump criticised the retired neurosurgery in vain, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
We need energy, Trump said last Saturday at his campaign visit in Iowa.
Five members of the brotherhood are accused of the death of a student of the first year of Baruch College.
Almost two years after the student died in a brotherhood's Simputusseremonia in the Pocono Mountains region of Pennsylvania, the murder charge has been brought up against five people.
The members of Baruch College University in New York City, Pi Delta Psi, were brutally attacked by Chun-Michael-Deng in September 2013, and then delayed his visit to the hospital, contributing to his death, the police said.
The authorities say that Deng's eyes were tied and his back was loaded with more than 13 kilos of truck full of sand, and then he was repeatedly tamed to the ground when he tried to walk through the rigid field toward the goal.
Finally, Deng complained that his head would get hurt, after which he lost consciousness.
Brothers did not call the emergency number after Deng passed out, but according to charges they waited an hour before they brought him to the hospital, the police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, find information on his symptoms, and contact Andy Mengi, the National President of the Brotherhood, asking for advice, Chris Wagner, at the press conference.
“In this place, the members began to hide their ritual equipment and, in practice, they set the welfare of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng, the police chief Wagner said.
Deng wasn't allowed to rest, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng received repeated boring objects on his head, body, and travel.
“A number of families have suffered from brotherhood when at least one student has died every year since 1970,” said Doug Fierberg, a lawyer representing the family of the Deng, in his opinion.
The brothers and their members must be responsible, and this step of the authorities is important.
The great jury in Monroe County was in favour of the first five members being charged with the murder of the third degree.
32 other members of the brotherhood, including Meng, are also charged with violent mutilation and criminal plotting.
“We do not only want to be responsible for individuals, but if there is an organisation behind what has happened that has been officially or informally accepted, they must also be held accountable, Wagner said on Tuesday at the press conference.
Baruch College denied the brotherhood and national brotherhood to bite their connection to the local department.
This is what happens when the central bank of the United States increases interest rates
The rise in interest rates will come, and the market for rising rates will fall, the yields of bonds will rise and the economy will have to decline.
This is what we know.
What we don't know is how long it's gonna take for all of this or how long it's gonna take.
The past does not really help with timing, as it comes to the economy.
The result of the recovery has taken just 11 months since the first lifting, sometimes again, for as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the central bank of the United States in raising interest rates has been often, although not always, a determining factor in how economic and financial assets react.
This is why the US Central Bank officials have so strongly stressed that investors should not be focused on it, because interest rates are being raised, but mainly on the development curve of the period leading to normalisation.
Indeed, there are several variables in the equation.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all interest-related rubbles have been overrated.
“The first increase in the global economic crisis by the central bank is inevitably interpreted in some respects to end the 'silent money' period,” said the Capital Economics main economic expert Julian Jessop, in a message to customers.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to normal, although still low, to the level of a revolutionary shock that many seem to be afraid of.
However, this does not mean that it does not have any effects.
The following is an overview of how some sectors of the economy will react on the basis of previous developments:
As has been seen in the market over the last about one month, waiting for an increase in interest can make the situation unstable.
When an increase becomes a fact, the effect is not quite as dramatic.
‘It appears that the return on capital has a tendency to stop for 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may once again reflect a delay in monetary policy,’ said the Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what will happen after the increase of the central bank.
More specifically, during the last about 35 years, the market is generally strong, with an increase of about 14 per cent, 250 days after the increase, the situation is relatively flat (mean increase 2.6 per cent) and the average return has been achieved after 500 days in the last six cycles of 14.4%, reported in the recent analysis of the leading capital strategy of Nuveen Asset Management, Bob Doll, published in the Barron's magazine.
According to Deutche Bank, the impact on shares is generally clearer at the later stage of the increase cycle when profits start to fall.
Economic recovery is part of the economy, but interest purchases often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges which have not been before and which can speed up the recession.
This is, in particular, a gross domestic product which will be closest to the lowest level of all time before the central bank’s interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, the 118 nominal annual GDP per year after 1950 has only been less than 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015, the figure was 3.6 per cent, it is rarely believed that it would remain when the third quarter had advanced 1.5 per cent, says the Atlantic Federal Reserve Bank.
The rise in interest rates in this fragile economic arrangement can be risky and raise the question of whether this time is different, Deutsche Bank said.
The market participants have reserved for the central bank's increase throughout the year, and everyone is waiting for this week's Committee on Federal Open Market Committee, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategies and economic experts believe that the Committee can accept an increase at this meeting, the future trade is expected to be only 25% probability.
Our study shows that from 1950 onwards, all increase cycles have so far experienced an increase in the rate of leverage in supercycles, where GDP has passed the peaks before the recession very quickly after recovery has started, the report tells us.
On the other hand, there has been an exceptionally slow recovery from the recession that has been the worst in the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has been looking forward to the worst of the end of the last recession: the record has been 35 months, and it is now 74 months.
The fixed return has also been unstable when the market is waiting for interest, and the model is somewhat like the capital findings.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its policies, its effects are seen more quickly in bonds than in shares.
The rate of return on debt records appears to change immediately in case of the first increase/delivery of the cycle.
At the end of the raise cycle, the return on bonds is immediately reduced, Deutche Bank said.
Charles Schwab's strategies believe that the increase in interest rates will lead to a convergence of incomes from longer and shorter-term debt instruments, thus balancing the rate of return.
The high-cost bonds often produce better in such a situation, although we are still careful about finding output, said Schwab's solid output analyst Kathy Jones in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adapted to the central bank’s policy expectations.
\"In addition to the low strength and inflation expectations, there are several indications that the market has adapted to the outlook for tighter monetary policy,\" he wrote.
The short-term interest rates are high, the rate of return is more equal, the credit margins have increased and the instability has increased - all these are characteristic of the market when the central bank has tightened its line.
Generally speaking, companies whose business is mainly located in the United States will win when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multi-national companies that owe a lot of debt will do less when the value of the dollar increases make their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than they have funding.
“The list shows that ‘quality’ shares are usually more profitable in the three months after the first rate,” the Goldman Sachs analysts stated in their report to customers.
Enterprises with strong turnover missed low turnover companies after the 1994, 1999 and 2004 increases by an average of five percentage points.
Enterprises with high return on capital and low volatility shares were better performing than companies of lower quality. First, the average of the above was 4 percentage points and 3 percentage points.
The debt is going to be a big problem.
Those companies that owe a lot of exchange rates are losing the most, Goldman said.
Outside the stock exchange, consumers also have the opportunity to benefit from an increase in the value of the dollar.
Savings can also benefit from higher profits, even though experts disagree on how quickly the impact feels.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, Congressman Andrew Bingham says
Commissioner Andrew Bingham is charged with the idea of channelling.
He claims that its separation from commercial competitors will become increasingly difficult.
He also accepted BBC Music Awards, saying that they were just mimicking British Awards
Commissioner Damien Collins criticised The Voice, saying it's not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is turning into ‘ Classical FM’, claiming the leading representative, adding the pressure of the production company to prove that it does something that commercial production companies do not do.
Commissioner Andrew Bingham also said to the BBC leaders that the public service radio channel had an impact on its content, which is becoming more and more difficult to distinguish from a commercial competitor.
\"It's a matter of fact that Radio 3 doesn't want to use the term \"citizens\" \"is turning into Classic FM,\" he said.
He also took his aim at the BBC Music Awards Award, which was launched last December.
“The last year’s BBC Music Awards seem to be just a British Awards galaxy under different names.
So if you're trying to do something different, here's two examples that I remember directly about when you actually copied something that you already found on the market, Bingham said.
The President of the BBC contested the allegations that BBC Radio 3 is above a large number of commercial competitors as regards live music and information sharing to citizens.
Radio 3 teaches such things about classic music that I can't learn from anywhere else.
Its commitment to living music and music is, in fact, a priority.
“I think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and order new works, ” he said.
Earlier this year, head of BBC Radio 3, Alan Davey, claimed that the channel had to do more work than previously to reach the public, because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offer, which was criticised for entering the bars of commercial competitors during the consultation of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sports.
Congressman Damien Collins criticised The Voice, the music contest BBC bought from the Dutch production company Talpa Media, estimated at 22 million pounds.
Do you understand why this programme is often discussed because it is not original and is not unique?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 channel program, in which Paloma Faith and Boy George were stars, was produced in the BBC style.
He added that he wanted the company to succeed in its own house, the next time it started a entertainment series.
However, he refused to prevent future periods of The Voice from producing, or to impose on other forms of entertainment that would allow him to use his money.
Online sales rose at least in August, Black Friday may be the reason
Net sales rose by 7 per cent during the first three months of 2015
Last month there was an increase after the start of the March statistics in 2000
Three years ago, online sales confirmed the use of mobile devices for buying
Experts believe that November Black Friday may slow consumption
The act of virtual shopping has grown dramatically for over a decade and has transformed many of the British shopping channels into haunted stores.
However, experts say that there are now signs of a smoothing of online sales in the air, when the latest figures showed only an increase of 7% for the first quarter of 2015.
Total August consumption grew least since the start of statistics in 2000: only 5% increase from last year.
Experts say that there are signs of a smoothing of online sales in the air when the latest figures showed only a 7% increase in the first quarter of 2015.
“If the growth levels of previous years were considered and returned to 2000, it was clear that the situation would become more rational over time,” told Guardian, the supplier of the JMRG sales index, Andy Mulcahy.
He explained that three years ago online sales were confirmed when buyers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people made purchases online, and that they could be made in different environments, such as the couch.
But now it will be adjusted, and (growing) can fall.
The Black Friday event from America has been regarded as one of the reasons behind slow shops.
Experts believe that consumers will slow down buying before the last Friday of November.
Last year, the average average of five times more buyers flocked to their computers to pick up the shops by covering the websites of many traders.
Experts believe that Black Friday, who got the buyers to argue about the findings, can control the purchase.
A study published by British Retail Consortium found that only about one pound of five was used online.
More than one third of the purchases of certain products, such as television and washing machines, are now made out of online stores.
At the same time, more than one quarter of people buy clothes and shoes from the network instead of using shopping street fashion chains.
Muslims bury Meka in a nostril accident, the consequences for Bin Laden's family
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies through the streets during the first funerals in Mekassa
Saudi Arabia has partly accused the collapse of the construction waste from Saudi Banlad Group
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were also injured when the crane broke down.
29 The dead were carried through the streets, when hundreds of Muslims gathered together to bury them, and the victims died when the crane broke down in Meka's big washers.
In the main, the white-dressed dying filled the route to respect the first dead who made their final journey to the territory of Al-Moaissem.
A sad journey passed through a sacred place, where only a few days ago the crane fell through the roof of a Moscower and poured down the worshipers.
The bodies were released for burial when the King of Saudi Arabia confirmed Bin Laden’s family building group as a victim of disaster, where 394 people were also injured.
The bodies of 29 of those who were killed by the rebels who fell in the Meka’s Great Smurfiant were carried through the streets.
Among the dead were the father of four children, Qasim Akram from Bolton, Manchester, and he was with his first sacrament when the crane broke down.
Akram had been in a major laundering with his parents before the start of the annual disengagement.
The Saudi authorities have already sworn that the disperse will continue when thousands of people arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that Binlad Group should not have left the crane up when it was not in use.
In the Arabic version of the decision published by the State-led Saudi Press Agency, it was said that the Binlad Group was partly responsible for the collapse.
The English service of the news office did not mention this detail, but it said that the leaders of the company were forbidden to travel abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to find out what caused the fall of the cranes to the yard of a major toyer, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had been gathered before the hair-sucking event in this month later.
The Binlad Group has not published any communications on the collapse of the Kurds and has not received any comments from its representatives.
The royal decision also accused the group of not using up-to-date safeguards and did not cooperate with meteorological authorities.
There are tens of cranes around the Meka’s big mopet, which are part of a huge construction robbery led by the Binlad Group.
Binladin's family has been close to Saudi Arabia's reigning family for decades, leading to major construction projects.
Osama bin Laden, the first leader of Al-Qaida, was a rebel boy whose family banned in the 1990s.
In the wind and rainy weather only days before millions arrive in the kingdom for a sacrament that each capable Muslim must do at least once in his life.
The authorities say that 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities ordered a million rice (174 000 pounds) to be paid to the families and permanently injured persons of the deceased.
The others will receive half of this amount.
B&Q-pomo says that East European low-wage workers are in favour
The British are increasingly using assistant services, says Veronique Laury
The number of professionals coming from Eastern Europe is behind the rise
As a result, Screwfix stores for professionals will open up 200 more
At the same time, Kingfisher closes 60 B&Q stores around the country
Author Rupert Steiner, head of the city for Daily Mail
The British say that they give up their hammers and paint pennies and hire more skilled Eastern European workers to do home-building work.
Looks like if you're with a hammer or you're going to paint walls, you're in a minority now.
The British see an increasing number of assistants working tea-to-she-dos in their homes, says the boss of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the Kodinremont trade chain, said that behind the popularity there is the number of skilled workers coming from Eastern Europe and that they offer their services at a cloud price.
This leads to the fact that Kingfisher is planning to open up 200 new Screwfix stores for employees and to close 60 B&Q sales.
Laury said that he wanted more women to work for B&Q sales, because eight out of ten shopping decisions were made by a more beautiful sex.
Today, most of the personnel are men.
He said that changes in the population must be taken into account: there are now more houses for one woman to do more homework than before.
Laury said: “There are still a lot of men in our shop crew.
We need to get a better balance.
However, half of our customers are women and 80% of the purchase decisions are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Laury is one of the five women leading the main companies of the UK FTSE100 index, and he has reconstructed his management team so that there are as many male and female men.
Kingfishher is almost the only company in the group of which 50% are women, including its Director-General and the Director-General.
Laury said: \"This was a conscious decision, a difference is important here.
It has not been difficult to find good women in the board.
Kingfishher reported a fall in both production and sales for six months after the group took the costs of closing the sales.
As a result of Trend, Kingfisher, who owns Screwfix and B&Q stores, is opening up 200 new stores
The three acet government decided to resort to mandatory legislation in order to save the country's economy.
Even visible effects were quickly achieved.
The sharp head of the SAK and other employees' centres began to force the same route and, as a result, the country stands on Friday because of the widespread demonstration of workers.
A lot of people feel that reason is at that time.
Let's see if it's worth a break when it goes bad anyway.
Even the resistance movement has been set up.
More than 50,000 people on the Internet have already come to announce that you are not going to participate in the expression of mind but go to work.
This would have been impossible in the good old consensus period.
Of course, there was no Internet where to protest, but openly declaring as a rich person would have been a small person's political suicide.
Millions of members of trade unions, a few tens of thousands of people, do not have much time, but it gives the reason for thinking.
The position of trade union is no longer as obvious as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed
From an interest in the Ay movement, the government's poor solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
For years, when things have seemed to roll with their own weight, it is now at last in the Treaties to get to the point, namely the rights of the worker to defend, appear and properly.
Thus, the government may want to imprison the role of the Ay movement when membership in the union is perhaps more necessary.
Whether we think about the activities of the organisations or not, it is dust that Friday's demonstration would somehow stop Finland.
Yes, Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been down for 31 months consecutively.
Gross domestic product is still falling, and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would force everyone's head.
High savings for the University of Lappeenranta: Objective 8.5 million savings, reduced staff by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenranta begins a savings study with the aim of getting costs out of total EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings university, the University will start the entire staff-to-work y negotiations with a savings target of 6.5 million per year.
In practice, it means a reduction of about 130 workers.
In addition, two million will be sought to save other activities.
As a result of the Yt negotiations, the 2016 budget is expected to be 8.5 million deficits.
It also affects the government's cut-offs.
During this accounting period, the university will produce some 2.6 million deficit results.
The expenditure will increase slightly next year, but the same funding from the Ministry will be reduced by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total university budget is approximately EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The interaction between mass education and research cuts and the reduction of corporate financing with our university is very important, says Principal Anneli at the University of Pauli's press release.
Before the summer, the effects of cuts seemed even more moderate, but now the additional funding reduction appears to be in new proportions.
The negotiations with the trustees will be launched next Tuesday and will last for six weeks.
Yle: Onnibus wants Finland's railways
The owner of Onnibus, the British Sir Brian Soutter, tells Yle that the company also aims at rail transport in Finland.
I am very interested in joining Finnish rail transport.
My Stagecoach company is one of the largest railway companies in Britain, soutter says.
Rail transport is supposed to be gradually opening up to competition.
The first is in line with the local transport in the capital region in 2017-2018.
There's a long-range traffic going on after the short-range traffic.
Soutter says he's already approached the Ministry of Transport.
According to Yle, Onnibus's plans are welcomed.
Other international companies have expressed interest in rail transport at least in Transdev (former Veolia), which also has bus and rail transport in Finland and elsewhere in Europe.
The central bank of the United States must take decisions on interest rates
The rest of the world follows from the page when the central bank of the United States meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time for almost a decade.
When Reuters asked 80 economic scientists a little more than half of those who still believed last week to raise interest rates, they now believe that the situation is not yet solved and the interest rates are maintained at the current level of 0-0.25%.
This is an historic event, because when the central bank cut interest rates to zero, it is seven years.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to get out of zero and to start normalising interest rates, said Angel Ubide, Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy has worked relatively well, and recovery has brought millions of dollars to balance and has created some inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore less rose global prospects.
It has warned the market that they should be ready to rise, but the signs show that they also believe that the odds are against the increase.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20.00 (CET).
Delta State University shooter left an apology message
After she shot her girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning before she shot her colleague later on the same day, Shannon Lamb wrote a message saying that she was “deprived ” of the first murder and hoped that she could cancel it, the authorities told them on Tuesday.
Miss Gautier's police told me that Delta State University's geography and social science teacher Lamb called 911 at about ten in the morning.
Monday and told me he's shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police had to send officers to his home.
He said that he had killed his wife last night, and he also mentioned that there was a “soul dog in the house, ” which does not bother anyone, but is probably shocked.
The police asked the caller for this name, but he didn't tell me that.
Lamb didn't give any explanation for shooting.
When the police arrived, the body of Amy Prentiss, 41 years old, and a message written by Lamb, 45 years old, read: “I am so sorry that I could cancel it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me.
After writing a message, Lamb drove nearly 500 miles away from Delta State, where he killed his history teacher Ethan Schmidt before he eventually killed himself late on Monday in the police district.
The director of the University William LaForge said that there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that clearly there was something in Lamb's mind.
On Tuesday, the authorities said that, despite claims published on Monday, that Lamb would have believed Prentiss had a relationship with Schmidt, there was no evidence or evidence of any kind.
Shawn O'Steen told me he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as a good man.
A couple broke up 15 years ago, but they stayed friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter, who is...
O'Steen told me that the Prentiss and his daughters were the best friends ever.
According to Linsday Knowles, the Prentiss worked at home online. According to Sun Heraldi, the Knowles was a close friend of the Prentiss.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog called Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
He always wanted to help other people.
The police said Lamb called his relatives somewhere on Mondays to tell them that he's not going to jail.
When the police reached Lamb's highway 1 at a later night near Greenville, Lamb stopped his car on the side of the road, left it and went running into the woods where he shot himself.
Lamb argued on educational science from Delta State in spring 2015, reports a CV found on the University’s website.
The stars that lost their charms
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), has been tough in recent years.
In 2001, he suffered leukemia, and in 2009 his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
According to the rumors, he also had drug problems, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
Indeed, all of this requires its taxes.
Manchester United Luke Shaw is out for months due to a double break
Luke Shaw had a double fracture on his right foot in the loss of Manchester United to the PSV Eindhoven in the fight against the Masters' league.
Even though the defender was left in tears and is out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal hopes that Shaw would be able to play again this season.
The injury caused by Héctor Moreno’s unsuspected tactics for 15 minutes after he was 20 years old, Shaw had fallen into the PSV area.
She was treated at the airport for nine minutes and had to be given oxygen before taking her to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: \"He's got a double fracture on his leg, and now he's in the hospital.\"
He'll be transferred tomorrow or maybe day after then, and then we'll cut him in Manchester.
This is terrible, the boy comes to Manchester United when he's 18 years old, suffers from trouble, and then he plays great, and this is what happens.
When I was in the dressing room, he was wearing a oxygen mask.
He cried.
I'm not a doctor, but a double fracture takes at least six months, and he's not playing at the block-stage.
I hope he can play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky when he got a red card and a penalty shot.
The judge Nicola Rizzoli didn't punish a Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian operator was mistaken.
You can judge the situation yourself when I say it became a penalty shot and a red card.
It was a really bad two-foot tattoo.
Shaw said: “Thank you all for your messages, the words are not enough to tell me how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I will come back stronger.
Related: Manchester United suffers from Luke Shaw and disappears to the PSV
The British defender has an additional incentive for recovery next June's European Championships in France.
The PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: \"It's a very bad injury.
If a player gets out of this kind of injury, they're all very sad.
Our players are never meant to hurt the opponent.
Moreno's leg broke when he played the Mexican team against Van Galal in the 2014 World Cup.
“Moreno takes this hard because it’s not intended to hurt the opponent, and when he hears that the injury is really bad, it’s bad, Cocu said.
I didn't see him in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball that was going in a different direction, so it looked like [Moreno] had touched it, but I didn't see Luke's fight.
Moreno told SBS6: “I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this. I'm so sorry.
Andrés Guardado, the PSV, was also taken to the hospital after Chris S Modeling challenged him.
You think David Cameron knows Lorax better than this?
Each parent will soon learn one thing: if your child loves a book, it will not last long before it is almost outside.
Unless you're David Cameron.
When asked the Prime Minister for his favorite children’s care service, he selected Dr. Seuss’s The Lorax book, an environmental protection story published in 1971.
The selection was difficult, Cameron writes in a message published on the SuperCamps website and continues: “The fun, moving, creative and containing a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to have a picture or message that we have never seen before.
All this is true, but the next paragraph, where Cameron is supposed to describe the book's plot, is a summary of the 2012 film version, where new characters and details had been added to a rather short original text.
“In the town of Tarville, where all nature has been destroyed and even the air is commercial, the son of Ted hopes to win his dreams on the heart of the girl by filling Audrey’s desire to see the right tree,” says and describes the love story, which Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991, did not write on the right name Theodor Seuss Geisel.
If this is not yet suspicious enough, Cameron's text sounds like it's taken from the Lorax film plot on the Internet Movie Database page, which starts as follows: \"In the town inside the city of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even the air is commercial, Ted's son hopes to win his dreams on the heart side of Audrey's girl.\"
Considering that Cameron is publicly active parents, it seems unlikely that he would have been so inexplicable that he had been drinking a book. There a young, anonymous boy hears how local nature has destroyed the greed, the wood that is beating and the need for the name Kerskanen, without care of the short, five - bit creature Lorax, who calls for trees.
Such a relatively invisible PR mission is likely to be externalized to an assistant who has apparently never read the book 20 times in a row for a child.
The Prime Minister's informant said that the text must have come from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's staff, but did not comment at the moment.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of leaving the British team behind, but it was still a tough place.
Playing against Pakistan in the Arab Emirates is a hard task, but when you see what kind of team England has chosen for tour, I don't think that the repeating of the last 3-0 serial destruction is likely.
I wouldn't shut down the guest butter from the bills.
Alastair Cook's side may have been less experienced than a three-year-old team, but it includes good tourrs and team thinking is strong: they do not have scars from 2012, only young positives.
Moeen Ali develops in his tour feeds and Adil Rashid is an attack option, although there is no known factor at this level.
Related to this: Adam Lyth dropped out of the British Cricket Team, he replaced Alex Hales
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is quite difficult to analyse for me, because I am his head coach in Yorkshir.
His seven games have been good at the attackers in challenging circumstances, and the bear of the truth is that critics are criticised on the basis of their results.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's choice before the press, because, as I have said before, players are the best choice factors.
About a hundred points more, and Lyth's season in the team could have continued, but he was responsible for his own fate.
I hope that if he gets more running for Yorkshire, another chance will come forward.
The head coach of England, Trevor Bayliss, praised Lyth's attitude even when he did not do as well as he could, and it does not surprise me. Lyth is, above all, a team singer.
It's hard to answer the question of how long it takes to leave a trace.
Lyth was elected seven times to the national team, like Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was elected nine times.
Only Compton had the opportunity to play at home and at visitors.
The only issue of the complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott first for the Caribbean when Lyth was in the peak, but this lost opportunity is now the past.
Alex Hales will come along, and there's a hitter I appreciate.
He has something that we saw early in the New York Star during this season when he did 236 points against us on Trent Bridge's field.
He must be given at least the same opportunity as the others before him, but this certainly depends on the team's composition in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of Moen in a shot-up by Cook, which would give the field an extra passer but might be held at four speeds, and I am not against it.
I don't understand why the batter couldn't hit it there, and this left-wing has already shown himself to be a rather critical player.
Moeen may not have done his job in the counties of Worcestershire, but he is a third to them and there is little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played the first 38 games when he fell before he got to the opening in 2001.
He did three hundred points right away, and he didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a thief, and, little about what I've done with him, he seems very impressive to a young man.
People can look at his unremarked statistics... hitting an average of 31, with a ball of 35... and think it's gambling, but there's no too many feeders and voters on offer.
He learns a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seems to have a few tough additions to the coach.
The appointment of the Sri Lankan batter M Chain Jaywarden as consultant for games can prove to be a neronism.
He is one of the most comfortable friends in the game and brings with him a huge amount of experience since he has done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes along with the white ball games, bringing with him both energy and an unscrupulous shame.
I've always thought that he was born to be involved in international criticism, then it was about playing or coaching, and he's got something similar to making use of Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room can refresh the team even if their message is the same as before.
Colly's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, was resting in one day, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and at least I have no problem with this.
Although not everyone agrees, trainers and the choice do not make timetables.
And you have to remember that just like players, their work depends on the results.
Such decisions will never be based on light criteria.
Britain's departure from the EU (Brexs) can lead to profit if the economy is in difficulty in 2017
David Cameron's unilateral renegotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are facing increasing problems from day to day, even if it is not taken into account even with a heartfelt Jeremy - whether it is or not - Corbyn's choice for the leadership of the Labour Party or for the anger of a professional organisation in Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their own Corbyns and Nigel Faragsa.
The European diplomatic blood recently explained that because the EU is so deeply involved in different crises, which are not all the reasons for it, some Member States have become tired of the self-centered agenda of Britain, which is full of concessions and disruptive contractual changes that these countries do not wish to do most.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Centre of Trade Associations decided that it would not want them even if they were to scratch social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's self-agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, taking a picture of themselves in front of a famous local monument, whether with or without the local eye view, and then coming home, saying that they will overcome the reformers.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outside of the British EU tent - - \"Don't leave us alone with France,\" says Berlin - suggests that the shortst-looking ministers and officials of certain capitals are now at the point that they don't care if we leave.
German careful and moderate Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but he has been in custody for 10 years and wishes to leave his action before it is ruined in the same way that it has been spent too long on Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
France François Holland has a re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a depressing force, too.
Poland can soon have a national right-wing government, a left-wing citizen in Spain.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificed for Self-Shimberites, when their energy should rather be directed to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want it for the same kind of separatist trends.
So, my friend, some of these ministers may even plan to make useless comments to the Scotland National Party style during the UK referendum 2017 in order to speed up the Brexit process.
The new negotiations had been held, and the new negotiations had nothing to do with Britain.
Europeans have had the bitter experience of being an greedy Fleet Street newspaper and how the EU-Sceptic press alone are, which they were not inspired by Tony Benn during the 1975 referendum, when our membership began in 1973 received a confirmation in the ratio of 2:1.
They can vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the largest Euro-opportunist, who named himself by writing \"the direct bananas of the EU\", when he was writing as a writer in Brussels in the early '90s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They were included in a bookable set of tax-responders, people who hacked and people whose place of residence is known elsewhere and who own most of our big newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought about them the same way, but it realized that if you're in a cage with a lusty gorillo, bananas must be handed over because of a spider if you don't want to be on that gorillo lunch list and later at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more bluffing than Blair himself on the basis of the opposition to Cameron's renegotiation, namely, he had accepted the principle behind the EU's rejected constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, giving Blair an exit situation.
The press never forgiven him.
But a nice Jeremy Corby, who kindly killed me at the Westminster Parliament building on Monday (I told him that he had no more time to waste on me) seems to be in danger of reinventing Neil Kinnock's 80s strategy, which was a mistake, both then and now.
Although it can take time, however, he has to develop a consistent strategy to keep in touch with the media. Not me, but no doubt Andrew Marri, whose BBC-sohvad Corby left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is well-known, evolving.
He says that he would like us to remain in the reformed EU.
Well, most of the people outside the British Independence Party of Ukip's military initiative and the most desperationary nationalists can surely stand behind this opinion.
Hilary-Benn, but not Benn-fan – Benn said this in both radio and television this week, when his internal Boy Scout would have wanted to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint a kasski John McDonnell shadow government finance minister was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the '70s when his father-in-law stressed in TV trying to be unsatisfied with the government colleagues of the Labour Party without going so far as to lose his position of government.
Hilary's coatings were more attractive.
But the fight to remain in any situation, in which, at any given time, what McDonnell said was not what Corby told the principals and representatives of the people at a private meeting on Monday night.
Whatever it is, it is an inherarical, emotional and personal image that Corby wants to convey (to remember that he even touched me), the discipline of communication is important in the time period of the tv, and in particular in the cycle of social media, which is an acceptable growth platform for paranoids and frauds.
As Mr McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Cameron an air ticket to Europe by allowing him to support the Labour Party in the referendum campaign for himself.
Simon Jenkins at least thinks that.
However, the basic rotation of McDonald and Corbyn on EU membership (and therefore in line with their Benn-spiritual regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult debate on left-wing thinkers who are at the heart of the dogmi-skilling.
As far as his duality with NATO is concerned (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby did not campaign to give up), foreign diplomats must only try to explain it to his superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin be willing to waste political capital (they also have suspicious voters) on the United Kingdom when it can be totally useless?
The United States has already disappointed the poor military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even as I was reminded on Monday at the initiative of the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticise Public Health England’s E-scene Assessment
The researchers have said that the state-funded agency’s claim that the electric tobacco is 95% less harmful than the traditional ones gave rise to a meeting of 12 people, some of which had access to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined Lance in their report on electronic tobacco.
In the last month, the PHE published its report on this matter, describing it as an overview of the evidence.
However, several researchers have questioned the sustainability of data and referred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month, the medical journal Lancet published a ledger attack on the basis of the PHE’s chief ruling.
Two other researchers in BMJ have wondered whether the claims were built on rock or sand.
Martin McKee, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medical School of Europe, and Professor Simon Capewell of Liverpool, says: \"The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven effectiveness.
They say that the public expects that PHE’s claim-to-be best estimate is about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes, based on a detailed assessment and modeling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people, which developed a multi-criteria decision-making model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions on the disadvantages of products containing nicotine, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose director-in-chief has previously received funding from the British American Tobacco for independent research.
He also supported the BT public health powers in the sustainability report, they say.
One meeting of 12 people announced that they had received funding from the electric tobacco manufacturer, but not from the funding that he was told had previously received from Philip Morris International, they would add.
The selection criteria for panel members are not stated, but the panel includes a number of well-known electric tobacco supporters, some of which also indicate that they have received funding in the field of research.
Others who have been present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by PHE’s tobacco manager.
The group's research, which has been produced, is very clear to admit that there is a lack of undisputed evidence regarding the disadvantages of most products and most of the criteria, McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or restrictions is mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell claim that there is no evidence that the electric tobacco works as a route for smoking in children or non-pactics.
Professor Kevin Fenton, Director of Health and Welfare of PHE, says that the arguments in BMJ have been answered in the past.
He says: “The tobacco is significantly less harmful than smoking.
Half the people who have burned their lives die of addiction.
All the evidence suggests that health risks caused by electric tobacco are relatively small, but we must continue to study long-term effects.
PHE has a clear obligation to inform the public of what the evidence looks like and what it does not look like, especially when there is so much public awareness of tobacco as compared to the relative risks.
Almost 80 000 people die every year of smoking-related illness and smoking costs NHS $2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - that is, although electrical tobacco is not unrisked, their disadvantages are only a fraction of the sharks of traditional tobacco - we fulfil our national responsibility.
BBC should give up the East Enders, says former Channel 4 Director.
Luke Johnson, former President of Channel 4 said that BBC should stop sending programmes such as EastEnders or The Voice, and that commercial competitors would give anything, for example, a series of soaps placed on this Albert Square street.
Johnson said that licensing should only be used for programmes that are not carried out by other British broadcasters.
He criticises the BBC for putting in public service programmes that are likely to have a smaller public, difficult broadcasting time against the most competitors' most viewed programmes and channels such as BBC4.
After the President of the BBC, Tony Hall, said that the company wanted to cooperate more with other organisations, Johnson said that he had come to Channel 4 for six years to establish a relationship with BBC, in vain.
“I do not understand the idea that BBC will produce and send programmes that would clearly agree with non-substantiated competitors,” said Johnson to the upper-room communications committee as part of its research on the future of BBC.
If the licence fee is held - and I'm not sure it would be a good idea for this message or for the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others will not and will not do.
The Voice will be sent to the most important broadcasting time, because it is intended to receive as much support as possible for its future.
The idea that no one else would look like a program is a joke, that's ridiculous, that's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said: “I do not understand why a regressive tax should be financed by programmes that could also be financed without State aid.
The Voice is one of those and the EastEnders another, without denying the inside of the house.
In fact, other channels would give anything about it.
I do not understand how this is about sending public service.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC at all.
In the year 2004-2010, serial entrepreneur Johnson said that the BBC is guilty of hunting the numbers of viewers because of the aims of the people working here, and because they believe that it is the best way to achieve long-term support.
He commented on the most popular series of BBCs, which resembles the comments made by former Sky Director Tony Ball, who used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that BBC sell series such as the East Enders.
Johnson said that the BBC's smaller public service programmes would go to BBC4, which often cannot measure the number of viewers, but the BBC will thus meet its responsibility and then be able to use the 4 billion pounds of license payments in defending it as a hypocrisy to say that 'I suppose we are doing all these unknown programs that no one sees.'
They'll put them at the embassy where no one's ever gonna come to see them.
As regards the permit fee, Johnson said to the Committee: “I'm going to have you look for a more regressive system in the person who gets the most value of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that in 150 pounds a year you will get a lot of value, but I don't know if it's the place for people who have 150 pounds of money, because they don't use BBC much.
Former Director of Sky and Channel 5 David Elstein, who also witnessed to the Committee on Tuesday, said that the BBC should re-evaluate its temporary mission to inform, train and entertain the Committee,
He said that only a small part of BBC's production is now classified as education - he said that the figures are 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio, and that it should be modelled on the Australian and Canadian radios and changed to form information, validation and entertainment.
As far as the partnership issues are concerned, Elstein said that the BBC should focus more on events such as Proms concerts, which he says are shown on TV by just some, and join commercial companies in such a way that all these things can be viewed online.
-Mänigenetics – enables brain cell control by means of sound waves
The video shows how the shuttle birds change direction as soon as the sound pulse hits them.
Scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems to control them with sound waves.
Small-scale shuttle birds change direction as soon as they have a sound pulse that is too high to hear the human ear.
Impulses work by switching on genetically modified motion nerve cells with membranes reacting to ultrasonic waves.
Subject: Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said that the worms show the performance of a new method called audiogenetics, which allows the ultrasound to activate certain brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekant Chalasani, a researcher at the California La Jolla Institute, told The Guardian that one day the method could replace deep brain stimulation. It is an invasive measure in which electrical pulses are used in human brain to treat Parkinson’s disease.
But Chalasan found that when they were surrounded by a liquid with microscopic small bubbles, the situation changed.
He noticed that the rubbers confirmed the ultrasounds that then entered the worms.
The reinforced ultrasound waves affect the TRP-4-ionic channels, structures in the cell membranes of some worms.
These ion channels can open up and activate the cells attached to them, reported in the report published in the Nature Communications.
In order to produce ultrasonic control shuttles, Chalasani developed worms genetically so that part of their business nerve cells are TRP-4-ion channels.
When Chalasani used the ultrasound to convert to modified mats, the microcircuits confirmed the sound waves and transmitted them to the mats where they switched on the modified motion nerve cells.
There are some of the same features in the process as in optogenetics, in a playful tool that allows scientists to switch nerve cells on and off using light pulses.
However, Chalasani says that there may be some advantages in the use of sonogenetics compared to optical genetics.
Unlike the light that needs to be sent from the optical to the desired point within the brain, low-speed ultrasound waves can pass through the tissue without any obstacle, so they can be sent to the brain from the head of the skull.
“We believe that gene therapy and therapeutic virus may be possible by the use of target human nerve cells for the moment to react to ultrasound signals in certain neurological treatments in the clinical environment,” Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.

Advertising may bring Britain’s arms trade to shame
See the video against Amnesty International Arms Fairs.
Terrible killer machines!
Necks crushing legs!
Robbery bombs!
And electronic bending pumps that cause painful pain but don't leave any trace!
The joyous voice and the comical language of the world’s largest weapons fairs are a sharp parod, produced by Amnesty International in order to highlight the willingness of the British government to trade weapons for the repression government at the ExCeL Centre in London.
Related to this: DSEI Arms Fairs: Authorary Administrations arriving in London
With a separate campaign, there were many posters for bus stops and metrojuni, which require more accurate information.
“The important information is whether you travel on the DLR route from 15 to 18 September – together you will be asked using the London underground font and brand, as the DLR track changes into the tank’s image.
In this September, a pack of arms dealers will arrive on the DLR route... and customers will be asked to help stop the weapons fairs.
These 300 posters are made by artists who were present at the Banksyn Dismaland Museum of Cruz Designs (in the museum of public plans).
A collective named Special Patrol Group helped spread posters all over London using “Ad Space Hack Packs” packages, which includes six pounds of six-packs with collective access to a third of the whole planet’s bus stop advertising space.
Transport for London has not been interested in this unauthorized public vandalization.
One of the parodiaines produced by the Special Patrol Group collective.
According to Cruz Designs and the University of Essex Journalist Gavin Grindon, artists are increasingly questioning and wishing to take political work to non-ferrous audiences.
Many artists have begun to work with activists in the resistance front when they realize that they have to go to the outside world if they want their skills to affect society.
Another poster against arms trade is greeted by business travelers in the subway.
Amnessty's video has been viewed on Facebook more than 100,000 times in the last 24 hours. It was created free of charge by VCCP, and also by the graphic designer and backgroundist worked for free.
The VCCP-creative director Matt Lever found that the gun fairs were not advertised at all - and the ExCeL calendar was then empty - and thought: \"Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid.\"
They were playing with the idea of a more realistic commercialization of the dazzle, but it was more important to stress it with bright colors and animation.
“They have done fantastic work to help us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment sold at fairs,” says Amnesstyn Tom Davies.
Now the British Government must take action and ensure that torture instruments are not sold illegally near our own home.
Perhaps the most creative art associated with the arms fair comes from the inside of ExCeL when the actors trade fantasticly decorated products.
In his press release, he received an order from the U.S. Army on top of the AT4CS RS.
This includes a –a quality pipette head that focuses on excellent effects behind the panzer inside the target.
Whatever it does, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a student apartment
It's been 11 years since I was unconscious when I moved to a student home, and then I believed in barettes and moral relativism, but I just remember the violent smiles and numerous, long complaints of the people I've upset.
A large part of what I've learned can be summed up into eight simple rules.
Moving to the apartment can be anything completely scary to the nerves.
It's tempting to tell me where you're from, did you have a year between you and what you think about Corby, and why, seriously, I don't love or hate Marmite because it's just a hiccup to find me in my room...
Take a breath.
And help others to draw their lives - ask questions and show interest.
It directs the conversation and helps you find the people you like, and the people you don't want to talk to, even if your eyelashes were on fire and they'd split off.
Give people room.
People’s rooms are often transformed into cocktail parties, venues for movie stars and great entertainment, but they are also places where people dress and repair their underwear.
Subject: Do not even imagine starting a university while you are in a relationship
The university is a tough place for the Introverters.
Your room should be a resting place, but many apartments are formed by a culture of walking from room to room, which is friendly, social and creates living friendships.
It could mean hell to someone trying to get some rest.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say \"I want to be friends with you,\" but now you have to leave, that I can recover the energy that I spent talking to you.
Try to see when a student friend is tired of socializing, and maybe send a text message to the door instead of knocking.
When the speech came, knock.
A guy in my student apartment thought that if the door wasn't locked, he had been invited in.
He saw some pretty big stuff.
You'll be friends by the baker.
Since you're starting a university in the bakery season, knocking people's doors with a chocolate chipboard and showing yourself seems somewhat less strange, less welcome to the neighborhood, I had something to eat for you, and now I'm smiling at you when I asked you personal questions.
It is a great way to make friends with self-determination.
Your roommates may feel obliged to talk, and they may be in the future to connect your face to a tasteful surprise.
This, of course, depends on your ability to bake.
Badly mixed flour-sugar fats are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student housing.
I understand taking someone's chicken is stealing, but what if you just take the milk off your tea?
Ask and check with the milk owner.
It's possible that they'll give you permission, even though they're boiling inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and you get my sympathy, but try to treat it more adult than my roommate, which mixed up his milk detergent to punish those who stole it.
He's in jail now.
You don't have to be a noiseist so people can't sleep or learn.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that eloquent pot hanging on the roof.
The girl in my hall asked her neighbor if they could call their drama and bass music later because it was three in the morning and she had a exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume of sound.
Finally, when they were quiet at five in the morning, the girl kindly allowed them to sleep two hours before putting their own music to a break, locked their doors and took a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future mate happened to move into the same apartment with you?
Or vice versa, would it not be incredibly embarrassing if you considered a roommate partner as your future mate, you would come together, resign, then you would see him every day, and possibly you would lose all your friends together.
Of course, the heart wants what he wants, but if a hot roommate partner really isn't your future mate, you could even try to make sense to your bottom.
In that exhilarating moment, when you find that someone has left his keys in his locked room, the limit between snoring and bullying is thinner than it does.
Well, that's fun, but it's gonna be canceled in a minute.
You can give us a useful and fun lesson for safety by hiding something, but never mess with someone's room with toothpaste and shampoola.
Lock their doors and drop the keys in the water glass, which you will then put on the freezer, but don't put their property in the blue bar at least twice.
A racist blow to the shelter of foreign students in Kite, when the house was planned to be received at the reception center, was strangled in Salo.
There was a racist attack on the premises of foreign students in Kite, North Karelia on Saturday morning.
Unlike the police mentioned earlier, it is not the accommodation of minors but the sleeping mats of foreign students in Finland, says Heidi Lukekainen, a teacher of Kiteen Evangelical folk school.
The windows and walls of the accommodation facilities were strangled by racist markings, such as gypsies, and a metal object had been thrown through a single room window, says the police of Eastern Finland.
According to Luke, the responsible teacher for social security training at the university’s youth college, the building under the influence of an evil authority was estimated to be ten people at the time of the attack.
“It was a weekend and adults are free to move, so some might be elsewhere,” says Luke.
People from 12 different nationalities are occupied by the National School.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time as well as under-represented asylum seekers who have only arrived.
All those who were in a rowing building have A-stations.
Part of the study at adult school, part of vocational studies, and part of the study in Finnish, says Luke.
A status is so-called a continuous residence permit, which can be granted for four years to a foreigner who has already been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack in the form of damage and damage to home peace.
According to Luke, students were held on Monday at a press conference, where the necessary interpretations were also present.
There's no panic here, and no one's ever wanted to leave.
We have had twenty years of foreign students, and this is the first time something like this happens, Luke says.
Luke says the mess's already been cleaned out of the wall.
They were suspected to have had at least three men and had been on a light passenger car.
I think this is the top of the young weekend when this topic has been on the surface.
Nothing more serious than that, Luke says.
Salo also has a hospital with a planned reception centre.
The incident happened last week.
This is about MTV's website on Tuesday night.
The hospital wall was drawn and written in English, You are not welcome
The case has been reported to the police.
Revision 15.9 at 16.02 corrected police information about the age and status of people living in the building.
The state is breaking up the passengers of the Y-jun to the Karjaa, with their gums, from the ancient idiotics.
The Y train from Helsinki to Raasepori Karjaa stops moving in March.
The news was agitated by passengers on the beginning of the train at Helsinki Main Railway Station.
In particular, the suburbs hit the Siuntiolas, said Torbjörn Bengtström in the municipality.
It's idiotic because the population is growing all the time and the working people need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be anything but political will or lack it.
Bengtström says HSTV's interview video is coming to the capital even if it's a tractor.
There will also be train changes elsewhere in the Uusimaa.
The H and R trains on the main track will be combined into a new line of R.
The station of Purola in Järvenpää and the use of Nupplinna in Tuusula are excluded.
On Tuesday, the Ministry of Transport and Communications and the VR published information on the route to which the Ministry buys train traffic during the next contract period.
The contract period is changing during the year and the routes to be stopped are in the country as a whole.
The new four-year agreement, which will be finalised in autumn, will be subsequently approved by the Committee on Monetary Affairs.
Bengtström, Siuntiolainen, considers that the public train camp is short-sighted.
Let us make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeated in a very systematic way.
Then there'll be a regret.
Y train is also used by non-Raaseporians and Siuntians, because it is fast and passing over multiple stations.
The Espoolainen Annina Pöyry, on the train, was ashamed of the fate of travelers beyond the city area.
“It’s very bad for those who have to plan their journey again, ” he said when he pained the Y train.
A little relief is promised.
A new train connection is coming to the beach, which will replace the Y train in the Helsinki Region (HSL) region, i.e. to Kirkkunum.
This will increase the cost to HSL, i.e. in practice to the municipalities of the region and their taxpayers.
“We are now going to find out different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices,” said Suvi Rihtniemi, CEO of HSL.
It is still impossible to assess the costs carefully.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid about a million per year from the Y train, the Ministry certainly did much more than that.
The R-line on the main track leaves between two positions.
Instead, in Ainola and in Sauna Kallio, the number of train trains is doubled.
A total of 28 small positions and numerous routes will cease in the whole country.
The Ministry will no longer buy train traffic on the routes in Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuru and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Sinajoki.
The Pieksämäki-Joensu route will be shortened as a route to Piksämäki-Varku.
Trains are reduced on routes to Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karja, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajani-Oulu.
More than half a million trips are made per year, with a total of about nine million trips purchased by the Ministry.
The aim of the new agreement is to bring to the state the annual savings of 12.3 million.
The value of the contract is approximately EUR 27.5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in the Finality Book: “Marxin should be familiar with:
The world economic crises have raised the surface of Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his work on capital in 1867-1894, writing in the book Marx's Mainoma, which is the former president of GDP, the author of Yrjö Hakane published today.
He is now being taken more seriously than for a long time. Hakanen writes in his first speech.
Marx's estimates of capitalist economic development, internationalisation and entry into all sectors of life, concentration of capital and the growing role of monetary capital and imaginary capital have proved to be amazingly long-term.
The writer list of the book based on the Capital Seminars of Hakake is also presented by the professor of Aalto University, a well-reputed economicist Sixten Korkman.
In the book Korkman writes Marx's current, and forever,
But the former CEO of the Institute of Economics and the Department of Economics is not Marxish, is he?
Oh, my God.
On the phone, Korkman says that he does not regard Marx as a current economic thinker but rather as an interesting social theory.
Today, social sciences have distinguished and specialised, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociology, economic scientist, journalist, political agitator and author of literature.
“The public perception of the history of the dead is that the false opinions of the dead men, ” Korkman, begins.
It's true that Marx's predictions went badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and meaning of the industrial revolution, he drew too far from the beginning of capitalism conclusions, Korkman thought.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical attitude.
\"The most relevant in Marx is that he asked good questions,\" he says.
Another discussion is about Marx's interests, such as the distribution of wealth.
“Marx may give inspiration to someone who wants to understand a big picture, a world that changes as a result of the technical revolution, ” Corkman analysis.
But what the government should decide tomorrow is not gonna help Marx.
In his opinion, capitalism was an hopeless case that should just be stopped.
And yet, Marxin's opinion is that Korkman should be familiar with it.
“In the '70s, Marx could not be read, ” Korkman says.
“Males and Trotskians and other sects hated all capitalisms, but more and more, ”
Today, the debate is more diverse, and Marx can also approach without the ideological and political weights of the years back.
\"Some social scientist should be familiar with Marx's idea world, as with other classes,\" says Korkman.
The UN demands war criminals in Sri Lanka
The UN calls for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes in Sri Lanka civil war, reports AFP.
The UN report on civil war in 1983-2009 appeared on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report blames both Sri Lanka's armed forces and the rebels known as the tamilis.
At least 100,000 people are estimated to have died in the civil war in Sri Lanka.
There's no accurate information on the number of victims.
In particular, the major attack of armed forces in the last months of a long war should be examined properly, and the UN report calls for it.
The Sri Lankan Armed Forces report is responsible for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which was as likely as men as women were victims.
According to the report, the rebels have been guilty of forced by bystanders and children as fighters.
Both sides, according to the report, have committed murder.
Sri Lanka replied on Wednesday that it intends to organise the investigation itself, but does not intend to allow the establishment of the UN Court of Justice because foreign judges.
In the English yo test, social media was able to weigh
On Wednesday there was a long foreign language that was English in the majority of the books in Syksy.
His English skills tested more than 16,000 experiments.
In the experiment, the substance could write about social media.
On the basis of our own experience, we had to consider whether social media would make us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, a letter in English 150-250 could give a web page counseling board to the holder.
The title was Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt responds to the Finnish Leelia rest chair.
He had to ask for advice on how parents could look at matters for young people.
The total number of subjects was four, one was to be chosen.
“It was the hardest of them, ” estimates the third topic of Porvoo’s Swedish high school in English, Mia Lybeck.
The third topic was merely a sitate from former President of the European Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso.
The fourth topic, Lybeck said, was so nice.
It was meant to write a fire call, why companies should hire young people to work.
“At least in our school, we have been trained to write talks,” says Lybeck, and estimates the whole test, “meel to be normal. ”
In the English test in Finland - or in Swedish - the English test was able to answer questions about texts that, for example, put the adaptation of the summer campaign to climate change and the handling of large mass data.
Some long Russian (68 pupils), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written on Wednesday.
Syksy’s articles continue on Friday, which is the turn of another domestic or Swedish or Finnish test.
The tests are organised normally, i.e. the expression of the employees' minds does not affect them.
The university of higher education invites the experienced people to search for appropriate transport links in time to get to the audition.
Additional time may also be obtained if it can be demonstrated that the delay was not due to its own negligence.
Stored in Oulu with a gun threat
The shop was robbed on Wednesday morning in the district of Kelo.
According to the police, the kidnapper was dressed in dark clothes and a comendop covering his face.
He's normal, and he's about 30 years old.
According to the police, the man had threatened the staff with a handgun and received a small amount of money to catch.
They're investigating this as a gross robbery.
Police are preparing for the arrival of tens of thousands of protesters in Helsinki - support parties from elsewhere in Finland
The expression of mind against government cutting decisions will be blocked on Friday at the centre of Helsinki, predicted by the police.
In advance, even tens of thousands of people can arrive.
The members of the SAK, the Planned and STK Associations will meet at Rautatientor at 11 a.m.
The police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration of mentality.
The task of the police at work is, in turn, not only to carry out alarming tasks and other police activities, but also to ensure the smooth functioning of the drumming expression.
The road to the railway station will be closed from motor vehicles at approximately 9.30-14 p.m.
All we can do is get the alarm vehicles in the area.
From the direction of Hakanieme, traffic will be cut off from the road of Kaisaniemi, westward from Mannerheiminti.
Is the people at Helsinki Police Department enough, Captain Seppo Kujala?
At least for now it looks like it's enough.
I don't take a stand on police work.
According to Kujala Helsinki, support parties are coming to Helsinki from other parts of Finland because of the demonstration of mind.
The police won't tell us the exact number of patrols.
There's going to be a lot of people coming, but, as a rule, we'll be doing it on our own, Kujala says.
The police are calling on us to avoid private car rental in Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates that the worst traffic pump extends from Hakaniemi level to the core centre.
Standing traffic is expected from the morning to the beginning of the evening.
With protestors coming from other parts of Finland, Helsinki also has a lot of subscription buses coming to Helsinki.
They won't be released to Rautatientori.
Buses tend to be far away from the point of view.
The rest of the trip then has to walk to the demonstration site, Kujala says.
The expression of mind also stops the public transport of Helsinki.
From the police' point of view, there's a positive side.
The issue of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally handled by these big gatherings, is now partly self-responsible.
Mental expression organisers have informed the police that there may be tens of thousands of opponents of government economic policy in Helsinki.
The police are waiting for the demonstration to go smoothly.
People are ordinary workers or unemployed - ordinary citizens.
Yes, the Finnish people are reasonable and peaceful. Kujala says.
In different parts of Finland, local demonstrations will also be held on Friday.
Friday's demonstration of mind is exceptional in many ways - do you remember these lakes and demonstrations?
In many ways, the great expression of mind, organised on Friday by trade unions, is interesting and exceptional.
For example, there is no very good reference point in Finnish political history, says the professor of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
It's no wonder the Ay movement protests.
If it didn't do that, it'd raise your hands up in front of the government, She says.
The very right government has hit the core points of Finnish corporateism - and also those that have been important to the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's heavy claims are lacking in contract law.
There are a lot of features here that the ay movement is really trying to get on its knees.
At the same time, the ay movement also has the place to look at the mirror.
For example, a mirror is needed because there is no support for Friday's demonstrations by all employees.
The new is now the sharp division that the expression of mind will bring about among the one that ay movement would like to participate in the demonstration.
The unemployed gathered across Finland showed their views at the Parliamentary House in November 1993.
If you are looking for a reference point for Friday's demonstration, it could be a giant demonstration of the unemployed, the Murrostorstai, which was held in 1993, then said.
In the middle of the deeper sheep, Murrostorstai collected 20,000 unemployed persons.
Esko Ahon (mainly) government tripped from labour market crisis to crisis.
It was said that the Finnish Government and the employees' organisations had never been as bad as during the Aho Bóvari government.
Now, maybe even worse between the government and the Ay movement than at the time of the Murrostorst.
Besides, Finland is now a very bourgeois government in power, says Siseiinen.
The current government coalition is still of such interest that it is such a strict right despite the words of the Finns.
There were certain elements of the old labor movement at the time of the crash.
A number of thousands of protestors are expected on Friday.
The expression of mind also stops public transport and possibly closes day care centres as well as schools.
Even if the expression of mind does not receive undivided support from employees, it may come to the greatest number of years.
Some 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki in recent years.
They're out of range.
Traditionally, Finnish demonstrations of ay movement have been quite peaceful - even though the methods of action have worsened in recent years.
Traditionally, Finnish protests avoid conflict, are legal.
Spiriters strive to avoid damage or destruction of property, says the Prince.
However, the end of the 1990s brought new winds.
The spirit culture changed.
EU membership made farmers nervous to throw chicken eggs and the police decided to get the pig shit on.
The firemen's strike lasted three months in 1998.
Among other things, there were visible strikes on pilots and air traffic controllers.
Do you remember these strikees and demonstrations?
Metal and electrical lakes of the 1970s
In 1971, the most significant warehouses in the 1970s were the metal lake and the power plant and electricity lake in 1977.
The metal men's strike took part in 70,000 metal men.
The strike was suspended with a proposal from the Conciliation Committee for seven weeks after the strike.
Metalmen received an increase of 16%.
The electric lake in the spring of 1977 lasted 49 days and caused electrical losses all over the country.
Murrostoristi in 1993
On 4 November 1993, about 20,000 people met at Parliament’s Parliamentary House, many of the poor unemployed, to show their views on the job.
The firemen ceased for three months in 1998.
The strike of firemen was one of the longest in the 1990s, unless the longest national strike.
Agriculture opposed the EU 1994 and 1999
The police came to the hake in the farmers' protests against the EU in 1994.
\"Siperia teaches, the EU stops,\" there was one of the punch clauses.
Espa's farmers killed tons of snow.
The Helsinki EU Summit in 1999 also led farmers to protest and to burn hazes in front of the meeting site.
In 1983 and 1995, care providers ceased to exist.
Hospital nurses stopped in 1995 for about a month.
For the last time, they had been on strike in 1983.
Some deaths occurred during the strike in 1995.
It was threatened by strike and mass transfer of nurses in 2007.
In the end, there was a threat of mass attack.
Doctors strike in 2001
The doctors in the strike, the escape, belonged to a clash of law enforcement doctors in 2001.
The death of municipal health centres and hospitals lasted a five-month period and resulted in a lively debate on how to endanger patient safety.
After the law, the public sector raised the medical salary.
Students on the move in 2013
About 5 000 students march in Helsinki from the Senate to the Parliamentary House in 2013.
The Central Criminal Police finds out that there were backs of a Finnish truck full of refugees to the Austrian police.
The Austrian police have requested assistance from the Central Criminal Police to find out about the backgrounds of the refugees registered in Finland.
On Sunday, the Austrian police stopped in Aisterheim near the German border with 42 refugees.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
They were all in good condition.
We've had an exchange of information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and the main responsibility are at the site of the event in Austria, reports Captain Tero Haapala of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, refugees travelling on a truck in Austria became more fatal.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board died by suffocating.
According to the public radio first told about cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to the Finnish limited company.
The company conducts restaurant activities, and its CEO is a foreignist, about 40-year-old man.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested for trafficking in human beings in Austria.
Captain refugees, former drug offender and an uplifting businessman - the story of five smugglers.
The king of high-end smugglers, the violent boatman, the stylish missionary and the cab driver himself as a good guy.
For example, such people carry on trafficking in human beings in the European Union.
The criminologist Andrea Di Nicola at Trento University and the supplier Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and clients, and their book Death Travel Office will be published in Finnish this week.
In the book they present human trafficking hipsters, propose solutions and present smugglers from different steps of business.
HS presents five of them.
I'm gonna beat them up right now.
The Kerkenna islands on the eastern coast of Tunisia do not attract foreign tourists, but many of the tunnels are heading there for summer.
On behalf of its location, the islands are also well suited for smuggling, as the trip to the island of Lampedusa, Italy, is only 120 km away.
Due to comparison: The distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 km.
There, in the village of El Attaya, Emir lives in the chain, the captain burning in the chain and the father of six children.
Kerkenna islands are famous for their shrimps, but the fishermen are more profitable to transport people.
Emir has done that in a blue, ten-foot wooden boat for hundreds of years.
If you fill the ship's feathers, there's 40 people in it.
One trip Emir makes some EUR 8 000 after the cost.
Emir has five assistants looking for customers all over Tunisia.
Customers are arriving from many countries, but during the Arab spring, a huge number of people in Tunisia wanted to escape restlessness.
After that, the situation calmed down until again, with the refugee crisis.
Customers arrive from the mainland to the Kerkenna Islands in small groups.
Emir will keep them in empty houses for as long as you can see fit.
Food is given so that customers are just and live.
The accommodation costs about EUR 75 per night, and if the customer ends up with the money, it's their problem.
The water will be released at midnight with a cut off.
The first night we drive away from the islands, then stop, wait a day, and drive to Lampedusa the next night.
Sometimes the sea is hard, and passengers cry and throw up in a 20 - meter - high wave.
The human cargo has been bitten in half an hour, and Emir leaves for return.
Emir wants him scared.
That's why he beats up his clients, and at least he claims he's going to beat the hangers to death.
He says in the book that once the police hit him, he threw all his passengers over the ship and told them to swim on the nearest island.
\"I used the clients on my own, and I threw them overboard,\" Emir says in the book.
The ironiest passengers are coming from the south of Sahara.
He says he's got to deal with this.
I'm gonna beat them up right now.
They need to be shown immediately who's to be ordered here.
Just a normal cab driver.
Goran is an ordinary cab driver in Bofovasha in Serbia.
His cab isn't very good. The starter's been pulling at last, and anyway, he's seen his best days.
However, the main point for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving at all, and that it moves towards Hungary's border.
Bohovasha is a small village of 500 inhabitants, about 60 kilometers from Belgrade to lunch.
It is located next to the village, a centre for asylum seekers, where families are primarily allowed.
In the forests around the centre, men who travel without their families will be housed in tents, villages and abandoned cars, which are now able to find or build.
The forest also includes families who have not submitted asylum applications to Serbia for a reason or another.
Some also stay in private housing, but it is a public secret.
In the woods, Goran will find most of his clients.
These are often exhausted - via the Balkans the route requires a large number of border crossings and weekly walks in a difficult land, often in mountain areas and in the dark.
In the end, when they arrive in the region of Bofovasha, in the node of the great human trafficking, people are dying.
The Gypsies of Goran are mainly Syrian, Afghan, Pakistani, Iraqi and Kurdish.
The best clients are the Syrians, he says in the book.
They say it once, and that's enough, Gora's compliment.
He says the Africans are trying to do a trick.
That's not what Goran likes.
You stupid fool all the way.
First, the price is agreed, for example, 300 euros, then they'll count to 200 and eventually offer 150.
Goran stresses that he's a nice and kindhearted man.
I don't care about the money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people. He says in the book.
Goran tells us that he will work less than the others and that he will only make 50 euros of his ride to the Hungarian border.
It's a three-mile road trip, most of the nicest part of the highway.
I hear colleagues are asking for a three or four-fold price.
Gora deserves about 50 000 euros a year.
It's not a lot of money for a smuggler, but it's a very nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered the taxis not to be transported 12 kilometres closer to the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and the arrows and takes his rides a mile from the border.
Then he shows his clients the right direction and goes away.
In the Work of the Prayer
A 35-year-old Congolese man is called the Messenger, and it's not just a nickname.
He really has a Protestant church in the capital of Uganda, Cambodia, where a lot of those who fled from the Congo will be visited, as well as a small center where the Congolese refugees will be helped.
In addition to preaching, the Ambassador runs a smuggling business where people are transferred from Congo to Europe.
He looks at the work of mercy.
It's important for a missionary to look good.
He polishes his shoe many times a day and takes care that the rubber tape of the white skulls is squeezing in style under the low waist of the jeans.
The ambassador is proud of his new Mercedes, his underground car and three motorcycles.
When the Messenger does not preach, he organises people from Congo to Uganda and forward to Europe.
At first, the customer will call someone from the five telephone numbers of the Ambassador.
He advises that it is worth coming to the border in the morning, hiding the money in the water and insulting the traffickers across the border.
In order to reach the authorities of the asylum seeker or refugee status in Uganda, it must be said that there are, for example, war zones in northern Kiev, and that there has been violence in their homes.
It's often true, but if it isn't, the Ambassador will arrange a new identity for the client.
The old identity certificate will be destroyed and the second will be acquired.
That's what they'll do to help the Closer's contacts with the Ugandan police.
The customer will then be directed to the same place where the right asylum seekers go: asylum procedures, NGOs, eventually UNHCR.
A missionary knows bureaucracy because he himself has become a refugee in Uganda.
He will charge each port separately: the lodging of an application to the Ugandan police will cost approximately EUR 100, the handling of documents to humanitarian organisations of some EUR 150 and the migration process in some European countries, for example, EUR 4 500-7 000.
Folio and icebergs
Tom's a start-up smuggler, a former drug dealer.
A four-year Irish warden on the coast of Calais, France, where his work is to load people to the trucks on his way to Britain.
He's got an Afghan, French cab driver and dozens of trucks who don't necessarily even know he's in a human trafficking business.
At night Tom and the cab driver pick up their clients, usually 2-3 people, from someone near the center of Calais.
They drive A26 and try to avoid the police.
If the police were to stop the car on the motorway, Tom and the driver would go straight to prison for the organisation of illegal immigration.
That's what Tom doesn't want. He's been sitting for seven years because of drugs.
The cab stops, Tom and his clients run across the highway to a place where the driver sleeps before they continue across the Channel to the British.
Tom chooses a suitable truck to make sure he's on his way to England right now, and he's not going to the Netherlands, and he's cutting off the safety guard.
It's gotta be done quietly so that the kids don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is on the line, but then the truck is more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his client with an aluminium foil, the same one that is wrapped in the kitchen around a shirt or oven potato.
It should prevent the police from detecting a hideout.
Some people use ice-filled sleeping bags for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck, and he's out there hoping he doesn't blow up the smugglers, at least before Britain.
King of smugglers
Muammer Küçuk is one of the world's most famous human transporters.
The Upocalytic Turkish have been called the Master of Marketing and the Undisputed King of the Indisputable Countries of the Mediterranean, which governs maritime routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçuk has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new methods of smuggling.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: he only demands the money.
One of the new methods is luxury: Turkish ports are leased for tourist cruises for a few days to accommodate Americans or European families.
In fact, ships will be loaded to fill in the Syrians, Iraqis, Kurdishs and Afghans, which will be transported against EUR 5 000-7 000, first from Istanbul to a port and then to a sea Europe.
Customers will be stored in human stocks, for example in old industrial halls until it is time to leave.
People are being turned to minibuses and driven somewhere along the coast.
They are told to hide among the vegetation and wait for the sign.
When it is given, we need to get on board quickly.
Passengers must stay under the deck all the way.
The Navy can only observe how deep the ship swims, as other signs of the crowd are not visible.
Food and drink are given, but the less passengers get out and throw up, the better.
Küçuk will receive around EUR 53 000 after a luxury trip.
He does not deal with practical matters himself, but hires captains, recruiters, guards, staffers and other smaller factors to do the work for him.
During the summer season, transports are organised at least hundreds and Küçuk makes millions.
He estimates that he bought through undercover companies, a country, a pharmaceutical company, and over 100 apartments he rents.
Muammer Küçuk was arrested in 2011 with the representative of the Turkish Democratic Party and an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical sector.
He's probably lost since then.

American Olympics in their book about their illness and becoming a prostitute
Three times in the Olympics, the new book of Suzy Favor Hamilton, a 500-meter runner, has attracted attention to the United States.
Favor Hamilton tells us in his book called Fast Girl about ending his career and driving into a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated magazine published articles of the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton decided his career at Sydney Olympics.
He came to the competitions in high school and ran away for the second time.
But in the finals, he was panicking.
At the beginning, he ran to the top and defended his position with a ground run.
Yet, at 150 meters before the goal, his strength was erupted.
He broke into the surface of the track, and the other competitors passed him one after another.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I'd never run again.
However, I was forced over the goal line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
Later it was discovered that Favor Hamilton suffered a two-way disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before Sydney's competitions, and he himself felt enormous successes.
Favor Hamilton was 43 years old when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
There were no financial problems in the park, but he was passionate about having money to have sex with other men.
He also called on his husband to accept his action.
Favor Hamilton's cab was 450 euros an hour.
He tells me that he's spent the money in his luxury life.
One example of Favor Hamilton as a prostitute was that he needed adrenaline stitches similar to that he had received in his competition in general sports.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he was ill with a two-way mood disorder.
The double life of the former star drinker came out at the end of 2012, when the Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton attended the Olympics in Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney.
In 2000, he was 1500 meters away with the world’s statistical rate of 3.57,40, but remained the last one in Sydney’s Olympic Final.
The master of the world was exhilarating when the union put Norway in the middle of a ski bowl: “Supreshing.
The Norwegian ski king Petter Northug has exceeded the limits of compliance in the opinion of at least one of his colleagues.
The Northug and the Norwegian ski union have turned the whole summer and the fall into a sports agreement.
Even though the alliance has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been good enough for a multi-faceted world champion and Olympic winner.
The association of Norwegian skiings decided to close Northug out of the future World Cup.
The decision was a thank-you from a double world champion, Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was happy that the union put a ski dress under control.
Thank you for pointing the spine, Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook profile.
“We cannot allow one of the active athletes to avoid working for the Union sponsor, ” he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian ski union and Northug is about money.
Apparently, Northug would like to be part of the whole country team so that he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an alliance that also cares for future generations and does not give one athlete in the fields.
At the same time, he recalled that the Union had given Northug both economic and other special rights for many years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb refuses to accept that one athlete has quite different rules than just because he's the best.
On Tuesday, Northug published his own release, where he assured his desire to be braved in Norwegian Springs next season in the world Cup as well as then in the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six MM medals, two of which were gold.
He was involved last winter in Falun's message cult in the winning team.
The day of the button-turner shall also be spent in the North Sea
On Thursday, 25 September, stamps are held in various restaurants and shops for which the Paisin translators' shield has been granted.
The goal of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of food skills and reduce the threshold for leaving the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, it is recalled that all high-level restaurants have not focused on the capital region, but on top restaurants controlled and classified by an impartial operator around Finland.
The international attention received by the event is an indication of the importance of the event as part of increasing the awareness of the thyroid conditions and the organisation.
In northern Finland the day is held in Vaasa, Vaasa, the restaurant is held in Fondi and Kantarelli.
In Kokkola, there's a restaurant in the Old Town.
The event has also received significant international attention.
It has been decided to do one of the most important international events in the organization, which will be held in different parts of the world during the same day.
Finland remains the host country of the event.
Kauhajoki-lehti: The establishment of the Kauhava reception centre for the Chancellor of Justice
The Finnish Immigration Service and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are working together to set up a refugee reception centre in the municipalities currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
According to the complaint, there is still a permanent location in the region of critical crisis-time infrastructure, which is used by defence forces and its partner, namely the Finnish Erillisnets Oy.
According to a private person, the placement of the reception centre in the same building package would constitute an important safety risk that has not been taken into account in the preparation of the case.
According to the complainant, the defence forces may have interests in the area of the former aviation school and the airport, whose impact has not been explained in the preparation of the reception centre.
The case states that, for the long-term field, negotiations have been held for the last two years on the organisation of flight training and on the outcome of any foreign operator to the airport.
It has been discussed, among other things, with Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (ps.) and Head of Defence Department, Arto Rädy.
A private person states to the Chancellor that the complaint is not a matter of principle opposition from the reception centre, but of the fact that the planned location in the former reserve area is wrong.
The city government of Kahavan handled the reception center case last Monday.
The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea Region
The management means that immigrants and those here need to have the necessary conditions, Niinist comments in the evening to journalists after meeting all the Presidents of the Parliamentary Party in Mänttyniemi.
According to the President, concerns about the management of the refugee situation were shared by all the participants.
He values the ability of government and opposition parties in Finland to discuss confidentially the underlying issues.
Especially in these times when we face major challenges
According to the Netherlands, the situation in Syria and Russia and the United States may also have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and, consequently, on the situation in the Baltic Sea region.
There is a desire for nobility in the development of dialogue.
If this situation develops in a positive way, i.e. the United States and Russia are able, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and still on the tension in the situation in the Baltic Sea.
According to the Nimista, NATO was also sidelined in the discussions.
The President did not take a position on the labour market.

Media researcher: Sipilta takes a huge risk
According to Sipil, many channels are needed for communication, and the Prime Minister's television and radio calls are one channel among others.
This channel of direct speech is also needed in the future.
This is not going to be the last time, Sipilä said to journalists in the Parliament.
The Sipil did not yet want to assess how often the prime minister’s television and radio phones would become.
According to the Sipil, talk may not always be transmitted in the future on Yle channels.
If other channels are reported as channel, then let's see.
Now we're using this channel tonight, Sipila said.
According to Sipil, the state of Finland's economy is so serious that it requires the provision of television and radio to the public.
This whole issue, which is now being discussed, is rather complex and requires a longer justification.
That's why we ended up in this canal, Sipili figured it out.
The speech will be sent at 21.05-21.20 both on TV1 and on Radio in Finland.
You can also look at it in Yle Areena.
Spil takes a big risk
The media scientist hopes that Sipilä's television phone will not tell us more about the government's inward turn.
Is it an effort to define a public debate more closely in your own hands and to refuse to discuss the questions of the public debate?
I remember the recent comment by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Timo) Soin that he did not follow the media agenda and let it not define himself.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope that these matters will not be linked.
The dog understands that commercial media has become nervous about Sipilä’s announcement.
It would be strange if the media field didn't react.
The communication styles of policy-makers are not about democracy.
It is for the media's representatives to be defined to seek that political agendas are not adopted.
According to the dawn, television is a major risk to Sipilä.
In his speech, there should be something new and special on the table in order to meet the exceptionally high expectations of the speech.
Is there more to offer today that we have already heard?
Or is he able to speak in a different way, in a different way, or would he say something new?
The dog says that if there is only more of the same old in the permit, it must be wondered why such a great gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
This is also a risk in the sense that it is not a special situation, but a routine speech among others.
The danger is that Yle is marked as a message of politicians or parliament and government, which is certainly not in line with Yle's interest or general policy.
Swirl-toe bet
What the Prime Minister leaves without saying is also important in the future speech, the media scientist stresses.
Tonight, we should look carefully at where Sipil is missing and where it is not, says Heikki Kuutt, research coordinator at the University of Jyväskylä.
According to the Six, the TV call is from Sipil's door for this to bring out its own view without the rings.
This is the case for the public without a journalistic filter, unlike at the press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The spark will pass the media and speak directly to the people.
However, the danger is that the media misinterprets the speech because there are no specific questions to ask.
According to the Six, it's very important to see how Sipil appears on TV... if there's any sweat in his hands.
He compares Sipil to the father figure, which now tells the people what to do.
If Sipila knows how to do it well, it can work.
The situation is different from that of the government to give information about something, because this is a person as if he speaks directly to another person.
This is what the President of the United States Barack is doing, Obama and its partners regularly.
Very exceptional
Political scientist Erkka Railo thinks the Prime Minister's speech to the public is very exceptional.
He said that it has not happened in decades that the Prime Minister is speaking directly to the people.
Exceptional time requires exceptional means, says Railo.
The researcher believes that the Prime Minister would like to make Finns so compassionate to the conflicts ahead.
The employees' organisations are organising protests and strikes against the government's actions on Friday.
On Twitter, the President of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, says that Sipilä could give his speech on the status of the nation in the Parliament as a statement by the Prime Minister, when the speech would also be discussed.
The President of the SDP Antti Rinne (sd.) again announces his challenge to Sipila's dialogue.
We don't have time for monologues.
It's about six months from the election.
You can't hide for the rest of the time, Rinne writes on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on a escape trip has been found in Tampere
The boy was fine at the time he was found.
The boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The Ministry of Justice of the Interior will also confirm the matter to the newspaper.
The boy left to play out at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later this evening, he was never contacted again.
Dad thanks all those people who helped him find him.
Thank you for these ten contacts and observations during these hours.
The update was divided closer to 15 000 times, which is an incredible balance in so short time
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed in the violent abuse of young people.
A sadistic freelancer, Makwan Amirkhani, published a video on Facebook, which appeals especially to young people from migrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani had to speak against young people's streetfights.
Amirkhani, who was born in Iran and who was five years old with his family in Finland, has won both his professional games in the most prestigious UFC series.
Amirkhani tells me that she received a message asking to look at an Instagram account.
Video has been downloaded to the account, where young people fight extremely violently.
Amirkhani tells me she's disappointed in the bullying of young people.
Amirkhan, 26 years old, has over 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys are kicking the ground, sitting on the other side, and hitting the eyelessly without thinking about any of these consequences that are caused by this when you make videos like this, Amirkhani updates.
It's hard to defend anymore
Some of the young people in the video have immigrant backgrounds.
According to the Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinonen, fighting videos on social media have been downloaded by both immigrants and young people from the heel.
Not to mention you're fighting on the street.
You make so many other immigrants' lives more difficult here in Finland, the Turkish Amirkhani reminds me.
Amirkhani recalls that Finland has sites that are looking for crimes committed by immigrants.
These individual cases have become very gross.
It's a little difficult, boys, to defend you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign country and you will be guests for quite a long time here.
That's a little different way to thank you for being here, Amirkhani says.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever end up being the target of some kind of racism, you'll have to blame yourself for it.
Now, think about it a couple of times before you go along with that, guys.
Amirkhani says that violent action is a contribution to racism.
You're making me hate that I don't like.
You've got things pretty bad anyway, and that's not gonna make you any better, Amirkhani.
SAK puts its position on the savings package - Lyly: decisions Monday
The president of SAK, Lauri Lyly, tells on Twitter that the wage organisation will consider its position on Monday on its alternative savings presented by STKK.
Lauuri Lyly commented on the STK's proposal on Twitter.
In the past Wednesday, STKI informed the government of its own proposal to achieve the 5% productivity gap required by Prime Minister Juha Sipila (medium).
Mr Fjäder, President of the Plan, believes that the government will accept the proposal if SAK, STKI and A scheme are all behind the proposal.
However, it would require the largest employee organisation SAK to soften its previous position.
Mr Lauri Lyly, president of the SAK, commented on the matter in brief on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAK Bureau will discuss this on Monday.
According to Lylyn, the SAK is looking for solutions to open the labour market lock and the need for agreements concluded by active parties on the basis of the forced laws.
Lyly points out that Prime Minister Sipilä's proposal for a social agreement was not acceptable to SAK.
The Sipils previously cut the negotiations on the social agreement when SAK refused to commit to the target of the 5% productivity gap.
Comment: High-defence threatens to choke, I think it's a little funny to put on a fist.
I think it's a little funny to put on a fist, if there's already a match paper in your pocket, then sign Pekka Tiinanen.
The tunnels vary from width to width in the employee camp.
Is it supposed to yell at the government or agree with it?
On Monday, the leaders of the SAKs will wipe out the sacred hatred for the government of the Republic.
The whole of Finland was threatened to shut down.
The threat spread to the deserts too.
OAJ threatened to close schools and day care centres.
On Tuesday, OAJ withdrew: no school or day care is completely closed.
On Wednesday, Antti Palola (sd), President of the STKT, was agreed.
He said that he had contacted the government and that he would draw up an alternative proposal for a 5% productivity block, which was required by Prime Minister Juha Sipila (medium).
Mr Fjäder (Kok) has immediately called on him to state that his piece of paper is already ready.
At first, the SAK office didn't belong in the yard.
President Lauri Lylyn (sd) is difficult to deal with when the allies on Monday were asked to put the country on Friday.
Finally, however, Lyly announced that the SAK Bureau would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAK would seek solutions to open up the labour market lock.
In order to create a joint proposal for employees, the SAK should be inclined to accept the 5% productivity gap as a target.
There is no wonder that Palola STTK has relations in order with the Sipilian government.
The right hand of the Palola, Jukka Beauty, director of the social impact of the STKK, used to act as special assistant of the Central Prime Ministers Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi.
So Palola described the government's ay-knowledge has been improved all the time.
Sattumaa or no, but Palola's exit took a bit of a clean off the Finnish standouts, which, as a pinshot, were strangled by the ACP Marko Pirate (sd).
I think it's a little funny to put on a fist if there's already a match paper in your pocket.
modified at 18.00: Added information on Lylyn's comments.
Russia called Finland a bad host: \"This must not happen again. \"
The President of the Russian duuma, Mr Sergei Naryshkin, criticised the Helsinki OSCE meeting.
Mr Sergei Naryshkin, the President of the Russian duuma, said Mongolia is better than Finland.
In the capital city of Mongolia, Uran Bator, the guilty court of the Parliamentary Assembly of Etyj, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the Helsinki July festival.
At that time, Finland did not allow the arrival of Russian politicians, such as Naryshkin, who had been forced by the European Union, to attend a meeting - a matter from which the President would remind journalists.
In our view, it was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, according to Naryshkin's pressurised news agency Interfax.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticism was addressed to the United States, where his access had also been blocked.
Sanctions are political suicide from the EU, Naryshk declared.
Mongolia's Russian delegation got complicated, so Naryshkin continued to hide Finland by complimenting and thanking Mongolia's different organisation.
I am sure that the Parliamentary Assembly will go constructively and with the most positive results - unlike the meeting held in Helsinki in July.
The leadership of Mongolia understands that parliamentary dialogue does not involve obstacles.
Naryshkin has met with Ilkka Kanervan (kok) who, according to the Russian media, has already discussed the Russian delegation.
The lock meets the real playoff section:
Tappara and Luku continue today in Hakamets for bully days when both are in fire on the second consecutive day.
Janne Lahti predicts that today's Hakamets is not a real goal party.
Tappara went to Kuopio last night, digging for a 3-time profit from KalPa.
The rise was a manly one, for last season's silver group was at its worst in the defeat of two goals.
The lock on the title was more than just a lot more successful.
Blues, a regular guest of the peaceful prey, was round zero points, and loss figures were also 2-3.
Hard game, paints tight, if any of them play the same game as last year, Luk-eatingr Janne Lahti predicts the settings on the company's pages.
Tappara has formed quite a playoff button for the rams.
In fact, in the last two years, Tappara has just dropped out of the final series of Luko.
On both occasions, a decisive seventh race has been required.
In the last season, Luku took the series to a quarter of the game, but Tappara rose up in the next three parallels and passed.
There are no major changes in group compositions except paint defects.
Both of the soldiers who fought last night will be able to get their sister-in-law today.
With the killer's goal, Mika Noronen makes room for Tomi Karhus, and between the plugs Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolsk.
Sight angle: A terrible play is happening in the voice
The Director-General of Sports, Katila, handed the chief coach to Rautakallio an inappropriate extension, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976 Sylvester Stalone hand-printed Rocky film where he himself played the main part.
The underprivilegator was sensationally placing a heavy series for the world champion Apollo Creed.
Rocky got a big sympathy, even though he finally lost the title match.
Thirty years after Rocky's first night, Mika Lumula handed to Pori the restless ashtray.
A nameless and wooden baker made it possible for all to be astonished to the SM-finals in 2006.
The team was full of anonymous but tough underprivilegers like Rocky.
It was White Indian, Porin Matta and Pele Pelto.
In the drop-off games, players dyed their heads red and cut the irony.
Hope became a blonde.
JP Jalo called Coach Neumann.
The ace took the won silver.
The hope was one of the heroes.
The writer hopes that the novelty of this season will work in the same way as ten years ago.
The man who works as the leader of the father's sports activities has built a piece of shit for the bad guys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been rotting garbage in the remote, like Rocky pig feeds at the slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholman and Matti Kuparinen are in some other way than to play in a hot game.
The hope has forgotten that in Rocky VI, the main part is to present the Pega Rautakallio.
Karri Stone has crossed the Iron Union with Sean Connerjek.
Rautakallio is writing in Rocky the same clumsy as Connery would have been in the original of 1976.
There's nothing left in the Iron Rocky except a nickname.
The philosophy of the Iron Curtain is not part of the routing and pygmy.
He appreciates a tough game, but it's a different thing to play hard than a pig.
In the last season, the Essien Garrett Stafford took your jacket to the head of the Tapparan Jere Karjalainen.
He got 2+10 minutes from the judges, but Rautakallio put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
All we have is those who deserve.
I will not accept such a game and it will not belong to an assieke, a hot Rautakallio woke up after the game to the people of Satanus.
This season's team is strangely built.
There's jocks, vets, cops, and cranberrys.
There are no key players in the game age in practice.
No wonder the head coach has complained about the skill shortage.
How much have you been able to influence player procurement, Pega Rautakallio?
The events of the last season have an impact on procurement, and unfortunately the situation on the market was rather narrow, and Rautakallio was diplomatically responsible.
I'll take a ride.
In 1953 Rautakallio is known to be interested in moving to the place of hopela to be a sports bomb.
Men's contracts end in the spring.
The noise balance in the three leagues of the season has as many losses with goal difference 1-6.
The hope would not have been in favour of the script.
Olga Temone plays Sipe Santapuk's mother
Olga Temone reveals that if he had met his husband as a teenager in Tuuka, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temone plays for the first time in the direction of his husband.
Yeah, I play my husband's friend's mom in the movie.
In a way, it seems crazy, actor and producer Olga Temone laugh.
He has been married to Apulanna ex-bassist and director Tuukka Temose since 2008.
The couple's done a lot of work together before, but for the first time Olga plays Tuuka.
The role of Olga in the early years of Apulanta is the drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother Sirkka.
Sirkka tsemppa and supports his son, although his father Risto (who present Lorenz Backmann) tries to be a sound of reason.
The more I've known my true example of Sirka, the easier it seems to play a role.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me with a role.
Olga had already met Sirka before the film project, but after that, the twin has been very close.
They've met, talked on the phone, and they've communicated.
The circus has helped a lot.
We've been through a lot of different angles in their history.
Sirkka also realizes that drama is drama and the truth may need to be a little colored.
Olga stresses that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that Apula will become the largest band in Finland.
In the '90s, there was a recession and a real duck.
It was quite a small probability that someone would really succeed, but Sirka had some kind of initiative, and he was right.
Olga tells us that he had heard a lot from Tuuka about this youth even before filming.
However, the parents’ stories have sometimes been a little different.
Yeah, if you're 15 years old, how much older do you really know what you're up to?
Olga reveals that his own youth was completely different from Tuuka, known as Heinola’s evil story.
Olga was an arch and a nice girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
At the top, he could've had a secret crush.
According to Olga, in 10 years he has worked so hard with Tuuka that a large joint project does not scare.
Everything's always been a super-good.
Now, the entire production team will be leaving for a month to describe Heinola.
However, because of their small children, a couple living in ancient Israel often plans to drive home for the night, because the distance is not too long.
We'll take over the entire Heinola for the month.
They have taken us very warmly, asking only what streets and when they will be empty.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive play movie in Finland
Timo Vuorensola directed by Iron Sky: The Come Race is a budget of EUR 17 million.
The descriptions start in October in Belgium.
The director, Timo Vuoreensola, begins shooting the Iron Sky 2 film in Belgium in October.
Scientific film of Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Come Race, will become the most expensive play movie of all time in Finland with its budget of EUR 17 million.
The title of the most expensive film in Finland has been in Jalmar Helander Big Gam.
The Angry Birds animation, which is being carried out, will also be passed by Iron Sky 2, as the film budget is over €100 million.
Timo Vuorensola directed and film produced by Tero Kaukoma begins in October near Antwerp, and lasts eight weeks.
The director Timo Vuorensola leaves for Belgium next week.
I'm not afraid of the left-over budget.
I've been so sick!
I have such a relaxing file about scripting, because I know exactly what a movie should be like.
Everyone in the working group seems to realize that they're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited, and I can't wait to show this movie to the audience, and he's telling the newspaper.
Originally, 8-10 million were planned for the film budget, but the budget also increased as the script was developed.
The budget's big, but there's a big stop.
However, 100 million people would get stuck in the film, because each angle and efficiency is so expensive.
Now everything's been shattered so tight that there's no loose ends.
Today, the film production company Iron Sky University launched a mass finance campaign and a crowd loan, which will be paid at 4-8% per annum.
The final interest rate will be determined by demand and supply during the campaign.
In the last two years, the company will pay the loan back.
Among other things, Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov play a role in this film.
Juntt or cool?
Big logos return to shirts
The breasts of the TRendsets have recently decorated large logos.
A while ago, a fashionable dresser avoided clear and big logos like Crocs in his console.
The advertising of a hooder or a T-shirt was seen as some kind of juntist.
But times change.
Sport has become the right megadradrend of the fashion, and so are the old, familiar sports symbols such as Adidas and Nike.
And like so often before, a funny and trendy limit is horrific: if something is already right, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm Core trend, i.e. the tavismot, where the trendsters surprised by favouring as boring as possible basic clothes as possible.
Now, instead of the grey base collegiate, we're going to have to put on the girdle that's buried on the bottom of the cabinet, before which the manufacturer's logo is commanded.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to the logos, for example, Adidas' identifying track curtains, the game shirts for the favorite team and the New York Yankees flags have made a return to street fashion.
For starters, the Calvin Klein logos are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands.
For example, Versace's breasts make it clear what kind of clothing it is.
Would you be willing to present logos in your dress?
The Russian politician published evidence: I didn't get stuck in a tank hole!
According to the claims, a special incident would have happened in Nizhni Tagil, where Russia Arms Expo, which presented products from the Russian military industry, was held in 2015.
In the recent days, the Russian media has spread colourful arguments that the Russian Ministry of Emergency was forced to remove from the large-scale gas hole in Zotovia for five hours.
Zotov has done all he can to deny the information.
Even on his own public Facebook site, he published a picture of the opening of the armor vehicle in a very good atmosphere, and not at least on the basis of their images, it's not about jugging or kissing.
It's all nonsense.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go into a combat tanks car, it was a front-run armor wagon BMP-3.
I'm a former soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel, I've served on Ural.
I went in there, I looked around, and I came out alone, and Zotov said Komosomolskaya to Pravda.
I wasn't stuck, and I really didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
On the TV channel of the Russian army, Zotov explained at his exhibition the new Russian technology as he himself was a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what's inside the wagons, and I wanted our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I went to all the tanks.
And also at the next show, I will definitely visit all tanks and all the assault tanks, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the editor a fool.
One fool wrote, and everyone else repeated.
There was nothing like that.
I went inside and came out.
I'm tall and rusty, but nothing like being stuck in a tank, didn't happen, he said to Russkaja Sluzhba's novosteii radio.
Zotov's words support the fact that no photographs of the alleged Judas have been published, even though during a few days a total of 50,000 people attended the arms exhibition.
The claim that Zotov's chat started with the Bloknot.ru website, where Zotov was told of his extremities as he tried and finally threatened to shoot everyone around, unless he gets out of the coating.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up discussion where the exhibition organisers told them what happened.
All of them are used to the rapid jump out of armored vehicles.
But Congressman Zotov, because of his big composition, was simply delayed when he came out.
But he did not sit in it for five hours, said the exhibition coordinator Alexandr Pisarevski Bloknot.

The mines of the Canadian mining company Agnico Eagle Finland have been leaked.
The purified process water for gold mines has leaked from the so-called enrichment sandal to its well.
According to the company, measures have been taken to correct the bleeding.
At Altaa is neutralized by the foaming process, the enriched sand and purified process water.
In general, water is injected either as a re-use water or as an authorisation, through the surface lighting field, into the environment.
The rate was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was observed.
According to the company, the quality of leak water meets the current permit conditions.
The rest of the matter didn't hurt the environment.
The year was observed during the verification round on Monday morning.
No structural damage has been observed in the building structure of the pool.
The company reports that it will cooperate closely with the authorities to monitor and correct the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Danski Kuoppamäki: IMF warns against cutting too much
The Finnish country report, published today by the IMF, is largely following the views of the government and the Ministry of Finance.
The organisation fled structural reforms covering Finland in order to overcome economic problems.
According to the IMF, reducing overtime and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed for the whole contract system and for unemployment security.
According to Pasi Kuoppämä, the Danske Bank’s main object is to agree on structural reforms, but there are also small differences.
The IMF estimates a great deal of accompanying message for government action, but on the other hand there is also a warning about what should not be too cut off.
These include, for example, infrastructure investments, Kuoppamäki says to the Economic Sanctuary.
In the opinion of the IMF, growth projects would also be in favour of implementing as soon as possible in order to support weak economic growth.
The IMF anticipates economic growth of 0.4% in Finland for this year, which is rising to 0.9% next year.
Danske is predicting today that today's new industry forecast will continue to grow this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic this year.
They may have been at the bottom of the latest findings.
This morning, Statistics Finland reported that total production was in the summer of small growth, Kuopoväki says.
Less attention has been given to the weakened confidence in industry or to other so-called softer measures.
However, there are only a few percent of decimals involved.
Nintendo, who recovers from death, appointed the new leader
In July, under the responsibility of Satoru Iwata, worked at Tatsumi Kimishima, who started his work on Wednesday, Nintendo told me on Monday.
Iwata led Nintendo since 2002 and he was popular and charismatic in the face of the game industry.
Iwata, for example, responded to a successful Wii-konsol hip-station.
The choice of a 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names raised as possible followers of Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice for monitoring Iwata's footprints, evaluates Ace Research analyst Hidek Yasuda Reuters.
It is the task of Kimishima to see that Nintendo is strongly involved in mobile games, but so that it does not eat the company's bread on the side of traditional game consoles.
There will be more and more asylum seekers in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Immigration Office acknowledged that even hundreds of children who have come to the country disappear annually.
Among other things, SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter, according to the Swedish Immigration Office, have reported that hundreds of minors are lost annually in the country.
The Inspector of the Finnish Immigration Service Juha Kannelmaa tells us what the situation is in Finland and how it has changed.
Is the same situation in Finland?
How many applicants disappear in less than - a year? - A total of 156 asylum applications were made in Finland in 2013 alone.
They disappeared nine.
In 2014, similar applications were made in 196, and 11 of them disappeared in Kannelmaa reports.
In the context of the disappearance, it can be found that the applicant is already registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and may be found to be full age there.
In such cases, the applicant may be more attractive to disappear than to continue processing the matter in Finland and to be returned to the responsible country.
Similarly, a part of the missing persons will be found later when they seek asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were total 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of whom 134 applications were made on the grounds that the applicant was likely to have moved away from Finland, so adults lost their asylum seekers during the last 123 years, he says.
Is there any growth?
By 6.9 this year, we have received a total of 586 asylum applications, which came alone.
The total statistics on minors lost this year are not yet available, but the number of minors is known and has grown clearly, which is likely to affect the number of lost persons, he stresses.
What happens to those who have decided to turn?
They are also lost to the labour market, for example:
This is difficult to assess by the Finnish Immigration Service, as the police, who is responsible for implementing the conversion decisions, stressed.
The Minister of Interior Petter Orpo (kok) has been concerned about the growing number of non-registered country seekers.
He's taken action on this.
At the EU Home Affairs Council, Orpo asked about refugee issues on Monday about practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to Northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen sells Timo T.A. studio online - see pictures of devices
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkosen for TV and radio production is now on sale because of the disease scene.
Mikkonen's spouse Nina Mikonen sells equipment in Huuto.net, which was once the most advanced professional equipment in his field.
The first time I told you about the online announcement was the evening mascot.
Today, much of the equipment has remained in the feet of technological development.
In the digital media world, TV programs are no longer described for the Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is still confident that there are interested parties.
Of course, the equipment is no longer up-to-date, but these are needed as long as there is an old generation of material that needs to be digitised.
On the other hand, there are a lot of amateurs - collectors and developers of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen thought about IS.
The reason for the sale is that Mikkos is trying to move away from the current Myrskylä's home.
There's no way we can take all the supplies with us.
I've started to invent and see where the goods are being disposed of.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There is no longer any use for television and radio equipment.
It is clear that a man who has a long career will no longer return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only supplies and equipment are sold.
Timo T.A. Mikkosen’s actual life work was archived already in the summer to the National Audiovisual Institute, which was held by representatives in a box store to pick up films and other materials from Myrskyla.
Traffic threatens to go down worse than you think: Metro and trams can stop all Friday
The metro and track wagon drivers decide today whether they will expand their efforts in connection with Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to stop the metro and rail wagon traffic only for Friday's demonstration of mind.
In the afternoon, you'll find out if the traffic stops all day.
Chief Inspector Pega Hirvonen says that the threat is great on the field.
Night and daytime surgery is a big challenge for drivers, so the government plans to cut the flowers raise opposition.
However, it is a kind of dilemma that has been considered by Hirvonen to stop traffic all day.
If the metro and rail wagons stand on Friday, public transport will be almost completely stopped in the capital region.
According to the VR data, trains do not travel on Friday between dawn and night.
On Friday nights, there's no road or long distance traffic.
Trains leaving before dawn will be driven to destination.
According to the HSL data, most of the buses remain in the shadow.
The members of the ACP will be absent from work on Friday at 3:00 p.m. to Saturday morning at 3:00 p.m.
Probably a small number of buses can be driven, driven by superior, HSL informant Pirkko Repo is charged.
Repo says that HSL can't say exactly what bus shifts are going on Friday.
The employees' organisations organise a major demonstration on the Helsinki Rautatientori Friday from 11 to 13 p.m.
Aftonbladet: Hungarian police used tear gas against refugees
The Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident took place at the Hungarian and Serbian border, where many refugees are trying to move forward in Europe, reports the news office AP.
According to Sky News, refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of whom were women and children, fled in panic.
According to local media, the Hungarian police would also have used water guns against people.
The Muslim boy was arrested at the school in Texas. The teacher thought he was a bomb.
In the United States, Texas, 14-year-old Ahmed Mohammed has been arrested since the teacher considered the clock he brought to school as a bomb.
Mohammed told Dallas Morning News that he wanted only to introduce his electronics experience in output.
One of the teachers, however, considered the clock just looking like a bomb.
The police were invited to appear, and the situation finally ended with the boy being taken to the youth detention cell in handrails.
Mohammed has never been found to have claimed anything but that he had made the clock.
Yet, it is still possible for him to be accused of making a false bomb.
According to Mohammed, the police said that the clock had been shown by a film bomb.
The clock is in police custody, but it was made up of a circuit board and a digital display that had leadership between them.
The incident occurred last Monday and Mohamed was punished by three days of forced leave from school.
His father is upset about the case and the American-Islamic Council in the country is considering whether the case is another indication of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain meets - Director Labour refused to sing national song
In song, God is being asked to protect the queen, but Corby is a opponent of monarchy.
Corbyn’s own own labour party’s representatives have also joined the criticism presented by an omnipotential press.
This has hurt the people, thought of the labur-citizen Kate Green public radio company in the BBC radio interview.
Green thought that Corbyn should have joined the song.
Last night's Memorial event respected the battle of British Airmen's pilots against Germany's Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party defends Corby in its official opinion and stresses the respect he has shown for pilots by taking part in the event.
We are all in enormous gratitude for the heroism of royal Air Force pilots.
He (Corbyn) stood with respect in the course of the national song, the opinion was highlighted.
Corbyn's choice as party leader has divided the lines of the labour.
In particular, there are those who fear him to escape moderate voters with his radical views.
Corby is in favour of unilateral armament, ending savings and increasing public expenditure.
For the first time today, Mr Corbyn is to be present in Parliament at the Question Time of the Prime Minister.
Corby has asked the public for suggestions on what should be asked of Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron was on Twitter for the weekend to pick Corbyn as a party manager.
The Labour Party is threatening our national security, our economic security and the safety of our families, and the Prime Minister has quoted it in his own account.
The reason for a family death in Minnesota was still unclear - the family's father was waiting for a case.
South Lake Mintonka's police have been investigating the family death of Minnesota Greenwood for a week.
The five - breathed family was found dead on September 10th and a few days later the police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family Brian Scott Short, 45.
When he first shot his wife and three children Brian Short killed himself in the garage.
Days spent dead
The family was found after the school was concerned about the absence of children.
According to this announcement, the police went to the house and found a huge house on the other side of Short's family dead.
According to StarTribune, it is possible that the victims had been dead for days.
Millions of houses and successful companies
The investigation of the South Lake Mintonka Police Chief, Michael Siair, is still ongoing.
The motive for blood vessels is still unclear.
The shooter Brian Short was a successful entrepreneur and he had created his property for nurses on the dedicated social media site of AllNurses.com.
In 2014, at StarTribune's interview, Short told us that there are four million different visitors on the site per week.
I've been made up of 50 purchases from the company over the last ten years.
I've abandoned all of them.
But I still have a lot of ideas that I want to do.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
The success was seen, among other things, by the fact that Short's family bought a hulpe house from Greenwood in 2011.
The house is advertised as a dream on the real estate website in Zillow: there are not only 12 rooms in the house, but also eight garages.
Court proceedings on the ground
But according to StarTribune, the family's father was waiting for a case.
Achieve Test Prep, offering various pre-op courses, had challenged him for comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prepin, comments were not deleted from Short's website and therefore they had lost customers to their competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a significant impact on Short's business.
Vesku Loir offered cake coffee
In addition, the owner's coin was awarded at the Finnish Hippos month horse owners' prize.
This is great, Lorir commented in a good mood on his honour board.
The celebrated Factory Duo won Derby's first Saturday and earned EUR 100 000.
The artist legend Loiri was still confused with the success of Fabrice Duo in the grand competition.
I still don't think it's happened.
According to Loir, the rescue horse coach Korpi gets a full-time job with a horse.
The blade will be set and will decide where the horse will be taken to compete.
And I'm gonna shut my mouth, Loir's laughing.
The amazing gesture from the NHL star, the greatest athlete gift ever made.
The Montreal Canadiens Superstar P. K. Subban has donated ten million dollars (about 6.7 million) to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to the medical report, this is the biggest single donation by the athlete of all time to charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban is committed to helping the hospital for the next seven years.
A year ago, Subban and Canadiens signed an agreement worth $8 years and $ 72 million.
Therefore, Subban’s donation amount is significantly higher than his annual budget of $9 million.
Subba will receive the lobbying space from the hospital as a reward for his donation.
The Canadians' players have before helped significantly local hospitals.
A year ago, long-term Captain Jean Beliveau collected millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, and Saku Koivu collected a huge amount of money for the other city's big hospital to receive the PET scanner needed for cancer studies.
The Japanese coffee shop can order a wife for the night, serving only the bikinis and the essu on her head.
The theme cafés are tough in Japan.
The market already has a goat coffee shop, a cinnamon coffee shop, a vampire coffee shop, a fish coffee shop, and now a coffee shop.
It's hitting on lonely, socialized, and hungry.
It's about Metro.
The Tokyo Ore no Yome (My wife) coffee shop can be ordered for a wife or husband's night.
It's a waitress who pretends to be a client's spouse.
\"Puoliso\" is chosen from the list before the coffee shop arrives, and he prepares and serves food.
The wife is just an essus and a bikini on her head, while the husband is in tight cycling shorts.
The website offers all the information about the length and weight of the wife’s candidates at all times, with what kind of pillow they prefer to sleep.
Soon 150 million vehicles have been connected to the network: they began to equip themselves with attacks against car security
The Automobile Security Review Board (ASRB) will also support technological developments and innovation in the sector, and Intel's release reports will be discussed.
The panel is composed of top security experts across the world.
ASRB researchers will carry out continuous safety tests and inspections aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel published the first version of best practices in cybersecurity.
The company will continue to update the report on the basis of ASRB's research results.
The international ICT research and consultation company Gartner estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles in transport have been connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own security on the road.
According to the same estimate, 60-75% of these vehicles can spend, create and share online data.
We can and we must improve car cybersecurity, says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
With the help of ASRB, Intel can establish best safety practices and support the view that cyber security is an important element in the design of every vehicle connected to the network.
Few things are more personal than our own security on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovations in data processing.
Ford Focus RS costs about EUR 52 000 in Finland!
Fordin Focus RS has been expected for years as the six rising.
Finally, the car starts to be around in Finland.
Ford published the RS data now that the eyes of the car world are at the Frankfurt auto exhibition.
Due to Ford's new four-wheel RS, its 2.3-litre, 350 horse-power engine has a maximum speed of 266 km per hour in 4.7 seconds.
The price is also interesting for Finland, initially it is said to be EUR 52 000.
The car is now available, though, when the first cars arrive in Finland, Ford does not tell in his newsletter.
The favourite mark Kia presented two news in the Frankfurt auto exhibition - such as the new Sportage and Optima
Finland is certainly more important than two new ones, the new fourth generation Sportage, which Kia intends to capture from the ever-growing street-stamping markets of the larger wing.
The new European design leader Gregory Guillaume, created by the new European design leader, is more round than ever.
There's been a cent in between axles and external dimensions, and the car's going to crack the air more efficiently.
The engine range is largely unchanged, but has been added to the 1.6-litre turbo to develop 177 horse power.
More Kia Sportage and its performance and consumption are reported closer to sales.
We'll have to wait a little longer, because we have a new Sportage coming in spring 2016.
Even before the year between, our country got the new Kia Optimats.
Suddenly, the news doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a whole new car.
It intends to conquer the hearts of the upper middle class buyers with even better driving features, lower noise levels and higher equipment.
At the beginning, Optims with 1,7-litre turbodiesel and 2,0-litre petrol engines are available.
Next summer, the pace will grow when Optima GT comes next to them with a 2.0-litre turbojet.
In the same time, it starts selling Optima Farm.
Chisu returned to the stage... ..with a bold hammer suit.
The singer Chisu is involved in the Life for a child concert with other domestic stars.
The electric pants have to look like an open neck hole.
The apartment presents a beautiful singer star's belt.
The size of the crown is the gold metal belt and the red lips.
During a three - year break, a singer who became mother has been strung with light movement and yoga.
Chisu's daughter will be filling in for a year.
The singer published his first single album in August.
After a long break, I'm not really excited to get back on the stage and get up front of the public.
It's been a shame to do everything about music, the singer tells me.
Chisu will publish a new album in a couple of weeks, while his fourth album is called Polaris.
The new situation in life has inspired us to make new pieces.
At this point, I wonder if people will find my new album, Chisu will think.
Kim Kardashian's mother's style of obsessive resembling... now it's visible in the chest.
The true-tv beauty, Kim Kardashian, will give talks for one another.
He presents his pregnant wife and bra in sexy clothes, last night at one American time when he left Kourtney Kardashian with his sister, husband, Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent at the front of the breasts.
It reveals the colourful bras under the dress when flashed with lightning lights.
The last time Kardashian was dressed as an amatsonish maternity home when she visited her friend at dinner parties in New York just a few days ago.
The department was emphatically emphatically embroidered by black extrapolates.
The third special maternity home is as fresh as last week's Friday, when the presentation was about to get pregnant.
The tough laws of the model world: No home, you're lonely, competition is terrible
The top model Mano Leloup wanted the idea that the model world would be pure glamour and champagne party.
He made his own documentary Speaking Dolls, where Leloup and his colleagues speak their mouths purely of model business.
The Harpeer's Bazaar magazine brought together the six tough truth behind the scenes of Leloup.
Every symphony starts out of nowhere.
Even if in the previous season you were living in top designers, the new season will begin again with Castings.
And every season there will be new, fresh faces that compete for work with them.
Models rarely have a place to call home.
The work is continuing to travel and can also take a year so that there is a hotel room or apartment where fashion houses can accommodate their models.
If you are very young and your mother can't travel along with you, loneliness can be inextricably difficult.
New York and Paris are the desired jobs, but they are the most stressful of all.
There's only one kind of legality.
Agent New York may ask you to drop the pounds, but in Paris they say you're too thin.
Getting a job is a risk game all the time.
The designs and designers work together all the time, while operating as a support network.
When the fashions end, the difference is bad.
The models want this sector to be able to offer it, but they are so pale that everyone thinks the job is just a presentation of clothes.
The models also want to be their own person.
Work makes models feel like they're actors with a role.
But in the work of the model, you can also express yourself.
You were modeling last night at Tory Burch's show.
New York is currently celebrating fashion weeks where designers will reveal their model for next year.
Roope Salminen, who moved into the style, presents the most unknown Abitant Musicist in the movie
Roope Salminen presents an Antti Lautala, the founder member of the band, in a film based on early years.
In 1991, Lautala established Apulanta with Toni Wirtase, but resigned from the band in 1994.
It's a pretty big challenge for me because I'm about to 26-year-old rap artist, and in this movie I'm going to present a 16-year-old guitarist, Salminen laughs.
I haven't wanted to meet the real Antti before the shoots because I want to make him my own interpretation.
Antti is clearly the most unknown to people, so I think it's just good that I'm just teaching her playing style from video.
I don't want to make an impression of a human being.
A man who trusts the Roope Salminen and the Dogs is not going to play a role.
The punk engineers come with a man naturally.
The stars, the stars in the punk section, I'm sure many people saw the first taste, as well as if they've ever been to our gigs.
Our performance has never been anything small, but we always go full.
In 1993-2004, the main performers of the beautiful film Tukka Temose was announced today.
A nuclear force known to the public by the band is yet to be presented to the general public by quite unknown young actors.
Rumple Sipe Santapukki presents Teppo Manner, a singer from Toni Wirta Tatu Sinisalo basist Tuukka from Temoa Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint of his future plague last night when he mysteriously told him in Snapchat to prepare for the most important day of his career.
Roope has already published in Instagram yesterday a picture of the new one he has had to carry out for the film.
Roope, who was previously seen in the figs and jaws, has driven his face to silopous, and dyed his brown hair to black.
Psychologist counsels: This is how you tell children about refugees
Many parents have been wondering in recent days how to tell the child about the situation of refugees seeking Europe.
Or is it worth telling you at all?
There is no need to talk about this by force, a member of the SPR crisis group, a psychologist, Fernando Garoff advises.
Smaller children should be helped to protect, for example, not to allow them to watch the news alone.
Little children are not always able to understand what they see, and it can stay in the sense of and distress, he says.
However, if a child has encountered or heard about the refugees on TV news, it is worth talking about.
It is good to visit the child’s starting points and listen carefully to what he asks.
The fear of a child may be surprising.
They may not be the ones that the parents think he is afraid of.
You don't have to be afraid of him, even if he'd be harassing himself and scaring himself.
A smaller child closely monitors the behaviour of his parents.
If parents themselves remain calm during the conversation, the child will also experience safety.
Larger children are likely to run into a conversation about refugees at school, with friends or online.
It is good for parents to talk to them about this if they think about it.
The fact is, all people in the world are not doing well.
The parents, together with the children, can wonder how our family views this.
In the end, however, do we feel that the world is a safe or secure place?
Parents may also have different aspects of education - some may want to protect their children from anxiety as far as possible.
On the other hand, if the family is also talking about difficult things, the child will have a model on how to deal with the difficulties that arise in life.
This could be useful for him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: “You need to teach your child to help the weaker.
At the end of your powers?
But you can still be a good parent to your child
Hard to control the blood-stamping Pallosalamaa
Perttu Pohjola got to sneak the Apila Pallosalama into the middle of the attack.
It only reduced the profits and the second seasons until at the end of July in Tampere, a collapse occurred.
Because the slave was just in the bottom, the coach suspected something was wrong and ordered a safe deposit from the vet for a while.
The explanation for the step-by-step was made clear in the alphabet.
The horse had a sore throat infection.
The disease was not the easiest way out of the world, but it required two courses of medicine to suffocate it.
As Apila Pallosalama had to be in a light motion, Pohjola says that he was welcome to the last run of the surprised horse.
It was in Turku at the record time, after another SE plant Taruntull.
Apila Pallosalama was very pressured from the hive when it could have been run normally for just a few weeks.
Those things at the end of the little bending of attention were understandable, says Pohjola.
The coach assumes that proper competition made the Ori sharp.
The horse must have moved on from it, and I hope it would have been even better off.
Apilan Pallosalama has been so-called humorous.
After not enjoying it, it could have been a fat guy without the sick.
On a good day, however, the Ori have been dissatisfied by such a mystery that the opponents have been wonderful.
At the speed of action, the competitors are not able to reach Pallosalama, who can even get rid of warm-blooded rides.
There's a mirror run in Vermo's wishes at the North Pole.
However, the different thing is how Apila Pallosalama agrees.
It's kind of hard to get out of here at the time of the departure, and it might be under the boom of the departure car and that kind of thing.
I hope the Ori would be more calm now than Turun's leaving.
Apilan Pallosalama is also able to come out of the bow while he is in order, and we will go out to win it, Coach's permission.
This is why you can't get rid of the bad iPhone software.
Tim Cook, CEO of Apple.
At least some of the programs that come with Apple's iPhone phones may sometimes be removed in the future, but not all of them.
Perhaps in the future, Apple intends to remove some of its own iPhone phones, says Tim Cook Buzzfeed, CEO of the company.
There are a number of programs on Apple's iPhone that are relatively rarely used: FaceTime calls, Journalism, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Vinks come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is Apple Watch, which became forced on iPhone phones, even though it is only necessary for Apple's smart watch owners.
Cook says the removal of Apple's programmes is more complicated than it seems on the top.
Some applications are linked to another iPhone.
If they are removed, it can cause problems somewhere else on the phone, Cook will tell Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which Apple iPhone applications work permanently together with other programs.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So with time, I think we can develop a way to allow the user to remove them, Cook added.
So, according to Cook, Apple is looking into it, because the company does not want to waste memory on users' iPhone phones.
inflation in the euro area went down to 0.1% in August
In August, consumer prices in the euro area rose only slightly, i.e. 0.1 per cent of the year-on-year, Eurostat reported today.
The rise in prices slowed down the decline in energy.
In this way, Eurostat revised the estimates of 0.2% a few weeks ago, slightly downwards.
In July, inflation rate was 0.2%.
The so-called base inflation fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat's estimates for basic inflation were 1.0 per cent.
Energy in the euro area last month was 7.2 per cent cheaper than one year ago.
The average inflation rate in the EU over the whole 28 countries was zero in August.
In July, the rise was 0.1 per cent.
The highest number of euro countries, i.e. 1.4 per cent of consumer prices, rose in August in Malta.
In Cyprus, inflation was lowest at 1.9 per cent.
In Finland, inflation was 0.2% minus the EU harmonised price index.
The inflation of the euro area continues to be very far from the objective of the European Central Bank (ECB), which is the rise in prices of two per cent in the medium term.
The ECB predicts an average inflation rate of 0.1% for this year for the euro area.
Next year, the rise will be up to 1.1%, and the central bank will predict its new inflation forecasts announced at the beginning of September.
The U.S. Fed's next attempt to blackmail monetary policy
The next US recession will begin at its speeds in less than a year, but more definitely within three years after the country’s central bank, Fed will start again for a long time to raise interest rates.
And in the financial markets, the deficit begins before the next recession.
Fed has indicated that he may have started interest purchases this week and at the latest by the end of the year.
The next recession can therefore be hit at its fastest by next autumn and as a financial market rate before.
Or at least this happens if the world's largest economy and financial markets work the way they've been doing, and if they're responding to the blackmail of Fed's money, as they've done before.
Such conclusions have led to the conclusion of the German Bank Deutsche Bank’s London Market Research Strategys Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker in its extensive long-term market and economic research.
The Bank distributed more than 60 pages of Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international major customers last week.
The strategies drawn up by the study and the report do not believe that they know exactly when Fed will begin to raise interest rates or what will happen in the economy and the market.
On the other hand, they present, through the cool facts and calculations of economic statistics, how the economy and markets have behaved in the past and after Fed’s interest rates.
In addition to historical findings, they will look at the key variables of the economy and the financial markets, which are now the same or another model as at the time of previous interest rates, and what might be the result.
It is clear that both the economy and the financial markets are now in a mucher position to endure the increase in interest rates than once before in the 1950s.
The beginning of the recovery may not be a year.
Fed's monetary policy and its officials have been determined by the leaders over the last summer and the beginning of the year, suggesting that time is beginning to be mature to raise interest rates.
The first deposit for over nine years may be due this week.
The matter will be resolved within the middle week and Thursday, when the so-called open market committee of the Fed Executive Board is meeting to decide on this matter at its two-day meeting.
For the previous time, Fed raised his so-called Fed Funds’ governance rate in June 2006.
At the same time, the relatively regular but at the same time a series of interest rates of a small 0,25 percentage points ended for Fed to raise his interest from 1.25 % to 5.25 %.
The symptom of the financial market began in 2007 from the difficulties of the US's most risky housing funding, and one year later the financial crisis was a worldwide judge day nightmare.
A major recession occurred in 2009.
Last time, serious financial market and real economy abuses began more slowly than the previous Fed interest rates have typically been achieved.
Similarly, the trials were tougher and rougher than the 1930s.
Deutschen’s strategies have reinvigorated the rises and declines of the world’s largest economies, as well as the changes in financial markets since 1950, and in places from the beginning of the 1800s.
They are making clear from the interest rates and their financial and financial impact since the 1950s.
At the earliest rate, less than a year has passed since the start of the recovery, mostly less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The increase in the financial market has ended in the course of the year or two since Fed's interest rates started.
Fed has now increased and in turn decreased his steering rate by a dozen cycles since the beginning of the 1950s.
In some respects, each time has differed from others, and the reporting is relatively limited in the review, so it is unlikely that they will give rise to any certainty as to the impact of the following increases.
The strategies remind us, therefore, that this time many things are different.
And not just better.
Interest rate too low for too long
The decisive causes of the financial crisis may not necessarily be indisputable in finding out even in decades of research.
But three things about the victims of the crisis and the causes of its destructive forces, I believe, are somewhat undisputedly clear:
1) In the 21st century, the Fed, the ECB of the euro area and the other largest central banks of the world considered their governance rates too low for too long.
They were sort of sorting on the Teknoculum's tracks, and at the same time they raised the next one.
2) In the course of the various parts of the financial and real economy, the amount of debt accumulated over the decades and, above all, too much debt increased even more by the overrun of central banks' monetary policy.
The largest debt-to-GDP ratio was born in the past.
3) In particular, debt financing, which was the most expensive in terms of financial finances, increased the number of shares in real estate, debt certificates and commodities in most financial market sectors in the past.
Even so, it is unlikely that it will be very harsh to argue that the financial markets that have risen to higher levels in case of increasingly complex debt defects were in rare dangerous and unstable situations when Fed and other central banks recently drove up interest rates.
As a result, the valuation curves imposed on the debt instruments did not last as long as after the interest purchases had started and the cost of debt financing had increased.
The risks occurred as a financial crisis and resulted in a major recession.
Larger bubble and more debt
Deutsche’s strategies do not guess what will happen next, but give a nuclear issue, for example, by mentioning the following:
1) Fed and other large central banks have now kept their monetary policy under way even lighter than before the financial crisis.
If the interest rates were too low before the crisis for too long, they have now been even lower.
2) The debt has not been insane for a long time, as it has been ten years ago, but now the debt money is, in fact, cheaper than it is to express.
Thus, the debt liability of the financial and real economy has not been reduced, but now, in different parts of the economy, the debt ratio is much more severe than before or at any time before the financial crisis.
3) The liquidity issued as the lowest and cheaper central banks has largely remained in the financial market and the key types of securities and assets have been reduced to the highest or never before the peak that was before the financial crisis.
And the strategies of Latin are not only on financial market warnings, but they also point out that even the US economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and from the worst recession in decades to the model it has been before.
The euro area economy has hardly recovered at all.
In other words, the real economy is in an unusually weak condition, but according to the pressures and risks of the financial markets, it is equally higher than before the financial crisis, when Fed will now start to tighten up his money supply.
Perhaps the picture of the future of Albert Edwards of the Societ General's strategy, the French bank, is not as strange as it can suddenly be.
He's been coaching the bank's international investors' clients for some time for the following full translations:
First, Fed will raise interest rates, then the financial blocks will break out, and soon it's time that Fedin will turn off the financial shocks with even greater QE coins.
Hewlett-Packard (HP) is planning to reduce up to 33,000 jobs.
Most of the reductions are directed at the HP Business Service Department, the company tells.
In November, HP is divided into HP Inc., which focuses on sales to Hewlett Packard Enterprises and consumers.
HP had the highest number of personnel in 2011, with 350000 employees.
In October last year, the staff had been cut to 302000.
The company will account for the one-off costs of USD 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion).
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will reduce between 25,000 and 30000 employees.
The consumer side reductions remain in 3300 within three years.
HP intends to transfer its activities to the economies of mauling to 60% of its employees in the countries of low cost in 2018.
The company already tells us that it has balanced its business so that none of its customers no longer account for more than 10 % of its operating income.
Another year, 65 per cent of the operating result was its three most important customers.
iOS 9: how to get a new operating system after updating iPhone Apple
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings Application, clicking on:
If the update is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some people have had problems after this installation, when the display has appeared, and the software update failed.
To bypass this, it is recommended that users either look forward to passing the worst screw or trying to update via the iTunes program.
The phone will guide the user in the final process.
This may include removing applications to get the status, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitating the process by a new tool that proposes to delete applications and then reinstall them when they are completed.
It is worth ensuring that the phone is loaded or near the charger during the update that the battery does not end.
If the charging level is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, because if the battery ends, it can lead to an update of the breach.

Top: Minister Berner has acted as a tax haven company in the government of the company
Minister for Transport and Communications Anne Berner (medium.) says Ylen has acted as a member of the board of a tax haven company.
According to Yle, the company's activities are related to so-called tax planning.
It's about the Luxemburg Saltri II LuxCo company, which was appointed as a member of the government by Berner in December 2012.
According to the Luxembourg trade register, Berner is still officially a member of the government.
Berner himself says that he left a declaration of resignation in May this year.
I checked it out, and it's enough that I've left a distinction.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that registration chains occur within the agreed timetable, Berner says in Yle's interview.
Membership after merger
Through the Luxembourg company, the holdings of the Swedish Kährs company are managed.
Kährs is a park manufacturer who has been fused with the Finnish park manufacturer Karelia-Upoflor in 2012.
Berner was a member of the Karelia-Upoflor Government in 2010-2013 and after the merger in Kährs and Luxembourg.
According to Ylen, Kährs' ownership is carried out in Luxembourg through a multi-port ownership structure.
Berner tells Yle that he accepted government membership in the Luxemburg company at the request of Kährs' second largest owner.
This owner is Hartwall Capital.
I've been involved in the Karelia-Upoflor government owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company had a partner that was found in Sweden.
This company was owned by a capital investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my job was to take care of the interests of the Finnish family company’s capital.
It is important that we ensure that our Finnish companies' capital income is taxed in Finland and that the starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Yle that Hartwall Capital's ownership in the company does not involve tax planning.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure set up for tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs’ capital fund Triton was already ready for ownership by the Luxemburg holding company.
Espoo opens up a corporate reception centre
Espoo Otamiem opens the first company-sponsored reception centre for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take the first 100 inhabitants from the evening.
The number of places can grow within a week to up to 300-400 people.
The Finnish Immigration Service is setting up a reception centre in the property of the former Rescue University.
The activities will be maintained by Luona Oy, which is particularly involved in the production of health care and medical care services.
The City of Espoo, the Finnish Immigration Service and Luona Oy together agree on the Centre’s security arrangements.
The STKI prepares alternative work-life tightening packages
The STKI will prepare an alternative package for the blackmail of the government's working life.
The organisation also wishes to include other employees' centres of interest.
According to President Antti Palola, attention is currently being given to Friday's demonstration of mind.
Alternative ways of reducing the price of work will be returned after that.
Everyone understands that life goes on after Friday, Palola pointed out the break-up of the organization’s administration for journalists.
Palola estimates that the Central Economic Union (EC) does not, however, have the readiness to negotiate.
STK's economists have calculated that the change security contained in the Government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million when the second half of the package is 2 700 million.
I don't know if part of it's a great zeal to have a conversation if there's a one-way relationship with a hundred.
Palola: A negotiation connection has been constructive
Prime Minister Juha Sipil (middle) has hoped for alternative proposals by Wednesday, since it is time for the Government to give its own package a communication to the Parliament and to start preparing for reforms.
The ball did not take any position on whether the schedule was realistic.
According to Palola, there is a connection to the government, and it has been constructive for him all the time.
In particular, according to Palola, the operation of Sunday supplements is a painful place for the STKT field.
The organisation requires that the government withdraws from the mandatory legislation in which it would carry out some of the blackmails.
According to the STK, the Palola does not warm up to the fact that the alternative package would be prepared with the SDP who held the case.
The employees will meet in Helsinki on Friday to oppose the working life Package presented by the government last week.
As part of the package, pay for the first days of sickness is cut, pay for overtime is halfd, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and snow is reduced.
The STK is stressed that the central organisations have called employees on the expression of mind, and the purpose has not been to strike.
The Plan Fjäder boasts
The agenda president, Mr Fjader, thanks the STTK for its notification of the preparation of an alternative package.
According to Fjader, the STKI is now coming to the same lines with Akari, as the program has already described a longer alternative model for government proposals.
Fjander hopes that SAK will also be included in an alternative package, because without SAK, the package will not be sufficiently comprehensive.
Mr Fjäder, the proposed president, hopes the SAK, led by Mr Lauri Lyly, to prepare the proposal as an alternative to surgery.
Antti Palola STKT said earlier on Wednesday that he was preparing new proposals.
We want change security and working time banks.
On Wednesday, the plan informed me that it has long been preparing its own proposal, which is ready to negotiate a 5% competitive advantage for the government of the country as an alternative to cuts.
The plan has been prepared all the time to negotiate, and we have long been writing an alternative model for government proposals.
We are ready to look at the terms of the employment relationship as part of the contract.
In return, we want change security and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
Fjander hopes that SAK will also come to the Open Line, as STTK has previously done on Wednesday.
Without SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now preparing together a model for the government and employers of the country, says Fjäder.
The draft Bureau will meet on Thursday at 15 a.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
\"The same boat, the common coal, the tallcots, is playing the bingo in Sipile talking tonight.
Green Left of Tampere University
The green left of the University of Tampere for the night of Vivan bingokuponk.
Prime Ministers have previously held exceptional talks during the rebellion and wars in Mäntsälä.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä speaks very exceptionally to the nation of Finland about the state of Finnish economy on the Yle channels on Wednesday at 21.05 a.m.
When applying for the previous speech of the Prime Minister, we must go to 1932 when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was the Prime Minister in holding the famous radio speech, which meant the beginning of the rebellion in Mäntsälä.
After that, the President and ministers held a number of radio calls during the winter and further war.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave President Mauno Koivisto a new year's speech, but it was more ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen quit the train operators' strike on television.
Single phone, monarchist makeup
The talk of the Sipile has raised all day's criticism and assumptions about what I'm going to do.
On Twitter, the President of the Left Alliance, Mr Arhinmäki, said that: “It could be said of the state of the nation in the Parliament as a declaration by the Prime Minister, which would also allow the speech to be discussed.
According to the Greens Ville Niinistö, there's already been a private phone call.
Leadership is a dialogue, listening to people.
On Facebook, the SDP's Erkki Judgments condemned that \"monarchist makeup: Prime Minister tells the people what is best for it.
The president of the SDP, Antti Rinne, challenged Sipila's dialogue: “A half a year of elections.
There's no record of the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
We've tried.
What is it that's afraid of?
Public service
According to the Government's office, Sipilä's speech has been recorded in advance and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to SAK, it is commented on by direct transmission by SAK President Lauri Lyly and CEO Jyr Hähämämämäminen of the EC.
Top has been criticised for making Sipil's speech.
We considered this and said that it was part of the public service task to promote the full publicity of Finland, the line in the news of Ismo Silvo Ylen, President of Yle's publications.
It's like Me at Tammel's time.
The speech has also brought about looseness.
The dinner that comes tonight is enjoyed in good time, the children are taken and put on their best.
My mom's gonna put on a nicer hole, and my dad's gonna make a tie to his neck.
At nine o'clock, we'll be on TV before we're back at Tammello's, writing a bloggari Saku Timonen.
“Do the Prime Minister Sipil also speak of why the Finnish Government is sitting in tax havens with millionaires hiding in its capitals, which are making mercy laws for other tax collector friends, and at the same time claim to the people that it is necessary to cut when the state has the rest of its money.
About what Sipilä says, one guess is presented by the Green Left of the University of Tampere.
It's been published on Facebook by the other bingon.
Do we hear about the same boat tonight, the same coal, the debt and the team spirit?
Coupons and pens complete at 21.05 it starts and channels are TV1, Radio Finland and Yle Areena.
Ahtisaari Guardian: Western countries rejected the Russian proposal for the deportation of Al-Assad
Over three years ago, the Western countries rejected the Russian offer by the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to abandon power, says President Martti Ahtisaari Guardian.
According to the Archbishop, the Russian U.N. ambassador proposed a plan that, after some time, Al-Assad would have been depreciated in style.
However, the Western countries did not stick to the proposal because they believed that Al-Assad would fall in a few weeks anyway.
The Ahtisaari discussed the Syrian crisis in 2012 with five permanent member states of the UN Security Council.
According to the Ahtisaari, the Russian Ambassador Vitali Tshurk, in a two-centre debate, listed three plans: the opposition was not allowed to be armed, the opposition and Al-Assad had to have a phone call immediately and the abandonment of Al-Assad had to be carried out in a slow manner.
I know Thurkin.
We may not agree on all matters, but we will be able to discuss them openly.
I told him what I did there, and he said he was sitting down in Alaska, Martti, and I'll tell him what we need to do, Ahtisaari recalls the Guardian interview.
Diplomatics do not comment
The Ahtisaari tells us that he has passed the Tshurkin message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing has happened.
Tshurk did not confirm the content of the discussion, but according to the Ahtisaari, there are no two words.
UN diplomats also refused to comment on the allegations of Ahtisaari, but said that at that time the Al-Assad troops had already committed several mass murders and the key opposition groups refused all agreements in which he would have been in power.
Sir John Jenkins, former Head of the Middle East Department of the British Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is inconvenient with the words of the Ahtisaari because, according to his experience, Russia was at no time prepared to discuss the fate of al-Assad.
Officially, Russia has supported Al-Assad throughout the war.
As soon as the Ahtisaari is concerned, Tshurk spoke with Moscow's mandate.
If he had told me about Tshurkin's speech, I would have replied that I would like to hear the same President Vladimir Putin so that I can take it seriously.
According to Jenkins, in that case, he would have suspected that it would have been Putin's rock to hold power on to some Al-Assad supporter.
Refugee flow in our own actions
During the negotiations at the airport, some 7,500 people had died in the Syrian crisis.
According to UN estimates, the number of deaths exceeded 220 000 at the beginning of the year.
More than 11 million people have had to flee their homes because of the war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is what we do.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
Now we're paying the bill that we've caused, says Ahtisaari to the newspaper.
Asylum seeker’s facility in a stint in Turin
The Centre for Asylum Applicants, designed by the Government for Northern Finland, is likely to be set up in Turin.
The Centre would be set up in the building of the tornio building which is empty at the city centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has sought an appropriate place to better manage refugee flows from the Swedish border.
Helsinki’s Words announced on Tuesday that the delegation had already decided to present the school building as a subscription solution to the Ministry.
According to Saul Hõppinen (left) of the Toronto City Council, it is not true.
When the whole delegation was not assembled and some of the group wanted a formal decision, we decided to invite the delegation meeting to the next Monday to decide on this matter, he would clarify it to the STT.
At the local meeting there were 36 delegates from 43.
The organisation centre was opposed to 13 mandates.
On that basis, the decision could be expected to be positive, says Höppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was contacted on Monday, and it was quickly addressed.
It would be an estimated 500 asylum seekers at a time.
The expert has been checking that it could be suitable for such use.
The location is a few hundred meters from the border, so it would also work in that sense, says Nousiainen.
The Sipil is still hoping for an alternative from the labour market to blackmail.
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (mainly).
However, it would be nice for the government to accept an alternative package if labour market organisations are able to agree on such an agreement.
In the Parliament, Sipil said to journalists that he had not been involved with labour market organisations.
He also did not know how seriously organizations are looking for substitute means for the blackmails of working life announced by the government.
If such an agreement is concluded, we will be happy to accept it as part of the whole package.
In Sipilä's view, it would be a way to make the holidays work, because it would be almost against all employees, unlike the Sunday cut by the government, for example.
Labour market organisations could agree on the cut-off of holiday money because they have been registered in collective agreements instead of law.
The government will give these views to Parliament next Wednesday about the pressure of working life in the form of a communication from the Government.
According to Sipil, organisations' proposals should be known before this.
This isn't even the final blanket.
The legislative work will then move, i.e. the train will be on the move and it will become more difficult all the time.
Now's a good time.
I mean, it's not gonna take long to do such things if you want to, Sipilka.
The list published last week by the government has, among other things, to turn the end-of-life and Helsinki into unpaid days without shortening the annual working time.
In addition, pay for the first days of sickness is cut, pay for overtime is halfd, Sunday allowances are reduced to 75% and snow is reduced.
The reforms are implemented as a mandatory legislation over trade unions, which has led to strong criticism.
As a result of the actions of the paid centres, there is a major demonstration on Friday, and a number of trade unions have declared political recessions.
The Council of Tohmajärve approved the extension of the Mahlahall warehouse
The Council of Tohmajärve unanimously approved the extension of the stock of the hall of Nordic Koivu Oy, which is the mahlahall.
The assessment was that the project was bigger and more expensive than it had originally been said.
A busy schedule is also heartbreaking.
It was also a little surprising that the volume need had not been known a year ago when it was decided on the previous extension.
At this stage, the extension of the stock by 400-450 square meters was accepted in the investment programme, but the funding will not be decided in the context of the sub-annual report.
The agenda also discussed investment of €150,000 to €200 000, but the technical manager Erkki Ikonen said that the price will be estimated at €300 000.
Investment was supported on the basis that it brings work and tax revenues to the local government.
The municipality has no risk as the company pays the investment as a rent, Vesa Väistö (ps.).
A place for Karjala to speak in Joensuu
The city government has made a sharp contribution to bringing the street name villages of the herd languages to the centre of Joensuu.
The new decision is important and, in the right mind, the election of the livestock tradition throughout the country.
Joensuu is not declared the capital city of herds because there are no historical grounds and the language of the herd is not a natural part of the territory's identity.
The language spoken in the region of Joensuu has been more part of the eastern savoise.
After a new decision, the city centre will not be listed as street names.
The city of Joensuu, however, is, on a case-by-case basis, also ready to use the language of the herd, for example in information tables and in tourism marketing.
The city recommends the same attitude for all other actors.
Although Joensuu is officially a single-linguish municipality, it is also helpful to take an open approach to the use of herd tongue now that multiculturalism is still alive and is strongly changing in North Karelia.
The language of Karjala is still the specific features of the region, as is the image of Joensuu as the Finnish Forest Capital.
Both of them can benefit from a wide range of marketing in the region.
The ceasefire of train connections will cut the vitality of the county
The cuts in connection with trains strike the energy of the region with a hard hand.
Transport links directly affect the economic and competitiveness of the region.
And it seems that there can be a place to live and work here at all, that the Mayor of Joensuu wonders.
He also highlights air traffic, which has continued to be on several occasions in meditation.
It is important for the whole region that we do not have the opportunity to deal with measures of state power, as is the case now.
We should look at the impact of these end-of-life links on employment, for example, Karjalainen.
The deterioration of transport links will lead to an additional challenge for the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, what better services here are, such as transport connections and housing, the easier it is to get students and employees, the principal of the University of Eastern Finland Jukka Mönkkönen says.
He points out that bad traffic links also affect the research community, which is very mobile and travels a lot due to research.
Marko Junkkarinen, Director of Recruitment, says that it is already difficult to market the university towards Western Finland, as transport links are weak in the opposite direction.
At present, about half of students from the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
They again account for about 10-20% of the Uusimaa, which is partly explained by the direct rail connection.
I got one of my fingers on Siu's wars.
The vision of the town government of Joensuu regarding the regional project Siu Sote is apparently unanimous, but there is one among my rings.
The City Government member, Pentti Centralsalo (sd., in the picture) presented the whole project to be abandoned at the Monday meeting, but his presentation was unprofitable.
The Board approved a decision by the Mayor, Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed at the beginning of October before the City Council meeting, which will give final opinion at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train shift from Kotka to Kouvola will end next year
Passenger train from Kotka to Kouvola will remain in the future, even though it is less frequent than one train.
Change in passenger train between Kotka and Kouvola will be made next March.
One train partner is left out, but there is still five days to get from Kotvola to Kouvola and vice versa.
Deductions are due to State savings measures.
The purchase of train transport by the Ministry of Transport and Communications will be reduced by EUR 12.3 million for the next four years.
The most quiet routes will be completely terminated.
The VR will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped out.
The rescue facility released a 12-year-old climb from the climbing roof, who couldn't get off the roof of his own help.
The situation was born in Turin on Ketotie at 6:30 p.m. on Tuesday night.
There's an old two - story wooden house in place, where there's no ladder on the roof at all.
It did not prevent a boy-to-man who decided to climb the roof of the house along the mass of radio amateurs next to it.
The rest of the boys got down the same route, but one of them didn't.
As a result, the rest of you were sneezing from the scene and the passovers were alert to the rescue facility to help the bets safely return to the surface of the last roof.
FedEx's operating profit is doubled, dropping tax year 2016 views
FedEx reported depressive results from the last quarter, and the delivery waste cut the whole year's performance forecast, as a result of reduced demand for freight services and higher costs for its land services.
The company also said that it was going to hire some 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced that it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
Its share fell by about 2.5 per cent at the opening auction 45 minutes before the opening of the week.
FedEx Corp. says that it expects the tax year to end next May to be 10,40-10,90 dollars, which is 20 cents lower than the previous forecast.
Analysts waited for $10.84, let's tell them at the FactSett survey.
Despite the average price increases of 4,9 %, which will enter into force on 4 January, and despite higher charges in November for land transport of heavy or large packages.
The company said that it expects business profits to grow from the previous year, as they have cut costs, turnover has increased and online trade is growing.
The president and CEO Fred Smith said that the company will continue to operate firmly, taking into account the expected weaker economic conditions, especially in production and global trade.
The plans for pay for the holiday were announced on the day after the competitor UPS told me that he intends to hire 90-95 000 extra workers, approximately the same amount as it hired last year.
In the fourth quarter of August 31st, FedEx's result was $692 million, which is 6 per cent more than last year.
The winning per share came from $2.42, which remains from the average forecast of $2.44.
The turnover increased by 5 per cent to $12.3 billion.
In Zacks' survey, six analysts were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from reducing international priority transport, which has stopped the development of its Express unit’s turnover.
However, the rise in online trade has improved the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the net sales of the land unit rose by 29 per cent, but in principle the revenues of the operations were the same because of the cost of the larger packages and their own insurance.
Express unit revenues were better due to higher basic charges, while operating profit in freight fell by higher labour costs.
At the opening auction about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx's shares fell to USD 3.85, i.e. 2.5 per cent to USD 150.15.
FedEx shut down 11 per cent on Tuesday for this year and 17 per cent for less than 11 June.
This week, the central bank’s decision-makers will sit around a huge mahogany table for the first time in almost a decade.
In the second place, the central bank’s ornamental, two-storey meeting room is a wall painting from the United States.
The map is a reminder that Janet L. Yellen, the President of the Central Bank, and his colleagues, must put the people's financial interests ahead of everything else.
The Congress has set two kinds of responsibility for the central bank's shoulders: they must maximise the employment of the United States and keep prices stable.
However, after the Great Land, the governors of the Central Bank have accepted that there is also a third, unwritten mandate: economic stability.
This third requirement can be a crucial factor in the decision to be published on Thursday , which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted .
While most of the information shows the economic growth in a stable manner, the recent collapse in the global financial markets may have been made by the officials of the central bank already on their way to increase instability, fearing how it would affect if the Federal Funds ratio were to be increased even in the fourth quarter of the percentage unit.
“I understand the labour market and inflation are the first and most important points to be followed,” says Lindsey M. Piegza, Meclariike Stifel Nicolaus & Co’s main economic expert.
“I believe, however, that if they are looking for a justification for leaving the interest rate unchanged, increased uncertainty on the world market is still a valid enough reason to wait, ” he says.
The decision of the Central Bank has not been agreed, which is already the result of nervousness in the economy.
According to a recent survey by Bloomberg, about half of economic experts predict that interest rates will rise this week.
Once again, the financial markets expect the central bank to delay the rise, as the key indicator indicates that only around 30 % of the potential for growth is available.
This refers to a fall in the securities market if the central bank increases the level if the decision-makers would not then be able to soften the impact by promising that the next increase will not take place in the near future.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average index rose to 228,89 points, i.e. 1.4 per cent, with the new chapter 16 599,85.
The recovery brought with it the expectation that the central bank will keep the level unchanged this week, says John Lonski, Moody's Capital Markets Research Group’s main economic experts.
It's surprising if the central bank raises interest rates right now, he says.
If the decision-makers raise interest rates, they will have to see a lot of effort in their policies to support the financial market so that they do not panic.
Other experts argue that an increased level would calm the financial markets, as it would eliminate uncertainty when the central bank operates.
Only a month ago, the central bank seemed to be raising interest rates in this month by a quarter, thus taking the first small step towards slow tightening the monetary position, which would ensure the stability of the US recovery.
Yellen has said in spring and early spring that he expects the level to rise this year, despite the fact that liberals demand more economic development in their complaints.
Although the creation of new jobs slowed down in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
In the last month, the unemployment rate fell to 5.1%, which is below seven years and close to the level considered by the central bank as the limit of full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of pestilence.
Although inflation is still below the 2 % annual target of the central bank, the decision-makers of the Central Bank believe that access to this is a temporary impact of significantly reduced oil prices.
It also needs to be clear of higher interest rates and also given the strict labour market situation, says Ian Shepherdson, Pantheon Macroeconomics main economic expert.
However, the financial markets around the world were shocked last week when China devalued its currency.
Down Jones's industrial average index fell by up to 16 per cent from its May record, while investors were afraid of slowing Chinese economies also slowing global growth.
The market has recovered somewhat in this month, and the Dow index is now almost 10% below the top secondary reading.
For the decision-makers of the central bank, market millery is an additional factor in the complex equation, which tells us that interest rates need to be increased.
“Ilma, these events in the financial markets and recent news about the weakness of the Chinese economy, the decision makers would be blackmailing the level at this meeting,” says Stephen D. Oliner, UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Central Bank official.
Now he predicts that the decision makers expect at least a month to gain a better understanding of the effects.
“The potential impact on the US economy is still very unclear, and they do not have much information on the consequences of China’s events,” says Oliner.
The international economic well-being is not the main concern of the central bank, so it should not in principle affect decision-making.
In practice, however, the federal central bank has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been enormous.
In 2013, Ben S. Bernanken, the president of the silos, suggested that the central bank could “scoffe” the increase in the amount of money, caused the shocks on the market around the world.
In a world where markets and economies have become increasingly shrinking together, central bank officials are expected not only to have further developments but also to consult other central banks and experts in order to gain a better understanding of the world economy.
The decision-making process of the Central Bank is more art than science, says Zachary Karabel, head of the global strategy of Envesnet Inc.
The President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Virginia (Federal Reserve Bank) noted in this month that the central bank had previously overrerepresented its financial market movement, which has seemed to be separate from the fundamental economic factors.
The Federal Open Market Committee, which makes its decisions, has called for an increase in interest, and Mr Lacker, a member of the Committee's voting rights, will set an example for the decisions of 1998-99.
The Asian economic crisis caused the central bank to cut its reference value by 0.75 percentage points during the three meetings, despite its limited, identifiable effects on US economic growth, Lacker says.
A year later, the central bank cancelled these operations.
The central bank should only give priority to economic stability during the major crisis, as the market was collapsing in 2008, says Adam S. Posen, former member of the Board of Governors of England (Bank of England).
The latest millery doesn't even come near its level, Posen says.
“No one wants a situation in which interest rates are raised because the market is depressed, says Posen, President of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Law on the Central Bank (Federal Reserve Act) remains a dual requirement and does not mention economic stability, as long as this is the case, I do not think they should anticipate it.

In Rio Grand, the Brazilian Child Disease Association advertises healthy diets for mammals
The Brazilian Child Disease Association SPRS has invented a shocking way of trying to make women understand the importance of good food during breast-feeding by publishing pictures of baby sucking breasts with painted photographs of unhealthy food.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all necessary nutrients to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to increase their daily calorie volume by about 500 calories.
However, a new study suggests that adding the calorie amount is not the only diet change that mothers should make.
The recent study led by the Texas Baylor College of Medical Science by Robert Waterland revealed that the healthy diet of pregnant women in fact affects the genetic appearance of their babies and protects babies from tumour development.
Unfortunately, unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child’s immune system.
The Seven Channel Sunrise programme is the favorite viewer program, despite the efforts of the Nine Channel to announce the performance of the Today Show programme
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's rhythm to Caperra's news about the post of the Liberal Party's leadership failed to increase Today's viewer's volumes.
The Nine channel morning program was sent from the capital of the country after Malcolm Turnbull was taken out of power by Tony Abbott.
The racing program Sunrise, which was run by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of the weekly series of international broadcasts that also cover Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The weight of the distance did not seem to be detrimental to Australian TV coverage, as Sunrisen’s average score was 397 000 in five state capitals, while Today’s figure was 339 000.
Today's average rose slightly from Monday to Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283 000), but it was still lower than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has taken Sunrise in the past few months.
In August, Today averaged 318 000 and Sunrisen 330 000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference ranged between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
Until now, in September, Sunrise's average is 349 000 viewers, while today is 314,000.
This is the most interesting event this morning.
Changes in the wind will blow this morning elsewhere than in Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Published by TODAY on Monday 14 September 2015
The great news of the Seven Channel was a 800-word series with an earlier Packed to the Rafters series star Erik Thomson, an amazing first performance.
The new drama series, which gathered a fairly impressive average of 1,219 million viewers, tells of the newly widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
The critics have wondered if Thomson's popular series was to be carried by itself without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibson.
Last night's results gave this real certainty.
The X Factor program of the Seven Channel was a strong favorite with 1,136 million viewers, easily winning the Block series (838 000) and the TBL Family series (726 000).
Seven had two kinds of fate on the second night of The Chase Australia series.
Andrew O'Keefe’s first half hour (17-17.30) was collected by 446 000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17.30-18) rose to 623 000 viewers, which was enough for a small win on Eddie McGuiren Hot Set (613 000).
On Monday night The Chase Australia's first half-hour average viewer was 520 000 viewers, and the second half-hour figure was a peak of 720 000.
Hot Seat's average was 620 000.
The Chase Australia's second night viewer's decline will bring the Nine channel confidence that Hot Seattle will eventually become the most popular program at 5.30 p.m.
The Chase Australia replaced the Millions Dollar Minute program, which failed to reduce the viewing volumes of the McGuire program.

The final coin agrees with fathers that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who does he choose?
The secret has been revealed? ...
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski could accidentally reveal who wins the Bachelor series.
The identity of that woman has been held extremely secret with Sam Wood in The Bachelor.
The three remaining girls are certainly not slippers, who received the last rose.
However, when we discussed with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markosk and Lana Jeavos-Fellows the day before the three became the two, they could, however, deliberately give a hint of the identity of the winner.
Sam Wood's lips are sealed before Thursday's final.
All three women went wild when they told me how Wood was a perfect man, mentioning his sense of humor, ambition, family value and positiveity for the reason they wanted to be his partner.
But when they asked, “If Wood’s last rose is not for you, for whom it should go, their answers could offer a discovery of who won the heart of the male.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly referred to Mackay as the best option for Wood after them themselves.
Sarah Mackay's and Sam Wood's have been complicated since the first day.
“From the moment I walked into the house, (Sarah) energy and Sam’s energy seemed quite compatible, and that thought was in my mind throughout the series,” said Jeavons-Fellows.
“Sarah is really close to the country, it’s fun to be with him,” added Markoski.
I've seen them together and there's chemistry between them.
They seem to have a nice and relax together.
Sarah Mackay believes that she and Sam Wood would be a very good couple.
Mackay said that last week's home visits made him realize that Wood could be the right one.
“When I saw him with my friends and my family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game,” he said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was worthy.
I don't know if I can say, he said.
I like the remaining girls as much as I do, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be sent to Ten on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.

Jarryd Hayna has many options where to start her NFL career
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested in him after he moved to the United States, and many other teams have asked about him in his impressive open training day after the end of last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers team as well as Coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some trainers would have left Hayne on the exchange bench for the rest of the game after this Australian rugbyligian turned down the ball's first takeoff when the team was back in Minnesota on Tuesday by reading 20-3.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Hayne return the next take-off and took her to the running game after Reggie Bush was hurt.
The real nature of Tomsula also appeared in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of barking up his new entrant in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-game press conference.
The 49ers special editor, Cam Inman, reported that Haynea also encouraged Special Team Coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget the fallen ball and to worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne dropped the flight kick that Minnesota Vikings caught in the first quarter of the game.
This was certainly not the beginning of Hayne and his numerous Australian fans hoped for a man's NFL-debyyt.
Hayne was seen cursing on the way from the field after the fall, and later he told Hamish & Andy the Australian radio pair at 2DayFM at a frequency of 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start for his NFL career.
“It was just one of these things now, we just need to think about the next game, and that’s it,” said Hayne.
Hayne compared his bearding with his 2007 Origin debut when the bait in his own goal area led to Queensland's goal.
In all, it was still a wonderful experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posted his Instagram account in a photo with fans, holding the flag of Australia.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the richest man in Russia, Mikhail Hodorkovski, was arrested with a gun, threatening a civilian runway.
Hodorkovski had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, and his efforts to support democracy were restricted.
4 When the police shot the rubbers, they died against the protestors in Nepal.
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, died in the south of Nepal after the police shot rubbers in a crowd that showed his mind against the new draft Constitution in the country, the Authority said on Wednesday.
The violence took place on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh region of approximately 175 miles west of the capital of Katmandus.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, an official in the region, said that more than 1,000 protestors had met outside the police station, and some of them threw stones and fire bombs.
Dhakal said that the police used the tear gas and then shot it into the air before it got into rubber gloves.
Twenty cops and five civilians got hurt, he told me.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to have killed, but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, seemed to have caused so many deaths.
In recent weeks, the summary was in violent demonstrations across the southern part of Nepal, where members of the Ethnic Group of the Madhesian Group say that the new provincial provincials established under the proposed new Constitution undermine their political influence.
There have also been protests in Western Nepal when the Tharus Group calls for its own country.
After 10 August, at least 40 people have died in violent gatherings, 11 of whom have been police officers.
At that time, four main parties signed an agreement with which the country was divided into commissions - this is a big step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial matter in Nepal, which has been a central government for centuries.
The new Constitution has been planned since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake in April killed thousands of people.
This week, the legislators have voted on the clauses of the Constitutional Treaty in Katmandus, and the authorities have said that the new Charter could have been adopted by Sunday.
NHC says that the South of Cape Verde has a 60% chance of evaporation.

The second specific low-level material, located in the middle of the Kap Verde island group and the Little Antillies, also has a 60% chance to develop into a tropical vortex in the next two days, increased the weather forecast centre in Miami.
Google starts the donation campaign with the aim of collecting 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc (GOGL.O) published a donation campaign aimed at collecting 11 million dollars for humanitarian organisations that help thousands of refugees from Europe to escape war from torn and poor countries.
Google had an exceptionally personal view of its published donation campaign’s blog.
Instead of making the announcement a leader, from his personal experience, Google’s employee, Rita Masoud, who escaped with his family seven years old from Kabul.
“Our journey included numerous blind train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, coldness, and darkness, he wrote.
I was lucky.
But when the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has grown, people like my family desperately want to help.
Gifts are provided by four non-profit organisations helping refugees and immigrants: Doctors without borders, International Rescue Committee, Save children and UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google reported that it corresponds to each donation made worldwide on the Google.com/refugeerelief website up to USD 5.5 million, with a total target of USD 11 million.
The worst refugee crisis in Europe is in progress since World War II, and it is mainly due to civil war in Syria for four years, which has driven over 4 million people from their homes this year.
Many also flee the war from Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

Dilution surgery can help mildly obese diabetics
According to the new study, the benefits of type 2 diabetes with mild obesity may last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to say whether these mildly obese diabetics are living longer than those who are treated in other ways than surgery.
“I have a long time to get the information, ” says Dr. Robin Blackstone, a D.A., who wrote the headline on a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Dilution or bariatric surgery uses a variety of methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit food absorption.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but the majority of those taking part in the study have been sick and their weight index (BMI) has been 35 or more.
BMI, i.e. weight ratio to length, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
If BMI is more than 25, it indicates that someone is obese and if the person’s BMI is more than 30, he is considered to be obese.
You can count your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Thailand used the data collected since 2007 to compare the two types of bariatric surgery, the bypass surgery of the stomach and the reduction of the stomach, the treatment of type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of the persons cut fell from 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, persons who were treated with other means than surgery remained largely in 29.
Of the persons cut, 36% improved completely and 28% improved in part.
Due to comparison, in the drug-treated group, diabetes was completely improved by only 1% and partly by about 2%.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and “pain – LDL cholesterol – were generally better in the surgical group,” the writers said.
The researchers also followed the levels of haemoglobin A1c in patients, reflecting long-term blood glucose levels.
Haemoglobin A1c should remain below 7%, researchers should write.
A1c post-operative haemoglobin level decreased from approximately 9% to approximately 6%.
However, in the treatment group, it remained stable at about 8 %.
However, this improved glycaemic control, which is described by improved haemoglobin levels A1c, did not reduce mortality over five years, says the chief investigator, Dr Chih-Cheng Hsu, and his colleagues.
The study group also compared average results between the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year when compared to the lower abdominal surgery group, the abdominal bypass surgery group had dropped more weight (18,7 and 14,2 kg), decreased weight index (7,4 and 5,1), decreased haemoglobin by more (3,1 % and 2.1 %), and more likely achieved a complete diabetes remission (46,9 % and 16,7 %).
The University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenixin Blackstone says that even though research does not appear to be survival or surgery after five years, there are research results from Sweden, where surgery led to longer lives in more powerful people.
In the Swedish study, 29% of the obese who had been in surgery had a lower probability of dying during the 15-year period when compared to a group who had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not seem to improve the survival of surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging for people with BMI below 35 who are interested in surgery.
\"The results of the investigation are crucial precisely in showing that the surgery is safe for the group of lower weight indexes, and do not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously at the point when the patient BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long before we take this seriously, ” he says.
I believe that once man has collected these genetic changes, which permanently prepare his body for obesity and diabetes, it is very difficult to cancel.
\"All can't come to Europe... - Dalai Lama - RT News
Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot accept all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis is found in the Middle East.
The leader of Tibetan Buddhism has called for the cessation of violence in the countries of refugees.
Dalai Lama dealt with the current refugee crisis in his speech, which he held at the openings of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, Oxford, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain.
Dalai Lama claimed that in the current situation, the needs of all mankind should be put ahead of individual peoples or even continents.
He also stressed that although the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis must be admired, it is also insufficient.
\"All cannot come to Europe,\" he said.
Although Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria to take action in the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
“It is wonderful to look after a number of thousands of refugees, but in the meantime it is necessary to think about long-term solutions: how real peace and real development can be brought to these Muslims, mainly through education.
The first thing is to think about how we can reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of power.
The use of power has never solved these problems, but he added.
When taking a stand on the question of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after 9/11 terrorist attacks and claimed that the US violent response caused severe events in the chain.
After 9/11, I presented my condolences to President Bush and told him that there was a solution to this problem through violence.
I know his motives were good, but he used power and created unexpected consequences, Dalai Lama said.
In the last four years, the absorption of hand-defining material for children has increased fourfold.
The United States of America has reported a strong increase of nearly 400% in the absorption of alcohol-containing handicrafts in children under 12 years of age after 2010, reports Georgia’s toxicity information centre.
According to the Director of Georgia’s Centre for Toxicity, Dr. Gaylord Lopez, there were an increase in the incidence of toxicity in children under 12 years of age from 3266 in the 2014 16117 case.
“The children are more interested in these products, and unfortunately a certain percentage of them will go to the emergency policy,” said Lopez to CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectation for purpose, while some want to impress their friends or respond to the challenge in social media.
YouTube has videos where teen-ages drink a disinfecting agent to get a cheap rise.
According to reports, the teenagers have mixed the disinfecting agent with alcoholic water in order to get a stronger drink.
The chairs of the desinfecting disinfecting agent can attract younger children.
\"The father doesn't think this is bad for him,\" Lopez said.
Many of the most interesting (handles) are those with added smell.
There are maize, grapes and orange-flavoured disinfectants that are very attractive to children.
The hand disinfecting agent may contain any alcohol between 45 % and 95 %.
In particular, small children need only a few rubbles for alcohol poisoning.
\"It's really concentrated alcohol,\" said Mr. Stephen Thornton, head of hospital medicine information centre at the University of Kansas Hospital, Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave the whiskey on the table, but the hand-defining agent is left on the screen, and if children are interested in it, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who, some time ago, swallowed only four raisins of Mansica-flavoured disinfecting material at school, and was taken to first aid.
His blood levels of alcohol were .179, which is twice as high as the limit of the adult race, says Chris Ritchey, a first-aid medical doctor, who held a girl at Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaih, when he spoke to you, he couldn't walk when he arrived in the first aid.
The doctors followed him at night in a separate children's hospital in case of possible brain injury, as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchey told me.
\"It was really scary,\" Nhaiiah's mother, Ortoria Scott, told CNN.
It could have been a deadly situation for my child.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic products or disinfecting swabs and move the disinfecting material away from the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisonings, some disinfectants are connected to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died of disinfecting agents containing toxic, unreported ingredients.
Health authorities assume that the product contained methanol, a deadly substance, and no ethyl alcohol declared as an active ingredient.
In January, in the northern part of New York State, three fourth graders designed to poison their mean teacher by spreading the bacterial poison to the classroom, reports the police report.
The teacher is very allergic to a hand disinfecting agent and denied it in his class.
The police need to prevent the plan as a whirlwind and leave the disciplinary measures in the school district.
Hurdyly: Celtic has no conflict
Griffiths is cutting off talks about Celtic's conflicts, and Delaa admits that Hoops is in a tight place, but she's gonna make it turn around.
Hearts is fighting the Scottish football union against Neilson's charges, and Warburton is on guard against the January recruits that could interfere with the team's unity.
Dons raised his lead to Celtic at five points.
Adam Rooney's first half-time penalty shot took Aberdeen to a narrow victory from Hamilton at the Pittodar Stadium and allowed the team to increase the difference between Celtic and five points.
Griffiths reduces talks about conflicts
There have been rumors about the internal conflicts in Celtic, but Griffiths passed them right away. He claims that he and his teammates have no sense of working under more accurate supervision when the team is preparing to meet the Dutch serial director.
I don't think we're under pressure, but I think players are waiting to see each other.
The lack of scotch mastorus extruds the Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers average field player and former Dutch national team singer Ronald de Boer have said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because it has no competition with Rangers.
Ajax's current ambassador de Boer said: \"There is no longer any mention of Celtic games and why...
Because Rangers isn't in.
People here can't just talk about the Rangers' return.
They're talking about the Old First Teams.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
These team games have a lot of excitement, and other than Scottishs also want to watch them play.
Deila swears to turn the situation around
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic is in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has sworn to turn around.
The destruction of Malmölle and the resulting fall from the Master's league was quickly followed by the loss of ten men to Aberdeen, which is now at the top of the series with five points apart.
But Dela said: \"Celtic has had bad episodes before, and we will rise again.
Now we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that many people are very, very angry or sad about what is happening.
We are, too, but we must continue.
We really need supporters because it improves the performance of players.
Now it's important to stay together.
Warburton is being guarded from January’s playoffs
Even though Rangers-bomo Mark Warburton commented just a few weeks ago on possible items of January playoffs, he is provided with the most colourful assurance that he does not want to confuse the team's unity.
The former Brentford boss said: “The January moving window is very different from the summer window.
For players coming up in the summer, the adjustment time will be the whole time, which will be seen in our team this season.
The team's doing very well.
Sometimes the addition of unnecessary players can do more harm.
Celtic's interest in michu's hint of living
Swanseean's attacker Michu, whose name has been attached to Celtic in connection with the transport window, has indicated that he can retire after his contract with Swans ends.
For two years, a 29-year-old player has been snooping, and during the summer, he failed to find another company outside Wales.
Hearts are ready to fight the Scottish Football League because of Neilson's comments
Hearts led to 2-1 when Paterson was removed from the field, and the team lost 3-2 after this. The defense's red card was cancelled later, and this was the third red card that Collum was condemned in the last eight months.
He kept saying, \"I did not question honesty, I did not comment on performance,\"
Griffiths swears to avoid Tynecastle
The faithful Hibernian player had to be snooped after singing a offensive song about the former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in the pub at the Edinburgh Roseburn before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastä Stadium in March 2014.
“It was a derby and it was a moment of mind, ” said the attacker, adding: “It is safe to say that I don’t return to Tynecastle, unless I move to Celtic.
Tannadice's government believes in Dundee United's leadership - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United government still has faith in the leadership ability to turn the situation around, but admits that the decline of players must stop.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're gonna get the boys back to work, Donnelly says.
McInnes is happy to win.
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, was desperately involved in the game against Hamilton Accies, but managed to reach his seventh consecutive league, which raised them at the top of the table five points above Celticia, thanks to Adam Rooney's first half-time penalty shot.
McInnes says: \"There is no team that would have won anything, it was then a poker or too, which would also not have won games in this way...
Scotland's unemployment remains the same as the UK's total population grew.
RECOMMENDATION In Scotland, 164 000 people remained in Scotland during the period between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of Great Britain rose to 1,82 million in total.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9 per cent higher than in the UK 5.5 per cent, according to the national statistical centre (ONS) figures.
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 people over three months and the number of employed persons is now 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74 per cent during the quarter, which is higher than the average in Great Britain by 73.5 per cent.
David Mundell, State Secretary of Scotland, commented on these latest figures: “The long-term plan of governance is to build a foundation for a stronger economy.
Almost exactly a year has passed since Scotland made an historic decision to remain part of Great Britain.
Over these 12 months, the Scottish labour market has improved, employment has increased and unemployment has fallen.
Why do I prove to be executed in Oklahoma?
If there is no legal intervention, later today I will see the man executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting on the viewers' papers at Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed with a deadly plague.
He has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
I received a request in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
I've started a terrible day nearing it.
So why would I do that?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
However, suppliers will have the opportunity to monitor executions in America, and since applications are often more than available, participants will be selected through a terrible value.
Oklahoma has reduced the sites reserved for the media to twelve.
Whoever you choose, you look at the event as cool.
I can't do it.
I'll be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I've also made contact with him through phone calls over the months and one two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like him.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so I can't have a notebook and a pen to record what I saw.
I just have to try and remember all the details.
On Twitter, one of the Oklahoman journalists accused me of being neutral.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner the way he wants it, and you'll be able to participate.
I chose the reporter.
He admitted that he could've put his word better, but he still thinks what I'm doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I have said and written.
He won't tell me what I'm supposed to write, and I wouldn't do it even if he said it.
I've told him that he can remove me from his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to write about it.
If Glossip dies, he believes that publicity will help the trend against the death penalty.
Huffington Post reporter Kim Bellware is next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to the podcast broadcasts I've made.
I'm not going through all the details here again.
I can't be sure to say that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Trees' murder would in any case make him guilty of aid.
But I believe that there is a very strong possibility that he has not committed murder.
I am sure that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I believe his execution is wrong.
And so this is the perspective I'm looking at for him to die.
I can't say I'm totally neutral.
There will be other journalists who will take care of it.
I'll give you a description of what it feels like to watch a man I like die unnecessaryly.
The man was lured away from the Canning River after a Russian police station.
The Canning Vale officer remained dry when he lured him out of the Canning River.
From Perth, a man's attempt to mislead the police from his cans went wrong when he found himself off the beach, just a few feet from the ancient water from the police officer who tried to gently drag him back to the beach.
On Tuesday, the Canning Vale police were invited to Beckenham for an unauthorized intrudement.
When they found the suspect, this was trying to mislead them by heading to the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
\"He was standing in the water saying, \"I'm not coming out, come get me,\" said senior sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to grow, so he used a safer tactics:
“The good people do funny things when they try to escape, ” told senior sergeant Castledine.
Masterfootballer Ben Cousins is a resembling example.
In 2006 the Cousins abandoned his car to avoid the blow and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He did not succeed in his company, but inspired locals to start the playful Ben Cousins biathlon design.
Peter Moody claims that the contractors tried to spy on him and threatened to stop competing.
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's suppliers tried to infiltrate his savings last year and that he threatened to stop competing immediately.
On Wednesday, Lady Tatai's late rejection of the day of the treatment was the last wet.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what is best for competition, and that he has been in a difficult situation after an inexplicable positive cocaine sample of Lidar.
He has kept his tongue in line with spy protests for a year and he did not want it to look like envy.
\"I was not going to say anything about this, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrated that everything will be destroyed at one time, \"Mody said.
They knew it was going on.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with sanctions, and I have to live with what I have said.
I'm gonna go home tonight and sleep well.
I want the head up and I want the owners to think that I'm doing the best I can for them.
When they start thinking differently, then I don't have to go back as coach anymore.
Then I'd have to consider what I'm doing to my license.
In the past, Moody dropped the bomb at the cracking.com site interview where he told me that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable stables.
\"A few years ago, Terry Bailey, Doyle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in the room with a man, and I'm gonna name him when I asked him, and they offered him a job with my savings if he cares about what I'm doing there.
They obviously think I'm a cheater.
If that's the case, they should be able to separate their lawyers, for they have failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moode, current Chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at that time and are clear about it today.
Should I start to think that this is going to be personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to man up and perhaps transfer responsibility to others other than the trainers about what's going on in the field?
Am I harmful to the industry?
Am I so harmful to the industry?
Maybe that's what people think.
Maybe they'll have to take my license and push me aside, and I don't even think that what I'm saying now might not make them think that.
But now I'm at the point that I don't care anymore, and it's gonna make me sick.
I'm really sorry about that.
I pressure them to make a decision that is their responsibility.
I have family support, and I can turn my back on this.
The frustration of the coach has increased with a long-term drug investigation in Lidar, and late rejection led him to say that he could be hurried over his license table.
Moody, the best known for coaching undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called on the day-to-day treatment rule to be \"spoiled\" after the mud or clay have been placed on horse feet, which is illegal.
It's against the rules of competition.
I have to take full responsibility for it, he said.
One of my employees, in a mistake, laid it on his foot.
It could have had a grave last night.
It could've had it yesterday, like it was.
It was on the day of the race.
There may be a three-month restriction on competition in the face of antitrust treatment, from which the operators started the investigation.
It's a joke.
People who draw up these rules don't know anything about a horse.
“All of us understand that the rules are needed, but this has gone too far,” said Moody.
In Cobram, the accused driver of a traffic bombing was arrested
The police have arrested a man who was guilty of a traffic runaway after the weekend of the biker in Cobram.
The biker was transported by air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital hospital after he got serious injuries when the car hit him on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
The police told me that the driver drove away and didn't stop to help the injured biker.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Natalia reported himself to the police in Shepparton.
He will be accused of not stopping in an accident, of failure to provide assistance, and of other traffic violations.
The biker, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in the hospital and his condition is stable.
Melbourne Storm Team Coach Craig Bellamy attacking competitors on the button claims
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticised the two NRL-rugbyligian masters' arguments that his team's fights would be part of the line.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said that the referees had allowed the Storm button on their own when it suddenly won the final cartel in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely covered his reference to Storm after it won the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night in the final bear. Bennett invited the game to Rugbyliiga's show window and said that two teams in Queensland were not very excited.
Bellamy was defending the battles of his team and said that they were just focusing on contact.
Bellamy added that his trust added two leading coach criticisms to Storm, because it means they're afraid to lose their team.
\"This is always the talk I didn't hear about Trent Robinson talking about the button when we lost them 24-2, Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can assure you that we haven't changed anything in our defence systems or technology all year. In the last six weeks, we've just been putting pressure on contact in the fights, and it's made us succeed.
Trent's been on the team for three years, and he's obviously got a great team coaching, so he's probably not used to losing, and this was a little shock for him.
It's funny how this always comes up this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of a exciting rugby, recalling that Bennett's coached St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing a \"tylsäst\".
Wayne's talking about exciting rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his game on Saturday night to our game on Friday night and to tell us how exciting their game was, Bellamy said.
I remember 2010 how St George was often criticised for being a boring team, and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he's got a team that can play rugby that we find exciting, especially when he has fast young friends.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have its type of players.
He brought it up on the side of 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team has no friends like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt to play like that.
I am more confident when they say such things because they are a little concerned about playing against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as opposed to important games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game between Storm and Roosters was more pompous than between the Broncos and the cowboys.
The Broncos game was certainly a good game, I haven't looked at it yet, but how did it end? 16-12?
Our game was 20-18, so we had two goals more, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it exciting to break the line of defense and not make the goal?
For me, it's about guidelines.
If they mention us, it means we can play against them somewhere.
Stormilla is free this weekend because they have already won the right to a home game, either with North Queensland Cowboys or with Cronou Sharks, next Saturday night's pre-final in AAMI Park.
For a Serbian man, you'll bet 200 grand on a drug charge.
A man at risk of a possible lifelong holding company of 40 cocaine kilograms smuggled into Queensland has been released against 200 000 dollars of guarantee.
29-year-old Marko Maximovic is one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police had traced 100 kilos of drugs to Solay Jah, who came to South America through Vanuatu, and was executed in August in Coomera.
Maximovic was seen meeting other accused boatmen all morning, and then he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where the police found 40 kilos of drug from the Toyo Echo truck.
Although Maximovic is threatening the potential lifelong business of a cocaine holding company, his lawyer claimed that there is no evidence that Maximovic tried to hold the entire amount and that he could have been in the cafe for absolutely innocent reasons.
Peter Flanagan, the Supreme Judge of Justice, was concerned that Maxovic was trying to escape.
He has solid connections to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often. He told the court on Wednesday.
In the case of the criminal court, Maxovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered a $ 200 000 guarantee to ensure his release.
“With regard to both persons’ statements, it is clear that setting the amount of the EUR 200 000 guarantee is a real financial burden for them, ” said Judge Flanagan.
But it alone was not enough to prevent him from appearing before justice, he warned.
Maxovic was granted guarantees on the condition that he surrenders his passports both in Australia and Serbia, reports daily to the police and adheres to his ban on outlets between night and morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to attract pedophiles to send pictures
Pedophile used a 11-year-old girl's phone asking for pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl when sleeping with this phone and then logged in to the online communications service where Hogg received numerous unsolicited images of children sent by another user.
She woke up later, found that the phone was missing and found it in Hogg's hand sleeping.
She studied her phone and found shocking messages, and then she immediately told her mother.
When the police arrived, they saw five photos, researched the computers on the site, and found some very impressive online searches on the search warrants that were used to find unspoken images taken from children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this to get pedophiles on the Internet before he pretended to be a cop to scare them.
The Fiscal depute, Eilith Robertson, told the Dundeen Sheriff Court: “He said it was an addiation - that he was dependent on the fear of people.
He admitted that he had performed the tombs on the computer but said that they had been made only because he wanted to pretend to be a cop so that he could scare the pedophiles.
He was asked about the discussions with an unknown person who sent him photos, as well as when Hogg asked the person to send additional images.
Hogg said this was just for bait purposes.
He said that after drinking, it's sick, and he wants to watch pictures of rape and murder.
Robertson added: “When the girl found the pictures of her phone, she yelled at her mother, sneezed, and cried.
My mother saw unspoken pictures on the phone and then met the defendant.
She was interviewed, and she told me that the defendant had used the computer and Playstation to talk to the girls who looked younger.
Hogg, a 23-year-old in Ward Road, admitted that he was guilty of producing or taking images of unspoiled children on the 14th of June of last year, in violation of his taboo on the 25th of January of this year, and had not come to trial on 24 March of this year.
The defense attorney, Gregor Sim, asked that Hogg not be identified as a sexual offender, as it can be claimed that his crime was not a ‘ significant sexual element’.
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal postponed the sentence to October in order for the social measure to have time to prepare the background reports.
Hogg was granted guarantees in this case, but in other ongoing cases he has been arrested before processing.
He was added to the sexual offender's register before the day of the judgment.
Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe gave the wrong speech to Parliament
The oldest African leader, Mugabe, fell earlier this year at the steps leading to the talker high.
He wasn't hurt, but the video of the crash spread like a virus in social media.
Parliament's opening points were also inspired by the arguments of the opposition's legislators that they had been sent with anonymous kill threats that warned them of bouting Mugabe during his speech.
In the last month, they failed and interrupted him in brief when he held the country's talk to Parliament - which speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) group discipline supervisor Innocent Gonese said the text messages of the seven opposition politicians who received their mobile phones that warned them not to disturb Mugabe's speech.
“Numero, from which the message was sent, does not respond, but the title of the message is “death”, Gonese told the journalists after Mugabe spoke.
It warned the relevant members that the immunity will end in Parliament, and when they come out, Parliamentary immunity will not be in force.
The group discipline officer said that the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is under the influence of threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard reduces up to 30 000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is preparing to cut between 25 000 and 30 000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-reorganization efforts in business services.
Later this year, HP will be divided into two listed companies, distinguishing between its computer and printer business and its faster growing business equipment and service activities.
The expected job cuts bring costs of around $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, the HP release said.
\"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for Hewlett Packard Enterprise,\" said Meg Whitman, the HP President and CEO, who will lead the unit after the division.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than today’s CFP, and we will have a wide and deep range of services that will help companies move into a new business,” said Whitman.
As a separate company, our opportunity to respond to the evolving needs of our customers around the world is better than ever.
The annual turnover of Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be over USD 50 billion, and it will focus its production on unaltered integrated technology solutions for companies, will be reported in the company's press release.
Jako breaks down the company that Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, who graduated from Stanford University University, founded in the 1930s to produce electrical supplies.
HP has undergone a huge reorganization to cope with the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the second largest computer manufacturer in the world and one of the largest technology brands in the United States, and its distribution is the last sector based on the belief that companies that are strictly limited are better off.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says that teammates need to support the injured Jack Wilshere before Dinamo Zagreb's tie.
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshire that it is only September now and assuming that he is going to go on with his rehabilitation as planned, there is no reason why he would not be playing again by Christmas.
In this best case, Wilshire will miss at least four games in England, and given its background, it is uncertain whether he will participate in the next summer's European Championships.
The biggest pity in this latest problem is that the end of the last season of Wilshere was strong after the one-legged, and he remembered his old sharpness before the beginning of the season.
\"This kind of injury does not threaten the career,\" Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't get well.
It's not strange.
It was just an accident.
It has nothing to do with her ankles or previous injuries she's had.
This may be true from a medical point of view, but, as the Wenger also admitted, the player trying to return in the middle of the way is always at the risk of additional injuries.
The design also has an uncomfortable model.
Studies by Premier Injuries Ltd show that Wilsher has had 23 different injuries since he debuted six years ago.
In addition, during the last five seasons, he has only played 65 games in the Arsenal 157 league.
In view of Arsenal's wider overall since 2007-08, for six seasons, it has been one of the teams of Valoliiga who have lost the most days because of the injury.
Wenger's gonna give a witch's chance, but Arsenal believes that their improvement last season will continue with the statistics on injury.
“The ability to recover from the injury may be a season, when you need to strengthen your body and acquire competition, ” said Wenger.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope that his body will grow firm, I am sure that it will happen, and that he will get the career he deserves.
Wenger prepares to recycle his team when Arsenal starts his master's league game on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, then playing on Saturday at Chelsea and next Wednesday against Tottenham Hotspur.
Hector Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are probably on the start.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud to replace Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
I'm trying to balance the balance and give a breathtaking tour to the players who need it,\" Wenger said.
Although the Arsenal is a clear extension of the F block, the maximum stadium in Zagreb is the most frightening in Europe.
In addition, Dinamo has not lost 41 matches since they had produced their own non-Invincible campaign in the last season.
The stadium was severed on Tuesday night by an earthquake that was at 3.2 Richter's scale.
It was a tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes that Arsenal has learned the last season about the surrender of the Masters' league against Monaco, and he is motivated by an ever - distant dream leading the team to its first European Cup victory.
This motivation is huge, Wenger said.
Arsenal has never achieved it.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I can be realistic.
We're ambitious, but we're not dreamers.
FriendsFest: a comedy series that taught us serious things about male friendship
It is striking how similar descriptions are not in series, especially given the need for men to open up more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men higher than 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the greatest cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In the attempt to deal with the problem of Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced for 2015 men's year. The aim was to challenge a culture that prevent men from seeking help when needed.
It is at the heart of meeting this challenge.
The recent study involved more than 2,000 upper and upper secondary school pupils who showed depression symptoms. According to the study, the possibility of a person recovers doubled if a high enough percentage of his friends were - healthy -
Similarly, those who were not depressed, the likelihood of the emergence of possible mental health problems was polered if they had healthy friends in mind.
But in order for friendship to function, it must first be available.
Through this social media, in the time of communication, the style goes past content, and the answer is often more important than relevant contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, happy and successful, although in fact isolation is controlled.
The values that psychologists call external: money, imago, social status, all this takes place at the expense of personal growth and friendship of internal values, which are more deeply affected by our mental health.
And as the billionaire video game developer recently explained, money really doesn't get a bigger happiness.
The fineness of Fredie was just that it turned this focus on his head.
No character defined their work, but rather their personality, which was clearly separated by interaction as friends.
Joey and Chandler have a lot of hugs, moments in comfortable chairs, watching football, Ross bored Rachel, their humor came out of the knowledge that yes, men can identify all this, even though they often hesitate to study their feelings completely.
As the Samaritans volunteer worker explained to me: ... when I heard people who are depressed and self-destructive, I really understood how the smallest interaction with a friend can be improved.
Men who contact us often find that they can't talk to friends.
The old idea of getting across the street is strong, as is the feeling that if problems arise, we will see it as weak.
Fredit is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer longer-term survival methods.
It highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
Although my neutral, external position on the other end of the phone helps people at a desperate moment, long-term support comes from a close, personal family and friends network.
And if you're taking part in the Comedy Central FriendsFesti this weekend, and all the description sites have been redesigned for the celebration, why don't you take your friends to the coffee in Central Perki.
Or even better if you see someone in Starbucks alone, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
The Freds will be sent to Comedy Central at the end of the beginning, all 236 episodes, participate in #FriendsFest
Di Maria's going to paint and help PSG get Malmö to the side.
Angel Di Maria and Blaise Matuid and Edinson Cavan celebrates paintings against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria made a goal in his master's league debut, helping the PSG to pass the Swedish team on Malmö's Tuesday.
Down the match report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line when Paris Saint-Germain finally started his master's league with a nice 2-0 win against Malmo in Parc des Princess on Tuesday.
Di Maria made the Masters' league debut in less than four minutes, pointing the way to the French leaguers, but the team lost a number of opportunities before finally adding its first trip to Cavan's attack on the 61st minute.
Paris, which is in the same section A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against Sweden's leader, since the game was not just a follow-up, but also an improvement in their last three round of games leading to their quarterly equations.
But even though the PSG took the score, it was not a classic game, because the Laurent Blanc team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic, lost a place in front of the goal and later changed from the field. Malmo is his old hometown team and the team in which he started his great career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win in the master’s league at home or at guests, so 2-0 wins create problems for the opponent and looks good in the statistics, and there is a good start, even though there are things that we have to take this season to hi, Blanc said.
This is good for you.
We wanted to win and win, even though I am concerned that we did not succeed in making one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team after three changes made after the team stayed in a 2-2 game in Ligue 1 home game against Bordeaux this weekend, but in the fourth minute he stayed in the shadow of Di Maria.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentinian Slayer was named as a man who will take the PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why, when Marco Verratt's bait was caught behind Malmö's defense line, he hit the back corner of the network of the beautiful finishing Johan Wiland.
However, if someone expected a simple and big victory from the PSG, he was disappointed.
Malmö was a blind opponent. It won Celtic in a match when he reached this level, its opening field has nine international players and five men's defense and two players in a deep middle field.
But the team didn't offer much more than Nikola Djordjic's shot on the side of the attack by 34 minutes, who passed the button from Kevin Trapp's goal.
On the other hand, the PSG suffered from lost inputs and bad endings, in particular Ibrahimovic, which failed in all five companies only during the first half of the period and after that he was disappointed when Cavani put the ball in touch with Ibrahimovic immediately at the beginning of the second half of the year.
However, he was much more effective in working for his colleagues, and Ibrahimovic just sent a tour of the tour, which fell around the Wiland painting site in 52 minutes.
In the end, after an hour of the game, the sixth goal of the season was hit by a Californian Cavan after Ibrahimovic had made it to the left of Maxwell's cross-flood.
It ended with Malmö's wishes to get back to the game, and only Wiland's brilliant fight on David Luis' direct kick was to keep the final numbers down before the change of Ezequiel Lavezz goal was completely abandoned at the end of the game.
Mr. Age Hareide later admitted that the PSG was as high as his team. The Norwegian said: “The last game of the Master’s league was in December last year.
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not the same level.
It's not enough to fight.
I'll pick up the hat for Paris.
This was a great game for them.

Matt Damon reduces the difference in filming
Matt Damon and the African filmmaker Effie Brown, who discussed the difference that Damon said is not necessary behind the scenes.
During the HBO Sunday night Project Greenlight period, the actor interrupted Brown’s need for different perspectives as a result of the project’s selected script for a dark chief.
“When we talk about differences, it will be taken into account when choosing actors in the film, not in the series,” Damon claimed.
The shocked Brown reacts unrulyly to the injured, the comments “Oho! Wow. Okay, while the comments of the Martian actor remained in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and Farrelly's brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the series's finalists.
“I want to ask people to think about who the director then is how they treat Harmony’s personal character, ” Brown said.
The only dark character is a whore that's hit by her white mate.
The Dear White People's producer called for film management rights to the finalists, Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon said that their guidance could end up giving us something we didn't want.
When the debate was sent, the social media blew up Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPoon expressed his anger with the film magazine by writing: “Matt Damon speaking on the only dark person in the room and explaining to him the difference is NINE VALKES that happens.
Twititus collected over 5,000 retwits and 4000 hinds after his publication.
Damon's comments are at a time where the exact racial performance in the media is at the heart of the social debate.
Since the White Police killed Michael Brown, a teenager in 2014, The Black Lives Matter movement spread underground and invited lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices.
In February, the singer Prince referred to the winner of the Grammy Prize as the winner of the year's album candidates.
“Albume still has meaning, ” he said.
As with books and black animals, albums are still important.
The leaders of the Black Lives Matter recently published an opinion to answer the question of Fox News TV show Elisabeth Hasselbeck as a group of enemies.
“The Black Lives Matter Network is a love group,” said the leaders.
It was also reported that Damon was involved in it among entertaining, producers and media modules, who have been invited to visit the pope to discuss the picture of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is unclear whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope.
First American Ninja Harrior crowned
On Monday, the first athlete who won the American Ninja Harrior tournament and received a million prize.
In just the seven-year competition programme, which has been decided upon, there has never been a competitor who would have survived all the parts of the programme's obstacle path.
In the last episode of Sarja, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, survived the last round.
The last task was to climb about a 23-metre rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and solved the challenge at his time, which made him the first athlete of all time, who explained to America's Ninja Warrior's dazzling fourth part.
Caldiero gave the interview to E!News after the difficult gain and was still in shock for winning a million dollars' principal prize.
“It’s great to think about this when I never earned or lived as much as $100,000 a year, ” Isac told E! after his big raise.
So all of a sudden... you can't even imagine what it's gonna be like... the future is unknown.
The production director Kent Weed had a chance to talk to The Hollywood Reporter about the story and why Britten won't get more reward money, even though he's the first competitor of all time who's managed to pass the track.
According to the rules, money goes to the fastest person.
If more people pass, they get the money that has the fastest time, Weed said.
Even though money is a great reward and changes in life, he still gets the feeling of great satisfaction.
I don't think he's gonna feel a grudge for that.
She's just so happy that she's done what she did.
His fans have praised him.
He's a great guy. He's a good family father.
He's a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, \"If anyone had to win me, I am happy that it was Isaac.
And I believe that Isaac would have thought the same way if this had been the other way around.
American Ninja Harrior returns to the eighth season, whose descriptions will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers sneaked past the Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS-- The other half of the season has not been very funny to Detroit Tigers.
Tigers used to be one of the best baseball teams, but now it's the last one in the American League Central division.
Tigers played his role as a joker perfectly on Tuesday, when it won the Minnesota Twins 5-4 Target Field.
Twins lost the opportunity to rise from Houston Astros to another American League wild card.
For Detroit, the game was, for at least one night, returning to a six-letter H-word that had been very difficult to reach most of the last half of the season.
\"All wins are fun, no matter how they get them,\" said Brad Ausmus, Team Manager of Tigers.
Mr. Alfredo Simon, who is the feeder of Tigers, continued his early attack aid, when Detroit ran three times in the first two shifts, and then once in the sixth and again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) threw 6 1/3 in a pair and released three runnings.
This was just his third quality wave in the last nine games.
I just want a strong ending for this year, Simon said.
It's hard for an alternate to feed every game, and that's why I want to go deep into the game.
Victor Martinez, a member of the Tigers, was hit three times, and he made it possible to have two runnings that were his first beatings after August.
This was Martinez's first three nights after he hit four against Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
He's a good man. He's a good man.
He looked good (in punch exercises), looked significantly better at the punch exercises and continued the same pattern in the game.
Twins were three runnings behind the latter half of the seventh round, and it was their best chance to get back to the game.
Sentter Byron Buxton started the switch by hitting twice out on the left line.
On the right, Aaron Hicks went home with one nest of his hands, and Simon got burned right into the second nest of player Brian Dozier before Simon was replaced with a left-wing Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Maueria, the only player against the only one, the pre-initiator Miguel said, who pulled the two nests off the left from Drew VerHagen.
When two runners were on the field and to correct the runner's number two, VerHagen got the third floor of Trevor Plouffen to hit a double-game leading painting.
This was the record of the main series: 27 times this season, when Plouffe hit a double.
After Detroit had received a security drink at the ninth start, Mauer pulled two punches against the Tigerslocker Bruce Rondon, and the situation was 5-4.
However, the right-hand player burned the Word in three feeds in his fifth rescue.
At first, Detroit used Phil Hughes in rust.
Tigers got three runnings in the first two seconds of the right-hand veteran player who got out of the injured list before the game was out of the way because of the infection of the lower part of the month.
\"It's obvious that I didn't want to start this kind of thing, Hughes said, \"but when I went to play, I felt more comfortable, and I felt that I had done some nice feedings on the third round. \"
After Hughes caught the first nest of the starter, he gave the second nest player Ian Kinsler to move on one by one.
The walking of J.D. Martinez on the right side brought Victor Martinez to the turn of two pieces, who took himself into the middle field and caused the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut off his 0-21 pipe while the runners were in good running positions.
Nick Castellanos, a third-party player, continued to hit the right and make another run, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was rejected in trying to move on to the third-party.
Tigers continued in the second round and received one fire, two nests in the situation of the kidnapper from James McCann and two pieces, one nest in the situation of one inch from Anthony Goselta, and then the situation was 3-0.
\"It was an important shot,\" Paul Molitor, the team leader of Twins, said.
He didn't hit very well, but he flew to the right.
Hughes began to be in the feedholes and fed an unscrupulous third pair, after which he replaced the right-hand pursuer A.J. Achter.
Hughes was counted three runnings of six punches and a walk with four fires.
HEREBY RECOMMENDS: The real-time feeder of Tigers, Anibal Sanchez, had to be thrown out into his shoulder because of a knife.
He's being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who's been cutting off Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the list of injured persons since the middle of August because of his shoulder wound, but he had to return on Wednesday.
While Sanchez is out there, the left-hand feeder Daniel Norris will come from the injured list to start with Twins.
Norris' statistics in Tigers are 1-1 in four initiatives after David Price was replaced by a left-hand passer on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20 for the Russian musculoskeletal of the right wet stomach.
The three games of Tigers and Twins will end on Wednesday at the Target Field.
Norris (2-2-, 4.43 ERA) is the right-hand feeder of Minnesota against Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi calls for a wider opening of the economy to the world
The economy must help the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told the group on Tuesday, which is to guide the reform.
\"It should be committed to attract foreign funding and expertise and develop transparency policy,\" he said, speaking at the 16th meeting of the General Reform Group.
Support for transparency at the same time as reforms are moving forward with new movement and vitality, as well as creating new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Group approved a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access, a reduction in border inspection principles, a call for private equity by state-owned companies, and a revision of the housing registration system.
According to the opinion, a negative list will be created which will name the sectors and companies that cannot be invested in.
The system is gradually being tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The change must be noted, as it plays a greater role on the market in resource allocation, ensuring a legal corporate environment and making the market more transparent, stated in the opinion.
The government will also reduce its management to the power it distributes to companies, ensuring that companies themselves decide how to operate their business.
The opinion also said that China would allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for developing regional growth.
In order to open up sectors governed by government, more sectors will be opened to private donors.
\"The Agency does not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of companies financed by foreigners and provide them with better services,\" the opinion said.
Furthermore, the search process for permanent residence permits, green cards, foreign residents will be facilitated by optimising requirements and reducing the search process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of professional qualifications for lawyers and the support of professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang, as well as the older leaders Liu Yunshan and Zang Gaoli, in the opinion published after the meeting.
