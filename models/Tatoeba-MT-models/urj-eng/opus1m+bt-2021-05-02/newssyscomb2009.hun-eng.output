The winner of the right-hand populists in Austria has a total of 29 percent
The fact that two parties of the grand coalition have been made to date has led to a marked decline and a strong strengthening of the populist parties on the right, according to the first preliminary results, of the pre-embracing parliamentary elections in Austria on Sunday.
The Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) where the current President, Wilhelm Molterer, seriously insided, suffered particularly severe losses.
On the other hand, President of the Association for the Future of Austria (BZÖ) Karintia, Governor of the Province of Karintia, Jörg Haider, is preparing for a victory return to national politics.
Based on the preliminary results, the country's strongest party will remain the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) at 29.8 per cent of the votes, but it lost 5.5 per cent compared to the recent elections in 2006.
The ÖVP has even worsened, which loses nearly nine percent of the votes by 25.6%.
These are the worst results of both great parties in the history of Austria after the war and, in particular, in the People's Party leading up to the forthcoming elections, the result is literally disastrous.
At the beginning of July, when the ÖVP coalition left, the population party had a significant advantage before SPÖ according to public opinion polls.
However, the voters have apparently been punished for letting the government fail.
In the first reactions to the results, speculation has been expressed on the possible withdrawal of the party president of Wilhelm Molterer and current cellar.
The observers believe that this may take place on Monday at the extraordinary meeting of the Parliament.
This development is likely to facilitate the ever more likely exit from the election result, i.e. the renewal of the large coalition of SPÖ and ÖVP.
However, given the strengthening of the two 'right-wing populist parties' - the Austrian Freedom Party (FPÖ) in advance, 18% of the votes and 11% of the votes were acquired - the Social Democrats expressed fear of repeating the year 1999, when the People's Party agreed with the populists (the FPÖ was united at the time of 2005), which even led to sanctions on behalf of the European Union.
Haider, who has already declared that he is willing to cooperate with any party, and I assume that he can return to Vienna to national politics, will obviously count on this solution.
The Green Party has also reached Parliament, but some of its lost popularity, and the Austrian political parties have fallen from third place to fifth place.
None of the other parties crossed the limit of four hundred and did not reach Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: You can heat out Indian relations
If it were not possible to solve the problem of Czech scientists who have been present for illegal gathering, the Czech Minister for Foreign Affairs Karel Schwarzenberg said that there would be some confusion in Czech-India relations.
The minister published this in New York after meeting with Pranab Mukherji, his Indian partner today.
“If this did not work out, yes, a certain delay would occur, ” she concluded, following the meeting that was provided by Czech incentives.
After the trial, Mukherji told me that the executive power could be difficult to intervene.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was dismissed and sentenced to punishment, the central government could negotiate the local leadership of the daikeeleg, whose jurisdiction the case was.
“His problem could be solved, ” said the minister.
However, for Emil Kučera, sentenced to three years in prison, Mukherji, it would be best to appeal to the Supreme Court.
Then you could apply for a release for bail, and you would be free to wait for judgment, explained.
Schwarzenberg has demonstrated that his partner expressed similarity during the trial.
“ He offered an appeal to the Supreme Court, it would be possible to rescue him, ” said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way to intervene in the whole case is to provide the Czech party, the convicted person, \"compensated legal support\", mentioned the Indian minister.
At the same time, he said that the Indian party would already provide them with such help.
“Our main interest in India is to maintain the best relations with many years’ leave.
The Indians recognise this too, mentioned Schwarzenberg.
At the same time as he told the JRC, his partner stressed that the Czech Republic had a major role to play in the problem of Czech encyclologists.
“ In fact, we consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists a serious mistake, ” reported.
The question of whether the Indian party was given a promise to deal with the case was that the minister missed the answer.
“ I had a lot of promises, ” she noted.
Czech judges in the fight for the seabed
It goes to the wall electronic map on which Australia and neighbouring sea areas can be seen.
But you don't care about the part of the land, but a point disappearing in the blue of the ocean.
“The island belongs to Australia, along with its neighboring seabed.
During the area as much as the continent itself, says Luigi Santosoosso Italian lawyer, who belongs to the thirty-member working party of the United Nations Division Ocean and Sea Law.
His boss, Mikulka Václav Czech lawyer, director of Division, monitors the explanation, which sometimes complements.
Work and enthusiasm are ruled here.
The seabed is a rich, barely known world in natural resources.
Oil, curc and other minerals can be found here, but also unidentified living organisms, which, for example, may be the key to developing anti-cancer drugs.
Seabeds greater than land
The coastal states today are intensively applying for new areas under the sea.
According to the United Nations Convention, they exercise their rights as agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay of Jamaica.
It is primarily the area of the so-called continent, which often extends up to a few hundred kilometers from the shores of that country.
According to the Convention, such a country has exclusive rights to all sources of the continental base.
‘Simplified, the part of the seabed and the bottom layer of the continent, which is the natural continuation of the underground land.
At the coasts of the sea, often two hundred nautical miles [200 nautical miles] across the borders of the sea, it goes beyond the economic zone,” explains Mikulka.
The application submitted by that country to the Commission setting out the external borders of the Convention shall be accompanied by a number of comprehensive scientific and technical documentation based on costly research and measurement.
This is a result of many years of preparatory work.
\"Our task is to provide legal and professional assistance to the Committee.
The Committee has so far negotiated five applications, Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
So far, only the three countries mentioned have succeeded,” adds Mikulka.
In the world, Australia's success has recently been echoed, which has first significantly enlarged its sub-sea country.
But New Zealand has also won - the seabed area for the Committee is about 1.6 million square kilometers, which is six times larger in the country's territory.
Both countries invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits resulting from the future use of the seabed will, in their hope, be invaluable.
Other countries are also constantly submitting their applications.
The “Montego Bay Convention” can be done within ten years of its ratification.
Where the continent ends, it begins with the territory of the oceanbed declared by the Convention on “the common inheritance of humanity. ”
There's no single country here.
The right to produce in this area shall be granted by the international institution established by the Convention.
“ However, the seabed is not Klondike, ” says overrun Director Mikulka, saying that “one of his areas have been legally surrounded and their regime is laid down in the contract. ”
Czechs on the Pacific
Some of the seabeds are now Czech Republic.
This former Eastern block is shared with other countries within the framework of the Common Organisation of Interoceanmet.
This organisation, as with investors from some other countries, received the status of the so-called ‘murder investor’ under the Convention in 1991.
He has been entitled to produce in the area of ClarionClipperton between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati on the Pacific.
The area examined by the investor is something bigger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom of the sea is a copy of the Tatra beneath the sea.
“A total of 75 000 square miles can be grown.
The area is a rich scene of polymetal coins containing nickel, foxes, cobalts and manganese,” says another lawyer, the price Pakshi Rajan.
Rober Sandev, a member of the TV macedón, presents another example of concretion.
It reminds me of a potato or some fantasy with a lifelong spell for Golemet.
Some special forces were present at the hostage release
The Egyptian government asked Germany for help to resolve the hostage crisis, and the experts came.
When the situation became a comeback, special units were ready, but they did not.
There are increasing details of the release of the eleven European tourists kidnapped in Egypt.
German Special Forces participated in the rescue operation, according to the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Home Affairs.
In addition to the experts of the German Federal Army, GSG 9, the German Federal Police, and the Federal Criminal Office, were also members of staff, as well as the logistics experts of the German Technical Service at the place of release.
According to the information from the Ministry's speakers on Monday night, the German forces were not required, however, because hostages were allowed to run their prisoners and then fled when they recognized the signs of violence.
The Egyptian Government accepted the aid offered by Germany to involve it as a support force on the ground.
“ Fortunately, there was no success, ” said the spokesperson of the Federal Ministry of Interior.
The attackers were kidnapped from five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman, and eight tourist groups of their Egyptian escorts in the southern part of Egypt on September 19.
Following the kidnapping of South Egypt in the desert area, hostages were strangled in the border area of Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The existence of hostages remains unclear until now, as well as details of the release of hostages or any ransom payments.
In the meantime, the fugitives arrived safely in Cairo.
Steinmeier reported that the released hostages were protected by the German embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, no information was provided regarding their return to Germany.
According to the “Bild” newspaper, the five tourists and the special forces are arriving in Germany on the German Air Forces Airbus last Tuesday.
The U.S. Parliamentary House rejects the rescue package.
The U.S. Congress House has failed by a small majority the $700 billion rescue package proposed for money markets.
Dow Jones fell deep.
The U.S. Parliamentary House with 227 votes against 206 votes against the government's rescue package for money markets.
Despite calls from the US President George W. Bush and the leading politicians in both parties, there was no available majority of the programme to contain the chaos in the money markets.
The supporters were desperate to convince the critics of the need for a $700 billion package during a dramatic operation.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the Democratic Party, called for the representatives, even if the plan is not popular.
“Seeing political support for avoiding something that has not yet come to pass, ” he recognized.
Dow Jones has still dropped more than 6 percent and 600 points during the vote.
Investors were concerned that the public rescue package could fail.
The index rose shortly before the end of the vote and then fell again after the failure to publicise.
Experts report additional serious turbines on international money markets.
To enter into force, both the Assembly and the Senate should be approved.
The directors register more and more reservations.
It's a good winter for German travel operators.
According to a study, the traffic for the following months has increased significantly compared to the previous year, with more than 30 percent for the winter season.
Despite the weak conjunctural prospects, the Germans' travel interest in the study did not fall.
In the winter season bookings, travel agencies accounted for 31 percent traffic growth compared to the previous year, which was reported in Berlin on Monday by the German Travel Association (DRV).
According to the GfK Market Research Institute, the number of bookings for autumn months is already higher.
The turnover of travel agencies in October was 11 per cent round in October 2007, reported by the DRV.
These results are based on GfK data, which assesss the monthly booking data of 1200 German travel agents and then extrapolates them to the entire market.
The Institute took into account the travels booked by the end of August 2008.
Due to the poor dollar price rate, travels to the US were particularly sought - reported by the DRV.
Here the rate of bookings rose round by one third.
In addition, the aims of the Germans, particularly popular destinations, are Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as domestic countries.
Mostly the organized roads were looking for us, said Klaus Laepple, president of the DRV.
As a result of rising energy and food costs, for organised roads, costs for passengers can be calculated more quickly than for individualised travels.
Passengers can save money with reservation discounts or all inclusive offers - added Laepple.
The booking rate for summer months was also very good, so, compared to the previous year, there will be another increase in traffic - although according to another study, less German tourists made their journey compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfeste
The repetitive Ballermann Slagers, literian corsets and design-arndlied celebrities.
Debuting the Wiesnen.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I are not really much like each other.
He's a blonde, a TV director, and he wears a flat-screen drend.
My hair is dark, I'm a student girl, and I bought my clothes in the furry.
One thing connects us: We're barely three minutes ago Wiesnen, we're already running into photographers and filling their memory cards - very flattering, and all this on my first visit to Wiesnen.
That's how we can make friends.
It seems that the cheap dirndli is fulfilling its destination.
As a Wiesn tourist from a white sausage, I still have a limit on public health.
But when you arrive at Theresienwies, it's not so bad.
Almost everyone wears drendles or leather pants; no one looks like a smile or awkward - everything's fine.
It's a weird look at my chocolate banana stand. It's just my dirndy rope.
A woman in Munich reminds me that I made the tie wrong: “You are free in the middle, you are a virgin, you’re a widow, you’re a widow in the right, you’re a widow in the back.
I secretly put the bow on the left from behind.
“ This is good, ” she says, “and laugh.
Others have a less boost around fine flirting techniques and wear a simple filter base, “I’m drunk to dress up, ” with a sign, and unspokenly showing their naked backs.
His name is Bob, a young man with exhibitionist traits, and he also visited Oktoberfest for the first time.
What you find very fantastic is long stretching away from the \"aaaaaaaaa\".
He's gonna tell me all this after he got rid of the contents of his previous sip.
Right next to one of the firefights everyone looks like trash.
So Bob is one of the most famous “waterers ”
Others are not so lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
By eight o'clock, the ambulances are going through the scene and taking care of the poor couples.
Patients always appear on the team - four of them carry a covered barrel from tent to tent at once.
This works as in most Wiesn visitors: Arrival empty, exit closed.
Who's lying in the liquor cologne under the pelvis doesn't look like it.
“ These are the ones who are completely ready, ” he shouts to me about my question, and then in the field.
The police have named the victim of the accident.
The police named the 63-year-old lady who hit a vehicle in Essex County and the hospital.
With the apartment at Chelmsford Road, Carole Paulson on Friday afternoon, the accident occurred at Shenfield Road, in town.
She was transported to a hospital called Queen's Hospital in Rome, but later she died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested for suspicion of reckless driving.
He's been released for bail ever since.
The diplomatic horizon of Turkey
Just before Turkey intended to join the European Union, European powers were burned from the desire to enter deep into the Turkish backland.
On the east side of Bosporus, perhaps just 20 steps from the European border, is one of the greatest relics of the failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha railway station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
At least that's what the passports write.
The building is surrounded by the ends of the perons, one of them in the front corner of each tower, and it looks like a German rural town hall.
The stone is dirty.
The whole building's a little dazzling.
However, it is evident from the inside of the store-shop, what a large-scale company had this most beautiful gate.
The station was opened in August 1908 by the German consortium, Anatolia-Baghund Corporation.
Germany, the late future of the conquests, through this railway from Damascus to Saudi Arabia, wanted to achieve its ambitions for the arrest of the Middle East.
The German conquest efforts were collapsing during World War I.
The railway lines were attacked by the parties of the Arabian Lawrence and Arab Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The British Communist Army has withdrawn from Egypt and has pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
The Hyderpasha station hasn't been any better.
In 1917 an ammo train exploded and destroyed the building's well-developed roof.
According to the Turkish sources, there was a sabotage operation.
Since then, history has slowly deteriorated.
At the same time, today, as the gate of the railway towards Anathelia and the entire eastern region - at least in symbolic terms - serves as a diplomatic horizon for Turkey.
The Government's Party of Justice and Development - the ACP - has developed a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the surrounding regions, caused by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
The new policy is metal-marked by commitment.
It is remarkable that the Turkish Government maintains good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian groups of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq, Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
I wanted to measure the parameters of the new foreign policy, so I boarded the Turkish capital, Ankara night train, to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the ACP, the Turkish Parliament, Suat Kinikoglu.
The next morning, after about ten and a half hours of strangulation, which at that time gave me the famous documentary about the old world, the rhythm of The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital.
However, the well-known Islamic roots of the AKP represent a paradox change in Turkish consensus.
This led to some suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
I went to the ACP Cathedral with a taxi, a ultra-modern, stone and steel, specifically designed for this purpose - which is in a developing suburban district, half ready for shopping and coffee houses.
Suat Kiniklioglu would have included a right-wing politician in any other European country.
He was wearing a belt, tie, and I'm sure he had another Blackberry.
\"The aim of the party's foreign policy is to help Turkey re-introduction into its immediate environment.
The Cold War covered the order, \"he said.
Turkey is isolated from its back.
He had to turn east and west today.
He couldn't choose from the two.
He had to open it both ways.
“ But it is possible that he would be forced to choose sooner or later, ” I asked.
“Tergy never wanted to get in front of a response, ”
He then stressed what almost everyone I spoke to here was almost mechanically repeating: Turkey, not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus and the countries around the Black Sea, has the same benefit for Europe and the United States as Turkey itself.
As if they wanted to convey the message that, in a sense, Turkey, together with Turkey, can reach Asia and the Middle East on those east railway lines.
When I was back at the Hydarpasha station, after another, mostly awake night, I thought of Herr Ritter and Herr Conura, the two German gentlemen who watched the reconstruction of this fancy building 100 years ago.
That they would have wondered if they knew that Europe's ambitions for the Middle East are now largely in Turkey's hands.
And as I was waiting for the ferry to take me back to Bosporus, I remembered that at that time, Turkey was called “a sick man of Europe. ”
At least then there was no question of which continent to demand this exciting country.
Remembering Life Ways: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Since 1962, as director of Guildford’s music director Vernon-Tod-Handley (Necrolog, Sept. 11) led the Philharmonic Orchestra and Kórus of Guildford.
On the basis of his urban musical plans, he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus, next year.
By the way, only under 21 years of age could have belonged to the singer, but when he sang his account in 1979, many of us were already at the end of our 20th year - we simply refused to take it from the choir.
The “Proteus” name (the name of the mythological variable) was in line with the determination and ability of the choir to cope with any bag they put in place - to be made by the Madriga or a piece of the Messiah; without a ghost or accompanied by a great orchestra.
The musical diversity of such a young choir was often amazing and always exciting, and we thanked the man whose inspiration for music remained unchanged over the years.
How often Todd told us that “Let the music speak to you, ”
He always said: “The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in the bag.
So sing it.
Karmester's technique was always fully understandable and accurate, but never more than a dictatorship or an overdosing.
Whatever the musical standards were, he always raised it.
John Frayn Turner wrote about him:
If you've ever lived as a conductor who should have been hit by a knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I was well acquainted with the two decades during which he led the Guildford Philharmonics from 1962 to 1982.
In the last 40 years, I've written criticism of over 100 concerts, but never, ever disappointed and often inspired them.
In Todd Handley, the size and the modesty, which is very rare.
He hated the leaders who, living with his words, were simply “with one or two well - known battleships all over the world ”
A lot of us will miss it.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
According to your William Woodruff (September 25) necrologist, he continued his economic history studies in Oxford in '1946, and in 1950 he became a scholarship to the Houblon-Norman research institute... while constantly preparing for his basic diploma, master's degree and PhD title.
This is from the authors of Woodruff’s work “Beyond Nab End”, but it is wrong.
Between 1946 and 1953, the economic history at the University of Nottingham, and then, under the leadership of Professor J. D. Chambers, he completed his PhD distribution of the British rubber industry, which was also awarded in 1958, under the title “The British rubber industry”.
In 1950-51, he actually stayed in the U.S. with a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and in the summer of 1952 at illusions, New York and Harvard universities.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and moved to Illinois.
It can't be known why Woodruff's career was pretty good at this time.
J. Vicente Resino on the Bay of Bourgeois
I recommend his exhibition “J. Vienne Resino-Flamenco and Life” because they are black and white, documentist photography impressive.
The ease and strength of them, as well as respect for the people in the photographs, have attracted my attention.
This exhibition can be passed by emotions.
Resino has come to realize the magical moments.
Second, the sales record at Honda's
In November, the Honduras will begin marketing the second generation Jazz.
It is true that the predecessor was already quite large on the road, but the design of the new model's internal areas is even wider than that.
This is combined with sophisticated mechanics, making driving more comfortable and increasing fuel savings.
evolution versus evolution.
That's how the second generation Handa Jazz looks.
Although the new Jazz looks very similar to its predecessor, many internal changes were carried out on it.
These include, for example, innovative design, new karosseries, larger sizes and new mechanics.
But before we move to a detailed description of the new model, we have to tell you that six years after the first generation of Jazz appeared on the market.
So, first of all, we can figure out that the Honduras has managed to renew this model in a shorter time than other manufacturers.
In Europe, Jazz is less known, but sales records are decided on other markets.
This is the market, for example, Japan, where Jazz was the most sought car brand in 2002 and this year in 2008.
In Japan, for example, almost a million copies of Jazz have been sold out of the market.
The second market was the Old Continent, an example of almost half a million sold over six years.
However, the Honduras will continue to increase traffic in the region with the new Jazz.
While in 2007, the Japanese company marketed 83,000 Jazz, the sales of 100,000 cars by 2009 would result in an increase of 17% on the European market.
Since 2002 the Spanish market has sold 8000 Jazzs, this represents 6.7% of the total turnover of the Landa in Spain.
In the case of the new generation, the leaders of the Spanish subsidiary will calculate the example given during a year 2000.
In fact, the arrival of the new Jazz will greatly mitigate the decline in the turnover of the Honduras in Spain.
The company’s representatives predict 22 000 copies sold by the end of this year, which represents a decrease of 4000 in 2007 data, i.e. 16%.
Despite the terms of sale, the Netherlands increased its market share in Spain, which increased to 1.8% compared to 1.6% last year.
I would also like to increase this rate by 2010 to 2%.
This can be achieved by introducing a new model.
This would have been the Insight, a five-door and compact size - 4370 mm long - hybrid from which the Japanese company would make up 200,000 worldwide each year.
According to the Japanese producer, 50% of Insight's market distribution would be carried out by the United States, while the remaining proportion would be distributed between the Old Continents and Japan.
The introduction of Insight's trade after the planned official currency presentation for January is due to take place in the first months of the year.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz became more spacious in all respects.
The length of 3900 mm (five cents longer), the width of 1690 mm (two cents wider) and the axis length increased five cents, i.e. 2500 mm.
Its height is unchanged 1520 mm.
In addition to the dimensions, the passenger space has become more spacious.
The larger internal space, on the one hand, is guaranteed by the new carousel and the fuel tank placed in the centre - this solution can be already known from the previous Jazz.
In addition, there was an increase in the capacity of the first generation of 399 litres, i.e. 19 litres.
Although it includes that these dimensions apply to the type 1,4 engine, since the trunk of the 1,2-Honda Jazz is 379 litres.
Some external modifications can also be discovered, such as rear LED lamps or the optional panraman ceiling, as well as easier access to the rear seats.
In addition, the opening angle of the doors to the rear seats was raised to 80 degrees, compared to the first opening angle of Jazz 67 degrees.
The second generation Jazz engines are new.
At the beginning of its rotation, this small model can be ordered with two engines, 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Thanks to the i-VTEC technology, the consumption of both resources is more favourable than the previous model, as well as the coordination of smaller CO2 emissions and excellent mechanicals, while the engine offers an excellent performance in all respects.
The power of 1.2 litres of resources is 90 horsepower at 6000 speeds and the maximum torque is 114 Nm at 4900 speeds.
This engine - which was 78 in the previous Jazz - is used in 5.3 litres and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
The other engine, which produced 83 horsepower in the previous generation, is now reaching 100 horsepower.
On average, the 100-hour jazz consumes 5.4 litres, and its emissions are 128 grams of CO2.
The non-contraceptor –
In order to develop emergency-preventive technologies this time, Nissan is an inspiration from nature, precisely from the world of bees.
The Japanese company designed a robot that avoids accidents if the bees were to fly.
It may be that the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive or BR23C instrument will be the first step towards developing anti-attack technologies.
The engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. Development Centre were built in Japan in collaboration with the Development Centre for Science and Technology of the University of Tokyo.
Kazuhhiro Doi, Director of Technology PR and Research-Feating Brands, defines BR23C as an extension of Nissan’s four-level safety shield.
The robot will make the company's products more efficient than its ability to fight.
During the flight, all bees develop their own oval-shaped personal space, which is very similar to Nissan’s safety shield.
However, the role of the bee is much more important than that of a complex eye, with more than 300 degrees in every direction, and consequently, it can wander in its own personal space.
To copy the function of the complex eye, engineers designed a so-called laser remote (Laser Range Finder).
The instrument shall identify obstacles within 180 degrees of sighting space before BR23C, calculate its distance and send a signal to the onboard micro processor, which shall immediately become an operation to prevent the impact.
\"As it happens to detect the obstacle, a small robot changes the direction immediately following the movements of the uterus by moving the wheels in a smaller or larger angle to avoid impact.
The system is the most different from the currently available instruments, that in this case the avoidable masonry is fully automatic.
If not, the robot would not be able to respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles, explain Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of Mobility Laboratorium and project engineer.
In a way other than bees, the elongation may not be directed upwards or downwards, nor can it move in a cross-sectional direction only in two dimensions, i.e. not in an infinite direction and in a manner that happens in the case of bees.
That is why Nissan in the robot used a rotting function not only to speed and slow down but also to avoid collisions.
“This structure only needs to process data every few seconds and respond to them.
There is no need for the storage of data or the intuitive logic based on past manoeuvres, so it can only work with a few dozen KB memory without interruption.
It may sound surprising, but it's not really gigabyte, but we're not even talking about megabyte memory.
This is the first step to develop the technology for immediate collision prevention, which, according to the Nissan estimates, can be involved in serialized cars within ten years.
The robot is operated with lithium polymer batteries that are easier and more durable than the lithium-ion version.
In the future, it may be possible for the unit to be integrated with the GPS satellite navigation system to reach the end end by avoiding obstacles on the road.
Fear of mortgage
We have to admit that the U.S. Department is beyond having a lot of investments in cash, without reasonable sense.
Since the crisis is on their way, and the Americans did not question whether they would be able to use mortgage banks, they created a fun and informative online game called \"Bad Credit Hotel\".
This is the “Rose Loans Hotel” ...or the gays.
The description of the accommodation and, above all, the reception búskomor suggests that we think again, twice, and even three times, if the time of borrowing really came.
And especially where we need credit, because that's probably the purpose.
The information available on the website is really useful, but it is little more detailed.
It's more of a campaign for the general public.
But what would happen if we were to complete the game?
For example, the hotel would have a room for our dreams.
Actually, that's something, because we don't dare dream about buying a flat.
Morgan Stanley opens up its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced that he would provide shares in his capital to the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG). The largest Japanese bank will pay $9 billion for 21% of the company's capital after Morgan Stanley's market share fell.
A week after the preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks said that MUFG buys 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stock shares at USD 25.25, i.e. a total of $3 billion.
The accepted price shall be more than 19% of the book value of the securities in August 31st.
The MUFG will invest another $6 billion in the purchase of converted securities, which will provide 10% returns, and the exchange rate will be USD 31.25.
According to Morgan Stanley, the global transaction is based on 29 dollar average prices, which is 28% higher than the current exchange rate.
However, Morgan Stanley's stock exchange rate decreased by 6.79% from 17:00 to 2307.
“This strategic alliance offers Morgan Stanley a great opportunity to speed up the transformation of bankholding into a company,” explains John Mack, CEO of the US Group of Companies.
The Morgan Stanley last week approved the new status by which he can divert his activities, while under the control of the Federal Reserve.
The MUFG agreement reiterates the fact that the current financial crisis requires even more caution on the corporate events recorded on Wall Street.
The conditions notified on Monday show that the agreement was amended in recent days: last Monday, Morgan only announced that 20% of his shares would be sold to the Japanese company for about $ 8.5 billion.
“ A week ago, we thought that the share would be entirely limited, ” explained Toshihiide Mizuno, Managing Director of MUFG in Tokyo.
However, because of the current market and economic situation, we wanted to minimise and protect potential risks.
In view of the weighted average price, MUFG will pay more than 7% of the book value for Morgan Stanley shares.
As a result of the transaction, the return on one share is reduced by approximately 20%.
On the basis of the agreement, MUFG will be able to convert half of its initial shares into stock shares in one year if the trading rate of the latter exceeds the conversion rate by more than 50% over a given period, i.e. about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley thus ensures that funds from MUFG can make use of its investment opportunities, improve its balance sheet and increase its liquidity resources.
However, the group spokesperson did not wish to provide accurate information on the new strategic plans of the two allies.
Following MUFG's involvement, Morgan Stanley is expected to increase its solvency rate by around 15%, which will be one of the best in its own sector.
Morgan said that his balance sheet had been ‘ specified’ improved since the end of August.
Over the past few weeks, a major attempt has been reported to the group, as the stock exchange has fallen to half, while the cost of ensuring a non-payment risk has fled to the heavens.
This cost was reduced on Monday, but remained high, around 12%.
One more of the big investors' banks remained the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and after the acquisition of Merill Lynch. Goldman Sachs, which announced last week that he had reached $15 billion: this is part of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's company group.
Rafael Correa Monday declaration, Quito
The reconstruction of the Republic in the spirit of socialism in the 21st century.
This joint plan is for the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Evo Morales in Bolivia, and for the Italian Raphael Correa.
Following the pattern of presidents and friends, Correa developed his ideas about the new constitution on Sunday.
His mission was successful, as 64% of the voters voted with yes, according to the official results, which concerned 80% of the votes.
According to this, 28% of the population voted in favour, 7% of the votes were invalid, while 0.7% of the voters were unsolicited.
50% + 1 vote was required for the adoption of the draft Constitution.
On Sunday, the two surveys conducted at the exit of voting offices and the counting carried out by a non-governmental organisation have demonstrated a huge excess of 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa, by the way, spoke about the victory of the draft constitution on Sunday night.
“ The Constitution has been won by a great victory, ” announced, and thanked the Italians at the headquarters of the Governors, Guayaquil, 80 miles southwest of Quinto.
As you know, Mr. Chávez, Mr Morales and the Chilean President, Mr Bachelet, also congratulated you.
According to the report by the United States Organisation (OAS), the vote took place in a quiet atmosphere, the main topic was a 444 precise text, which included the principles of “new socialism ” protected by the President.
The proposed Constitution lays down the power of the State to serve the economy, while maintaining the right to ‘development’ to a country which essentially lives in the foreign currency sent by foreign companies.
The draft Correa, elected in 2006, also strengthens the power of the Prime Minister, who may obtain mandates for a maximum of two consecutive periods and is entitled to the distribution of the Assembly.
Correa has already announced that she intends to live with this opportunity and will again compete for the Prime Minister's mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also included the free movement of health services and education. The President has already started its introduction in the country of 13.9 million inhabitants and half the population is living under the minimum of living.
Finally, the Constitution prohibits the presence of foreign troops in the country, which could put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington on the use of an asylum facility based on anti-drug measures in the United States.
He was released from the 19 hostages in Chad
He was hit by an Egyptian commando on the kidnappers, who spent ten days hostageing eleven tourists and eight of their escorts.
The hostages are in Cairo now.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts were held in the desert for ten days, from which they were transported unharmedly to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
The hostages were released in Chad during the morning by an Egyptian commando.
Apparently in good condition, they arrived at the Al-Maza military base around half an afternoon, directly linked to the international airport in Cairo.
The hostages were forbidden to declare to the press and were immediately transferred to a hospital in the suburbs of Cairo where they were examined.
The hostages were “an additional person, ” and the kidnappers did not pay the ransom,” said the Minister for Egyptian tourism at the airport of Zoheir Garanna.
On September 19, the hostages were arrested at the foot of the Ouanat Mountain in the border regions of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, where they participated in the land-based safarin.
There were 11 tourists in the group (five Italian men, five German men and one Romanian women), and eight Egyptians: two tourist drivers, four drivers, a border guard and the director of the Agyptus travel agency organized by safarite.
According to an Egyptian security manager, two helicopters of 30 members arrived at the site where they hit the hostages directly before the river.
“ There was a battle of fire between the troops. Half of the kidnappers were killed, the others fled, ” said the head of the hearing of his name.
He also stated that a total of 150 special teams were sent to Sudan from Egypt’s Villam Group, where German and Italian comets were added.
The Italian head of diplomacy in Belgrade, Franco Frattini, stressed the role of secret agents and special Italian action groups.
“We must have acknowledged that this result was not achieved without the professional and effective intervention of our secret service people and our action groups,” he announced, without further details.
He also refused to pay a ransom for hostages.
On the previous day, the Sudanese army announced that during the patrol, they arrested a fielder, on which the kidnappers were travelling, killed six of them (including the captain of the Juvenile), and two were arrested.
According to the army, the hostages were connected to a rebel organization in Darfur, the Sudanese Liberation Movement (SLA-U), which the organisation concerned was immediately suffocating.
Lettres - Most of the culture –
The media and the election campaign are currently at the heart of a debate on the financing of culture.
We can only enjoy this.
But they're still forgetting a slice of our cultural life.
Who will raise his word to reveal the ridiculous amounts of small museums, archives, archaeology and national historical monuments that exist at the edge of the famine?
Which political sea reminds the federal government that it does not care about its monuments and the buildings that are part of cultural heritage?
Or that there are no laws in Quebec or Canada that really ensure the effective protection of our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French Government has only spent three and a half million euros on the restoration of Chino Castle in the valley of Loire?
The Constitution of our American neighbours states that the protection of cultural heritage is part of the American culture, and this heritage must be protected by all citizens, by all elected representatives and by all government bodies.
Within the framework of the Québeci Historical Society Association (Fédération des sociétéés d'histoire du Québec), more than 40 000 volunteers are working on history, cultural heritage, archives and genetics to preserve large numbers of private archives and archeological findings with a minimum budget.
Often, these organizations protect our heritage with teeth and their last power to protest when real estate developers and decision makers direct their bulldozers to our old buildings and our esteemed cemeterys.
When will someone stand up for the protection of historical and cultural heritage?
Stateise part of Fortis Bank of the Benelux Governments
With partial nationalisation, the Benelux countries have been in difficulty at the bank of Belgium, Italy, because of the impact of the US credit market crisis, and Fortison: the three countries have a total of EUR 11.2 billion in support of the financial and insurance institution with Hungarian interests.
The Belgian, Luxembourg and the Dutch Government have agreed at the highest level on this case at the end of the week, involving the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commission's responsibility for competition.
In the euro area, Fortis's bank is the first major crisis in the waves in the context of the international money market crisis that has been ringed over a year, and decisions taken in the matter of the bank can therefore be considered to be precedential in some respects.
According to the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states (49 %) acquire their existing assets there.
The bank will certainly sell part of its interests, including, above all, the activities of the Dutch ABN Amro purchased last year, mainly insurance.
The shares in Fortis began to fall steep last week, and in the second half of the week there have already been serious crisis events at the Institute.
However, they agree that the Bank's 85 000 employees are too large to be allowed to fail.
The company's papers only fell by about 12 percent on Friday, 14 years old.
Since January, the value of the shares decreased by more than two thirds.
In view of the current share prices, the total market capital of the group is around EUR 14 billion, but according to the corporate managers, this is not realistic.
In other words, corporate governance caused over-the-sea market uncertainty regarding the adoption of the $700 billion US package.
On Monday, the papers have risen slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx has appointed a new CEO to the bank's head.
The financial institution was also looking for private buyers, but no one has ever applied for a substantial offer.
The Belgian government has already indicated that investors do not have to worry, they do not lose their money.
There has been no panic among the bank's clients, no seizures in the accounts.
In Hungary, Fortis has a separate account and also purchased leasing companies.
Rice in the hen
In America, life and health insurance companies often refuse to conclude insurance contracts with the applicant on the basis of drug purchase data.
Data protection professionals fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
‘A data protection programme shall be linked to the consent of the person concerned to the use of pharmacovigilance data in all cases.
It must be in an independent hand, otherwise we're going to have to get the henkot to the fox... to quote Richard Dick, the developer of the program to follow the prescriptions at Washington Post.
Insurance companies make insurance premiums and claims dependent on the health status of the applicant, and if they consider the risk to be too high, they will not be insured.
The person was previously sent to a medical examination and the contract was concluded only in the light of the outcome of the investigation.
Dick has found a much cheaper procedure ten years ago: according to the customer's identification number, he easily acquires what medicines he bought in the last year and a half, and this program itself leads to the disease and health situation.
For example, if you regularly take a high dose of cholesterol, it suggests that your blood fat levels are virtually high, which is now classified into a higher risk category.
Several versions of the programme are available, some of them also set a risk factor number, so the insurance is not enough to do it outside the paperwork, although there are minor difficulties.
The disadvantages include that some medicines may be used for a number of purposes, such as the use of compounds against migraines or heat waves, and are also effective against depression.
The latter is a significant risk-raising factor for business insurance companies, not the above.
The data were requested and processed by separate companies, and they, before getting the necessary information from the pharmacy, asked for the patient's consent.
They are now bound by the authorities, although they have not been punished for their failure to do so.
Some companies are already working on the results of laboratory tests and are connected to drug consumption data, so they can provide a more accurate picture of the health status of patients.
More and more companies have access to data, while monitoring the use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate health data protection law, but only applies to healthcare providers and insurance companies.
Before the convention, there is a draft law that gives the authorities control powers over undertakings specialised in the provision of data.
Dick Richard notes that this is not enough: therefore, he has developed his programme, which would bind the transmission of data to the express contribution involved.
Another question is that the Member State concerned may refuse the contribution, otherwise the insurance undertaking shall not conclude a contract with it.
So the hens are still referring to all the fox's charity.
Global Marseille Menu
Double-trade between the European Union and India
As the leading trading partners of the European Union and India, the ninth summit agenda was also dominated by this issue, with the rest of the world's problems, in particular.
Today there will also be a French-India Summit, where nuclear cooperation will be mainly.
At the same time, the European Union recognises that India is a rising democratic power that should be given greater involvement in international affairs, but that Member States have not yet succeeded in receiving a common denominator, to support the permanent membership of Newdelhi in the UN Security Council.
This was not the case yesterday in Marseille, and it was now the ninth summit.
The French President, Mr Sarkozy, as President of the Union, and Mr Barroso, and Mr Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Mr Manmohan Szingh, who was also agreed that he would double in five years, i.e. an increase in commercial sales to around one hundred billion euros.
In view of the increase in trade between 2000 and 2007 from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious objective.
In this context, the twenty-six bilateral civil aviation agreements with India, i.e. air traffic, could be dried in the future, were legally consolidated.
India wishes to sign the free trade agreement with the Union by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to speed up the settlement.
The aim is to balance the fact that, while the EU's first Indian trading partner, Newdelhi is only in the ninth place in the EU's partners.
The summit has given attention to global affairs.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as the latter, was condemned in all forms of terrorism, and called for the UN Conference to be convened.
The conclusion of the Dohan trading round has been encouraged, although both of them have a large part of the failure to date.
The EU has confirmed that it will maintain its energy and climate programme, i.e. wishing to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20 % by 2020.
With this, India has agreed, as is the case for a global deal at the climate conference to be scheduled for the future, and to reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
I would also like to prevent the rise in food prices and have supported the international conference to review the financial crisis.
The Indian Prime Minister is going to the French capital today, where the bilateral meeting is about to make a deal about the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, we trust that the French companies will receive 20 billion euros for the construction of Indian nuclear reactors.
According to reporting reports, the agreement would be for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian books in Frankfurt
The Italian publishers are represented by a strong field at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than three hundred Italian publishers will be present at the most significant international copyright meetings at the 60th Buymesse fair.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair is waiting for 7 000 exhibitors from 101 countries in 171.790 square meters, where more than 403.000 books are presented.
The Italian Government is represented at the opening ceremony of Italian Pavilion by the State Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Recommendations and Activities, Francesco Maria Giro: Italy, by setting up a single Italian Pont, will take 264 square meters of exhibition area.
The formal opening will be followed by a press conference held at the Bachmessa 5.0 Pavilion Room Struktur, where information, trends and prospects on the situation of Italian book publishing will be presented.
According to the data, the Italian publisher market continues to decrease the proportion of foreign authors, especially in adult and youth publications.
They found the one year missing billionaire Steve Fossett's plane.
They found the remains of the billion-dollar Steve Fosset plane, who disappeared from the Nedai desert on 3 September 2007.
The wreckage was found at a height of 3000 metres, near Mammoth Lakes, located on the coast of California and Nevada.
They couldn't find human remains inside the plane.
John Anderson, Sheriff of Madera County, disbanded all the existing doubts: “We sent a team after establishing the flight situation, and now we can be sure that this is about the machine on which Steve Fossett was flying on the day of his disappearance,” said a press conference.
The sheriff also confirmed that there were no human remains in the plane or the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Transport Safety Office (NTSB) has announced that several hours after the discovery of the wreck, an investigation committee was asked to identify the machine and to state that it was really about Bellanca 8kcab, which disappeared on 3 September 2007, on the day Fossett started a three-hour flight trip from Yerington in Nevada.
Yesterday he found some personal belongings near Mammoth Lakes' home, near the Nemmoth Lakes border in California.
Two IDs on the name of Fosset, issued by the Alliance of Aviations in Illinois, some cash and a sweater.
The search for Fossett was filed a month after he disappeared.
The billionaire set up a number of peaks, by which he wrote himself into history.
In 2002, the sixth attempt, he first managed to fly around the earth in a balloon: two weeks of lonely flight.
Three years later, he was on a plane without landing.
There are several records of the flight above the Andes at a height of 15.445 meters, carried out with a second pilot.
GLK, shocking advertising
It is an unusual, yet original and firm-fledged hobby truck with large surfaces and cleaned-up corners.
A few of these are the most recent Mercedes-Benz mobiles that the German car manufacturer tried to bring fresh impetus to the market.
This is why the introduction campaign of SUV GLK in Mercedes-Benz, which is available from 17 October, will be surprising and unusual due to its different content.
The same advertising campaign accompanying the introduction of the new vehicle has been used by an unknown media communication tool, including by means of posters of 3D that have not yet been used in Italy.
The giant poster action, which consists of three sections, will dominate Milan's central shopping street by 15 November, Corso Como.
The first phase of this new type of media communication begins with the presentation of the car's spatial performance, with special glasses, almost real dimensions and three dimensions, shared by the new SUV, Corso Como.
The viewer of the picture will feel like the car's out of the poster.
Then, through the innovative Elumina8 technology, all the details of the new GLK become one, so that it can be combined into a single form.
Without doubt, Mercedes is trying to introduce something new with this promotion into the stereotypes of the automotive industry.
Will this help raise the interest of future customers?
We'll show you who the Italian football hooligans are.
They're probably out of the field.
But who is this 150-200 boy and girl who is now ashamed of Italy? Members of the group called “Ultras Italy ” that has followed the choice for years, and which, in truth, has not caused too much trouble.
I've never had a fight with your opponents.
The core of the group is right-hand.
The main performers are from Trivento.
Including Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udin.
These were joined in Sofia by smaller symphony groups from Campania and Puglia (in fact only a few units).
Italian flags were splintered, in which the native town of the Surkors had been mentioned: on Saturday they took them off so that they could not be identified.
They follow the example of English fans.
In Bulgaria, they faced a real Nazi suffocating team with the Levski Drukkers.
The Italian football community made 144 tickets available to Italian fans. They were tickets for their name, so it was easier to check the Surkó team.
The Ministry of Home Affairs has also checked everyone: there was no one in Sofia to deal with, no one who would have been banned from the stadium visit.
Four Italian fans with a record of football have refused the ticket and the exit.
At present, the Ministry of Home Affairs is waiting for protocols from the Symphony Police, and then it will take the necessary measures: the fans who have been arrested or identified during the disruptions may also be banned for five years.
It is an international ban that concerns not only the visit of Italy but also all of Europe's stadiums.
So our football hooligans can't get their feet on any football course.
Lucky for you.
But we also need to be afraid that they will find followers of the Huligans, which means that they will join only a hundred and fifty people.
“ It is necessary to choke this fire, not to save anyone who behaves like this, ” said the Ministry of Interior.
So we'd better keep our eyes open, especially since Wednesdays have been selected for the week, in Lecca.
Puglia has a small cell that supports Italian ultras.
The Watch Tower Service will be held tomorrow, and on Tuesday, the Committee on Safety of Sport events, which may also be a member of the Internal Security Service, will be held in secret services for windmill behaviour.
“Duce-Duce scan and flying arm under Italian anthem?
He expressed this thought in a rather unfortunate way, Domenico Mazzzilli, who was appointed for a few weeks at the Ministry of Interior (the post was taken by Francesco Tagliente, and then by Felice Ferlitzi).
Mazzilli used to be the chief police captain of Trieste, the city where he has been operating since 2002 has been a cell supporting the Ultras Italian group.
What Mazzilli claims is true, it is not forbidden to feed Ducet in Bulgaria, but that was why the behavior of that 150-200 suffocators was a disgrace.
I'm not a sociologist, he added the first person in the surveillance service, but the crimes must be condemned in the country of the crime.
Until now, this group has not caused any problems, and we need to examine exactly what happened and consider how to continue.
But let's also talk a little about snoring out Italian hymns: it's not a crime, but, if I may say so, I can't even call it a good name.
