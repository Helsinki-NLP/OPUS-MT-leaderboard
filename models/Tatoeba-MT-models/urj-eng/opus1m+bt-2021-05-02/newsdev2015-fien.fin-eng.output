Change in corporate support practices - Region - Regions - News - Karjalainen
In addition to EU support for businesses, the management of national corporate subsidies will be concentrated on four centres of living from mid-September.
In Eastern Finland, the South Savo's living center is in Mikkeli.
Following the entry into force of the new company subsidy law of July, EU Structural Fund aid must no longer be targeted at large enterprises unless it is entirely a new activity.
The subsidiaries of municipalities of more than five thousand inhabitants are also considered to be a great honour.
On the other hand, EU support may continue to be granted for investment which improves the conditions for the business of municipalities.
In Eastern Finland, about 30 people become the strength of an EU and national support unit.
At least so far, they all continue to work at their current premises.
For example, the job of the Head of the Structural Fund Unit of the South Savo Centre, Kalev Pööle, is in Joensuu.
Researcher: This is what Russia is now seeking in Ukraine
Russia works consistently, even if it doesn't always seem that way.
Head of the Department of the National Defence College Strategy, Colonel, Doctor Torsti Siren, was not surprised by the conflicting Ukrainian news of the Monday morning.
This has been the same thing for a long time, Siren says.
On the other hand, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov called for an immediate ceasefire and announced that Russia would not attack Ukraine (read more here).
On the other hand, Ukraine is telling us that its landing forces are currently fighting with the Russian tank department near Luhansk Airport, and that the tank department has received confirmation (read more here).
Lavrov called for the immediate ceasefire to be achieved in the Minsk negotiations without conditions.
Russia denies itself and must immediately get the outcome of the negotiations to get their well-established position in Luhansk and Donetsk.
That's the whole thing, Siren says.
This is the big picture: suddenly we need to negotiate, and specifically so that Russia gets its own grip on the areas of Luhansk and Donetsk.
Finnair externalizes cabin services to the Norwegian company, holidays people
Finnair begins to purchase cabin services as a sub-contract from the Norwegian crew service company OSM Aviation.
The agreement will first apply to Finnair Hong Kong and Singapore, but it will be extended later.
The appearance of two routes in Finland leads to a total reduction of about one hundred years of personal work, which is carried out first on holiday trips, the company reported on its release.
In addition, the work of some 80 Asian rental workers will be completed at the point when the routes are outside.
Finnair already said in June that it intends to display some 20 passenger services over the next two years.
Externalities were concluded when no savings were made with staff.
The aim is to start the next year's January-March.
According to the company, negotiations on cooperation will continue with other partners.
According to the study, sleep problems multiply the risk of nervous back pain, i.e. shock pain, for those who work hard.
In the study of the occupational health service, firemen were monitored for 13 years.
The connection of sleep disturbances to the impactive tree is surprising, although many other factors were taken into account.
The good muscle strength and endurance of firemen, which are tested regularly, does not appear to be protective of pain, says the Director of the study, Doctor Sirpa Lusa, at the Health Department.
The work of firemen is an irregular shift where the shifts can stretch up to 24 hours.
According to the occupational health service, sleep problems in this type of work are common.
The results are based on a survey carried out in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Do you feel the surprise new causes of water damage?
It is easy to destroy other dwellings
Water damage Water damage, however, is not always caused by a leaking tube or hana, is a reminder of the host marriage expert.
We have been contacted when the infringement of the aquarium has caused a water damage in the house company, that the aquarium can be banned, says Marina Furuhjelm, a law specialist in the host Union.
It is strange to note that only pipes and sewers are not the general causes of water damage, but also, today, even more and more new machinery, such as ice-burners, have caused water leaks in housing.
Many do not know that machines such as washing or washing machines must not be left uncontrollable.
The water supply must also be kept closed whenever the machine is not on, as otherwise the pressure in the tube can lead to a water leak.
A resident may be considered guilty of negligence if these obligations are not met, in which case liability for damage is a resident.
Of course, in these cases home insurance can compensate for the damage, depending on the terms and conditions of the insurance.
If you can demonstrate that the resident has been negligently injured, you have a liability.
If a resident has choked the shower on the floor roof, the neglect can often be proved, as usually in these cases the water has flooded elsewhere and the caretaker comes into the apartment with a lost resident.
Furudjelm says that due to the generalisation of the roofs on the floor, two floor wells have now been installed in shower rooms for many student housings.
Water damage has also been caused by water beds, although not to the extent that they were more popular than before.
Even the dog’s watercup and the fall of its home wine can become real water damage.
I also know a case where there were many cats in the apartment that had peed on the floors so that there was extensive damage, Furuhjelm says.
The principle of rescheduling always goes the same way if the company does not order otherwise in its corporate order.
The shareholder is responsible for the repair of surface material and the damage to the structure of the house company as well as for damage to other dwellings.
Water damage can easily be destroyed in other apartments, as the structure of concrete is very easily absorbing water.
Furjujjjeljeljem says that the housing battery leaks are particularly difficult because the batteries are easily leaking to the structures.
Water damage can now result in general air temperature pumps producing condens water.
Water should lead to a solid drain or a rainwater network, not just a container.
It is also the responsibility of the shareholders to remove water, snow, ice and garbage from the balcony, counseling the law specialist.
Furuhjelm advises that, although the rules of the household do not require, for example, permanent removal of a washing machine, the assurance may be the condition for which the compensation is not received for this reason.
You should be careful with your own home insurance policy.
However, I consider washing machines to be ironic, for example, as a major risk to the bathed water removal tube, which has caused many damage.
I recommend that the removal doors be always permanently channelled into the drain pipe.
Snow and water removal with balcony
Control of the washing machine, the dry cleaning machine, etc. machines, when they're on.
Shut down water wells (with washing machine and dishwasher)
The cleaning of the floor cover is visible twice a year.
The recommendation is to connect the removal doors to the drain permanently.
Check the gloves and their possible leaks
Regular freezer melting
Do you have any experience with water damage?
Tell me about your experiences in a commentist?
FC Honka was lost again and lit into a serial jumbo
At the Tapiola Sports Park, two of the weakest teams met on Sunday night at the Sports League of Football.
In June, FC Honka last celebrated the victory, mastered seven games in a winning tube of the wall of Vaasa Palloseura.
VPS just accepted Honka's previous victory in July.
Sunnuntani's encounter with the Espoola team came to a good staff, for VPS returned from a long time to profit base by reading 2-1.
The main coach of the Vaasans Olli Huttunen complained before his team was ineffective, but the mixed Honka defense made it easier for VPS to paint problems.
Playedly very nervous about doing it.
We didn't get any longer attacks, we couldn't hold the ball, Hatunen estimated his own performance.
In the first half of the year, Honga's Toppikikiks Milos Milovic - Kosta Manev played really uncertainly.
Both female paints were born as a result of the loose play of topparians.
After only five minutes of the game, Steven Morrissey directed Sebastian Strandvall's launch by the dazzling Honka painter Walter Vielan.
It's too bad for the first half of the day.
By the field, the team did the opposite as agreed before the game, Honga chief coach Shefki Kuqi mani.
After the start-up, the espoolans got their game together and rolled the ball around at the attack.
Especially the middle field player, Carlos Portela, and the wingman Roni Porokara were eager to pick up the scene, but the last solutions were almost repeated.
The closest painting was the Honga central fieldman Jussi Vasara, whose 20-metre shot went a little past the VPS painting.
VPS was effective against the use of vikels for its attackers and Honga's confusing toppari.
At half an hour, the whales made a 2-0 stake when Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart got through the line.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was in the opening session with a good gamehead and once again created situations on the left.
Stewart's speed again seemed to be too much of an espolar defense throughout the game.
“In six months, if you lose, then you lose your honor, Kuqi told me.
In the second period, Honka applied for a gravitational painting.
The team was twice close to the hit until the third firm succeeded.
Yerai Vilaboa, who was a performer, finished at the center of the goal's penalty zone.
After Vilabo's goal, Honga had half an hour to fight.
The Espoo team continued to take more and more risks, allowing VPS to engage in dangerous counter-attacks.
Both Stewart and Morrissey were once caught up with Viita, but the battles of the Honka painter were held with the home team in the game.
At the end of the day, Honka was a little tired and didn't get any more paints early.
As a result, Honka lit Veikkausligi last while there are seven more matches left.
Journal: Putin threatened to take Kiova in two weeks.
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, was in a very hard talk with the President of the EU Commission, Jose Manuel Barroso, reports the Italian La Republica newspaper.
Putin expressed its irresponsibility with the plans of the European Union to blackmail sanctions against Russia.
If I want to, I can take Kiev in two weeks, La Repubblica says Putin said.
According to the newspaper, Putin's message to Barroso was this: it is not worth annoying Russia with new sanctions.
Putin presented an interview with Russian television on the 1st channel of the Ukrainian crisis on Sunday night.
Putin reported that he was holding the conflict in the interview fully within Ukraine and called on the Government of Kiev to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he warned Kiova very much about entering civilian destinations in eastern Ukraine.
Russia can't look next door if people are shot at at near range, Putin said.
Esko Roine confesses: The actor's work destroyed the family
The hard work of the Konkaratättistor and the theater suite was raised to recognize how the actor's profession destroyed his first marriage.
Actor Esko Roine will be 70 years next Friday, but I think he's right for a valid saying that age is just a number.
I don't see any difference compared to two years ago or ten years ago.
The spiritual puberty seems to be continuing, says Esko Roine.
Roine's been retired for years, but yet he's been working hard for a lot of men.
Sometimes it was a joke that there are not many plays in this country without Esko Roinetta.
At the moment, Roine has the roles of the City Theatre of Helsinki How to succeed in business life, the Theatre of Tampere, and the Kvartette of the Tampere Komedia Theatre.
Roine will also be seen in the future Risto Robbost movie.
KUKA: Reijo Hietanen
Rheine's acting career didn't start promisingly.
I didn't want to go to school to see a pioneer boy.
40-50 years later, the teacher said it was the reason I was so bad.
Esko Roine didn't fall.
The career's choice was clear, there were no alternatives.
It seemed close and loved.
I was so busy in the field that I left the school and went to the army on a voluntary basis just to get to the theatre school as quickly as possible.
Roine has done about 200 theater roles and 300 TV show little depending on how to calculate.
If the work is calculated like the engelsmants that every part of the TV series is in its own show, then the TV stuff is more than 600.
I was three years old in a new day, made three episodes a week.
The other spring, I was killed when I didn't have time to do it.
Commitments to autumn 2016
Eskon isosikot Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are fully hit and do the Tampere Work Theatre Still time in the exhibition to play the charming roles in anarchy memory.
Little brother's gonna be on stage for years.
That's what it looks like now, but you don't know about this age.
You always have to make a little reservation that I'll come if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
The calendar has reservations for autumn 2016.
They've left a man behind for years.
He's not going to be alone.
The knees are operated, the hip tip and the arthropod bothers, but when you don't let it too much bother, yes, with these, Esko Roine says.
To the TV general, Roine became familiar, for example.
I'm talking about the pirates' radio, and I'm talking about some kind of vision, where he and Einio shared hundreds of notes, hundreds of brands.
It was Antti Einio, which divided hundreds.
I was trying to get it back, they're rainy, not rainy.
In the Reinikainen series, Roine was a fuzzy Lieutenant Rautakallio.
He became a Tampere police favourite when it happened to be a similar Lieutenant at work.
A policeman stopped the car on the street, took the window open and yelled at me, \"This Iron Rock is great.\"
Working Group Successful
The theater works in the minds of Roine have remained, for example.
Producer and Master Class of the City Theatre of Helsinki, Death of the Theatre of Tampere and Long-day trip to the night.
It's all about the popular performances.
It's not my fault, it's the task force.
There have also been rituals.
There's one of those things about Pekka Puupää's role in the movie.
There are others.
The reason is, I've agreed too easily.
I don't know if I regret those roles, but the outcome is not satisfied with myself or with the viewers.
As a matchmaker, you can't choose your own job.
It's just kind of done what's been told.
In addition to theatre work, Roine has also tried to succeed in business.
In the '80s, he held a restaurant called Wanhat Rooms in Tampere.
It was a teaching experience.
There was nothing about it when I tried to be the director of Tampere Theatre, an actor and then a restaurant owner.
If I remember correctly, within the year, it became clear that these were not to be agreed upon at all.
It was typical that when the show was over or between time and time, I thought about whether I'd put on the sauna, the restaurant would have a call, that there's friends here that wish they'd see you after the show.
Remembering the Celebration
On the day of his birth, Esko Roine shows up in memory of Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
Some kind of charm they've made up of the memories of the navigator.
At one time, when I was playing in Zoom, I was called the \"Walker\".
They didn't know who I was.
It's been years.
In time, Roine told me that no news bombs are allowed, because he hasn't done anything so rough, or if he is, he won't tell me.
I made a small statement in the book.
I say that if someone waits for scandalous revelations or good gossip, you should stop reading this.
There's quite a lot of professional stuff in there, so actor when you're the director of the theatre.
According to the publisher, there is also a tourist from an unspoken theater school.
It was a pretty normal student life, but the kakara made all kinds of tricks.
It wasn't as charming as it was at Turka's time.
It was very different.
I don't know how much more than confidence I got out of there, that when the school's been gone, you know, it's not gonna be closed if you don't get better.
I didn't have to think how good I would be if I went to school.
Roine also remembers the legends of the National Theatre.
I was friends with Pentti Siimes, Tarmo Mann and Hannes Häyrinen, and I got to work with them.
Well, there were legends from my first father-in-law Kaarlo's death.
With Pia Hatara, we had a very close relationship.
Tauno Palo was already gone, but I had time to get to know him during school.
The first son of a fire, Martti, was with me on the same course.
At the theatre school, Roine met her first wife, Marjukka Haltusen.
As a pain, he remembers his divorce.
After a relatively long battle, the children were divided.
Not in two parts, but in a way that the daughter went to my mother and son to me.
I did not consider it a good solution, and I believe that children are quite in agreement now as adults.
It's not uncommon for the theatre circles to be divided into silver.
In our case, some part of it was that I did a lot of work at the time.
I was close to the theater, almost every case.
Then there was a TV and a radio on it.
I did a long day and a family life suffered.
At the party, maybe at night.
Esko Roine celebrated the Tampere Labour Theatre on 7 September.
The festival will continue at the City of Helsinki Theatre on 21 and 28 September.
There's a mind-hater out there, too.
I was working 50, and I was working sixty-six.
When a play like this happened, I thought that it would be held even after the age of 70, it would be taken off with one rhythm.
According to Roine, there's no celebration at the actual birthday.
I remember it's a free night, but I'm not going to swear.
I may have failed some job for that day.
Or maybe it's a strange night off I'm going to have a night off, Roine says.
Aviation companies are concerned about the production chain
Some of the smaller aircraft manufacturers in Great Britain are concerned that the supply chain manufacturing capacity problems may go off track with ambitious plans for large aircraft manufacturers to increase the production of passenger aircraft.
In Great Britain, thousands of companies in the aircraft manufacturing chain are currently enjoying an unexpected large amount of simultaneous aircraft and engine development plans.
Aviation and defence
At the same time as some enjoy the order call, there are warnings about capacity problems and price pressure at the hands of the production chain.
“It is quite true that there is a price pressure, especially now that the production volume causes challenges,” says Mr. Craig Gallagher, President of the MB Aerospace, the major suppliers of the manufacturers of aeroplanes such as Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, the CEO of North West Aerospace Alliance, representing approximately 240 suppliers of aircraft production in North England, needs more capacity.
\"Do strategies and investment plans reflect these growth plans?
To tell you the truth, I'm not quite sure.
Above all, we need to increase our investment in new production equipment and machines that are needed in order to achieve these production volumes, says Gallagher.
According to some companies, the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the expansion of aircraft buildings is part of the problem.
According to Andrew Churchilli, the CEO of JJ Chrurchill, producing gas-fuelled wings, the company has a period of distress when several new building plans were to be implemented at the same time at the beginning of the year.
In the blink of an eye, we moved from very small production to a state where production capacity was exceeded.
Many orders were paid only afterwards, and we also had to try to move on.
However, it is useless to try to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of new production plans.
JJ Churchill has responded to the challenge by investing $800 000 in new machines and hiring 26 new employees.
Many operators believe that investment and coordination between small suppliers will be needed if Britain wishes to maintain its position as second largest player in the aviation sector after the United States.
The President of Ford Aerospace and the engineer Geoff Ford of Tyneside, says that the order duty should increase the confidence of producers and the desire to increase production capacity, as work should be sufficient.
“If this does not work, we will lose our competition against other countries, ” says Ford.
A few large players are trying to solve the problem by acquiring capacity.
The FTSE 250-based aircraft and an engine-run company, Senior, bought parts of the aircraft operating in Malaysia with 75 million pounds of UPECA.
Last year, MB Aerospace bought companies from North America and Poland.
“It is possible to buy start-up companies that create new activities, but in reality, production slows down the limit of design and the number of engineers,” says Gallagher MB Aerospace.
Both small and large companies have mentioned the price pressure that has moved from large aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engine manufacturers.
Some people believe that the problems of the production chain are over-expressed.
Marcus Bryson, director of GKN's aircraft manufacturing unit, also acts as a representative body of the UK aviation industry, the ADS president believes that the production chain has dealt with the problem better than in previous periods.
There are pressures in the supply chain, but I would not consider the situation critical.
“The introduction of new technologies and advanced processes is more important,” says Bryson.
Both Airbus and Boeing have learned errors and are now more cautious so that building volumes do not increase too quickly.
When Boeing tried to increase its production in 1997, it became difficult when the company lost and the factories and the production chain fought to survive.
Tony Wood, head of the unit for the manufacture of Rolls Royce aircraft, says that the company has not yet encountered any problems in the production chain, which will deliver most of the 18 000 parts of the jet aircraft required to manufacture the engine.
“I'm sure it will be a pitfall, but we believe that we have done more in-depth work on the supply chain by choosing the best partners and by keeping contact with suppliers when they are prepared to increase their activity,” says Wood.
According to Boeing's CEO, James McNerney, the company's production chain has had time to prepare for an increase in delivery volumes.
We have a good feeling about the strength of the production chain.
We have been open to journalists, which is very important.
The CEO of the Airbus passenger spraying unit, Fabrice Brégier, says that the company will do everything to reduce the risks associated with its plans to increase the production of the A350 model to 10 machines in one month by 2018.
“Some reporters may not succeed, and it is our job to try to prevent this situation and to support journalists and look for alternatives, but there are great problems,” says Brégier.
Bregiér says that Airbus is not looking for pieces of sin: “The quality of the production chain is the responsibility of the main supplier.
So this is my job as well as Airbus.
Hong Kong protest teams are launching the \"Citizens of the period of the period of insolventity - the open elections in Beijing
China refuses to give full democracy to Hong Kong
The activists supporting democracy spread to Hong Kong streets after China has rejected their open elections.
The groups in favour of democracy in Hong Kong emphasise that demonstrations can stamp and swear to ensure that the period of inviolability in the city begins – to oppose the reforms proposed by the Chinese Government.
Thousands of protesters threatened the rain of Hong Kong’s dazzling horizons when they traveled from a democratic Occupy Central group to organise a demonstration in front of the Council’s law enforcement facilities on Sunday night.
The demonstration took place only hours after Beijing had announced that it would prohibit the right of voters to propose candidates publicly in the 2017 mayors' elections, under threat of such monthly demonstrations, which will further increase the city's chasm.
The protesters are taking place in front of the key government buildings in Hong Kong, Occupy Central.
“We want fair and decent elections,” says the 24-year-old website operator Dion Tse, who attended a Sunday demonstration with his 50-year-old mother Wong Chi-y.
The government does not respect the voice of Hong Kongers.
We want the government to listen to us and see the determination of the Hong Kongers.
The China People's Congress on High Laws approved plans for change in elections, which will allow only two of the three candidates to participate in the first direct elections in Hong Kong.
However, it is called for the approval of the 1200-person Nomination Committee and, in the opinion of opposition politicians, this will effectively prevent the entry of the disputing political point-by-point party to the electoral flags.
The protests of Occupy Central Love and Peace take place in Tamar Park in front of the Hong Kong government building.
According to the police, more than 2 600 people were currently involved.
A large number of policemen were following when some 100 protestors led by the Scholarism group were gathered late on Sunday to Grand Hiat, where L Fein, a member of the Communist Party, was scheduled to stay overnight after he arrived in Beijing.
Benny Tai, one of the founders of the Occupy Central, attended a press conference with members of the associations of the True Democracy, Scolarism and Federation of Students.
Or not to comply with the law, however, the exact date in which the blockage was carried out, but invited the participants to follow closely the development of the situation in the next couple of weeks, adding that the city would be officially transferred to the period of inadmissibility.
Benny or the press will answer the questions.
“ Look at the person next to you, ” he said, in his Sunday demonstration, in front of the advertising board representing the two insubordinations in China.
That man will take over the center with you!
The 17-year-old meeting of Scolarism Joshua Wong said earlier that preparations for high school students' demonstrations are ongoing and are designed to be maintained at the same time as thousands of university students are expected to show their opinion by refusing to teach.
\"In addition to academic responsibility, we have our social responsibility,\" Wong says.
In Beijing, Vice-President Li Fei, Vice-President of the Congress Committee, told journalists that the protection of the general right of vote, is far-reaching and come from some Hong Kong politicians who are trying to confuse society and mislead it.
“The unusual proposals such as the appointment of a public candidate have wasted a lot of time,” Li says, demanding that the electoral approach should be established in such a way that it is compatible with the real situation of each society and with the legislative framework.
The draft law on public voting rights can only be adopted if a large majority, or two thirds, of the 70-year legislative body in Hong Kong supports the idea of stopping 27 opposition members from the government.
Mr Li warned that Hong Kong might have to go into a prolonged political debate if the reform proposal is rejected as a right of veto.
\"It would harm business and city development,\" he says.
Almost 800 000 people voted in an informal survey conducted by Occupy Central in June to oppose China's requirements.
Even 172 000 people march on behalf of democracy on 1 July, while the march on 17 August against Beijing and against Octupy Central attracted some 88 000 participants.
Three injured lightning strikes on the New York beach
At a lightning strike on a New York bathing beach, three people were injured.
According to the fire department, men were injured at the Orchard Beach beach in Pelham Bay, Bronx on Sunday night when the storms went through the area.
The injured men are in hospital.
The extent of injuries is unknown.
The lightning hit when the rough storms wipe over the city.
The storm rains, thunder and lightning stopped the Labor Day weekend celebration and U.S. Open tennis in Queens and forced the music festival to shut down early on East River Island.
Ten of the commercial flights arriving at the airports of the city were delayed due to bad weather.
The new idea is not to please
This is the latest guidance for employees and superiors of network users, and it is distributed by Harvey Schachter, author of the Monday Morning Manager.
According to the entrepreneur Seth Godin, the idea of identifying such comments as \"I don't like it\" or \"I don't understand.\"
If this is not the case, the idea is probably popular and self-evident – then boring and everyday – or the benefits it brings are so little that they do not support the objective.
As a history scientist, Harvard Drew Gilpin never repeated anything that had already been published so that people wouldn't think he had anything new to offer.
Now, as a university principal, he repeats the same thing several times, so that the message goes widely.
The advertising consultant, Bob Hoffman, thinks that TV and radio are the best tools to create demand, while the network creates supply.
The fact that more and more news about the network does not mean that the internet is good between advertising – just as the first phone was also a popular communication tool but a bad alternative for advertising professionals.
Psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson notes that there is only one word to motivate workers: together.
In a study, participants were told that they would be critical of cooperation, although in fact they worked alone in an empty room; these participants worked longer and solved more problems than the participants who were not told at the beginning of the cooperation.
If the task is to find a repeated pattern or relationship between two units, the performance expert Dave Paradise advises to forget about Microsoft's SmartArt and instead use the Chartmer.com program where you can choose 14 different relationships.
Mount Stuart Hospital’s excavation in order to prevent safety risks
The doctor has temporarily resigned, and the UK National Health System NHS ceased to direct patients to any hospital in question after the hospital problems occurred.
Two people applied for the hospital in Torbay after they were in Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
The Torbay Hospital in Devon has said that it was connected to 19 patients on 26 July and invited them to ‘a critical clinical study’.
The Mount Stuart Hospital was very sorry about this and said that it had begun to investigate after the doctor got out.
It came to Torbay's hospital when two patients in Mount Stuart had applied for its first aid due to eye problems.
According to Torbay Hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients who were all examined on the same day needed repair surgery.
The Torbay hospital and the medical district of South Devon and Torbay have not directed patients to treat the problems of Mount Stuart.
David Sinclair, the temporary director of the South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation leading to the hospital, said that “we have identified the problem at its beginning and we have been able to contact all the patients concerned quickly.
Every time we direct patients to the service provider, we perform quality and safety tests and ensure that the service provider fulfils the latest regulatory requirements and that its licenses are in order.
According to Gill Ganti, the patient safety manager responsible for the patient safety of the South Devon and Torbay Hospital, who is responsible for patient safety, is always an absolute one, so it is important that these cataract surgery is not carried out until we can be absolutely sure that the treatment is safe.
The Ramsay Health Care UK company, managing Mount Stuart Hospital, asked: “I deeply forgive all patients with complications.
The company was informed that “the week when we found out about the potential problem, we and later the Torbay Hospital were called to all the patients concerned,”
This specialist has been authorised to treat Ramsay Health Care since 2005 and has been registered as a doctor since 1989.
To date, he has performed 4 537 echoes in different parts of the organization. According to statistics, the clinical results of the surgery he has performed have been excellent, and the complicated percentage has been less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor had temporarily resigned until it had been studied.
What's \"4chan\"
The most important anonymous communication site was published by the first published naked images
What exactly is ‘4chan’, and why was it the first option of the hacker when he published stolen images?
\"4chan\" was set up in 2003. It has raised a communication website, which is as much as it is called.
The site is divided into a number of sections, i.e. reporting tables where anonymous users can discuss any possible, video games and travel to porn and hacking.
Unlike other online forums, users do not create one profile that is constantly used, and their publications are not maintained.
On the most popular reporting tables, comments may be lost less than a minute when the latest publications are removed from the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchist and surprising creative atmosphere.
Members of the Community acting as anonymous have created some of the most famous features of the network (such as \"rickrolling\" and \"loolcats\", but the lack of the rules of the site has also led to a lot of question on the site or, directly, criminal content.
The most popular reporting table of the site is /b/, which is intended for mixed discussions and is regularly available in NSFW content (Not Safe For Work).
This may include summer porn, but also rough and shocking pictures. Unnamed hacker published public stolen images on this announcement board this weekend.
American CytRx invests in cancer research and development
CytRx aims to improve cancer – or at least slow it down.
A company producing biological medicinal products in Los Angeles, which had a short period of time ago to focus on the use of the shares in terms of efficiency, has specialised in the research and development of cancer medicines.
The most promising drug is aldocsorubin, a more advanced form of doxorubicin commonly used in chemotherapy.
CytRx performs clinical studies in the treatment of aldoxorubine soft tissue carcinoma, capos sarcoma and renewable glioblastoma or brain tumours.
It is as if it is a controlled missile that goes directly to the tumour and not to the other organs, says Steven Kriegsman’s CEO of CytRx on aldocsorubis.
Aldocsorubis contains so-called joint technology, which works like a Troyja horse.
It binds directly to the protein in the blood, which also collects into the tumours, when the medicine passes directly into the cancer cells.
I was just trying to give up the medicine in an acidic environment, or cancer cells, but not in a healthy tissue.
This technology allows patients to receive more cancer medicine and more doses.
“It is like a missile that goes straight to the tumor and not to the other organs,” says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx.
Like many other biotechnology companies that focus on developing medicines, CytRx does not make a profit.
This year, the company sold shares and thus raised $86 million for maintenance and research.
CytRx is currently searching worldwide for 400 patients in a critical Phase 3 clinical trial for soft tissue sarcoma alternative therapy.
Soft tissue sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in soft tissues of the body, such as blood vessels, muscles and fat tissue.
Alternative treatment is used for the treatment of cancer when the initial treatment does not result in results.
If the clinical investigation is successful, CytRx plans to apply for authorisation from the US Food and Medicines Management Board already in 2016, says Kriegsman.
This medicine could then be adopted in 2017.
Analysts say that data published from the previous clinical study of CytRx in December showed that aldocsorubis is a promising treatment for soft tissue cancer.
“We have not seen the clinical data on how much it differs from the medicine itself, ” says H.C. Wainwright & Co. Investor Analyst Andrew Fein.
The publication of results confirmed the many opinions that this treatment is different.
Fein, however, says it is difficult to predict the results and timing of the current clinical study, as it is significantly different from the previous study that produced good results.
- There's so many things to go right, he says.
Fein compares drug development to mining industry.
First, we invest a lot of money to find that one gold coin, and the investment will continue for so long that the gold vessel will be found, he says.
Money is spent on research and development so long that the medicine can be commercialized.
A number of shareholders have called for CytRx to be courted because they believe that it gave a better picture of its success.
The company is accused that it hired a DreamTeam Group holding investment relationships, who then claimed that he hired people to write positive comments about the CytRx company and the second biotech company Forbes, Seking Alphan, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet on pages like Forbes, Forbes, Seeing Alphan, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
According to the submissions, the articles did not reveal that companies paid commissions to authors.
As a result of the news, Seking Alpha announced that he had deleted articles that were against practice.
A number of articles were also removed from other sites.
Kriegsman refused to comment on charges.
The company has hired an outside lawyer to respond to the complaints.
\"I don't have time and energy to focus on this,\" says Kriegsman.
According to him, the real challenge of CytRx is to find talented workers who generally seek employment at centres such as San Diego, San Francisco and Boston in biotechnology.
\"This is in many respects the wilderness from the point of view of the pharmaceutical industry,\" he says.
Opinions of the Analyst magazine
The price of the shares in the CytRx company rose to USD 8.08 on 10 January and then fell to less than three dollars in April when the charges for the advertising of shares came to the public.
According to the Analyst magazine, the claims and negative disclosures have reduced the price of the shares as their actual value.
“It’s unfortunate, ” Fein says, “but I’m not sure if there’s any easy way to pass this matter as long as the concept is in force.
In the name of the law, the cameraman of the police series was killed in the middle of a description.
On Tuesday night, when he was shot in the middle of a shooting incident, the filmmaker of a series of real events, which is also in the name of the Law in Finland.
The cameraman described the shooting between a private police department and an armed robbery from a fast food restaurant when he was hit by a bullet.
He died quickly of the injuries he suffered.
According to the TMZ website, a person suspected of armed robbery was killed in addition to a cameraman.
In the name of Law, the first series of true-tv programmes has been presented in the United States since 1989.
In Finland, a series of MTV channels has been presented since the 1990s.
The issue of an outsider will rise to a crucial role in the court trial that started today in Ulvila's death.
Anneli Aueria is charged with the murder of her husband, Jukka S. Lahti, in 2006.
The court of Vaasa is now handling the case for the second time, because the Supreme Court restored the case with the new evidence of its flyer's right.
The purpose of the court court is that the judgment will still be given on this side of the year.
The court of Vaasa released Auer in 2011.
The court then considered the possibility of an outsider to be sufficiently likely.
In his opening speech, Prosecutor Kalle Kulmala expressed the view of the prosecutor on the night of the murder and of the things that exclude the possibility of an outsider.
In our view, the crucial question is whether the building has become an outsider who has killed Jukka Lahtien Anner in a way and in time.
It's Anneli Auer's report on credibility, Kulmala said.
Hendrikkos began a family relationship during which Auer had announced that he would leave home and seek divorce.
At some point, they moved into the kitchen where Lahti was caught from Auer and tried to stop him from leaving.
One took the kitchen knife. The Kulmala described events on Monday night of death.
According to the D.A., a number of things prove that there was no external factor.
For example, emergency calls are not a voice of an outsider.
The oldest child of Auer, the daughter of a child, told me at the hearing that he saw the unsub when he left the back room door.
The liberalization of Vaasa's court court ruling in 2011 was partly based on the daughter's report.
According to the D.A., the daughter's observation cannot be correct.
“Tytari did not see an outsider in her older bedroom, even though she visited there twice,” said Kulmala.
The new witness from the prosecutor is precisely linked to the possibility of an outsider.
Jukka S. Lahti's sister has told me about the events since the night of the murder in the hospital.
According to a woman, the daughter in the hospital only told me that she saw Lahti's body when she was in the closet.
Auer's defense intends to introduce legal investigation lines that the police have not, as a matter of defence, had not sufficiently resolved.
When the court of Vaasa released her three years ago from Auer's accusation, the court had to find a foreign man's DNA as one of an outsider.
The sample later proved to be the dna of a researcher working in the Central Crime Police Laboratory.
That was when a sample of 700 people was taken from the DNA.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspects and alternative investigators were excluded, the defense attorney Juha Manner said.
Another of the new witnesses in defence tells of the possible outsider.
The Ulvilian told the police about a Portuguese man who, according to a woman, had confessed to the act.
The police questioned the man in the summer.
The D.A. made a decision that the Portugueseman had nothing to do with the spirit crime.
A female prosecutor made a request for an investigation because the prosecutor suspects that she was lying in her report.
Another of the new defense witnesses is a nurse who worked at the headquarters of the Satakunta at the night of death.
In December last year, Auer was sentenced to lifelong imprisonment by the Supreme Court.
According to the judgment of the Court of Justice, reports by Auer’s children, noises from the outside point of emergency, as well as the time required to take action, were fought against the possibility of an outsider.
The judgment came in 2-1.
The judge, who was left behind, wrote that the evidence in the criminal case had to be interpreted as an advantage of the defendant.
That is why the daughter's report must be interpreted so that, despite the contradictions in the report, this had noticed an outsider leaving the back room door.
Two of the oldest children of Auer have been invited to hear the courtroom.
The girl was first heard personally last year at the Supreme Court of Satan.
In court, he no longer remembered the events of the night of the murder.
The second oldest child named her mother as killer in the video interview in 2011.
The boy told me he heard the events of the murder night behind the closed door.
He also told me that Auer was planning to kill for six months.
The son has no obligation to declare anything in court as a lawyer.
The court trial will continue today with Anneli Auer's hearing.
If you need to hear it, you'll be back tomorrow.
Anneli Auer is currently in prison for more than seven years of sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin’s participation in the G20 be allowed?
Putin's actions in Ukraine have made him many people.
Putin is due to attend the G20 summit in Brisbane in November, and Australia is eager to discuss whether or not his entry should be allowed.
In the weekend, the Punkrockactivist group, Pussy Riot, requested Australia to ban Putin's participation summit involving more than 4,000 representatives from the most powerful states in the world.
“We do not think that this person has anything to do with the G20. Maria Alyokhina said to the public at Sydney’s fully-fledged opera house in connection with the Festival of Dangerous Ideas.
Kiev has warned that he is a complete war on the brink, and Putin calls parts of Ukraine “Novorossy,” i.e. to “New Russia, ” so is it necessary to welcome him?
Tony Abbott has said, \"to make a decision,\"
According to Mike Callaghan, the head of the Lowy Institute's G20 unit, the Australians cannot decide which meeting to attend, even though the meeting is held in the country.
\"Australia can decide who it is to let down, but it is an international meeting,\" she says.
Just as in New York hosting UN meetings or Washington host meetings on the International Monetary Fund, the father's task is not to deny any of the invited arrivals, says Callaghan.
Last week Tony Abbott said that he was making a decision - after Russia's disgusting actions in Ukraine.
This is a very important question.
Since Putin is coming to a very significant international meeting, Australia has no right to decide this on its own.
“It is important, however, that I am going to weigh a lot, and I believe that other countries will also do so in the next few weeks, ” he says.
People are taking part in an anti-war meeting in Mariupoli, East Ukraine.
The event lasts for two days, with a wide variety of representatives of the world's largest and fastest developing economies, with about two-thirds of the world's people living in total, representing 85% of global GDP and 75% of international trade.
Members include Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union as well as some specifically invited guests from countries not members of the G20, such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia was able to balance the various interests under great public pressure.
In his view, the prime minister's best way of handling this is to use the opportunity to pressure Russia to speak publicly about its recent actions.
\"The Prime Minister should say that we are going to use this opportunity to pursue a very open dialogue and that he will demand President Putin to make an account of his actions.
If Putin comes to the meeting, it is his duty to give an explanation of his activities, says Callaghan.
There is clearly an increase in geopolitical pressures.
I think the world is waiting for them to talk about these things.
Russian-minded rebels are preparing weapons at Donetsk Airport for an attack on the Ukrainian military base in eastern Ukraine.
It is still unclear whether to attend the Putt meeting, and Callaghan said that this is not necessarily known until a few days in advance.
I'm sure this is the last thing in Putin's mind.
He hardly points out that \"I must change my attitude toward Ukraine, because I desperately want to go to Brisbane in November -
Bill Shorten, Director of Opposition, responds specifically to Putin's arrival in Australia, but understands that this is an international conference.
It is probably time for the Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers to discuss with other countries and the G20 if it is appropriate to allow Putin's entry into Australia.
It is an international, not an Australian conference, I understand it.
After the tragic events that have taken place in Malaysia Airlines, as well as in the absence of a proper cooperation capacity in relation to weather, responsibility and aviation accidents, and now that thousands of Russian soldiers flock on the Ukraine border, I think that most Australians are very reserved for Putin's hope to Australia.
Germany’s business world criticises the “truths of Rome” - Berlin
Some of the German top-level managers warn that Germany has become very confident and untapped, as government policy threatens the competitiveness of the country's poor.
The criticism towards the Government of Angela Merkel happens at the same time as Europe's largest economy seems to be showing signs of slowing down, causing concern about whether it is able to turn economic growth on its path in the euro area.
Company leaders' criticism is the result of the intense opposition of the German business sector to political decisions, including the introduction of minimum wage and the reduction of the retirement age of certain long-term employees for 63 years.
“I think that the greatest threat right now is too much trust in Germany, which inevitably causes a sense of self-responsibility,” says Kurt Bock, CEO of the world’s largest chemical manufacturer, BASF.
EU economy
He said: “In general terms, we feel that we are working well, we have money to use and unemployment at a relatively low level.
I think there is a great danger here.
The German Government's policy shows that we are not focused on growth and that we are not a favourable environment for businesses, but rather we are much more focused on sharing wealth and meeting the expectations of certain people.
According to Markus Kerber, the CEO of the German Industry Organisation, Markus Kerber, the situation in Germany is now good.
In the next ten years, however, every developed economy will have to change. ...[in Germany] the reform programme will not achieve as much progress as in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce has also expressed criticism about recent political developments.
Germany's unemployment has remained at a low level and the budget is almost balanced, and the already slow consumption is growing again.
However, the second quarter of GDP has highlighted the vulnerability of export-oriented Germany to external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP decreased by 0.2% over the three months preceding June compared to the previous year.
Germany's reduced performance threatens to make the ECB's fight against inflation even more difficult and may make it more likely to recover quantitatively.
Kerber would like government-to-public consumption to return to public investment, for example by focusing future consumption on infrastructure and not on pensions.
According to Kerber, Merkel's government will destroy the fruit generated by his social democracy predecessor, Gerhard Schröder, at the beginning of the 21st century.
According to Stefan Heidbreder, the CEO of the Stiftung Familienunnerhmen Foundation, established for family businesses, continues to be good in comparison with other countries.
It is a thanks to businesses and not to government policy. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
The French example has shown that the use of money for social support and the restriction of the freedom to run a company is the wrong way to act.
The leading German investment banker described the situation more clearly, in other words, that recent decisions taken by the government are a disaster-
Germany is threatening to lose everything it has worked so hard to please voters.
This is my main concern at the moment, the banker says.
According to Bock, the energy reforms of the new government coalition failed to resolve the fundamental weaknesses of the policy which have caused the industry to be less competitive.
Ashton Kutcher's handcuffing with music festivals, prevented security guards from getting to the fan
Actor Ashton Kutcher attended the Stagecoach Academy Festivals in India, California, where he was told that he had a violent argument with a tight security officer.
Ashton Kutcher is told by the security officer of the struggle at the Kantrimus Music Festivals.
Kutcher's fan tried to approach him in a backstage at the Stagecoachcantrimic festival in California, and then the situation was robbed of his hands, theTMZ website says.
Kutcher was in the VIPs when a young woman approached him to say hello and to hand him over.
When the star of the male-sex series went to say hello to a fan, an over-informed security man went in and caused a doll.
The actor and securityman drove into a handwreck, and Kutcher's friends had to go between them to arrest Kutcher, TTZ says.
After his ex-wife demi Moore Kutcher is dating Mila Kunis, who is like Kutcher, the stars of the former '70s show.
The Nujakka happened shortly after Angus T. Jones was practically removed from the standard show card after he published a video in which he calls the series \"serious\" and urges fans not to look at it.
Actor Ashton Kutcher participates in Stagecoach Music Festivals in California.
Angus T. Jones, James, calls the series \"serious,\" and urges people not to look.
The Baltic bacteria killed a vacationer
Six people have been infected by a bacteria that comes from the Caribbean, which has been placed at the most popular German tourist destination.
One of the sick is in a coma.
Vibrio vulnificus is seen in parts of the Baltic Sea and other parts of the world, but it is found in the Gulf of Mexico.
The bacteria are most effective in spreading over 20 degrees of broken water.
“The bacteria can be found anywhere, as long as the conditions are correct, Dr. Heiko Will, director of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Health and Safety Agency (LAGuS), told The Local magazine.
The bacteria are also found in Denmark, Poland and along the coast of Germany.
According to LAGuS, the disease had been on vacation on the island of Usedom at the end of July.
He died early in August.
Another pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks, and it is possible that his leg should be shot.
He went swimming near Ahrenshoot with a small wound on his leg.
The sick man went to the hospital after he found out that his leg had become blue.
Doctors reported blood poisoning caused by Vibrio vulnificus bacteria on foot.
“My husband would certainly not have spent time in the Baltic Sea area if he had known of the danger, the sick wife Sonja Bruehl told Oscee Zeitung.
A serious disease and damage to the patient and the family could have been avoided if the data had been better provided.
LAGuS told the dpa news agency that the doctor had called for the following infection at the beginning of the summer, but no official notice was given.
Cool temperatures have brought about a lower risk of bacterial disease.
“[Maantain] test results showed that the strain of V.vulnificus has decreased significantly,” Dr. Will says.
Cool weather has worked.
Vibrio vulnificus, a relative of collera-induced bacteria, is particularly dangerous if a person has pre-existing chronic liver disease and reduced immune response such as HIV or diabetes and elderly people.
The risk of male disease is greater than that of women, as the oestrogen has been identified as protective pathogens.
If the bacteria develop, it causes blood poisoning and septicism.
The probability of loss of bacteria to illness is about 25 per cent.
V.vulnificus can also be infected by eating its contaminated marine animals, although Dr. Will says that in these cases this is not something to be infected.
Food pollution from the sea is more common in the southern half of the world.
In Germany, V. vulnificcus caused poisonings the previous time in 2010, when two people died of it.
Vieno Kekkonen: The breast was removed because of cancer
A 80-year-old singer, Vino Kekkonen, is working hard, but has also been afraid of his health.
I can't believe the radiating Vieno Kekkonen's been filling in for 80 years.
He himself is astonished as to how many years of age can suddenly be so many.
I haven't really realized I'm this old.
For 80 years, it does sound so much, Vino Kekkonen laughs.
His birthday, Vino Kekkonen, is spending time with his family.
At the end of August, he was given a birthday party by a folk music and pension society in Kartula, where he lived his childhood.
We were on the stage of Kekkola, in the same place my grandfather was born.
I was so ashamed of the party, the birthday hero tells me about the opportunity where the stage measured for three hundred was filled with congratulations.
A few days later, Armi Kuusela was gathered together in Muho, whose life Vieno Kekkonen remembers being followed when he was young.
And now we're both our age!
Vieno Kekkonen is laughing.
During his long career, there are only few aspects not seen in public by Vino Kekkos.
One thing he has never said in public before: 2006 he was removed from another breast.
There was an unclear finding on my breast at a point where it was decided to be completely removed.
That was not the end of the day, of course, the cancer I was happy about.
A new breast was made during the same surgery, so it was a rather large measure.
Vieno Kekkonen has not thought of losing his own breast in a way in vain, for knowledge of the unclear discovery would have been a heavy burden and cannot be left out of care.
I was only so relieved when there was nothing serious, Vino Kekkonen tells me and points out that for younger people the loss of your breast is certainly more difficult.

The farmer is made guilty of the state of the sea
The debate on the poor condition of the Baltic Sea and its connection to Finnish agriculture is depressive.
The voice of experts has been drowned in political aspirations.
In particular, Helsinki’s Words and Yle have shared the responsibility of agriculture for nutrient emissions to the Baltic Sea during the summer.
Fast action has been required to control emissions in the same breath.
The average farmer seems to have a few environmental scientists and, with their help, they have been trained in comparison with the above-mentioned nutrition experts.
The farmer knows that the nutrient spray cannot be grown if the same amount of nutrients has been bathed in the field as is harvested with the harvest.
In Finland, almost all farms are committed to the environment programme.
It strictly limits the use of fertilisers and requires accurate monitoring and reporting for the nutrient.
The authorities shall monitor compliance with the conditions.
In the field, stored nutrients have been drowned in water bodies even after fertilisation restrictions, but even for years there has been a clear reduction in emissions.
The farmers have a desire and willingness to continue to work to reduce nutrient emissions.
However, everyone should understand that access to zero levels is impossible.
“If we are to have an approximately equivalent amount of agricultural production, it is only acceptable that this is the case, Jyrki Akkula, Director of the MTT Environmental Survey, says (MT 29.8).
The summer went to the Gulf of Finland with massive blue-skinned plants.
The researchers were quite unanimous about the fact that the rest received its growth power from the marine’s own phosphorus stocks.
The phosphorus stored on the bottom of the sea is partly withdrawn from the agriculture of the coastal states for the past decades, but it alone does not explain the stocks.
The treatment of waste water from the growing cities of the Baltic Sea until the end of the 19th century.
The problem also concerned large-scale Helsinki waste water and was not seen as a problem as regards the pollution of its own wrists.
The pollution of the shores was prevented by the construction of a waste water pipe in the open sea in the 1980s.
Of course, the quality of water under control has improved over the years.
In time, the endings of the sea will not be removed even if agriculture is completely out of Finland.
However, every single blue debate and the accusations that have been made are always directed at agriculture today.
The public debate is an expression of the farmer's guilt in the state of the Baltic Sea.
The accusation is unreasonable, but it becomes increasingly difficult when it is used to implement political passions.
The Greens, under the leadership of the Environment Minister Ville Niinistö, run major changes to agricultural environmental standards.
As a deportation plate Niinistö has spent summer's rest conversation.
In my opinion, Nimistö has accused producers of the existence of an association of interest for the past and considered it the most difficult barrier to water protection.
There should be some kind of limit on political rhetoric.
Most of the specific water protection projects are based specifically on cooperation between the RTD, farmers and environmental management.
The type of style attacking the Nimista is more served by fishing the voices of the city greens than by water protection.
I guess that's the purpose.
With hard talk, the Greens are preparing to leave the government.
In policy change, the task of the PSC is to ensure that its members live.
It is difficult for farmers to trade expensive changes unless they have a substitute for their costs.
The only money that Ville Niinistö has presented is the cuts from other agricultural funds.
The cancellation of mining tax does not go through: Palmer
The latest attempt by the Abbott government to throw a mine tax on the trash basket seems to have been destroyed, as Clive Palmer has declared that his senators will reject it without any change.
The Labour Party in Australia is also concerned that the government has included a new initiative with a provision that could limit employers' contributions to compulsory pension payments up to 2034.
The government used a qualified majority in Parliament's sub-house on Monday to speed up the process of repealing the general confusion and a clear frenzy of the Labour Party.
It sided with the original annulment initiative, which had previously made significant changes, and replaced it with a new bill, which it described primarily in taxes, pension payments, social security and family social assistance.
Originally, this initiative was aimed at repealing the ‘restricted’ mining tax and other decisions, such as a low income pension fee (3.6 billion dollars savings), the income subsidy bonus (1.3 billion dollars) and the bonus for school-age children (4.7 billion dollars).
Clive Palmer, director of Palmer United Party, did not accept the transfer of the government.
“The planned mining tax cancellation initiative is not accepted in the Senate without a low income pension fee, a bonus bonus for income and a bonus for school-age children.
The government needs support from independent parties such as UPU to ensure that the Labour Party and the Greens do not oppose the initiative in the Senate.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Chris Bowen, accused the government of trying to eliminate Parliament's power to decide on the compulsory guarantee of pension payments, giving the Minister for Finance all the powers of decision.
This is unpredictable, he said to the journalists in Canberra.
In this way, the government could delay further increases, with the 12% objective of the guarantee for the contributions of the Labour Party to be made up to 2034.
\"It is in no way acceptable, and the Labour Party will, of course, oppose any means,\" says Bowen.
The guarantee is now 9,5 %, but the government wants to give the Minister of Finance the power to decide to stop any future additions.
The man's body was found on the beach at Brighton's pool.
The Sussex police picked up an unidentified man's body before the morning's rising water, and the police closed the area near the beginning of the Volk's Electric Railway.
The police and the medical officer are working to find out where the body went to the beach.
We haven't identified a man yet.
Researchers go through the list of missing persons to determine whether missing persons are connected to the body.
The police were not yet able to confirm whether death occurred under suspicious circumstances.
According to the Mexican police, by an accidental explosion at the border, one of the victims of death was killed.
According to Piedras Negras's police, an accidental explosion at the customs building at Mexico and the United States border caused one woman's death and five other people's injury.
Felix Alberto Lopez Arenas acts as an operational director of the local police of the city border of Texas.
He told the Associated Press news office that the woman who died in the Sunday explosion had damage to her skull and five others had burns.
According to Lopez Arenas, the explosion occurred this morning in customs accommodation.
The cause of the explosion is currently being investigated, but the authorities believe that the explosion was caused by the accumulation of gases.
The explosion didn't affect border guards.
Three Atlantic City casinos are closed in September
Three Atlantic City casinos are closing their doors this month
The male client plays in the Showboat casino, which is scheduled to close his doors, Atlantic City, N.J., 29.7.2014
September is expected to be a difficult month for Atlantic City when three casinos share their last cards on the table
Three casinos will close their doors in Atlantic City this month in New Jersey, which means, at the same time, that this neon-light, well-known metropoli, known as the money machine's race, can no longer be counted for the game results.
More than 5 000 workers remain unemployed in the closure of Showboat and Reval casinos this weekend, the Associated Press News Office reported.
More unemployed will come when Trump Plaza turns off its light.
Three casinos, one of which had only been able to work for two years, were expected to close the city’s latest disaster after the story of Atlantic Club was completed only eight months earlier.
By the end of September, more than 25% of the casino workers in the city, 8 000 people, will be unemployed, New York Times will write.
When gambling was allowed in New Jersey in 1976, casinos were advertised as a sure choice for Atlantic City, the AP News Office writes.
However, the local gambling industry has received a lot more competitors when the casinos of New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania hold the vast majority of Atlantic City once of such huge casinos.
Even those who were opposed to gambling earlier, Massachusetts looks at his own share of money by welcoming three casinos to the state.
TVO: The new timetable for Areva is difficult to accept
According to Power (TVO) in manufacturing, it is difficult to accept the new assessment by plant supplier Areva, according to which Olkiludoto's third reactor will only be available for commercial use until 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennoinen, the project manager of the power plant project, this is due, among other things, to the fact that construction works are already largely ready and the number of works between them is known.
TVO will continue to assess the information received from Areva.
Silvennoinen notes in the communication that TVO welcomes all initiatives that can speed up the project.
Today, Areeva submitted to TVO the updated timetable for Olkiluto 3, according to which the construction work of the Triangular reactor would be completed in mid-2016 and that commercial activity could begin in 2018.
According to the Areva report, recent delays in the project have mainly led to the approval of reactor automation systems that were received in April.
This was preceded by four years of negotiations with TVO.
Olkiluto 3 was supposed to be completed in 2009, but the schedule has been postponed once after each other.
TVO and Areva have been arguing for years on which responsibility for the delay.
There is a dispute in the right of arbitration where Areva has requested compensation of EUR 2.7 billion from TVO.
On the other hand, TVO considers Areeva’s requirements justified and requires about EUR 1.8 billion from the company.
Cooperation between energy and water actors is needed in the face of global challenges
International leaders met today in Stockholm during the 24th International Water Week, calling on energy and water operators to work together to meet the greatest challenges of our time to ensure sufficient water and energy production for the growing population.
The theme of the 2014 Water Week is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are very often dependent on each other.
Energy is needed for water pumping, storage, transport and cleaning, and water is needed for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, it will affect the other immediately.
These two funds are also an integral part of sustainable development and must always be kept in mind when making global decisions.
At the opening of the water week, the CEO of the Stockholm International Water Institute, Torgny Holmgren, who organised the Water Week, said that the challenges are enormous.
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 50 %, and energy consumption is expected to increase by 50% over the next two decades, and therefore closer cooperation between energy and water operators is urgently needed to find solutions to allow all the peoples of the world to flourish.
Professor John Briscoe, the winner of this year's water award, described the water as an opportunity for growth, which needs both society as a whole and other sectors. Briscoe said that developing countries face major challenges.
They need to mobilise these funds.
Briscoe added that there is no permanent solution to the \"water crisis\".
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that form a chain.
During the week, representatives will discuss ongoing and future work and cooperation of energy and water operators during more than a hundred seminars, workshops and events.
Originally from South Africa, Professor John Briscoe receives the Stockholm Water Prize from His Majesty, King Charles XVI of Sweden, from Kulta, in a ceremony at the Stockholm City Hall on Thursday 4 September.
The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) is a research centre that produces research data and provides decision-makers with information so that they can make rational decisions for water and sustainable development.
The flying of foreign bodies of the dead home in Miami: The cost of flying bodies
In October 2012, 23 Cuban refugees transported to Miami and 14 people were reported dead.
The same has happened to hundreds of years earlier, and I'm sure this was not the last of its quality.
Every year more than 1 000 U.S. migrants die trying illegally to cross the US border.
Because of the first town, they're ready to die.
It is ironic, though, that when it comes to the first city in the country, it is rarely planned to remain there until its last breath.
For many, this city is a temporary place of residence: either asylum, effort board up or a better place to spend time waiting.
Few people imagine they die there, and when death approaches many people are planning to return to their homeland.
In the popular cities of migrants, there is a disproportionate number of people born abroad and temporarily resident in the country, and death and return to the country continue to work.
It is estimated that 20% of the bodies that died in South Florida are flown elsewhere, more than anywhere else in the United States.
Most of the human remains (HR, short form of professional slang) are flown to the homeland from the international airport of Miami.
Since 1964, according to the CEO of Pierson, the largest company in the sector, approximately 80% of this traffic goes abroad, and the company flys bodies to several destinations in the Mediterranean and South America and to several European countries.

The more migrants move to popular cities, the more they die there.
Even after he died, there's a cost to go home.
Miami is the main airport for Latin American flights by American Airlines, and the figures in the table describe the human remains that the airline has flown back to its country in 2013.
The return of bodies to the country is not cheap: prices can vary from five to hundreds of thousands of dollars.
The religious, cultural and public health requirements associated with the flying and delivery of human waste also vary.
The migrant communities of the popular cities of migrants sometimes organise funeral communities to help with costs, as the return of the bodies is expensive, the government does not help the process and the deaths are often young people without insurance.
Some credit institutions and non-formal health insurance programmes were born in the past from entities set up by Italian, Jewish and Greek citizens living in New York, the United States' first migrant groups.
New generations of Mexicans, Chinese, Filipinos and Bangladeshn migrants now operate in many of their popular cities.

Death abroad always causes difficulties, as few foreigners plan to make their last resters from a migrant town.
For example, in Dubai, the Sharia Act applies to foreigners who have died without will, even if the laws on the recovery of the dead are different.
The whole property of the dead shall be frozen and then distributed in accordance with the decision of the Sharia Court.
A network of human remains carried by Aer Lingus flying its headquarters in Dublin (
2013) The scale reflects the multicultural population structure of the city and the Irish.
The airline suspended the service, but started again in 2004 after obtaining a negative return from those who moved from the country.
The idea of death is rarely present when a person passes through a popular city of migrants or living there.
On the contrary – temporary or permanent migration to the settlement city is an open declaration of the mover’s way of view of life, not death.
However, the death abroad means taking decisions that are the most powerful and unrescinded – decisions whether to belong to the local or global community, to the universe or to the country, to the short-term or to the eternal.
The Centre and the Left Alliance are making a distinction between the issues of the interim dimension
The opposition parties to the centre and the left-wing union intend to give the government an interim question on the income of low incomes and on the increase in inequality.
The parties want to raise a debate on people's income problems, which are exacerbating poor economic development and exacerbating unemployment.
Growing inequalities are also seen between the various parts of the country and within large cities, and the parties point out in their information.
In the next year's budget, cuts and tax increases are directed at low incomes, such as students, unemployed and pensioners, family and ordinary employment, while, among other things, food, medicines and housing continue to grow.
Indeed, almost half a million people are already unemployed, the parties say in their press release.
The income problems of employed people have also worsened.
I will discuss the matter and the parliamentary groups of the left-wing union on Thursday.
The third opposition party's fundamental Finns have already announced that they leave an intermediate question about police and internal security resources.
The parliamentary session will begin tomorrow on Tuesday.
New York City West Indian Day is about to start
The Caribbean culture will once again be able to reach light in New York City, where West Indian Day is one of the biggest outdoor events in the year, and there politicians will also see each other and see each other.
The annual parade will be held in Brooklyn on Monday.
It takes up traditional Carneal Festivals prior to roasting, and part of it is dancers who carry complex, often sweet-made costumes.
Eric Adams, President of the Brooklyn region, is the festival master of this year, but there are also many other faces known in politics.
The parade is an excellent opportunity for current and candidate politicians to welcome the audience a week before the pre-elections.
Despite the sexual abuses, violence has been included in the Paradise weekend in previous years.
The police have said that they are trying to keep the event safe by means of additional measures, including by monitoring the activities of nearby gangs.
Do you even want to ask rhetorical questions?
Everyone knows rhetorical questions, doesn't they?
You don't have to answer that question.
This figure of language, that is, the question that is not expected to be answered, but which points in a direction of a specific response, tastes both high-aired speeches and daily exchange of words.
The initial words of the famous Catilina in Ciceron are the chain of rhetorical questions, the first of which is: “How long, O Catilina, you are going to take advantage of our patience.
The same applies to my wife’s questions: “Why shouldn’t I warm up five days old chickens for children?
Why are you so tense?
The difference is a better word for a rhetorical question.
The force of the rhetorical question lies in the fact that the question is open and the public is inclined to accept the question.
A mysteriously rhetorical question suggests that no one full-fledged could agree on it.
David Williams, a writer in the 19th century, described the rhetorical question as “who is shown to be an excellent way of producing a strong feeling about the truth about a subject, and at the same time the challenge they are faced with is impossible to disagree.
Taste skills
Restorative questions can be put after us if you want to achieve more ambitious goals.
Several subsequent rhetorical questions, designed to express grief or extremism, are called epilepsy.
For example, Job uses them when he appeals to the Almighty: “What good do you do that you suffocate me?
Do you have the same eyes as we do?
Do you see the same way a man sees?
The chains of rhetoric are also found in my wife’s comments: “Why did you cause food poisoning to children?
Are you crazy?
Can't you do anything right?
There is also a hypofora, which is the issue when the question is asked and answered immediately.
Isaac Hayes provides an excellent example of this: “Who is the black private egg that is the fear of sex for all women?
Parru!
That's right.
Who would sacrifice his life for his brother?
More examples of my wife: “What is the only food that the children have eaten and where they may have been able to come from?
This chicken.
Who was the idiot feeding it to them?
You.
Strangely, the rhetorical question does not usually try to bend, even though the rhetoric means skill.
If you are trying to talk to someone around instead of trying to preach to those who have already been turned on, or are exacerbated by someone's selfishness, you should use rhetorical questions in a sustainable way.
They are more useful in trying to reconcile opinions than in trying to get one to accept its own opinion.
If the public agrees with the claim: “And it is not nice to have such a sunny issue outside, ” the rhetorical question tells us that the speaker is sure to say what binds the speaker and the public better together.
However, this will only happen if the speaker is certain that there are no differing opinions.
By assuming that consensus has been reached instead of seeking unanimity, the speaker may seem, well, self-righteous.
In other situations, the rhetorical question refers to the weakness of argument.
In the headlines of the papers, too often the most strong possible argument in a very weak case is the rhetorical question: \"Do the aliens of pyramids\"
In both cases, there is a risk that the question may lead to a response which is different from that indicated.
\"Do you think the same way we were, as was the case with the British Conservative Party, a risky campaign clause in the general elections in 2005.
The party's gone.
For some of these cases, it has become a hobby, and questions such as 'QTWAIN' (the concept of the British supplier John Rentoul, made known by the British supplier, Questions To Which Answer Is No, questions that are not) are popular.
A few years ago, one of my friends organized a competition in which best examples were sought.
The competition won clearly the song “Do You Wanna Be In My Gang”, which sang by the pop star Gary Glitter before he appeared to be a sexual abuser of children.
The author has also written the book You Talkin' to Me
Investigator: The time of the federal compromise may be over.
At the beginning of the conflict, many countries were still thinking that a federal state could have some kind of compromise in the conflict, says Saari.
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, said earlier in the Russian channel interview that peace in East Ukraine would require discussions on the state of the region.
In practice, this would mean some kind of self-government in East Ukraine.
According to Putin, it would protect the legal rights of people living in the east.
Ukraine's transition into a federal state is, according to Saare, a certain priority for Russia's goals.
It is certainly for a reason to suspect that Russia would, through it, seek to influence Ukraine's internal policy, he says.
If there is no federal solution, the second option could be some kind of frozen conflict from the Russian perspective, where Russia would in practice control Luhanski and Donetski, Saari's assessment.
Western and Ukraine have been indicting Russia from sending arms and soldiers to the east.
Russia has challenged the arguments, for example, the Russian-minded rebels themselves have told us that there have been fighting in their troops, voluntary Russian soldiers.
Director of Upi: An effective role for the Katainen
A scientist reminds me that the image is new, and it's still forming.
According to him, it is the idea that Katainen would, in some way, coordinate or even lead to the Commission's work on competitiveness and employment issues.
Of course, the Commission is one of the priorities of the new programme, which is the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
That is how we are at the heart of the Commission's power, says Tiilikainen.
The scientist believes that the background, economic competence and role of Katainen in the course of the economic crisis will give him the opportunity to play a good role within the Commission.
According to the plan, it would be a no-fly mission, i.e. Katainen would not be under his own control.
Instead, Kata should be a team leader in the EU's competitiveness and employment, which could be co-ordinated not only with the portfolio of the Economic Commissioner but also with other portfolios in the sector.
In practice, team management could mean planning and guidance, for example.
Mothers of soldiers: up to 15,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine
According to the Russian Military Mothers Organization, up to 15 000 Russian soldiers have been sent to Ukraine in the past two months, and more than 7 000 Russian soldiers are currently in the country.
According to human rights organizations, at least 200 Russian soldiers are dead.
According to the organization, the hospital of the City of Rostov, near the Ukrainian border, is filled with wounded people in the Ukrainian war.
The soldiers' mothers collect their data from the soldiers' families.
NATO has estimated that there are over a thousand Russian soldiers in Ukraine.
With BB-Andte's alcohol consumption: \"After a little drinking, there's a story. \"
Big brother Jussi and Andte drove on Monday night to think about the life of the BB house.
On Monday night, Jussi and Andte, who was on the side of the basement, burned a fitness bike with the Andte of Kartano's inhabitants.
The twin wondered what they were doing in the opinion of the programme viewers.
That's not what you've seen before, Andte said.
In the opinion of Jussi, most of the time in the BB House is waiting and spending time.
Possible parties or tasks form only a fraction of the life of the BB House.
More than that, we wait and wonder and talk and live.
Andte, Anne and Jussi.
On Wednesday, the people of Kartano spent the evening with wet markings and alcohol, especially on Andte's speech.
Andelta asked if the party had made a man’s life more meaningful now that he had been able to talk to these other residents in a small hipray.
I'll have a little drink, and then I'll have a case, Andte admitted.
Look at Andte's interview on the ISTV video!
Anna Abreu reveals his body-building efforts in Me Nais
Let Abreu tell us in the Women magazine that he decided to move two years ago when he stayed at the gig.
At that time, Anna, tired of the job, thought she'd get more energy when she was losing weight.
Fred Montana / Split News
Give me a dream a couple years ago about the type body of Victoria's Secret models.
My body project was a Victoria's Secret model.
I wanted to look good, and I thought I wanted to lose weight, Anna's telling the newspaper.
Anna, who is presenting her body with toys and music videos, says that she's not a fan of passion, even though she's been named that way.
Vina Kytöjoki
Anna is fine in Timm, training in a gym and doing boxing.
The visible muscles are not important to me, but the fact that I get a certain weight on the gym, Anna points out.
Sometimes a pop star allows himself to be sensitive.
If I'm delicious, I'm very sensitive.
Sometimes I pull unhealthy guys, and I don't wonder if there's more pounds.
Instead, I wonder what my body thinks.
If I do something bad to my body, I'll be sick of it.

Anna says she's enjoying herself in her body.
The profit distribution of companies is pleasing to shareholders but does not increase growth
Are the leaders of the Australian stock exchange companies today just trying to please a large number by granting the shareholders' wishes for a higher profit distribution and buying back their shares?
Is the decision to switch from the company governments to the shareholders that the government serves?
The most important distribution of profits was shown last week at the end of the reporting period 2014.
The prices of shares in companies that have awarded investors in the form of buy-back programmes and by sharing more profits have clearly increased.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
However, the reverse side of the coin is that the consumption of capital will be reduced faster than the analysts have predicted, and this is a fact that many will ask if there is too much emphasis on the recommendation for a short period of time and whether there is sufficient focus on the future and long-term growth.
Some companies will, of course, return money to shareholders and finance business through other means.
For example, more funding will be obtained from cheap stock markets.
From the point of view of the company, this is reasonable because the loan is currently cheap, whereas capital is not.
However, even if the funds obtained from the loan market would not be taken into account, it is clear that transparency for shareholders is financed, above all, by the fact that the company spends less money on investment.
The net result of the wave (and withdrawal of profit investment plans) of this purchase programme is the decrease in capital on the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls for this reporting period, the loss of capital, during which companies have tried to keep the volume of shares down at all times.
As part of the same plan, companies have fewer and less capital.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of the buy-back programmes was 3,7 billion dollars and the value of the expected unrealised equity procurement programmes was 1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far that it sees the consumption of capital in a title of its report.
Although we now have figures that confirm that such a trend exists, there has been informal evidence for months.
The President of the Central Bank of Australia, Glenn Stevens, considered it sufficient to point out a few weeks ago that companies need a little more effort to increase their investment.
Stevens is not concerned about the future of individual companies, but with the overall impact on the economy, as the consumption of low capital usually results in negative effects for economic growth and employment.
Credit Suisse says that, on average, the own estimates of the reporting companies for the consumption of their capital have decreased by four per cent over the previous two years.
On average, estimates of free cash flows have increased by 2%.
Improving the cash flow is likely to increase the consumption of capital.
This rapid eye affects well from the point of view of current shareholders and the stock market, but it is also some kind of evidence of company obedience.
If I had a coin every time the CEO said that the price of the stock was not important for a short time, I'd be... well, the end of the sentence is easy to guess.
This claim is, of course, not the case.
The CEOs are very closely following stock prices and are very concerned about price fluctuations.
The bonus packages for suppliers for a short and long period of time are defined according to the value of the shares, and the status of managers depends on it.
The CEOs would like to say that some decisions, whether they are business deals, increased investment in an organisation or profit distribution, may not always be immediately recommended, but they are useful in terms of the medium-term strategy.
In fact, business leaders often complain about the fact that there is a very short-sighted approach to the investment market.
Therefore, the current lack of conservativeism seems to be positive for short-term objectives.
In the opinion of those who assessed the low share market and were in favour of saving capital, there is no such concern, but it was too clear during the reporting period that the weight was too high to reduce future capital consumption and that the most sustainable companies were encouraged.
The large mining companies, such as BHP and Rio Tinto, held a single share in the reduction of capital consumption, but also many other companies did so – part of the burden and part of the fear that they were afraid of the reaction of shareholders.
Then why are investors pushing companies to share profits?
According to the Credit Suisse's strategicist Hasan Tevfik, it is clear that shareholders want more income, as the profits of other more traditional fixed-income investment products have been reduced when, suddenly, the central banks have dropped interest rates globally to bring more money on the market.
In this way, investors have been forced to look for profits on the capital markets, and they are, in turn, pushing companies to share more profits.
Shareholders have also made it quite clear to companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies whose profit distribution is uncertain.
Investors would rather want money just as more and more investors are approaching the retirement age.
The statistics in the previous reporting period clearly show that the distribution of profit contributed much to the cost cuts of companies and not to the growth of turnover.
Public leaking cases appear to be a breach of the data or an email account
Jennifer Lawrence's photos and some sources indicate that the unknown hacker who leaked videos on the Internet is surprised by information security experts and Apple.
Although the hacker has published lists of female people in a chatroom and said that he has more pictures of women, some of them have reported that their images are fake, while others have said that they were long ago removed.
There's a lot of footage and there's been a number of people called Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton and American actor Mary E Winstead.
After the hacking, the biggest question is what the attack was done.
And were the pictures and videos real, and where was they loaded?
The main source of news – an unscrupulous and thorough attack on Apple iCloud – is the most unlikely option.
Large companies such as Apple have invested in information security teams working inside the house to try to penetrate the company’s own systems on a regular basis.
The large scale hacking into Apple's iCloud service is unlikely.
Furthermore, the original publisher does not claim that the claim should be correct, to point out the vice-president of the Information Security Research Unit of the Rik Ferguson, Trend Micro.
A simpler and more likely explanation for these people of public interest (and for applicants for less than one person each day) is e-mail address and password leaking, either by guessing or using information, i.e. by cheating on a real-looking site, which will then be used against them.
Apple will continue to investigate the alleged attack on the iCloud service used in iPhone phones for storing settings and, above all, for backup of images when they are transferred to a Cloud server.
The user's account can be entered in the iCloud service by issuing this email address and password, after which their images and other information can be downloaded from the account.
This can only be prevented if the account holder has introduced a two-step identification-two factor statement-, 2FA), i.e. an extra protection against entry into the account, when a code is sent to the owner's mobile phone before the account can be registered.
However, it is rare to use a 2FA feature, either because it is not known, or because it is considered to be poor.
Apple will continue to examine whether all information comes from its iCloud service, and if so, how widely user accounts were infiltrated.
The company has not given an opinion on the matter at the time of publication of the original version of this text.
Fernando considers it possible for the hacker to use the password - link in the Apple iCloud service by first collecting the e-mail addresses of the public, for example, from the address book of another hacked device.
It is also possible that the posters have used the same password in several services when passwords were kidnapped through them.
The publisher of Lawrence's images claims that the pictures are real, but don't tell me when they're taken.
Winstead said in his tweet that it could be a long-term hacking company.
These images were removed a long time ago, so I can only imagine how long this took for a creepy, awkward look.
I feel compassion for all the other people who have been involved in the hacking process, and he wrote in his tweet.
However, independent information security expert Graham Cluley points out that Winstead may have thought that he has removed images of his mobile phone, but removing the image from the modern smartphone does not always mean that there are no copies of the image.
Modern smartphones regularly record images for cloud service as they often do not have room for a large number of images from the user.
Apple iPhone's standard setting is to save images in iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ service and Microsoft's Windows Phones to record images in OneDrive.
Independent service providers such as Dropbox offer automatic images and data storage services.
People take and remove pictures, but they don't understand that they're downloading pictures from the account, Clley says to The Guardian.
Fernando agrees: “The removal does not always mean deleted, ” he states.
Pictures and videos can be stored for years.
If someone gets access to the user's email address and password, he can reload all the photos and videos that have been sent by e-mail.
Apple service pictures can be downloaded to your Mac machine, Windows PC or any Apple device.
The hacker published a screenshot that was claimed to be presenting videos and images taken from Windows PC so far.
Two-step identification is protected from such hacks as it requires everyone who tries to copy an account already in existence to another device to provide the original user's device, usually the code sent to the mobile phone.
Without the code, you'll be denied access to the account.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo offer a two-step identification account, but it is not yet known whether these public persons used the service, or how many of them used it.
Some have said that the pictures in which they claim to be are not real.
The representative of Ariana Grande has said that the pictures in which Grande is claimed to be are completely fake.
Victoria Justice wrote in her tweet: “The naked images that were taken according to me are INDUSTRY, don’t you understand?
Let me break the rumors to the root right now.
Cluley's bringing up another option.
Since the people of the public were the objects of the hacking, their accounts may have been broken by someone who kept their social media accounts or kept their email regularly.
“I would like to know if there are actors’ agencies or some representative involved in the matter, ” she explains.
However, those persons of the public do not use one publisher or agency.
Another option is that someone who installed one or more systems of the victim's security attack or helped to configure it and secreted the system so that all the information can be returned.
This happened in the case of Christopher Chaney, a floridian named hollywood hacker, where the hacker distributed images from Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis’s e-mail accounts in 2011, and he was sentenced to ten years in December 2012.
Chaney was accused of entry into the e-mail accounts of more than 50 people in the entertainment industry during the period from November 2010 to October 2011. In some cases, he asked Aguelira for pictures of the star in the name of this styllist, and then published pictures online.
Chaney later apologized, saying that his actions were certainly one of the worst violations of privacy that could be imagined.
Chaney also claimed that two people on the web for more than ten years were guarded.
According to Cluley, \"In the case of Chuney, letters were broken into e-mail accounts, and they were changed so that someone sent their information forward after the password was changed. \"
Cluley says that the obsession between hacks breaking into these accounts is a reminder of butterfly collection.
They just want to collect information like this.
In this case, it is possible that someone had encountered a list of services such as Dropbox containing information and login data in these accounts.
The hackers have also been able to try to intrude for a long time
or they could access the information of an e-mail account, such as an address book, and then fished the information of other persons.
I don't think it's a simple iCloud security hole.
Australia has offered its intelligence service to help the UN track down 44 peacekeepers that were kidnapped by terrorists in Al-Qaeda in Syria.
The terrorist group, Jabhat al-Nusra, is believed to have held 44 philisic peacekeepers in custody, which was the last week of the crossing point in the Golan hills and forced UN troops to surrender.
Peacekeepers have been missing since the middle of the week, and there is no knowledge of their location.
At the same time, ministers from the UN Conference of Small developing islands, including the Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, are very concerned about what has happened.
Bishop discussed the situation with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Mon at the summit, and he has provided Australia's help to save missing peacekeepers.
“I have assured you that Australia will help the UN in any way that it can, for example, provide intelligence services,” he said to the AAP news service on Monday.
We keep very close contact with all the co-operation and friends of the intelligence network... to ensure that we can locate them and that they are safe.
Bishop has already assured the Prime Minister of Fiji Frank Bainimarama and Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabol that Australia will take over its position at the UN Security Council in order to monitor the situation.
At the same time, a group of peacekeeping officers in the Philippines, held captive in military arms, was reported to have escaped from the different parts of the same controversial area.
The UN has been monitoring the Golan hills since the ceasefire in Syria and Israel in 1974.
You're the one who's trying to steal your money through a coal tax cancellation initiative, warns the Australian Competition Authority of ACCC
The killers use a carbon tax cancellation initiative to steal money, ACTC warns.
The SCAMwatch Unit has warned consumers and businesses not to rely on the government agencies for over-reliant offers offering thousands of dollars credit.
Players may use the media figures to prove to the consumer how much he can save in the purchase of goods after the loss of carbon tax and offering it up to $7,000, the warning says.
It may sound very convincing, as they have discovered the personal information of the victim that they use in trying to obtain bank information or in trying to get the victim to pay the commission.
They're discussing current issues to deceive the victim.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Also, a plane lost by MH370 and Robin Williams' death are inspired by fraud.
The ACCC instructs the company to contact the contact information it has examined, instead of the contact information provided by the caller, if there is any doubt about the identity of the player representing the company.
If you receive an unexpected call or an e-mail from someone who claims to represent the government agency or an undertaking such as an energy company, and according to which you are entitled to compensation due to the cancellation of the carbon tax, please be in your reserve.
If you believe you're being deceived and given personal information or transferred money to a fraud account, please contact your bank immediately.
If the offer sounds too good to be true – for example, the government distributed free money – it is likely to be.
Economic words: Lipponen blames the EU's Russian patents
Former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen criticises the sanctions imposed by the EU for Russia in the interview of Economics.
Russia's priority in politics is to take advantage of its own interests.
You don't necessarily make any sanctions for this. Lipponen says in the interview.
Lipponen has started work as a explainer of the business of the Central Economic Union for the Arctic regions of the European Union.
He is concerned that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) suspended their Russian project funding as part of the EU's economic patents.
“It means, for example, that environmental projects of the northern dimension, which have clear visions, go to the ice,” says Lipponen in the interview.
The freezing of funding is now detrimental to cooperation, which, according to Lipposen, may be difficult if there is no confidence.
However, he believes that the interest of Finnish companies in cooperation projects in the Arctic region continues to be as great as before.
He is currently working on an EC study on Finnish Arctic policy and business opportunities in the north.
It does not affect the acute situation in Ukraine or the situation in Russia.
The study is far ahead, we talk about ten years, he says.
It is rare that the norpp will be a low water or a nearby facility, says the Natural Pedagogi Vesa Heinonen Museum of Northern Finland.
At Vaasa Suvilahhti, an elephant was seen on Sunday, swimming near the beach.
According to Heinonen, the elephant is likely to come after Suvilahen's food.
It's not crazy.
This means there's fish in the area, Heinone's tip.
For example, on the Sundom Bridge, there are springs and autumn norpps, which are coming to the scene, especially after fish.
Norppa is still not a common species in the Vaasa Sea Region.
They're going to see an elephant in front of the villa, and he's going on.
Norway, among other things, lives in the Ocean and the Island Sea.
According to the Court of Southern Australia, Robert Vallelonga, a murdered pizzeriaist, behaved aggressively and violently outside the night club
Murdered with Robert Vallelon, a Southern Australian pizzerianoist.
In the hearing of the court, Robert Vallelon and his pizzeriaist acted aggressively for both his partner and his security officer only minutes before he was killed outside the night club.
In the lower court of the Adelaide Court, lawyers who accused Vallelonga of killing asked for a guarantee against their clients, since it was clearly a matter of self-defense.
Marie Shaw, QC, said that the case is not serious enough to keep his client, whose identity has not been published, behind the tents until the trial.
According to the evidence, the dead behaved so aggressively that he had to be removed from the night club, he said.
After that, the doll started, which resulted in this 40-year-old man... tearing up the security guard's shirt.
It is important to note that, according to the prosecutor, death caused one shot, which clearly refers to self-defence or to the defence of another.
A 25-year-old man is only being charged with murder for the moment.
Vallonga, 44, was found unconscious near Rundle St and Synagogue Place at approximately 2.25 p.m. on May 4th. He had severe head injuries.
He died in his injuries at the Adela Royal Hospital the next day. Friends and pizzeria customers were left to die at One Tree Hill's local legend.
According to the prosecutors, there was no cause for the murder of the accused, and after the incident he had told the cab driver that he had taken someone to sleep for a few days.
But now, there's something else to prove on the security camera, says Shaw.
\"It confirms that the dead behaved aggressively -- his partner tried to calm him down, and he received his own share of hard and violent conduct,\" he says.
On our client's side, there is both a presumption of innocence and evidence that he defends himself, which will be mentioned in the trial.
The prosecutors opposed the release of a man because of the fact that only one of the three security officers at the scene had been involved in the conduct of Vallelonga.
According to them, other security guards did not view him as threatening because he was short, and he used a big man’s vocabulary because he wanted to avoid physical assembly.
They said that the taxi driver, who clearly saw the case, would prove that Vallelonga was hit with strength, and he did not have the opportunity to defend himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered the man to be arrested until the next week, when he would declare his decision.
The controversial dolphin hunt began in Japan on the basis of tradition - foreign news - evening Sanomat
The worst weather was expected to delay the world, largely from the beginning of the horrific hunting.
In the Japanese city of Taiji, the annual dolphin hunting season began again on Monday.
It is expected to last until the end of February.
For example, the British newspaper Guardia reports a great deal of opposition from all over the world.
In hunting, hunters drive hundreds of dolphins to a remote bay depot where mammals are slaughtered after the choice of the most suitable individuals to transport to dolphins and theme parks around the world.
The dolphins' meat also becomes food.
However, according to the local authorities, the beginning of the hunting was expected to be delayed due to poor weather.
Information about practice was spread to the world through the 2009 documentary film entitled The Cove.
During the previous hunting seasons, not only have diplomats been criticised by animal protectors.
According to the opponents, dolphin meat has, in any event, a limited market because of its high mercury content.
According to the Japanese Government, those who defend hunting, it is a tradition.
The parties have also pointed out that dolphins are not endangered.
During the weekend, the dolphin hunt was opposed to demonstrations in several countries.
According to the Protestants in Tokyo, Japan's reputation was damaged by the world.
On Monday, Helsinki also held a demonstration in front of the Japanese Embassy.
Some of NATO's Member States are uncertain about investing new troops in Eastern Europe
The military union within NATO is divided between whether NATO's support points should be set up in Eastern Europe and the Baltic States in response to the crisis in Ukraine, reports the Financial Times.
Poland and Estonia have requested military union to bring permanent troops to their countries, but the German Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has been against the plan.
“Ukraine has given a new perspective to Russia’s policy, and it threatens to bring Europe’s security down,” told Michael Clarke Financial Times, director of the London Royal United Services Institute.
NATO Member States are in a meeting week, and the military union is due to publish its new contingency plans.
The main question of the plan is whether NATO could breach the TEE agreement on conventional weapons signed in 1990.
There NATO and the Warsaw Federation agree on how they invest armed forces in the Atlantic and Ural Mountains.
In practice, according to the Financial Times, the agreement prevents new military bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltic States.
Russia itself frozen its participation in the agreement in 2007, but the country did not express itself on the agreement.
In view of the situation in Ukraine, NATO wonders whether the terms of the agreement still need to be complied with.
“The resources of NATO must be in all NATO countries that need resources, ” said Sir Malcolm Rifnd Financial Times, President of the British Parliament’s Security Committee.
Matt Guthmiller flew around the youngest world
When other teenagers learned how to drive a car, Matt Guthmiller learned how to fly.
Of the 19-year-old Guthmiller, he just flew around the youngest world – and still alone, reports CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
A young man living in the state of South Dakota flew 30 000 miles to stop 23 times 15 different countries in five different parts of the country.
On his way to Guthmiller, he was treated like a rock star because of his record flight performance.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
\"A little risky, and \"some spoiled, rich kid just wants to see a little world and have fun...
Guthmiller did not have much to say to the rapporteurs of such comments.
Of course, I enjoyed a lot of fun, but there was also a lot of work to do, and I hope, in my record, I also inspire other people to go to the world and do great things.
Guthmiller's takeoff started when he was young, and at first he asked his parents to eat in the cafes on airports.
Later, he insisted on getting to flight classes.
My parents let me go to a short flight of $20, a 20-minute visit, but I think I'm going to stop my enthusiasm at that time.
No, I didn't.
Soon after, Guthmiller made an agreement with his parents to give him more time in the cab.
I agreed to share the car with my father, the whole high school student, instead of getting my own car.
I could fly planes at the auction store.
By 17 years of age, Guthmiller had received a licence and two years later he leased a single-engine Beechcraft for his single flight around the world.
A young man studying in MIT high school took care of the aircraft itself and made fuel calculations.
Many hours on top also meant that he himself needed more money...
practically a lot of caffeine and Oreos cookies.
Guthmiller says he's eaten a couple of inventions all over a long flight.
Flying into the clouds was both amazing and scary.
Air traffic controllers were not regulated in other countries to help them navigation around storms.
I had no idea which clouds were just a little higher than the plane and which were up to the height of the 45,000 feet and tearing off the plane.
Guthmiller's plane wasn't under pressure and there was no oxygen supply, so he couldn't fly above the clouds.
The fuel volume of the machine would never have been higher.
On the day following the interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died on a flight between Samo of America and Hawaii, which Guthmiller calls his journey the most difficult part.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Suleman, and he believes that the rise phase is technically challenging because of the high fuel needed for 16 hours of flight.
However, despite the risks and even high-level crime, Guthmiller managed to break the record and collect money for the ATK training via Code.org website.
He's a coder himself, and he set up his own company when he was 12 years old.
Guthmiller's goals are here in the sky.
It would be great to set up the next Apple, but let's see how it goes.
In any case, Guthmiller is going to aim high.
Aim for the sky and you can achieve something great.
It's more difficult to find a real Fahrenhei entrepreneur than you think.
Lori Joyce was excited to drink fans to his Cupcakes by Heather and Lori stores around Canada after Canada’s W TV channel began to show the Cupcake Girls programme in 2009.
The innovation continued until it became clear that one of the Franchise entrepreneurs was not in a position to do the right thing.
\"My Franchise entrepreneur sat in his car and called me for a hundred potential customers to be lined up outside the store and ready to buy a cup of cake, and he's not going to take the situation,\" says Joyce.
This event opened my eyes because it was a huge lost opportunity for us.
After the meeting, Joyce decided to change the process of selecting the Franchise partners to stress the culture of the company rather than the bakery skills.
\"Whoever can shine in an interview -- they know what I want to hear, he says, adding that he has held about 100 interviews for each 11 Franchise movement.
We start with six weeks of education, but workers work in a completely different way in their own working environment, so the whole process is quite difficult.
Finding the right French entrepreneur is vital to the development of any small company.
A strong and honest leader is able to modify and increase the organisation, while a well-functioning leader can cause expensive damage to the company.
Before I thought that looking for a French entrepreneur was like dating, but it's not true at all, you can do a lot to get to know each other before you get married, Joyce says.
Instead, in the case of a Franchise partner, a contract is signed, a guarantee is provided and a new store is built.
Being in partnership with someone before you see how a person works is a huge step and an important trust test.
The symbiotic relationship between the Franchise and the French parties reminds us of a strong marriage, as they have common goals, explains Lorraine McLachlan, President and CEO of the Canadian Franchise Association (CFA).
Therefore, McLachlan also feels that the Franchise entrepreneur should be careful to complain about the future French donor before entering into such a long-term partnership.
“This is the same as in relationships: if a date partner is rude already on date, imagine what he is in marriage, ” he says.
It is equally important for both parties to choose with care and to assess the future partner and to pay attention to the smallest alarm marks on either side.
McLachlan adds that French donors like Joyce can learn from past successes and mistakes, but for the first time, they must be more careful when choosing the first, most important partners.
Once again, the new French employers must be determined on the basis of a successful parent company, which challenges they have had to face and what skills the new French entrepreneur needs when faced with similar difficulties.
For the first time, companies acting as French donors may also request the help of a French adviser in order to create a profile based on industry’s practices.
McLachlan also points out that, for the first time, people who operate as Franchise sensors and entrepreneurs are provided with a lot of help on the CFA website at the elkforafranchise.ca.
However, the process will be easier later, as French donors learn to evaluate potential entrepreneurs better, but also because the first French entrepreneurs can provide advice and help them assess.
“The first French partner’s contribution helped Brian (Scudamore, founder and CEO of 1-800-GOT-JUNK) significantly in this creation,” says Erik Church, O2E Brands, operational director of O2E Brands, O2E Brands, companies belonging to O2E Brands, including 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me and Wow 1 Day Painting.
Franchise's entrepreneurs helped Brian create something that he could not have created alone, so the first French entrepreneurs have to choose this idea in mind.
Under Church there are 216 French entrepreneurs representing all three brands of O2E, and he is also a member of the Toronto Franchise of You Move Me.
Chruch's method for finding the real French partner is simple.
“The trust test we use is to ask ourselves, ‘ Should I call this person to my place for the weekend’s barbecue?’, he says.
If the answer to this question is 'en', you probably don't want to spend a large part of your working day looking for solutions with them to major business challenges.
In addition, Church points out that O2E Brands is largely grateful for the success of its Franchise structure.
In the business organisation, leaders often see their status as short-term and in relation to lower management levels as extremely formal, while the French entrepreneurs take a partnership with long-term objectives and are thus more committed to the success of the company.
“The French partnership has a much more good side than the traditional business structure, but the partnership is also much more intensive,” he says.
This is a partnership, not a relationship between the Vice-President and the local operational director.
Such a partnership is more difficult, but well managed it will produce better results.
Railway delayes fall from the prices of cereals in the North of the United States
The delayed train transport has led to a significant fall in prices of cereals in the northern United States, weeks before a huge harvest is expected to be under new pressure from the transport network.
Commercial cereals in the state of North Dakota offer farmers only $2.7 from the bus - about a dollar less than the control prices - primarily the cost of ensuring the capacity of the rails to be received, traders and agricultural organisations say.
IN Raw materials
The most acute problems are with the Buffet Berkshire Hathaway railways and the Canadian Pacific railway company.
The Federal Railway Monitor organises a consultation on service problems on Thursday.
The northern plains will have to rely on railways for the transport of agricultural products, as they are far from river networks.
The delay in the transport of trains increased when the increase in 2013 resulted in a very cold winter that caused the slowing and shortening of trains.
Some farmers believe that the transport of increased crude oil from North Dakota Bakken’s oil mix has excluded the transport of cereals, which is not correct according to the railway companies.
According to the director of a company engaged in international cereal trade, the costs of sales of grain storage and transferable sales to ensure the use of the train have risen from zero to $2 000 a year from the wagon.
Someone's gonna have to pay for it.
“These costs are paid either by the farmer or the customer,” says the director of the grain trading company.
The United States Agriculture Agency estimates that North Dakota's soya beans will grow by more than a third and 16% in the spring crop.
Randy Gordon, Chairman of the National Grain and Feed Association, says that “normally we are trying to start a new crop from a clean table, i.e. enough storage space has been empty and the grain has been sold and transferred.
However, we are now starting late because of the service problems of trains last year.
The railway company BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it will process the transport of this year's harvest smoothly.
John Miller, Vice-President for the transport of agricultural products, said that the company has reduced the number of long-term transport (cars ordered by customers for which more than four days have passed) from the beginning of April to 16 500, about two thousand.
“We have moved almost everything from the old harvest that we were meant to move, ” Miller says, referring to the previous harvest in the surplus grain.
However, the latest reported speeds of the BNSF crop trains were nine per cent lower than in the second quarter of last year, which is a sign of congestion.
Miller admits that progress was \"inconsistent\", but pointed out that the company is currently investing USD 5 billion in capital this year in order to improve the handling capacity of all kinds of products transported, such as cereal waste.
Due to the second fog, the speeds of the trains of the Canadian Pacific railway company that have suffered problems are 11 per cent lower than in the same year, but clearly higher than in the early year, much lower speeds.
The Canadian Pacific railway undertaking has said to the railway monitor (Surface Transport Board) that the changes made to its train order system should improve its capacity to deal with transport during the next 15 % period.
“The action plan of the Canadian Pacific railway company will focus on the continuous improvement of the speed of trains and the efficient exploitation of trains so that we can deliver more and more trains every week,” said the railway company’s representative.
The crisis in Ukraine may resolve the NATO identity crisis.
The leaders, diplomats and experts of large countries have often been concerned about NATO's future and whether the end of the NATO Afghanistan Commission will end itself with NATO.
However, this concern is very premature, as is evident at the NATO Summit in the Wales Cardiff this week, involving 60 leaders, including US President Barack Obama.
The task list of politicians and diplomats is no longer weak from the world's crises, even to the extent that the withdrawal of the Afghan troops, which was a priorityist, is no longer the most important thing.
On the other hand, 28 states are needed after Russia's entry into Ukraine, and this is a shocking reminder that the threat of European independence is not necessarily just a part of the past.
World leaders are looking for new ways to punish Russia, but they will also move troops, promise more money for defence expenditures and reinvigorate defence cooperation.
In some sense, NATO is to thank Vladimir Putin.
“It (NATO) is looking for some kind of purpose -- and it had a rather significant identity crisis,” says Heather Conley, Head of the Washington Center for Strategic and International Studies Programme.
NATO has not only found a new purpose, but it has also strengthened.
Obama has also added a new role to the agenda.
The President of the United States has promised to try to get world leaders to create a common strategy for quickly promoting the destruction of Islamic State military forces in Iraq and Syria.
According to official opinions, the President will face significant challenges in trying to encourage his partners in the war to respond to military responses, in particular to one that would cross the border from Iraq to Syria.
However, President Obama is under pressure to show that he is leading the world to find a strategy to win extreme Islam, first of all to establish that we have no strategy.
Western experts have put careful expectations at the summit on whether there are breakthroughs in Ukraine or Islamic State centres.
Further economic sanctions are planned as the main means of punishment for the event called Russian attack in Ukraine.
The European Union officials dealt with this during the weekend, but the decision on new sanctions was postponed.
The U.S. officials pointed out that the countries that Obama wishes to be the main partners in the issue of Islam are not necessarily NATO members.
The collapse of the problems could not be predicted two years ago when the previous NATO summit was held in Chicago, when the debate was held by the withdrawal of soldiers from Afghanistan.
One year earlier, Robert M. Gates used his last speech to say that the organization has reached almost a point of common military significance.
U.S. officials continually complained about the fact that other countries did not reach their financial objectives.
NATO members promise to use 2% of their GDP in defence expenditure, but only four Member States – Estonia, Greece, United Kingdom and the United States – achieved this target last year.
Now, however, the White House officials say that they have noticed a change.
NATO members are expected to sign an agreement with Cardiff to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The details were still discussed late last week, but the White House found that this time there is a genuine desire for a genuine desire for Member States to face possible threats to their actual composition.
After Russia's intervention in Ukraine, the defence promises are more important and more important than ever after the end of the Cold War, says Charles Kupchan, President of the United States Security Council.
We are quite hopeful that we will reach agreement between the 28 Member States.
Obama is using a large part of his journey to strengthen his commitment to defence cooperation for Russia's troubled neighbouring countries.
The President will start his trip to Tallinn, Estonia, with a three-day visit, where he will meet both the leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
NATO has recycled its troops in Estonia since Russia joined the Crimean peninsula in Ukraine this year, and NATO troops will be regularly recycled in Estonia when the new contingency plan, which will be published this week, will be introduced.
The plan aims to shorten the time that NATO needs to react to attacks in the border regions, officials say.
The plan includes increasing air surveillance and other visible defence cooperation marks.
The changes represent a small risk for NATO, who abstained from establishing permanent support points for Eastern and Central Europe as a sign of friendship with Russia.
According to officials, the new plan is not really a violation of the agreement, but it can also be a purely semantic distinction, says a Western diplomat who did not want to name in public in connection with the discussions before formal information.
NATO's presence is likely to be described as long-term, not permanent, diplomat said.
Is he using it in Ukraine?
Russia's President Vladimir Putin has one in his sleeve with regard to Ukraine.
The Western countries and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putin of the rebel arms of East Ukraine and of sending Russian troops to Ukraine's soil.
For this reason, the West has imposed sanctions on Russia.
Once the situation in Ukraine is tense, the Western countries are planning tougher sanctions against Russia.
Russia, however, has a licence: winter is on its way, and Ukraine's main source of energy is Russia.
According to the American authorities, Ukraine's primary energy sources are natural gas (40%) and carbon (28%), Geysar Gurbanov, active at Harvard University, writes Business Insider.
When winter comes to Ukraine within less than four months and coal mines are located in the rotting east of the country's conflict, Ukrainians will remain in their homes when gas supplies from Russia become humidified.
Therefore, if the rebels fail to achieve their goal, Gazprom, Russia's energy waste, will help Putin to win the war in the end, Gurbanov writes.
Last year, half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine on 16 July due to outstanding invoices.
Previously, in this month, Gazprom announced that Ukraine’s debt of gas was USD 5.3 billion (approximately EUR 4 billion) by 1 August.
According to The New York Times, Putin commented on the coming winter as follows:
I think that no one will think of it (letter) anymore, except Russia, Putin said.
There are always ways to make it easier.
Firstly, the immediate cessation of hostility and the correction of the necessary infrastructure.
In order to complement the stocks, necessary repairs must be made and prepared for the cold season.
According to Business Officer, Putin's comment can be interpreted as a masked threat.
If the Ukrainian army does not retreat in front of the Separatists, Moscow can use natural gas as a weapon.
Last month, Alistair Newman, Japan Holding Company Nomura, pointed out that Russian talks on humanitarian issues and the planning of a potential new natural gas crisis in Ukraine will be more powerful in a few months if Russia can maintain separatist activities until then.
Moscow has already announced that Ukraine will have to pay for future gas supplies unless the Kiova industry pays the accumulated debts.
The EU is trying to negotiate an agreement that would allow temporary continuation of gas imports.
Last week, Prime Minister of Ukraine, Arseni Jatsenuk, said that Russia is planning to stop gas supplies in the EU in winter.
Later, the Russian Minister for Energy Aleksandr Novak told me that the speeches were endless.
According to him, Russia will do everything in its power to deliver gas to the EU countries.
Liberal Aldabloggari received 10 years of imprisonment and a thousand devastations
The Saudi Arabian court has held a imprisonment sentence for ten years for Raif Badaw, founded by the Liberal Free Saudi Liberals Movement in May.
The judgment contains an additional penalty of thousands of pieces and a fine of millions (around EUR 200 000).
The judgment was founded on the fact that he had set up Islam on a degraded website.
On Monday, the judge told AFP the second founder of the organization Suad al-Shamari.
Badawi himself has been imprisoned since 2012.
Badawi was sentenced to seven years in July 2013 and 600 in prison, but was sued and renegotiated.
The judgment was also complained about in May when Amnesty International also pointed out its injustice.
Madventures Riku Ranta’s childhood experience in Afghanistan: “It was one of the revolutionary human matchings, ”
The Madventures published today a new book World Explanation, an adventurer's explanation of everything.
We asked Riku Rantal about the future of the world and the differences between Indian and Finnish culture.
The crime also tells us about the most important human encounter of his life.
The author, the journalist, the other half of the Madventures Riku Rantala, is a busy man.
Today's new book has been published, last night was a moviehead at the Civil Society and Wednesday starts at Ylelä Docventures' second production period.
Ever since the morning, he's been running from place to place.
From the maari's morning-tv, the child to take her to the day-care home and to the weekly meeting.
The most attractive interview you have reached must be transferred to a telephone interview.
Otherwise, we won't be able to make it.
In the middle of everything, he and Madventures have had time to stop and write the World Clearing Book, which according to the cover of the book, is an adventurer's handbook for everything.
Everything?
Oh, pretty much promised.
The book examines a number of themes, such as what is our future, why another culture is doing worse than another, why we are here and who we really are.
We took advantage of the interviews we've been doing over the years.
The book contains both professors and magicians.
We worked actively on the book for about a year, Riku tells IS by phone.
You've picked up a pretty big piece in the book.
What is the main message of the book?
The fact that the world needs to know more and big questions should be considered, because then we will do the best in this world.
On the other hand, the ancient book is good for travel reading, but it is also intended to get people at home to discuss and share thoughts.
The debate may even lead to action, Riku says.
KUVA: Pete Aarre-Ahtio
One of the themes of your book is the future of the world.
How does it look?
We concluded that the human race is optimistic.
Despite the warming of the climate and the current state of the earth, it is essential to believe that at some point we are making solutions to improve our situation.
The earth is a kind of alcoholic.
First, it should admit that we have a problem, only then can change, Riku philosophio.
According to some studies, Western mankind has reached the top point of happiness in the 1970s.
Since then our prosperity has not increased.
From this it can be concluded that when the money is sufficient and our basic need is satisfied, we are happy.
Money doesn't add happiness.
We want to wake people up to discuss what is enough.
Making use of our natural resources is not enough for much longer, Riku says.
In your book, you will also consider differences in cultures.
How does an Indian man differ from Finland?
People don't differ much.
Of course, the starting points are different in terms of education, health care and hygiene.
The culturally biggest difference is that the Community's importance is much greater in India as good as bad.
When the Western worlds are prosperous, people live more alone.
Let us distinguish ourselves from others, and it may lead to loneliness and anxiety.
When we find a proper balance between socialism and loneliness, we would be pretty close to happiness, Riku says.
The crime has encountered a lot of different people in the world.
What kind of human contact has the best impact on his mind?
It is placed in my childhood when I was with my family on the first big foreign trip.
We lived in India and Pakistan when my father was there in the United Nations.
I was 7 years old and two smaller sisters were involved.
My brother was just a baby, Riku's boss.
Back home, a big moving car came to Finland.
We were running a war in Afghanistan when there were huge numbers of refugees on the road.
On the road, a girl my age walked around wearing her little brother in her arms.
I was sitting on a big dick in my hand with a cook can.
Our eyes met, Riku describes.
A child of your age is aware of the situation.
It was one of the revolutionary human encounters I'll always remember.
KVA: Leena Koskela
Riku and Tunna at the book fair in 2013.
Then, at the bottom of my crime, we must respect other people even if they are considerably poorer or they do not have the same conditions of life as we do.
The crime was already discovered at that time that money could not be a measure of human dignity.
From adult memories to surface, people in New Guinea will rise.
I couldn't stop wondering how people were traditionally living there.
They use natural materials to benefit from everything, they don't exactly use money or metal tools.
They live in very challenging living conditions.
It's really hard to survive.
It made me think about it.
And he wants to think about getting his new book, too.
The idea is that our book would inspire people to read, watch and listen more.
That it would get people to act in a warm lovemaking conversation, or even in a fist fight, Riku will throw up.
It's about the Kauhajoki newspaper.
Events went on from the time the couple arrived at the bus station and ordered a taxi.
When the cab got moving, the man on the outside threw a cab after an item.
The driver got out of the car, and a man who was a passenger.
The man who threw the present stabbed the male passenger in his head life - threateningly, with his hand and left the place.
The sticker is a 170-175-inch tank, short-haired man.
According to the newspaper, there has been a young woman in the vicinity of the site, a light pon-tailed woman.
He's hoping to get in touch with the police.
The police will also request clues for any person who may have observed events or persons involved in the event.
On Wednesday, at 7.50 p.m., the stab wound occurred at 7.50 p.m.
\"Moi... said the brain to the brain... the first telepathic message in the world... passed through the Internet.
Scientific publication PROS ONE has published an article that the International Research Group has been the first to communicate the message directly to the mind.
The first messages that were sent through the system through the transmitters were \"hola andciao\", i.e. Spanish and Italian.
The test was carried out to monitor the electric power supply of the dispatcher.
The broadcaster was trained with the help of the program to send bits either by thinking about the movement of hand or foot.
The design of the leg movement was interpreted as zero, and the movement of hands to one.
This bit coded information was sent to the recipient through the Internet.
The respondent was caused by magnetic stimulation to detect a light beam for each one encoded bit.
The recipient had been taught to interpret flashes as a message.
Scientists admit that this is still a field of study in their children's shoes, but believe that computerized telepathic communication is routine in the near future of mankind.
Packages - Point - The future of the rural region
The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also blackmailing its own sanctions.
There is a political need for sanctions.
It would be impossible for the EU and the United States not to react when Russia wars in Ukraine and occupied Crimea.
In international politics, the reaction follows a reaction, action countermeasures.
Experience shows that all sanctions will only be reduced in the long term.
Iran was given a tendency to negotiate its nuclear programme only after years.
The South African Rotusortoorgan government sat in place for decades, even though trade was prohibited by UN decisions.
Penalties have also been used against Russia.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was not allowed to take high-level electronics and military technology.
Russia itself has put barriers to trade on the world page.
The last time I touched was frozen was the raw timber trade.
It is clear that sanctions for Russia are not going to get on their knees.
The Russians are used to bad times, and Viola's disappearance from the store does not cause panic.
When the EU intends to ban Vodka imports from Russia, it is mainly a joke.
The Russians will drink the vodka themselves.
EU sanctions are also selective.
The French will be allowed to ship air support vessels to Russia, but Finland cannot export milk.
The gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.
The biggest disadvantage for Russia is the end of imports of cheese or exports of vodka.
Most of the problems arise from the constraints of the financial sector.
They will only affect the future.
The Russian State cannot operate in international loan markets.
It needs to shorten old loans, but it's hard to take a new one.
Although Russia has huge foreign reserves, they cannot last forever.
The availability of credit for Russian companies is rising and money is falling.
Their own banks are unable to finance all of them.
We have to push more money, or we're gonna have to make a lot of money for companies.
Competitions are also competitive in Russia, Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis continues for years, Russia’s modernisation will stop, as the Russian expert, René Nyberg, wrote in the Helsinki Sanam.
It wouldn't be the first time.
At first, Russia would once again return to Russia and be walking in.
In North Korea, an exceptional freeband event was held.
About 10,000 North Koreans, as well as a number of diplomats, followed international freepaintings held in Pjongjang on Saturday.
Antonio Inoki of Japan, who moved from the Lawyer to be a free-presser, took part in the event in Japan, the United States, China, France, Brazil and Mexico.
In addition to the free matches, there were also local athletes' taekwondo matches.
According to Iok, the objective of the event was to bring the countries of dispute closer through sport and to promote world peace.
In their speeches, the politicians wished to improve between North Korea and Japan.
In the summer, Japan removed the sanctions it had imposed on North Korea as a result of the attacks of the Japanese in the 1970s and 1980s.
North Korea, on the other hand, promised to reopen the investigation of these cases.
Last seen in North Korea international freepaint in 1995.
SoOK will reduce around 110 people from the organisation of goods.
The Yt negotiations began in June, when a reduction need was estimated at no more than 130.
According to the company, its organisation has now been broken down into overlapping activities and areas of responsibility have been clarified.
SOK tells us that it is looking for a clearly better cost-effectiveness and synergies between different sectors.
In addition to the recession of the economy and the decline in consumer demand, there is a structural change in trade, which has undergone particularly trade in goods.
The result of the S Group's commercial trade has been lost for some time.
The Yt negotiations concerned all employees and management of SOK’s use and day-to-day goods trade, i.e. about 530 persons.
Turun Word: Part of the medicine behind the counter
According to the newspaper, there is going to be more medicines to be taken without a prescription, but only after the advice of the pharmacist’s employee.
According to the Finnish Farms Association, eye drops containing antibiotics, for example, could come into the field of advice.
After interviewing the Farmseutide or the Provisor and meeting the pre-defined criteria, the medicine should be guaranteed by a stamp, considered by Kirsi Kvarnström, Chairman of the Farmasis Union, in Turun Sanam.
Finland already needs to have a few medicines without a prescription, but it requires advice.
One such as this is a after-prevention product.
Corruption to More Reasons
Finland will pay more attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended by both the OECD and the Council of Europe, as the world is amazed at the lack of bribes and judgments in Finland.
By the end of the year, the Justice Working Party will consider whether there is a need for criminal law to refrain from trade in and abuse of influence.
For example, the differences in legislation were raised in the legal treatment of Patria’s bribe in Slovenia, Hämeenlinna a year ago.
In Slovenia, the trading of influence brought two years of imprisonment to the former Prime Minister, but the Finnish law does not know the same criminal code.
The network of cooperation against corruption has strengthened its cooperation as required by the Government Programme.
According to the newly completed survey, corruption is not much studied in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now ordered the University of Vaasa and the Police College to report on corruption in different areas.

Many of the players in the Western Sydney Wanderers team are in the first game, and coach Tony Popovic hesitates to throw other players at the Asian Championships League witch-sucker FC Seoull.
The Wanderers are in Dubai at a 10-day training camp, including two friends in Abu Dhab, so that the team can prepare for the first semifinal match to be held on 17 September.
Because of the excessive yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole leave the Korean trip, but Coach Popovic believes in their tuuras.
“I suppose this is a loss – they have been three very important players in ACL for us,” says Popovic.
Tomi Juric was banned from this gesture in China.
After all, none of the players should be gone, but we didn't have Mattya (Spiranovic) in the first game, and until now Daniel Mullen has been hurt.
Whoever comes in, I'm sure he's done a lot of work, and I trust the whole team.
I'm not afraid to play against anyone in semifinals.
The Wanderers will also have to be without Spiranovici, who will continue to recover from ankle surgery.
The defender of the Socceroos team was injured before the beginning of the season, but has continued running, and it is possible that he will play in the return match at Pirtek Stadium on 1 October.
He's back on the job and he's gonna be fine, Popovic says.
He follows his own training program and goes to Dubai with us, which is great news for him, because it means gradually returning to the field.
He's been practicing outside a couple of times, which is good.
It's gonna be a while longer before he's completely fine, but he's gonna be fine.
The Wanderers team in Dubai has world-class facilities at Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic also feels that the trip to Dubai is a good opportunity to get to know each other better after major changes in the last season.
“We know this will certainly help players create bonds,” says Popovic.
We have a lot of new players, and this is a great opportunity for them to get to know each other even better on the ground and outside.
So we use camp for many purposes.
Eliit's burger pays three times the employee's monthly salary
01.09.2014 21:18 In North Korea you can enjoy the luxury of rich economies if you happen to belong to the country's elite.
The Financial Times.
In North Korea, the informal market may be more flourishing than ever.
They provide a luxury for wealthy or sustainable ordinary citizens, which has not been used to unite in the dictatorship.
The Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park: a pleasure center, where only the ticket pays up to ten months' ordinary employee salary.
You'll get the burgers who pay $76 for the place.
It's three to five months' pay for a regular duunar in the country.
Under the pool, men drink beer in their shorts.
Life looks expensive and comfortable.
North Korean-Western markets began in the 1990s when the country suffered from famine.
The government will allow them to exist, even if the prices of the goods can be gross at their worst.
Yet, in the capital of Pjongjang, many have a mobile phone with a oukh of 200 dollars.
The reason may be in the ruler Kim Jong-un, 31 who has tried to create an energy and young picture of himself.
In his time, the administration has stressed the importance of technology in the decorating of the country.

Ormiston House: Stormont Council wishes for sale
The Stormont Council is hopeful that it will find a buyer for Ormisto House, Belfast, a building that cost taxpayers nearly 3 000 pounds a week.
The Council bought a building in the eastern part of the 18th century 13 years ago and paid 9 million pounds for it.
The Council was unable to continue to sell the building, when the security and maintenance of the building had to be paid to the Council about 400 pounds a day.
The building was sold at a cost of 1,25 million pounds.
Apparently, the building will be used as a private residential building.
The Council bought a building classified as a category B of historical value with 9 million pounds in 2001, as it needed more office space.
Later, however, it was found that the building was not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after the purchase of the building, it was re-selled at the price of 2,5 million pounds this time.
The building was not sold, and the price was calculated.
Last year, Mike Nesbitt, the Ulster Unionist Party, suggested that Ormiston House might be the premises of a new international trauma center.
However, the Council has now confirmed that it will negotiate the sale of the building.
According to the editor, the building will be moved to the new owner, as long as the paperwork is completed.
Both the Council and the real estate intermediary remain silent about the identity and sales price of the buyer.
The weekly security and repair costs of Ormisto House are about 3 000 pounds.
The Council bought the building from the police forces that promoted the Northern Ireland Policing Board.
By the beginning of this year, Ormisto House's security costs amounted to 885 641 pounds and maintenance costs to 371 379 pounds.
The price of repair and maintenance professional services was 250 015 and the fees for development and design professionals were 212 466.
The building was previously owned by shipbuilder Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887, when it was purchased by Harland's partner William Pirrie. The Pirrie later became Chairman of Harland & Wolff.
Soon after Lord Pirri's death, 1924 Harland & Wolff became the owner of the building. The company sold it in 1928 to Campbell College, which held it until the mid-70s.
“Excellence increases: Helsinki intends to reduce the number of school assistants.
No savings are made, says JHL.
In Helsinki, there is a radical reduction in the number of school-specific school assistants.
The reduction would not concern a child's personal assistant.
The Helsinki Board of Education decided to present a total of approximately 2.7 million out of the resources of school assistants in the spring.
In Helsinki, there are around 600 school assistants.
If the reductions occur, they will enter into force in the middle of the academic period immediately from the beginning of the year.
According to JHL, the decision increases inequalities.
More and more children need support for learning.
However, it is unfortunate for donors to reduce the cost of savings because the amount of learning aid is not clearly defined in the law.
Savings are certainly not created, on the contrary, the work burden of the teaching staff is increasing.
At school, savings create an ever greater risk of falling from the goals of learning and sharing teachers are hard, stressing the JHL’s industry leader, Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The City of Helsinki’s plans match schools, as young schools and students need support will no longer receive assistant resources at all in future resources.
The City of Helsinki's goal is to prevent exclusion.
It is the educational assistants that are doing income prevention work.
However, the adjustment measures of the Finnish Education Office are aimed at this group for the highest part.
All parties will continue to suffer from this.
In autumn, the final solution to the resources will be made by the City Council of Helsinki, to whom I hope to look at the vision and wisdom of the future and to act in accordance with its objectives, Niemi-Laine says.
Israel will take over the land on the West Bank
Israeli women are walking in a Jewish settlement near Bethlehem in the Etzion area.
On Sunday, nearly 400 acres of land were taken over by Israel in the Jewish province of the West Bank near Bethlehem. This may be a sign of Israel's future major construction in the region, while it threatens the Palestinians' request not to build more settlements and threaten the general opinion of the world community.
The Israeli-Peace Now- group, opposed to the expansion of West Bank agencies, felt that Sunday events could have been the greatest single country takeover in the West Bank region for decades and could dramatically change the situation in the region.
The Palestinians' aim is to establish their own state for the countries that Israel conquered in 1967.
According to the Israeli authorities, the political drive to assess the situation in the countryside came after the three Israeli young people were kidnapped and killed in June after they boarded the area.
In July, the Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian accused of kidnappings and killings.
The timing of the takeover of the land implies that it was meant to be a kind of compensation for the population and punishment of the Palestinians.
Close to the Jewish Gevaot facility, the land area in the territory of South Jerusalem is now officially declared as the country of the state when it was before the Palestinian private ownership, which was a necessary step to enable Israel to start planning buildings in the region.
However, Mayor Ahmad Lafi of Surif, a nearby Palestinian city, said that the country belongs to Palestinian families.
He told the Palestinian official news office of WAFA that the Israeli army and its staff were publishing the provisions early on Sunday, in which Israel announced that it would take over the olive and other trees-based countries of Surif and of the nearby villages Al-Jaba and Wadi Fukin.
Possible objections should be expressed within 45 days.
The kidnapping of young people resulted in the Israeli army carrying out a court return on the west coast against Hamas, the Islamist group in Gaza, which Israel says was behind the kidnappings.
The following tensions on the border of Israel and Gaza encamped in a war of 50 days, which ended last week in Egypt to bring about a ceasefire.
The takeover of the land has quickly drawn attention to the Israeli rule on the West Bank and revealed the conflicting objectives of the Israeli Government, which are hampering the wider development of the Israeli and Palestinian peace process.
Children’s crises are usually multi-faceted.
A growing majority of Lapland’s municipalities are in trouble, reports a well-being study conducted by Lappi University and Lappi University of Applied Sciences.
There are no quick solutions to crisis problems.
According to the professor, the reduction in municipal tasks by EUR 1 billion is not sufficient.
The common features of the crisis include poor municipal economy, poor employment and loss of migration.
According to Professor Asko Suikkasen at the University of Lapland's sociology, new crises are coming from the Western border and from East Lapa.
In the survey survey survey, people are quite realistic in assessing the situation.
Even pessimisticly, the inhabitants of the municipalities that were well - prepared in the study.
There are strong expectations of consumption.
People hope that today’s everyday life and well-being will remain, perhaps even slightly improved.
In this time, we are not afraid to think about longer-term investments, such as buying a dwelling, says Suikkanen.
The group of researchers surprised the big differences between municipalities.
For example, per capita expenditure on income subsidies varies from two to tens to over 100 euros.
The tax revenue per capita of the municipality varies from two thousand euros to 4400 euros in the Ranua fair.
According to the family, the municipalities of Lapland are different.
How money is used, how much money is made of state contributions and what is the degree of debt, is much different in each of the situations in which it is similar, he says.

Britain may close borders with returning Islamists
Britain may temporarily prevent the return of Islamic fighters leaving Iraq and Syria to their homeland.
This is about BBC, referring to government sources.
According to the BBC, however, British citizens suspected of terrorism would be allowed to keep their citizenship.
According to the government source, this is one of the many proposals that are being considered.
The proposal is being finalised, and Prime Minister David Cameron is to present it.
The government is also looking for ways to make it difficult for potential fighters to travel abroad.
One way may be to increase the powers of the authorities in such a way that they could temporarily seize the passports of potential fighters at the border.
On Friday, Britain raised the possibility of terrorist threat to the second highest level.
Bob Carr is happy with the immediate release of the Australian lawyer, Melinda Taylor, from the slippery prison.
The Australian lawyer, Melinda Taylor, is expected to be released from libyaan prison today.
The Federal Government welcomed the news that the Libyan authorities are expected to release Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor today.
Foreign Minister Bob Carr said that \"all goes well\" and the lawyer of the International Criminal Court will be released from the Australian authorities this evening, after which he will board a plane flying to Europe by midnight.
“We are happy with the news that he is likely to be released today, ” commented to the AAP News Office in New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanks the wider international community for assistance and support, said the representative.
Taylor is likely to fly to Rome before the journey to his home in Haag.
Taylor and three of his criminal court attorneys were arrested in the city of Zintan on 7 June when they represented the son of Seif al-Islam, the former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.
According to the Libyan authorities, Taylor took the Seif papers that they thought threatened national security.
Senator Carr has seen a lot of effort to free Taylor, including traveling to the capital of Libya in the last month to drive this thing.
Taylor couldn't have talked to her husband or her little daughter before last week.
According to Senator Carr, Taylor was allowed to make a short call to his home in Haag shortly after the visit of the Australian Ambassador David Ritchie.
Carr also spoke with the parents John and Janell of Taylor's in Brisbane who were relieved to hear that Taylor was finally allowed to use the phone.
Taylor's parents were convinced of Libya's daughter's release before the third birthday of this little child in July.
Three other arrested criminal justice lawyers are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Carr reported a week ago that, as a result of the debate between the lawyer released in the Hague and the Libyan authorities, the Court of Justice's lawyer was sorry and apologized for the possible misunderstanding.
The International Criminal Court has not spoken of any errors, but it has promised to investigate the actions of its team thoroughly after its members returned home.
\"In the final investigation of the International Criminal Court, it will ensure that all those who have acted wrong will be convicted in a proper manner,\" said the Court in its communication last month.
The International Criminal Court calls for a trial against the crimes of Seif al-Islamm during the reign of his father, which ended suddenly last year.
According to Tripoli, his trial should be local and launched on 1 May, in which he announced that he would not accept the decision of a criminal court lawyer to hold a trial in the Hague.

The collections for the Ferguson police came to an end mysteriously after an overdraft of $433 000.
Surprisers shut down two online collection sites without an explanation this weekend for over $400 000 collected by websites for a police officer who shot an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, the state of Missour.
Two separate pages on the GoFundMe approval website, which wore similar names – \"Support Officer Darren Wilson\" and \"Support Officer Wilson\" – have collected $235 750 and $197 620 for the ferguson-like police who shot Michael Brown.
A similar site maintained by the Brown family lawyer had collected $314 099 after Sunday night.
The shootings were followed by many weeks of rest and demonstrations, mostly against the almost white police forces of the black people, which forced Wilson to hide while local and federal studies were trying to decide whether to shoot Brown without reason.
The network collection campaigns have caused some amount of hard work to defend Wilson, especially since some visitors had written a comment on racist comments that have been deleted since then.
Apparently, both pages stopped receiving donations at the same time on Saturday, and the owners of the pages did not give any reason for this.
When trying to give a donation on the site, he sees a message that says: “No more shootings are accepted!
The organiser has stopped collecting donations.
On Sunday, a representative of the GoFundMe website gave the Los Angeles Times a notice saying that the website has not prevented donations.
\"The organiser of each GoFundMe campaign will decide when to stop receiving donations,\" Kelsea Little, a representative of the GoFundMe website, said in his press release.
The organisers can also continue receiving donations later if they want.
‘Support Officer Wilson’, the income of which was $197 620, maintains a charity group composed of St. Louis's police, the recipient of donations approved by the GoFundMe website.
Three policemen, Joseph Eagle, Timothy Zoll, and Jeffrey Roorda, who were appointed official representatives of the Shield of Hope State collection register, did not respond immediately to e-mails asking for further information on the collection campaign.
Zoll is an official informant of the Ferguson Police Department, Eagan is a member of the Florissant City Council nearby and member of Roorda Mission's House of Representatives.
The Times also did not immediately contact the anonymous founder of the Support Office Darren Wilson page, who uses the name ‘Stand Up’ and has collected $235 750.
However, in his press release to The Times, a representative of the GoFundMe website assured that there was an anonymous good-for-gooder.
Only a limited amount of information has been provided to donors about the anonymous charity of the collection campaign, unlike operators of another Wilson page or Brown donation site.
Two weeks ago, a message was written to visitors of the anonymous Wilson page, according to which the page cooperates with the Shield of Hope group to become officially accepted recipients of donations.
The approval has not yet been granted.
The editor gave additional information to visitors who wish to receive a password-based Gmail email address, but did not respond immediately on Sunday to the request for more information.
In its communication to The Times, the representative of the GoFundMe website said that the anonymous collection page had been removed from the search results of the main site and added that ‘the present campaign no longer meets the requirements of the GoFundMe website that a functioning Facebook account should be used.
In the information safety practices of the GoFundMe website, users are invited to pay only to GoFundMe users who are personally familiar with and depend on:
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the content of the collection page published on the GoFundMe website is accurate and honest.
According to Mr Little, however, GoFundMe has been in contact with the campaign organiser, and it has no reason to doubt his honesty.
GoFundMe will also be able to hold all the funds collected if there is a need to start research in connection with a campaign.
However, GoFundMe has not considered it appropriate to retain the funds collected in this campaign.
The popular Facebook page –Support Officer Wilson –, who has organized Wilson support campaigns, told the followers of the page this weekend that lawyers are trying to find out why GoFundMe’s sponsors have been prevented from donate, but the page did not give any further information.
The Facebook page also has an anonymous operator, and the independent source has not been able to confirm these comments.
