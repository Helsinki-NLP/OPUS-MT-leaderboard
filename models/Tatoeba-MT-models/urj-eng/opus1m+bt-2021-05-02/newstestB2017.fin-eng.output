The 28-year-old cook was found dead at the Sanfrancisco Shopping Centre
Only the 28-year-old cook that recently moved to San Francisco was found dead at the local shopping centre portal this week.
The victim's brother says he didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt his brother.
The body found at Westfield Shopping Center on Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old Sanfranciscola Frank Galicia, reported to the San Francisco Legal Agency.
According to San Francisco Police Department, death is being investigated as a spirit crime.
The victim's brother Louis Galicia told ABC's KGO radio station in San Francisco that Frank, who worked as a cook in Boston, had found his dream job when he was released to the kitchen master at San Francisco Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
The representative of the Sons & Deughters restaurant said that death was a shock for all of them.
\"We're a small and dense team, like a family, and our regret is great,\" the representative says.
Our thoughts are with Frank's family and his friends.
Louis Galicia tells me that Frank first lived at the hostel, but he finally had his case in order.
He found the apartment, and he had a girlfriend, told Louis Galicia KGO.
Louis Galicia says she didn't know anyone who wanted to hurt her little brother.
- He was a nice, big heart.
His way of being with the family was to cook for all of us, says Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to have a fight with anyone.
He was the brother who went along with the river.
Despite all the wrongs in the world, he was an unbelievably diamond who shined every day, saying.
All aware of the case is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's tip number 415-575-444.
Licensing Junior Doctors require new work combat measures
The representatives of the British Junior Doctors (who are mainly specialised doctors in Finland) have appealed to their trade union and requested permission for new work combat measures in the new employment contract dispute.
The JDC, which is a member of the UK Medical Association (BMA), is seeking support from its entire government for further work efforts from the beginning of September.
According to JDC, ministers have not solved the problems of the agreement.
Junior doctors and medical students rejected the agreement with BMA in their vote in July.
58% of those who took part in the vote rejected the agreement.
On Thursday night, Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the Committee on Junior Medicine, published a letter sent to the JDC members on Twitter, where he says that the government has been \"feelingly\", on questions that McCourt said led to the fight against the agreement.
The letter reads: “In this light, the JDC Government has, in its vote, rejected a new draft agreement and calls for new formal negotiations to be held on all our concerns.
In response to the government's difficulties, the JDC government has today submitted an official request to the government of BMA asking permission for the least advanced work efforts since the beginning of September.
In view of the dispute, junior doctors have been on strike six times this year, which included the first complete job stops ever seen in the history of the British public health system.
Mr Malawana, Director of BMA, resigned after the vote, for he did not accept the negotiated contractual terms recommended by BMA.
Mr Malawana said to the BMA members that the agreement was good and should be adopted, with 54 000 junior doctors and medical students taking part in the vote.
After the vote, Minister for Health Jeremy Hunt said that the agreement would enter into force and that it would apply to British doctors.
Russia and Turkey: an external alliance?
It was a gesture that decided the crisis.
In Tuesday, the Russian and Turkish leaders met with a view to reconciliation and formal completion of the eight-month word war and economic patents.
However, when Vladimir Putin received his Turkish official brother, Peter’s palace in the golden hall, I had a clear impression that the greater desire for reconciliation was in Ankara.
The parties did.
But Putin's smile looked thin, and he didn't just choke the heat on his own restraining standards.
However, Recep Tayyyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his good friend, Mr Putin, five times according to one report.
I didn't keep my bills.
He also promised that relations with Russia would come back even better than before the crisis.
The next day, a newspaper in our country wrote Erdogan's conduct as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I personally understood his enthusiasm just the opposite.
But the constant delay from Putin showed that the Russian chief has not forgotten anything.
In fact, the first thing Putin mentioned in his opening speech was the cause of the crisis: Turkey shot down the Russian combat aircraft on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time of the event was furious.
Putin attacked me strictly against Ankara and accused him of stabting his back.
The insult was even bigger because it came from a certain friend.
It will be difficult, perhaps impossible, to regain true trust.
The general opinion of the Russian people has also changed since November.
For months, the media controlled by the State took a thorough and aggressive campaign against Ankara.
All of a sudden it seemed that the Turkish people were the reason for everything.
The most serious were the accusations of top officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in the areas controlled by Isis in Syria.
Erdogan has strongly denied charges.
However, the official message received from Peter was that it was time to move forward.
After all, this meeting was only arranged so that Putin received the apology from President Erdogan.
In this way, Russia could have some kind of victory.
The benefits of declaring a ceasefire are clear.
Above all, Erdogan needs all of his potential friends after he was almost disfellowshiped in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey have clearly shaken him too.
Sovinno also has an economic impact.
Russia's sanctions have hit Turkey, particularly the charter ban, because millions of Russian tourists travel to the coast of Turkey every year.
The volume has collapsed by almost 90%.
As far as Russia is concerned, tour operators and charter companies will certainly be aware of the relief when air traffic can eventually be continued.
They put their faith in a late season's attack on the Mediterranean.
And still this week, government television has predicted that the price of fruit and vegetables will fall, while imports of agricultural products in Turkey are allowed again.
\"You've come back here, you've come back with tomatoes, and they've written a paper on the Vedemos article.
But the visit also had a greater political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West, for it feels that the West responded to the coup attempt.
Without forgetting the old grudge on Turkey's accession negotiations and the absence of Putin, which is eager to use cool distances and to undermine Turkey's ties to the west.
The Russian leader no doubt won bonus points from Ankara when it expressed its support to the elected authorities after the coup.
This was self-evident for Moscow, who had his own concerns about the change of power.
Thus, Russia and Turkey were able to deliver a picture of what was described by an analyst as “the alliance of outsiders: two countries that have experienced their being rejected and treated as calculus in the West.
Despite public reconciliation, these two still have major differences.
The most important is Syria, where Moscow has created itself as a peace builder, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
Please note that, after almost three hours of initial negotiations, both presidents reported at the press conference that they had not dealt with the subject at all.
The Turkish President refused to answer the question of differences in the countries, while Putin stressed them.
There is no clear consensus between countries on where they could seek agreement in Syria.
In view of the possibility of a full disaster that Turkey, a member of NATO, caused by Turkey, when shooting down a Russian battle machine, is undoubtedly better that, after months of open hostility, these two Heads of State are still speaking.
Royal Bank of Scotland banks disappear from their customers outside Scotland
According to the Governor of the RBS Bank, the Bank’s activities outside Scotland will be cut off in such a way that it will continue to provide only business services, i.e. back office services.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears from its customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was initially linked to the global objectives of the bank.
The bank had to retreat from its goals when it nearly broke down eight years ago and was saved.
During that period, brand-newists have used RBS to protect other consumer finance brands.
It sponsored a million pounds of international sports, such as Six Nations and Wimbledon Master Andy Murray.
But now the priority has been given the right access to national brands.
Royal Bank of Scotland will remain available to Scottish customers, but it will not be used to shorten RBS.
In England and Wales, all RBS names will be converted into NatWeste, except the head office and the stock exchange list.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use in the Irish and Northern Ireland.
In addition, there are other smaller private banking brands that will gain greater weight, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwani was interviewed during the presentation to customers and staff in Inverness.
He said to BBC Scotland: “RBS is becoming an investment brand and because of what our staff is working for, because we are now becoming a much more different brand bank.
Since the bank itself became a global brand, RBS also became a global brand.
Now our efforts are no longer global, but local.
Each of these brands represents something quite different in its own community, and our staff is working with customers under these brands.
The RBS has already announced that it will complete the sponsorship of Six Nations, and it has raised the profile of the various brands in sports sponsorship.
“Now is the right time to move into a bank containing different brands, because essentially the question is how we can make a bank better for customers,” says the President of the Bank.
\"It would have been very genuine three years ago if we had said that we would be an excellent bank for our customers and put in place brands.
But the work we have done and the focus on the needs of our customers rather than our own needs has changed a lot.
We can bring those brands back, so I think it's time for us to come back.
Frankie Dettori rode Predilection to victory in Newmarket and won 3 000.
Dettori showers champagne once won twice a row in Newmarket, which meant 3 000 wins for him.
Jockey Frankie Dettori confirmed his 3 000 prizes at the British Championship series in Newmarket on Friday.
This peach he reached by riding his horse Predilection twice to win the same night at his own local track. Predilection is a horse trained by John Gosden.
Italian Dettori, 45, is the sixth jockey to reach this streaming line in running competitions.
He's got the same one before Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The triple master jockey Dettori, who won earlier in Ghayary, says: “This is special.
My feelings are on the surface because my family is here too.
I'm very glad this happened in Newmarket because I just ended up here 30 years ago.
The event is not a big event, not a Royal Ascot, but a completely normal Friday night and a 20 000-person audience.
I'm relieved, and I feel great humility.
Dettori will take the cheers with Predilection after his victory
Two jockeys have reached the scenery event, and they have been master jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-fold Master Sir Anthony McCoy, who won over 4 300 times on his record career.
Lester Piggott, nine times Derby winner, 4 493 wins
“Frankie is one of the best jockeys of this time, and it is no surprise that she has just reached this milestone, which has rarely reached.
He's stylish and strong, but his tactical advances are what separates him from others.
He's a fantastic representative for racing, his enthusiasm, and his charisma has brought support to the species for years.
“I told Frankie a few weeks ago that she would have won 6 000 pounds if she hadn’t only competed on weekends and only in big competitions!
Speaking seriously, Frankie's riding career in British competitions has been a winner for nearly 30 years, which has been a great follow-up.
He's a lively person, which is good for the British race, but above all, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori's fan will achieve his logo in a way that jumps off his horse.
“The outstanding goal results for flying down income Frankie Dettori has been a model example of the British race response for two decades now.
There's been a lot of upper and bottoms on the way.
He has won many major races, including his famous victory in Ascot in 1996 – Magnificent Seven – but also he has survived the flight accident and has been in a competition ban because of drug abuse.
When the ban on competition ended three years ago, he had problems starting, but he showed the amazing nature of strength, seemed to his suspects and returned to his best.
And for a little while, he's not going to stop his career – Dettori has recently said he wants to continue to race until he's 50 years old.
Putin was separated by Chief of Administration Sergei Ivanov
The Russian President, Vladimir Putin, was surprised by the resignation of his Head of Administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin’s believed inner circle for many years.
Ivanov, 63, was now appointed Special Representative for the Environment and Transport.
According to the information provided by the Kreml, President Putin decided to release Ivanov as Head of the Russian presidential administration, but the reasons for the dismissal were not stated.
Mr Anton Vaino, Vice President of Ivanov, has been appointed as vice-president since 2012.
Parado, 44, is the former diplomat.
Naso, born in 1972 in Tallinn, graduated from the National Institute for International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and has previously worked at the Tokyo Embassy.
Later, he led the President's office and the government's office, says Kremlin's Russian-speaking website.
The persecution thanked Putin for his appointment as follows: “I am grateful for your trust.
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your efforts as Head of State, which is to make the draft laws and to monitor how your instructions are implemented.
Putin told the Russian television company on Friday that Ivanov himself had asked for a divorce and recommended the Parade to be his successor.
Are the smiles real?
This transfer has caused confusion in Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been in the vicinity of Vladimir Putin, and Putin also has a KGB.
As Head of Administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, the Russian government television, each said Ivanov would withdraw from his own request.
Despite the smiles shown on the cameras, the explanations only convince a few, especially under the parliamentary elections.
Are they fired from some kind of power struggle?
No one knows that yet.
Russia has been highly suspicious about the official argument that a man who has been given a chance as president wants to suddenly lead Russia's environmental policy.
The Kremlin website presents Ivanov’s words to Putin, saying: “It is true that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to give my responsibility to this very complicated and, to some extent, difficult work for four years.
Now I've been the President's managing director for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up office in December 2011.
He used to be Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the State Security Service KGB.
When Putin acted as Head of the Security Service (FSB) of the KGB replacement Federation in the late 1990s, Ivanov was appointed Deputy Head of Mission.
When Putin entered power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
It was intended that Ivanov could come from Russia after the second season of President Putin, as the Constitution would have prevented Putin's choice for the third period.
However, the mission went to another area near Putin, Dmitri Medvedeville.
Putin became Prime Minister, after which he returned to President only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds – Star of the FBI Researcher series Thomas Gibson got fired after he fired the producer
Gibson was involved in a violent dispute at the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce a series, reported kicks in their joint release.
Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, known as the series, Gibson had filed an apology on Thursday before he was informed of his resignation.
We had creative differences.
I'm sorry this happened, he says in his press release.
Information on how Gibson's character is written out of the next series of FBI agents will be published later, will be reported in the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios press release.
Previously on Dharma & Greg's 54-year-old Gibson has been involved in the series since its first production period, i.e. since 2005.
“I love Criminal Minds and have put my heart and soul in it for the last twelve years, ” says Gibson in his press release on Friday.
I was hoping I'd see the show all the way to the end, but it's not possible anymore.
I would like to thank all commentaries, producers, actors, great production team and most important: the best fans that the series could ever hope for.
Series 12 production period will start in the United States on September 28th.
The mysterious landing of fish into the Bangladeshn garden
Kevin Bain, who lives in Banffi, has asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Bain doubts these 75 fish are winds that have become the age of a whirlwind.
Bain, who lives 500 meters away from the seashore, published the image material in Periscope and hoped to respond to the appearance of these five-tenthic fish.
The Queensferry crossing has now been linked to Fife
The estimated EUR 1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern deck and the bridge of Queensferry, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of the four parts between the nations, which are now almost ready around the three pillars of the bridge.
Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30 000 tonnes.
It contains 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20 000 tonnes of concrete and 46 vino-ceivers.
The estimated EUR 1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
The Minister for Economic Affairs Keith Brown visited the working country today and was one of the first to walk from the country to the bridge.
Brown says: “This is a historic and symbolic moment in building a bridge over Queensferry.
We are all witnessing a very significant step forward in building a bridge. More than 30 000 concrete and steel have been used to build this bridge.
Despite its massive size and weight, building a bridge section between the bridge and the bridge deck is a delicate operation requiring extremely precise installation tolerances.
The whole bridge deck is now close to 79%, and the rest of the deck is about to get its concrete pain in Rosyth today, which means that the cover is ready to be raised.
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructions project, says: “The completion of the first bridge is always a significant urinary barrier for all bridge projects.
In this fantastic project, this share represents the top of the road and water building industry.
After the last part of the road deck was installed and attached to the North Tower road document, we had to close the remaining northward (i.e. on the ground).
This was done by pulling 700 millimetres south of the north.
This was a massive operation, and at the same time a major mission requiring precision.
Massive because the ground is 222 metres long and about 6 000 tonnes of weight were to be pulled up at about 3 % angle.
And it was very small – just a few millimetres, because the tolerances that the working team had to follow were very small.
Well, luckily, everything went well.
The Moelfre Bay rescue department tells us about the wonders of three men.
As Anglesey represented the three men who had been caught in the water by his fishing boat, they were saved as a miracle in the trade.
On Friday, at 13.20 p.m., the seaside station at Moelfre RNLI made a alarm at its crew's observed accident at Moelfre Bay.
Three men desperately tried to swim into safety while their boat continued to go out of custody without a director.
“We saw the boat going right next to them and we imagined the worst,” says Vince Jones, driving the lifeboat of Moelfre.
“By the time we got to the water, powerful winds had, fortunately, transported the boat away from them.
The local fishing boat saved two of the men, while the third, the age of 60, was found exhausted as a pick-up and without life-rafts.
They were all taken to the coastboat and transported to the rescue station.
Vince Jones says: “It is a miracle that these three men who have been killed by water are still alive and perfectly well.
The boat engine had an emergency extinguisher, but it had, for some reason, broken off a boat from a man of the age.
They were really lucky to be on their way.
Pokémon Go - pursued his health and happiness
It's fascinating to follow how the world changes.
In the last decade, many have complained about why teenagers and children no longer go out to play, but prefer to stay in and watch their frames.
Pokémon Go makes people get up on the couch and move.
Originally, it was just watching television, and then video games and the latest smartphones came.
So it's great to see that technology and externality don't shut each other down.
Of course, I refer to Pokemon Go. Pokemon Go is a game application with characters from a video game created in the 1990s (which was later also made in the drawing series, game cards and other accompanying products).
As with many popular cultural phenomena, this also stopped a little before the new game became available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
The earthquake in other countries was delayed because of a huge interest that overloaded the servers.
In just a few days, the user number of Pokémon Go game missed Tinder and was almost as big as on Twitter.
Then how does the game work?
In brief, players will go out looking for pokers with their smartphone, which are monitored by GPS. When they find poker, it can be “photophobia” or “capata” (with the image of the phone).
The wildness has sprung into a video game younger than playing a generation and raised the backsides on the couch.
In the United States, the game has significantly increased the number of steps the average person takes a day.
Washington Post recently reported an Apple Watch video on the Cardiogram app that discovered within two days of the game’s launch that the number of mobile people suddenly rose from 45% to 53% in 30 minutes a day.
The company doesn't know who the users play Pokkero Go, it sees only the raw data of the quantities of exercise.
Many public health campaigns, which encourage people to rise from the couch and move from at least 30 minutes a day, have gone down to deaf ears because the campaigns have been boring and their advertising people have shown themselves to be harmless.
However, the importance of sport should not be reduced.
Regularly mobile probability of developing cancer or depression is lower.
exercise helps in weight management, lower blood pressure, prevents diabetes and brings a large number of other benefits.
The fineness of the Pokemon Go game is that it gets people out to do something they enjoy.
It thus achieves three basic health supporting issues – exercise, clean air and sun and joy.
Even new friends are possible during the hunt.
As usual, even this phenomenon is a serious phenomenon of joy.
And yes, someone can walk towards the door when they're playing.
What about it?
We're done with the break-in.
For even though Intelligent Phone Applications such as Fitz were already able to monitor your activity earlier, they did not allow us to move forward, as Pokémon Go does.
The new alarm disappears, and the use decreases in time.
However, the success of Pokemons will lead to more games where applications and virtual reality are combined with activity in the real world, which will increase the movement of people leaving hunting and improve their condition and health.

Simone Biles picked up gold in a women's teen-sucking multi-game
Forget the pressure.
Forget the jump.
Simone Biles is immune to all of these.
Dynamites jump.
Unsuspected party.
You're going to have to be a leua with a periman.
Excellent for everything.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
The American 19-year-old teenager won the championship on Thursday and raised the difference between himself and the rest of the world in the Olympic light field.
His overall point 6.2.198 was clearly better than the silver-based “Final Five” team member Aly Raisman and the Russian pronsimist Aliya Mustafina.
The United States Simone Biles is present in the party of the Women's Teline War in the final match on Thursday in Rio 2016 in the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
The party became the fourth consecutive, and the fifth American woman of all time, who won the championship, thus strengthening his reputation as the best of his generation or even the best of all time.
Bales shattered the tears when his whole final point came to sight, and his long way to this moment ended.
The achievement will take the species to a completely new dimension and raise him to the same category of sports with other superstars such as Michael Phelps:
Biles has been completely overwhelming for the last three years. He has won 15 world championships, of which 10 gold, and he earned them with such ambitious and precise programmes that the 1984 Olympic winner Mary Lou Retton called him \"the greatest teenager in all time\"...
There was another final competition left in Brazil, which was mainly between Biles and his own burden and the burden of excessive expectations, not between Biles and the rest of the world.
Returning home to Texas Spring with less than a curvature of gold medals would be a disappointment.
Simone Biles (left) and Aly Raisman are hugging gold and silver in the final round of the women's tennis competition in the Olympics in Rio's 2016 summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 11.8.2016
Biles won the first gold medal on Tuesday as a point on i for the country team co-ordinated and now retired to Martha Karoly's students.
Although Biles claimed that he never thought of anything prior while at the top for a long time, it is not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program, which includes the volt series known as his card, has been adapted to Latin music, which could well be heard on the streets outside the Rio Olympics.
It's not a coincidence.
Their grandparents have already found a small adoptive and coach named Aimee Boorman's mother has become a powerful figure. Boorman found her when she was on a daycare tour in the gym where Boorman trained.
He has not lost any competition after the summer of 2013, and the winning tube is likely to continue as long as Biles wants it to continue.
Despite the fact that Mustafina got a little lead on two tours, it was like fabrication.
And there was a boom and a permanto where Biles is a defender of the world.
He returned to the lead after getting 15.433 points from his boom and crowned the final result at 15.933 points.
Raisman was gentlely hugging him when they were waiting for the final points – which was just a formality – and tears began to appear around the bordering color of Biles red, white and blue when the dream that he once wrote in his playbook came true.
Raisman's performance was a small advance for a four-year-old competition, when he first divided the third place, but then lost his pross at Mustafini's revolving tour.
This time, a 22-year-old team leader, called by the Americans, was clearly ahead of Mustafina.
He sent air suits to the public after his permanto program and thus became a winner of the loss position, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
As far as Biles comes, this 19-year-old has now a completely new meaning by doing and spreading a wide-ranging twit:
Police say three music in the car is the victim of a serial killer who's heard it.
Two women and one 12-year-old girl were killed in Phoenix's most devastating mass murder for ten years, and the victims were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, reports the police notice published on Thursday.
According to the authorities, on 12 June, Angela Rochelle Linger, Stefanie R. Ellis, and the daughter of Ellis, were shot in the car parked on the streets.
The shooter stood on the passenger side of the car, where he shot eight shots with a handgun, and then fled with another car, the release says.
The police suspect that the cause of the triangular death was probably not a robbery because the attacker did not take the purses and the 2 900 dollars found in another adult victim's ear.
The Phoenix police informant, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, says the police are now investigating whether death relates to the four prior attacks.
A total of seven people have died and two have been wounded in nine attacks, mainly in Latin American settlements within four months.
\"It is common for the events that they have happened in residential areas, in the presence of homes, Howard told CBS’s subsidiary CBS earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have several vehicles, including brown Nissan, black BMW in the late 1990s and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The researchers do not want to reveal what led them to conclude that the attacks are linked and that their author is the same.
Ellis, 33, was taken to the hospital because of his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Maleah died immediately at the scene of the event.
The witness told the police that the threesome had often sat in the car listening to music.
In addition, the police published a report explaining that there was only half an hour before the death of the shooter on the empty van, which is believed to be the same in both cases.
The scientists found seals, and they took a bullet from the car seat and a bullet from the engine space.
The mother of a 6-year-old boy with microcephalia: “The things are getting better.
Like most of the six-year-olds, Edmund Picciuto also likes singing, toys and, of course, mother.
But unlike most other age brothers, Edmund has a microcephalic, or birth-like, small scale due to his mother Elizabeth Picciuto’s genetic disorder, which she was not aware of when she was pregnant.
“When I first brought Edmund home, my first thought was that I would not survive this.
I'm not gonna make it.
I didn't commit to this.
What is not true at all – of course you are committed to it, he says.
Elizabeth and her husband Vincent were told that Edmund may never recognize them and perhaps live at all.
Some doctors went so far as to suggest that a child be placed in institutional care.
“ My first reaction was that I didn’t think there was any such practice anymore, ” says Picciuto.
Edmund's walking with the steering wheel.
Edmund sat down and started his bones until he was 3 years old, and he still doesn't talk.
But he's slowly moving into his own pace.
He's walking around with help and driving a bicycle.
He's happy to play with his two brothers and love to sing.
Elizabeth presents the sign she invented with which she means to me.
We're teaching him the sign language, Picciuto told CBS News.
However, it does not only mean the ordinary sign language, but also includes the figs that Edmund himself invented.
In the background of microcephalia, there may be a variety of diseases: hereditary, including Edmund, or pre-pregnant viral infections such as squamous or zicovirus.
There are great variations in the symptoms and forecasts.
It is still too early to assess how it affects the lives of people who have been infected with zizavirus.
Picciuto recalls the atmosphere caused by a uncertain future.
I kept saying, \"What's going on?\"
What do we do?
And he still doesn't know.
\"I haven't asked for a prophecy in a long time, because I don't think anyone can give it.
But Picciuto has hope of giving advice to mothers whose children have birth defects caused by the zicavirus.
Things are getting better.
Things are going to be all right.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Regretts and floods have caused massive rescue operations in the states of Louisiana and Mississippi
On Friday, the Governor of Louisiana declared an emergency situation due to heavy rainfalls and widespread floods.
According to the national weather service, several rivers of Kaakkois-Louisiana and South Massissipsip are flooded and spread to a large area as a result of heavy rainfalls.
Governor John Bel Edwards of Louisiana says that state authorities are in constant contact with local authorities and that aid is already on the way to flood areas.
Mike Steele, informant of the Governor responsible for National Security and Emergency Response, tells the Agency about requests for flood vehicles, boats and sand jackets.
According to Steele, only the province of Tangipahoa has requested tens of thousands of sands.
The flood warning remains valid until Saturdays in most parts of South Louisina.
According to the information provided by the Weather Service, water may be added to the area from 76 to 27 mm.
In the south, the flood warning was given on Friday, when the rains continued in the mobile area.
During the weekend near the Comite River Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, of which each in Louisiana, is predicted to rise to record heights.
According to Manager Alek Krautmann, many houses on riverside may have to flood under the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
In addition, he says that the floods in Ascension County form a threat, as the flooding rivers slowly empty into Lake Maurepas Lake.
In Louisiana Liverpool right south of the state border of Mississippi, the Tickfaw River was already higher than ever on Friday at 9 o'clock.
The rescue work continued in the districts of Ami and Wilkinson in Lounais-Mississip.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and half-son were earlier on Friday, near those who had been rescued from Glosterer.
Hansford, 62, says that the Beaver Creek River, which normally is more than 120 metres away from his house, rose rapidly during the night.
The second half of the boy living near him had warned him.
“ We got up, and the water came up on a continuous feed,” says Hansford.
\"It extends to my belt. \"
The wife had told Hansford that she had never seen the river rise so high during the 48 years that she had lived in the area.
Hansford tells us that he himself and his family have injuries to all of them, and he himself is the only swimmer of them.
The rescue workers had saved all three large army-style trucks and brought them to the firehouse at Gloster where they held protection on Friday.
Regulator Krautmann says that floods are spreading rapidly when the heavy rains continue, and the authorities are already considering evacuation orders.
He tells us about the information from an observer close to Livingston, according to which almost 350 mm had been rained between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann says that the soil has been heavily strung after the rains that began on Wednesday.
The authorities tell us that because of the flooding of hard rains and streets, the inhabitants of the Tangipaho County were forced to save their homes and that school hours were to be cancelled in five school districts.
A member of the Danish City Council had told CBS's subsidiary WWL that there were 200 homes under the flood.
The inhabitants had been evacuated into two churches, but now the flood has reached them both.
Robby Miller, director of the county, tells us that the authorities have saved 72 people and seven pets that had remained prisoners of the flood.
Evacuateds have been opened up to shelters in Amteen and Hammond.
They get back to their homes when the water begins to retreat, he says.
In the city of Hammond, almost twenty streets were to be closed due to flood, and the inhabitants were offered sand jackets to try to prevent the water from entering their homes and the premises of their businesses.
“ For the first time, we experienced a great flood in March,” says Lacy Landrum, member of the city government.
This flood seems like the same.
In Mississip, the rains continued even on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, says Rupert Lacy, the rescue director of Harrison County.
Lacy tells me that on Thursday, they were reported about the house that had fallen under a tragic flood, but on Friday there had not yet been any information.
The head of the Shopper Value Foods shop Keith Townson tells us that he lived in Amisen district for 40 years.
\"I've seen water in places where I've never seen it before, and more rain all the time...
Several bullets received from his body are the six-year-old Mahaj Brown to survive the Philadelphia shooting interval.
According to the police, there's been a six-year-old boy shot in Philadelphia, another six-year-old who's been shot in town this week.
The grandparents of the child told me on CBS Philadelphia channel the son was Mahaj Brown.
According to grandparents, the boy had several gunshot wounds in his hips, leg, arm and stomach, but he was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
“He got many hits, his little body was full of bullets,” said the boy’s grandmother Delores Melendez for the television company.
I can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital, and several surgery has been done for him.
The family tells the television company that the boy is believed to survive.
He was about to start his first class at local sub-level.
Brown was one of the four people who was shot in Germantown.
There were also two 29-year-old men and one 32-year-old man.
Another 29-year-old state was reported to be critical and the other two were stable, reports CBS Philadelphia.
According to the TV company, the child was found in a critical position of the front seat of the car next to the 29-year-old.
Two other victims were not in the car, and the police are now investigating whether the other wounded men could have been a shooter.
Police investigators told CBS Philadelphia that it was a crossfire between many armed men.
The site of the event was filled with rotting weapons types which are derived from various types of assault weapons.
\"It is quite clear that this was the ongoing fight.
On the street, there were seals on both sides of the footwalk.
There have been several armed fighters in the area, and they have been actively involved in the shooting, Chief Inspector Anthony Ginaldi of Philadelphia, told the television station.
The bullets also hit many houses and vehicles in the area.
No arrests have been made, and hearings are that the police are going through surveillance videos.
Another shooting victim in the city this week was a 6-year-old girl whose hand was hit by a delusion when she played Tuesday in front of her home in West Oak Lane.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
In this name, I call on women to play the Olympic team in the gymnastics, and there is more than one reason.
First of all, I have been to every summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been as overwhelming as it is now.
Secondly, three gymnastics in this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren-Laurie- Hernandez, have inspired many colored girls.
The team's composition, which is complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everything proud.
The team is finally representing America.
It has also confirmed the visibility of black and Latin women at the top of the species.
For the last four years, the best female women's swimmer has been African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were about to be 1 and 2.
This is awesome.
In the ancient Olympics, Gabby Douglas rose up as a surprise winner, and the whole of America cheered.
Now the world has been able to prove the incredible performances and surprises and masterly performances of the threefold world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez.
Simona became a fourth consecutive American on Thursday, who won gold in the women's individual contest.
Aly Raisman, teammate, won silver.
These visions are at the top of the species, but the same does not seem to be done across the globe.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie followed the same tracks as Aly and Madison to form the Olympic team.
They're five of the last five \"Final Five\", for in the next team of teen-sitting Olympics there'll be only four gymnastics, and this is Marta Karoly's last year coach.
The reality is, however, that artificial power is a precious sport and gymnastics are mainly practised in private tennis promotions, which are maintained by their parents. Parents pay training costs, facilities, travels, accommodation, competition fees, hotel fees (for coaching, gymnastics and family members) etc.
Most of the telecommunications centres are located in prosperous residential areas that can support their activities.
The teaching of theocratic power bodies takes place in these clubs, which means a costly and long-term commitment to the families of gymnasts.
The coach of Simone Biles, Aimee Boorman and Laurie Hernandez, Maggie Honey, have both trained the species from the time they started a teenager's life.
We need to organise a more affordable and better available artificial power education for unreadable young girls whose enthusiasm for Simone, Gabby and Laurie have been raised.
I set up my own artificial gym 20 years ago.
My organisations in Harlem have offered a free or affordable opportunity for the theocratic exercise of more than 15,000 urban young people (mostly black and Latin Americans), and these young people have reached national and international championships.
In September, we will expand our activities in my hometown to Detroit, so that we can offer high-quality artificial power for young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic species.
Telineivation develops strength, flexibility and body coordination and teaches hard work, discipline and determination.
This combination brings the lasting benefits of life and supports good health and success in school and working life.
This team has raised enthusiasm in thousands of young girls who now want to start a teenager's life, and it's amazing.
Participation in a sport is very important, especially for girls.
This is an exciting time.
Thank you for Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison's real girl power, which you showed when you won the Olympics, and that you motivated so many young girls from their backgrounds to start their way to be well-being, strong and successful young women.
Junior doctors rejected Jeremy Hunt's proposal and are preparing for new strikes.
Ministers wished to decide on changes to remuneration and working conditions by adopting a renewed agreement with the trade union of doctors representing BMA (British Medical Association), but the vote on 37 000 so-called junior doctors, 58% of the specialist doctor, rejected the proposal.
In July, Minister Hunt announced plans to make the agreement mandatory and said that the UK public health system (NHS) was not in any country - and that all additional delays were harmful to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are moving into a new agreement that contains changes to night and weekend practices in order to improve health care during social times.
Last night, Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Committee on Junior Medicine, issued an opinion saying: \"Juniorics are still very prepared for the proposed agreement, especially fear that it will accelerate the current labour crisis and that it will not treat all doctors fairly.
It is only eight weeks after the first doctors are transferred to the new agreement, so now we have to move forward, because time is running out.
BMA has tried to resolve the dispute by talking, but the government has been reluctant and sometimes even in no way responding to the discussions.
Even so, in the last month, Jeremy Hunt made a promise that his door would always be open.
Jeremy Hunt must now act, withdraw the implementation of the agreement and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If that is not the case, the junior doctors will be ready for new work combat measures,
At the end of April, the previous strike was delayed by nearly 13 000 routine measures and 100 000 reception times when nurses and consultants were asked to support the lacquer physicians.
Ministers wished to conclude a renewed agreement on change with members of the trade union representing British doctors.
The trade union BMA wants a better weekend salary for 54 000 junior doctors, which would be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, Director General of NHS staff, appealed to junior doctors that they would not enter the new strike.
Mortimer says: “The work effort will achieve very little or nothing, but they will put pressure on teams and services already active in the extremes and will cause concern, distress and disturbances for patients, medical staff and their families.
For the last two months, we have been negotiating with the Junior Medical Committee, and together with the Ministry of Health and other bodies, we have welcomed the role and openness of their concerns about the role of the supervisor.
The workers were hoping that the continued positive commitment to other important issues – such as development, flexibility in education, further training from careers, training costs, mutual recognition of the educational programme, access to study and gender pay gap in the care sector – was a sign of how serious workers, health education England and the Ministry of Health want to stick to agreements with BMA in November, February and May –
A medicine that costs €2.40 per day may reduce the risk of a heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are about €2.40 per day, when the authorities recommended that it be given to more people and longer-term use.
The risk of new heart attacks in patients with heart disease is reduced by the antihypertensive ticagrelor.
The medicine is already given 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of stroke or a new heart attack.
The NIC (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellent) that evaluates the introduction of NHS and new treatment methods has shown that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years in order to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now, the NIC (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellent) that is part of the UK Public Health System (NHS) and which assesses the introduction of new treatment methods has shown that ticagrelor should be given to patients for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people get a heart attack every year, of which a quarter recovers from a heart attack or they get strokes.
The cause of heart attacks and strokes is a fat material that is building up on the walls of the blood vessels, which produces blocks.
If the patch tears, it can cause a blood clot that prevents blood from entering the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the blood clot is removed, it can pass with the blood flow and prevent blood flow to the brain, resulting in a stroke.
The risk of a new scene is higher in people who have had a heart attack repeated.
The ticagrelor produced by the British AstraZenecan, sold on the product name Brilique, reduces this risk by reducing the likelihood of floods.
In today’s NIC guidelines, it is recommended that ticagrelor be given for the next 90 mg for 12 months and then reduced to 60 milligrams, and that aspirin be given twice daily for three years.
Professor Carole Longson of the Centre for Management (NICE) says: “Even though there is an effective disease progression and effective treatment to prevent symptoms, even a quarter of those who have had a heart attack receive a new scene or stroke – often with fatal consequences.
The fear of regeneration can have a very negative impact on the quality of life.
We have received evidence that ticagrelor combined with aspirin effectively reduces the risk of new heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
The recommendation for temporary use of ticagrelor increases treatment options for thousands of people who benefit from it:
As data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially in the case of risk of bleeding, are limited if used for more than three years, the draft guidelines do not recommend the use of the treatment method for longer periods.
Because of the climate of political regularity, the voting crop in Muslim regions was suffocated
The former mayor of the Tower Hamlets, Lutfur Rahman, was fired from his last year for corruption, resulting in a report by the government.
The climate for political regularity led to widespread closure of the eyes in Muslim communities, reveals the government report published today.
Sir Eric Pickles, former Minister of Government, strongly criticised the police, electoral observers and city councils that they have choked their eyes on electoral ethics and the hypersensitivity to religion.
According to Pickles, the former Minister of Regional Administration and the current powerful figure against corruption, the fear of voters for religious reasons was so bad that the police should have been allowed to form security chains outside voting stations to protect the feared voters.
He suggests that voters should present a identity certificate in order to prove their identity when they vote.
At the moment, the voter should only give his name and address.
In addition, the report proposes that the fingers be strung to the uninitiated music after voting so that no one can vote twice.
More protection should be given to the publishers, says Sir Eric.
He calls for suppliers to be given access to government documents and for decisions of informal committees and working groups to be improved.
\"The aim is not only to prevent electoral violence, but also to combat fraud and the culture that favours corruption and economic interests more widely in local governments,\" he says.
The British Prime Minister asked for an explanation after the voting scandal in East London Tower Hamlet.
Last year, a special electoral court ordered that mayor Lutfur Rahman would have to separate his role because of corruption and numerous illegal practices.
The Court of Justice considered that Rahman’s misgiving was an age - adjudicate of the religious feeling of his Muslim community and that his critics were accused of racism and Islam.
Rahman was told that his campaign was based on the religious obligation of every believer to vote for him.
Up to 300 of them were questionable or sincerely given in such a way that the person voted by making a decision to become another person.
According to Sir Eric, there was evidence from the whole country.
He expressed particular concern about the postal crop, where members of the Muslim community were told that they had put pressure on the people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric (in picture) made a number of proposals to clean up the voting system, including a request for a identity certificate at the voting place.
The report says: \"There is evidence that some members of vulnerable ethnic minority groups, particularly women and young people, have been stressed to vote in accordance with the parents' will, particularly in Pakistan and Bangladesh-related communities.
“It was a concern that... the government institutions had choked their eyes on such activities... politically correct... because of the hypersensitivity to ethnicism and religion.
Sir Eric made 50 proposals to ensure that the system could be clean, including the ban on the handling of postal voting tickets from political activists, in order to prevent 'sounding'.
The report under consideration also calls for more stringent checks on registration in order to prevent the use of the voting rights register for immigration and benefit fraud.
Considering the options in which voters would be required to present a identity certificate before voting.
Distinguishing the fingers to an uninhabited music after voting so that no one can vote twice.
Systematic checks to ensure the nationality and voting rights of voters.
Set up a three-year limit for requests for automatic mail voting.
Disableing the handling of voice and mail mail messages sent by completed mail from political activists.
Police are entitled to form security chains around voting stations.
The amendment of the law makes it easier to raise fears on the basis of the 1983 Representation of the People Act.
Refusal of photography at voting venues.
Only the English permit at the polling stations (except the Wales).
Improving training to ensure that staff are controlled by a rule that only one person should be allowed to go to the voting copy at a time.
Sir Eric strongly criticises the London police and finds it surprising that after the Tower Hamlet incident, there were no criminal charges.
“The Court resigned from the task of Mr Rahman and his representative because of corruption and numerous illegal practices,” he says.
\"He was found guilty without a certain suspicion and criminal evidence threshold exceeded many criteria:
He also criticises the ineffective checks of the departments responsible for the election lists of the City Council.
“The decision of the Court last year in the case of Tower Hamlet was a wake,” says Sir Eric.
\"Our country is proud of its heritage as the mother of all Parliaments, but this good reputation threatens the worrying and hidden election and its refusal by some people.

In Primark, unspoken underwear in the middle of the trade was shocked by the customers
The customers didn't know where to look when a woman went off in the middle of Primark to settle the underwear.
He continued to worsen the situation by assessing what he looked like in his underwear, taking them out of his leg and putting them back on the shelf.
He continued to spin and eventually tried four underwear in a shop at the Bouvere Place Shopping Centre in Folkeston.
Primark chain store at the Folkestone Bouvere Place mall where a woman tried underwear in front of everyone and put them back on the shelf
At the same time, the mother Jenny Davidson, who was two children at the same time, says that when she tried underwear, she dressed and walked out of the shop without buying anything.
He tells us about what happened: \"The people had no faith in their eyes.
The woman stood in the middle of the shop, took her underwear off the shelf, took off her own tricks and underwear and put them on.
He didn't try to do it unnoticedly, but he did it completely without shame.
Everyone was staring at him when he took the underwear he tested off his leg, and apparently he didn't like them because he put them back in the shelf.
He did it three more times before finally decided not to hold on to anything, dressed and walked out.
He didn't seem to care about the eyes, and he didn't think about a person who would finally buy the underwear he had experienced.
The 33 - year - old Davidson, who lives in Kenttown, continues: “How disgusting it is to think that someone will take his home underpants, which someone else has used, and they will not be washed.
It happened Tuesday afternoon.
“I have understood that the trading staff is trying to remove these items from the sale after she left – what is right.
It would be terrible to take the new underwear home and see that someone else has come to them without being washed after that, more Davidson.
Primark’s notifier commented: “Primark is aware of the situation in the Folkestone movement on Tuesday 9 August.
All the products in question have been removed from the sale:
This is how you defend yourself against armed attacks with the help of Krav Mag.
The world is full of dangers, but this on Dailymail.com can help make it a little safer.
We interviewed the major master of the Krav Mag Union in New York, Rhon Mizrachi, and asked for advice on how to cope with the pyssy of a robbery or assaultist in the near range.
The video shows how you can defend the attacker, depending on whether the attacker is approaching you or behind you.
If the attacker approaches the rear, the first thing you need to turn around is to see the attacker and get out of the firing line, says Mizrachi.
After this, take the gun so that it stays between your elbow and shoulder arm, and strike the face with your free elbow.
Then kick the attacker on the knee to the ankles, and when he goes to pain the twin factor, stick him on his face with the gun's pipe, and back off by holding a gun on him.
The technology is equivalent if the armed attacker approaches the front. You have to move off the firing line, grab the gun and turn it around so that the attacker can't fire.
At the same time, put your weight on the gun and the attacker's fist on the chest, turn your gun off from the front of the attacker and hold the gun against the attacker.
Does that sound difficult?
Look at the video, how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way to get rid of the kidnapper by giving up your cash if you are not the Great Master of Krav Mag.
World Traveler Ian Wright arrows the dirtiest places in Europe
The British world traveler put his resistance and their chaos reflexes on a hard test by licking the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
The Suffolk plotter and travel guide writer Ian Wright, 51, wanted to prove his resistance by licking the strength of the euro banknote, handcuff in Piccadilly Circus, the train’s toilet license button and the Russian general phone.
Before licking Wright measured the objects on the snowometer to see themselves and show the viewers where they were banned to push.
The test was carried out by a documentary film Ian Wright – on the tracks of internal power, and the results were surprising.
The idea of sinking a train toilet license can be disgusting, but in fact more bacteria are in the kitchen sink.
On the way across Europe, Wright interviews doctors and other medical professionals to strengthen the good intestinal bacteria and their own health.
Fortunately, nothing that he licked caused nothing but evil mouth.
Ian Wright first became known for his travel program, where he tested the sustainability of his bowels by travelling around the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
There is no doubt that the sinking of the handrails and toilet licenses at the railway stations was affected by Wright's resistance.
Wright says in the document: “I’ve been pretty concerned about my health since I was a child and I’ve put all kinds of things in my mouth, such as dirt, worms and sores.
In the film, he really showed himself to be a taxist of his reputation.
The border was only received in a public bathroom in Russia.
The lumometer measured more than 4,000 units of the sample.
For the purposes of comparison, it should be said that the number in the hands of the antibodies is usually less than 60.
The border came up in a Russian public bathroom where Wright refused to lick when the snowmeter measured the result of 4,000 units – the same figure is less than 60 in the hands of the defendants.
Wright adventures in a documentary film produced with Valio, Ian Wright – on internal power tracks, where the number of bacteria is made visible in different places, such as the bathroom.
Wright says in the document: “This is almost the smell of a terrible thing I've smelled in any bathroom.
Four thousand units, nothing's more dirty than that!
This place is so disgusting that I really don't eat anything here.
Wright produced a documentary photo of Ian Wright – in cooperation with Valio on the tracks of internal power.
From the choice Wright received a selection of lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and vitamin D vitamins from Valio Gefilus, which helps to strengthen the positive bacterial strain and resistance of the intestine.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Head of the category of snack, juice and novelty products in the selection, says: “We wanted to offer consumers something completely new.
Something that's fascinating to look at and at the same time tells about the benefits of probiotics.
We used a lot of time to think about something crazy, and finally we ended up asking Ia,
Salt health has become a global trend.
Instead of simply talking about products, we wanted to bring them into a wider relationship and tell us about the good and bad bacteria, the importance of intestinal health and how it relates to resistance.
The health of salt has become a global trend, and the document enables us to give consumers more information in an interesting way.
The film also tells us about our sense of humor.
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds this: “Let’s say that I have lost respect for Ian if he had licked certain of the items we requested, such as the disgusting Russian toilet, which is also shown in the movie.
Naturally, licking some of the targets was easier for Ian, while part was pretty bad.
I'm glad we got some of the dirty arrows on the tape.
In a survey carried out in 2015 by Valio, 84% of respondents added lactic acid bacteria to the well-being of the stomach and intestines, and 58% reported at least occasionally that they used products with added lactic acid bacteria.
Before his wedding, his family destroyed the rental house in Saltashi, Cornwall.
After leaving 50 000 pounds of the family behind, the city owns a rental house after they had received a wedding for the terroristation of the neighborhood.
Tanya Skeldon and her husband Shaun Trebilcock have received a wedding from their apartment in Cornwall, Saltashi, after numerous complaints against the couple.
When the couple had been forced to leave the apartment, the representatives of the rental company declared that the dwelling was in a repairing order.
There were amplifying holes in the wall, the floorboards had been torn off, the trash had been spread to the floors, and the walls were shattered with graphite.
The couple has now changed, and they are believed to live in a private home.
Donna McEvoy, head of the Cornwall Housing Agency, says he's afraid he may no longer be able to save the dwelling.
He says: “This has been a nightmare for people living here, no one should have to endure such things.
There is much to be weighed, as the property is likely to become known as not so pleasant as part of Cornwall.
The family's insolent, just like its name.
There were three boys who lived in the apartment from time to time, according to the police, there were streetfights in the nesting countries, the fear of residents, the use and transmission of drugs, and the loud noise, the fight and the curse.
In June, the 47-year-old Skeldon, who signed the lease, received an order for social behaviour.
Old waste was found in several rooms of the house under the fountain threat.
The house had previously sold drugs, and the floorboards had been torn off.
According to the neighbors, the family fought on the street and the police were regularly called.
The Cornwall apartment agency dismissed the couple's forced action this week after they first gave them 11 weeks of additional time voluntarily to move away.
The mild neighbors were grateful for their wedding – they said their lives were earthly hell.
One of the neighbors says: “They didn’t care about anyone.
We've lived next door for 20 years, and the whole time's been hard.
The police have been here a lot of times.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We woke up because it was so quiet, and we're not used to it!
It'll be wonderful now that they've finally been evicted.
Adam Fitzpatrick, responsible for the forced arrests of the Cornwall apartment agency, says that the family could not cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, during which the police were regularly invited.
The trash and old toys had been dumped on a wild wall of the rental house.
Fitzpatrick adds: “It is a pity that the tenant did not take any responsibility for his or her family’s behaviour, as the wedding is always the last measure considered by the Cornwall Housing Agency.
This case was extremely difficult, since behaviour was extreme, and their actions must have been shocking to the attention of the neighbourhood.
I am grateful to my working group, the Devon and the Cornwall police and the members of the Community who took part in the work and had the courage to provide us with information.
I hope that this step forward will improve the well-being of the neighbours and will send a message that social behaviour is not accepted.
Fitzpatrick tells us that the three sons of the family had all lived in the apartment in different times, but they were already in twenty.
A dirty pillow found in one bedroom after the wedding
The housing workers now need to clean up the waste plants around the house.
In 2014, the police made a race and found more than 70 grams of cannabis and also waxes and other supplies, as well as 1,700 pounds of cash.
Skeldon received a fine penalty when he was found guilty of possession of class B drugs to sell it.
He claimed that the money was in his car accident in 2013 for his dead son Lee Skeldon's gravestone.
After being homeless, Skeldon and his husband have been heard about changing to a private apartment in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms were ashted on graphite.
Police say they demand a wedding for tenants who break the rules on leases.
Angela Crow Devon and Cornwall police say that this wedding is a clear warning to the tenants who are constantly threatening the rules.
“This is a clear message for those who think they can behave how they want to do without charges, as well as for those who suffer from such conduct,” says Crow.
Devon and Cornwall police will never accept criminal and social behavior and continue working with their partners to protect our communities.
Low flying, landless military jet scared tourists in Portugal
The sun worshipers experienced the shock of their lives in Portugal’s Aveir.
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force crashed into an alarming low.
According to the Air Force, it was a training flight that did not threaten safety.
The picture shows a moment when tourists were forced to escape when a low - flying jet hit over a full beach.
From the dramatic images, you can see how an army plane will come near the distance of contact with the sandy beach from the tourists taking the sun in North Portugal’s Aveir.
The dragons rose on their feet, worryingly worrying about the steepness of the jet engines that began to belong before they saw what was coming through the clouds.
The incident occurred last afternoon in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
One of the pictures and videos of the dramatic pastry in social media was Daniel Fernandos, who says: “It passed the beach twice in a very low way, and there was a moment when it looked like it was falling into the ground.
Nuno Arroja adds: “I was surfing and I was sure that the machine would fall on me.
The tourists on the lake were shocked when the plane suddenly came to view and flew down at an alarming low level.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that the P-3C Orion pilot was on a training flight to identify coastal fishing vessels and therefore had to fly so low.
According to the pilot, they had to be a little lower than normal because the smoke caused by the nearby forest fires damaged visibility, but according to the Air Force, this was not a threat to anyone's safety.
Forest fires have caused destruction in parts of mainland Portugal and have killed four people on Madeira Island.
The Portuguese Air Force announced today that because of the poor visibility of the sand fog and smoke, the pilot had to be so low.
The aircraft was on a training flight, where the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels.
Better than expected result of the first half of the extract
In January - June, the social and health border in South Karelia (Exote) made EUR 3.4 million better than planned results.
The result was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The result was particularly good in family and social services, where preventive services have been developed to eliminate institutional care.
The treatment guarantee was implemented in all activities.
This year, the Exote will try to shorten the rules of action.
Exote covers the surplus of previously born deficits.
It may be used to shorten queues and buy measures for patients.
The whole year's result is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Exote Government will discuss a half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Borderers swore a military whale in Immolola
70 guards from the Border and Marine Guard School swore a military election on Friday.
Military election was held in Immmola on Friday.
Ten special ice cream courses were organised in the sports field of the reserve.
The militaryvalan swore 70 armed men.
Special Borderers are trained in demanding border security, intelligence and combat tasks.
They serve 347 days.
This year, ten young people were applied for.
They were called 250 for selection tests.
Special MRLs have been trained in Immmolola since 2007.
Five veterans of war-time border forces were involved in the treatment of hydrogen in connection with the whale ceremony.
The average age of those who have been involved is now 90 years.
The oldest veterans who took part in the event were born in 1918.
A limit of race ahead of the crime investigation will help to investigate crimes and reveal serious crime - ESS.fi
In each of the 11 police institutes in Finland, the RTA has been operating since the beginning of 2014.
The operation of the unit is out of sight.
There are four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
That's what's being placed in the Gulf, Sergeant.
Lieutenant Lahti is the chief officer.
In addition, the strength of the unit is one of the civilians dedicated to information technology in Hämeenlinna.
Everyone's working in a civilian suit.
The unit has demonstrated its usefulness and necessity, considers Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces different investigations for the other police.
It has, among other things, acquired information on asylum seekers.
Reform of recent working practices
The creation of analytical units is the latest reform of police working methods.
The aim has been to prevent crime, i.e. to make the police leave more and less and less often, until they get the alarm.
The information collected and analysed by the unit will help target daily police activities where it is most needed.
As part of the reform of the police administration, a criminal intelligence centre was established, less than three national units and each police station has its own criminal intelligence unit.
The PTR Centre in Vantaa, in the context of the Central Criminal Police, is a national leader.
PTR units work according to their name from police, Customs and Border Guard.
The RTA services, for their part, work in divided areas according to the police departments, are responsible for providing information to both local police and national services.
Intelligence extends beyond its own territory
Where an individual police officer is aware of what has happened during his 12-hour working hours, the task of the RTA unit is to know what is happening in the entire police department area.
Intelligence also extends beyond the borders of its own institution because it also makes crime.
RTA employees have better knowledge of basic politics.
The unit seeks to draw police attention to new phenomena, productive criminals or similar crimes by means of registers, alert mission databases and observations.
This is called sacrimation, and it is one of the most important tools in criminal intelligence.
All people have their own way of doing things.
The handprint is also visible at work, whether it was honest or criminal.
Based on the practice of the factor, there is a certain kind of picture.
This can be done either on the basis of an artificial or a person, depending on which police has more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
The employees of the RTA unit do not travel in the city with the collars in standing, but their work is not entirely public.
As a result, professional offenders would develop their activities and thus try to prevent police criminal activities.
The police will be publicly informed of the conduct if it anticipates their threat.
This was, for example, the initial news, the signification of empty dwellings used in housing fractures.
That's where the authors put the apartment in the outer door with a stick, a single needle or a tape with which they tried to see if the inhabitants were really on their way.
The preliminary investigation material shall be made public to at least the parties concerned.
The analysis unit has found that the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The smartest ordering protocol on the right to fly, for example, shows that fingerprints have been found at the scene.
Next time, we're going to steal the gloves in our hand.
The case has been interviewed by Deputy Police Chief Tero Seppista from Häme police, Lieutenant Tuimo Lepola from the East Finland Police Department, Detective Sami Joutjärve from the Joensuu Police Station and Detective Arto Tuamela from Central Crime Police.
The police will collect and analyse information that will help us plan practical action.
Background to the reduction of labour and financial resources.
The first steps towards the new approach were taken 30 years ago.
The latest change was the three-step PURA reform, which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation collects information from outside its own institution and Finland.
A London schoolgirl associated with her father killed in Syria.
News reports that one of the three British students who joined the Isis last year, Kadiza Sultana, has been killed in Syria.
The lawyer Tasime Akunjee tells her family that Sultana died in Syria a few weeks ago.
He was believed to have been killed in a Russian air strike in Raqa, a base of Isis in Syria, told ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old, and according to her family, she was just planning to escape from the war from the fiery land and the return to Britain.
It can only be hoped that this will act as a warning example and a will so that people will understand this is a real risk when they go to the war zone, and which will allow people to give up their decision to leave, says Akunjee.
In February 2015, Sultana, together with two other Eastern school girls, went on a plane flying to Turkey and continued on a bus to Syria.
The family had heard that Sultana had married the Isis player in Syria and remained widowed only a few months after the wedding.
Reid says Clinton's support for Garland's Supreme Court if he's elected
President Harry Reid of the Senate says he's convinced that Mr Hillary Clinton, the candidate for democratic President, will be appointed Judge of Merrick Garland's Supreme Court if he is elected president.
The Republican representatives of the Senate have not agreed to confirm Garland's appointment after Barack Obama appointed him in March.
According to the Senate’s majority leader, Mitch McConnell, the next president will select the person to fill the place of Antonon Scalia, the Supreme Judge of the Supreme Court.
Reid said in the telephone conference on Thursday that he predicted Clinton's dominant Garland noise with great certainty.
Reid's informant later specified that this was just speculation and that Reid had not spoken directly to Clinton about whether this was going to be called Garland.
Reid praised Garland and said that Clinton's team wouldn't want to \"cry the boat\" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the head of the United States Court of Appeal in the district of Columbia.
Reid says that the Republicans that are preventing Garland's appointment are the presidential candidate for Donald Trump's commandees.
He says Trump doesn't fit in.
According to the Treats magazine, naked calendars belong to women as well as to men
Treats magazine cooperates with photographer David Bellemere and puts on the market for the year 2017 of the calendar made in the 1970s and inspired by Pirelli.
They want to find the top models of the next generation of their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
The CEO of Treats, Steve Shaw, earlier this year, reported that his nakedness is different from that of the old school's Playboy magazine because he said: “Playboy is for men.
I'm doing this to women.
Apparently, he thinks the same about the calendar.
“We need to bring back timeless and classic nakedness, where women, where men, too, can no longer enjoy and inspire the images of these women’s body, ” says Shaw’s calendar press release.
“The women will certainly want to participate in this project, because it will be a beautiful work of art.
The model will allow you to send pictures via the network or participate in open selection events in Los Angeles and New York.
Vinyl charm: Who buys records?
Single, middle-aged men like vinyl.
Before you have time to write a comment on the name of your angry objection, EiväKikSäksiÜksi Keeheh, this argument is based on real research data.
According to YouGov research company, behind the new arrival of many vinyl plates, there is no rubber in the millennial-supplement when the Millennials want to feel a physical object in their hands, but instead there is a middle-aged nostalgia.
The age of the person who recently bought vinyl album is most likely between 45 and 54.
In fact, 18-24 are the least likely buyers.
Moreover, it is not just a desire for amateurs to hug records, but the meaning is emotional: older vinyl buyers are more likely to keep their feelings hidden (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy being single (69% vs. 66%).
But do you think the results of YouGov are true?
If this blog were a television broadcast, the camera would follow me walking along the live Soho Street, a gray jacket on top of me.
So let's find out.
Even though Soho has slowly lost its charm and its roses, while hotels, Eats, Prets and Paperchase chains have taken over before private entrepreneurs have owned facilities, there are still some terrible special record stores.
I would probably ask the photographer to stop the camera for a moment when I apply very close to the men visiting these stores and try to monitor their age and nature.
The Glasgow Stuart, 55, followed by two young women at the time of the Sister Ray movement (in the case of clients, three middle-aged men) to the Reckles Records (in the case of eight middle-aged men, one probably twenty-seven-seven women) is on a meeting trip in London for the afternoon and spends extra time on the supply of shops.
I'll ask if he's a collector.
I think I'm, he says.
- I've got some 3000 to 1,000 albums.
These records meet his living room wall as shown in the picture. (Stuart sent me a picture by email, I did not follow him home.)
The reason why he has acquired so much albums and singles is partly his available income. He is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared in the beginning and to buy again the things he had been young and insolvent to sell.
“I have a lot of stuff from the late '60s and from the beginning of the '70s that appeared when I was 11 or 12 years old and probably too young to get them, ” he says.
He agrees that those buying vinyl plates are more likely to be introverters that enjoy their company and add: “I don’t smoke, and I don’t drink much.
It's my bad.
Sister Ray, 25, believes that many of their clients are also suitable for the YouGov profile.
However, he has discovered a new kind of human stream that has been influenced by media hiccup, and these people have heard about the coming of vinyl plates and now feel forced to buy their old albums back.
\"In the light of my discussions, people had usually abandoned their collections in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling CDs to buy their vinyl back, he says.
This may explain the boom of certain ages.
And what about the emotional meaning of the recordings claimed?
In just a few seconds, Phonica-like movement realizes that they provide comfort to the same-sex types of community.
According to Wez, some of the older customers are particularly affected by the in-depth payment system.
The digital world may be ashamed of some vinyl fans to which the return to familiar record boxes means stability and reminds youth of lucky days.
“I believe that it sometimes fills up with an opening or material property as some sort of comfort, ” says Wez.
“I saw it as a collector myself, and I believe that so many others too.
It's an easy way to get ideas out of here.
- We're like social workers. - We're behind the record.
The ICM opinion survey in April revealed that almost 50% of the purchases of vinyl albums in the previous month had not yet been heard.
The opinion study also reported that 41% is a disc player that they never use, and 7% of vinyl buyers do not have a record player at all.
At this point, I would probably look like a serious face to the news, while turning on the stacked bossa nova collections.
The new arrival of Vinyl plates is also accompanied by a \"pocal phenomenon\", found by Jonny, a salesman from the Sounds of the Universe (as clients at the moment three middle-aged men), 42.
“The customer recently released and said he didn’t have a record player, but he wanted to buy a radiohead disc so he could put it on his shelf,” Jonny says.
\"The proportion of these customers is not high, but they are.
To them, materiality is more important than music.
Some of our clients tell us they still don't have a record player.
They're younger, not older, mostly teen-aged people who are just starting a hobby.
The customer is significantly more variable in Foppi, where I am next. The movement has dedicated a whole layer to vinyl plates.
There are seveny-seven-seven-seven-seven-seven-seven-seven-seven-seven-seven tourists, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
The difference between customers makes us happy, even though the atmosphere is not as relaxing as in previous moves: the echoing of the whirlwind with the swing jazz instead of Wild Beats' new sex with a synthesizer pop.
No customers seem particularly lonely, but it's hard to say a pale psychological trauma by standing next to someone in 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Foppi for a few minutes and looking at various records at discounts.
He's more watching than doing shopping.
He tells us that his income is small, so it's not possible for him to collect the albums.
- They're paying a lot.
The music is easy to listen to from your computer or otherwise, but the decoration of the vineyard is ..., he lets the lovely sneezing go and continues:
- I can't explain. They're so unique.
My last stop is a trade that is said to have inspired the generation of new vinyl fans: Urban Outfitters.
I can see a bunch of teenage girls who would think they're going to be doing dicks, but they're going to be gathered for a moment around the Polaroid cameras, and I see a father and a daughter who's considering buying a Crosley board.
On the left there is a staircase filled with the wall of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, key albums in any middle collection.
No one looks at the wall, maybe because they're just a decorating element and part so high that they don't even get promoted.
They're a clean-ass vinyl-silence.
But given that all the means to get attention to these albums may mean more money for the sector and send some customers to the hacking Sohoon, there is little reason to complain.
It is no surprise that a population group, most likely to have more time and money than most, is also the group that spends most money on luxury, such as vinyl plates.
Although my research shows that youGov's results are true, at least in Soho's record stores, they do not exclude a large number of female collectors and vinyl fans, which actually exist in both record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be closely caught in school or working life.
I'm sure they're not spending their Thursday morning in record stores on Berwick Street, playing records and avoiding a 30-year-old TV driver who's looking scaryly and looking at the mean-time men who don't know what they're doing.
Holkeri, or ice shark, is the longest living spine – video report
According to researchers, the longest living spine on the planet is ice shark.
According to shark investigator Julius Nielsen, the oldest remains were granted in the study for 272 to 512 years, a five-metre female.
The French court rejected the application for the removal of the goods of the jungle
The French court has rejected the application of the Calais authorities, in which they require the removal of tens of temporary shops and restaurants by housing thousands of refugees in the jungle camp.
In the course of the trial held this week, the Calais authorities argued that the State should be allowed to break down the 72 temporary shops set up for refugee camps, which sell various goods to refugees in tobacco drinks and offer hair clips.
According to Calais's cracking authorities, these trades and restaurants must be bitten because they do not pay taxes and therefore represent the grey economy and are associated with fire and hygiene crises.
The humanitarian aid teams told the Court that trades and restaurants are necessary for the camp, as free meals offered by the government and other bodies are not sufficient for the growing population of the camp.
According to them, temporary stores and restaurants often provide protection and free food for those who need them.
The Lille Court decided that there was no legal basis for the exclusion of 72 temporary traders, but considered the concern of Calais's prafty to be understandable.
According to Judge Jean-François Molla, the camp’s food shops, cafes and restaurants are much more important than just offering food to people who live under extremely unstable conditions.
He says they offer peaceful places where refugees and volunteers can meet each other.
One of the places under the threat of unloading was the camp Jungle Book Kids, which is unprofitable and offers 200 meals a day, English and French hours and asylum advice for the camp's hundreds of underages, whose position is most vulnerable.
More than 170 000 people have signed an address where children's cafe is required to be maintained.
According to a letter sent to Guardian, its closure would be a disaster for these children, some of which are only 8 years old.
Two charity organizations, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimate on Friday that the population of the jungle camp has risen to over 9 000 people after the steep growth of the summer fires.
Food prices in Finland clearly fall faster than average in the EU
Food is very cheap in Finland to the joy of consumers and to the harm of producers.
Food prices have fallen by nearly 5% in Finland in three years, with an average decrease of 0.9% in EU countries.
At the same time, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one percent more expensive.
Over the last three years, food prices have fallen most among the EU countries with similar levels of pay compared to Finland.
From the analogue countries only in Britain, the price of food has decreased faster than in Finland.
The information is presented in the article of Statistics Finland’s Development Manager Ilkka Lehtinen published in the Information & Trends bilog.
The magazine compared real assets, i.e. prices that are related to the general development of consumer prices.
The latest data is from June this year.
At the beginning of the 2010s, food prices rose strongly.
In 2013, prices fell close to the 1994 price level.
The situation was alarming.
“We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership,” says Lehtinen.
Then followed the translation, after which the food has become cheaper year by year.
The prices are now under pressure by the Russian import ban on food which has caused food exports from Finland to Russia.
Therefore, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and producer prices for agriculture have decreased.
“Putin’s policy has helped Finnish consumers in the short term,” says Lehtinen.
The increased price competition for industry and trade has also had an impact on the fall in prices.
The big trade chains in the S-group and Kesko have both dropped their prices.
For the consumer, price competition has been seen as visible promotion campaigns.
However, Finland is still not cheap food styles, even though the price of food has fallen.
In 2015, food in Finland was one of the fourth most expensive EU countries with similar wage levels in Finland.
According to the newspaper, VAT has a significant impact on the price of food sold in Finland.
He found that if the Verrokki countries had the same VAT rate, food would be sold in Finland at the same wage level as third countries.
The newspaper compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate were seven in the Verrokki countries, only the Germans and Dutch would sell cheaper food than Finns.
“If we want to reach the level of old EU countries at food prices, VAT must be half-at EU average and price competition continued,” says Lehtinen.
The newspaper points out that the calculations made by him at the rate of VAT are indicative.
School isn't exactly what it used to be anymore.
A returning school bench may notice that there has been a change in school during the summer.
A new education plan has been drawn up for schools, which will be put in place at the beginning of the academic period in all sub-schools.
It is a guide to all schools in Finland.
The schools themselves decide on the details, but the plan shows the official objectives.
The new guidelines have been prepared for several years and differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
Among other things, teaching beauty writing is being abandoned, and schools are starting to practice coding.
Swedish education starts at the latest in the sixth grade, and social education is already being read in the fourth grade.
However, the greatest change concerns the role of students.
Before it was thought that the teacher was teaching students, but now everyone should be active and learn each other.
This is how we try to make training more interesting.
The world's most long-lasting spine could live for up to 400 years.
The Greenland hai (Somniosus microcephalus) known for icebergs reaches the age of 150.
It can then live another 250 years, reporting a new investigation.
The figures make the species the longest backbone of today’s world.
In the animal kingdom it is only passed by the Islamic population, whose oldest known individual has been scheduled to be 507 years old.
The Greenland sharks swim along the North Atlantic.
They also have another record: they are the largest fish in the Arctic region.
The females stretch dogs for longer, they can grow up up up to five meters.
Since the rate of growth is slow, only about a centimetre per year is observed, adult individuals have lived for a long time.
But how long?
Julius Nielsen from Copenhagen University and his colleagues found out.
He defined adults' ice cream age from 28 females who had been caught by fishermen.
The age of fish was revealed by the radiocarbonism of the ophthalmologists.
The average age of the sharks studied was at least 272 years.
Two of the largest fish, 493 and 502 cents of the sample, were exposed to some 335 and 392 years of age.
In the previous studies, it has been found that the ice sharks only reach sexual maturity by more than four meters, the researchers decreased their number at that point in time to some 150 years of age.
Science published by the study.
Stockmann fires for almost 300 salesmen are not reduced.
Almost 300 employees will be suspended from Stockman.
The joint venture companies ended in the company that ran into difficulties at the beginning of August.
\"As a result of the consultations, around 300 jobs will be reduced, most of which will be made redundant,\" says Stockmann in his report.
It says that there is no reduction in the number of traders in the goods sector so that customer service does not suffer.
In addition, about 80 workers from support activities will be offered new jobs as salesmen.
The Stockmann yt negotiations concerned some 3 000 employees.
At the start of their reduction, some 380 employees were estimated to be employed.
A small reduction will aim at an annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are to be achieved over the next year.
Stockmann has already launched an efficiency programme with a view to achieving savings of EUR 50 million this year.
Stockmann’s difficulties in getting profitable from the trade in goods are underlying.
Although the adjusted operating result of the Group improved in the second quarter to EUR 11,1 million, the trade in goods still makes a loss.
According to the CEO Lauri Veijalainen, the sale of Stockmann v. CEO has not achieved the company's objectives in the goods stores.
“Achievements are, unfortunately, necessary to ensure the positive operating result of Stockmann Retail in 2018-, the Vejalainen notes in the press release.
The result improvement of the second quarter was particularly due to the success of Lindex.
Ketju achieved its second quarter turnover and results in all time.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9.5 million to EUR 28.1 million.
Last year's total Stockmann Group's operating result was 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the Group's turnover will fall last year.
The operating result is expected to be slightly positive this year.

Kenya’s general sports team is treating the Dopingskandal - coach’s explanation
The Kenian general sports coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Olympics in Rio after it became apparent that Anzrah was a national team athlete in the doping test.
The news agency AP told me that the athlete, when Anzrah tried to perform, is the 800-metre star Fernando Rotich.
Stephen Arap Soi, a country team leader in Kenya, told me that Anzrah's identity was revealed after he had issued a sample of Rotichina in the surprise test.
Doping officials went to the authorities of Anzrah.
According to Soi, Anzrah was sent home because he committed a crime against the Kenyan nation team.
He appeared as an athlete, gave a urine sample, and even signed the documents.
We cannot accept such behavior, Kip Keino, President of the Kenian Olympics Committee, would, in turn, continue to be a news agency for Reuters.
The Olympics' general sports starts on Friday, and Rotich is due to run immediately at that time.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the case.
Rotich was placed last year in the World Cup on the way to the quarter and is in advance Rio's winning favours.
According to Reuters, the source of Kenya's general sports team claimed that Anzrah went to the athlete's accreditation card only to get free meals in the race room.
When the antidoping officials met him, they assumed he was a athlete and he was taken to the test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to the officials because he was afraid to find out, the source told me.
Where is everybody?
Rio's general sports stadium is evacuating to its emptyness
Where is everybody?
At Rio's Olympic Stadium, at least, they're not following general sports.
On Friday, Rio started a struggle on the medals of general sports, but the world’s top figures were presented with confusing skills for an empty audience.
On Friday, Rio’s organisers told me that only 58 percent of the tickets to the first day’s morning competitions and 65% of the tickets to the evening competitions have been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium was pulsating people.
The flags of the finals have already been sold out in Rio.
The viewers of Rio’s Olympic Games have attracted attention even before the general sport.
For example, thousands of empty blades have been seen in the eyes of rugby, melody and horse riding.
When Brazil’s medalivos Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca played beach flying ball in the legendary Copacaba, only 70% of the watch was full.
After the Brazilian cab, the Netherlands played against Russia, and about 30 per cent of the 12 000 people were in sight.
At least the fact that Brazil, who is fighting in economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian tourists, and many of the Olympic species are strange to the Brazilians who are used to football.
However, even in the Brazil football team, the first match was not allowed to complete the football stadium.
At the weekend, the reporter Mario Andrada reported that 82 per cent of the tickets had been sold at that time, which is clearly a smaller figure than four years ago.
\"We still have 1.1 million left for sale,\" said Reuters.
Of the 8,5 million flags of London’s Olympic Games, 8,2 million were sold, although almost half the flags were worth more than in Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from about nine euros to over a thousand euros.
More than half of the tickets pay less than €16.
In London's Olympic volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty places, but in Rio this is not yet allowed, as organisers need money and try to get tickets sold until the last minute.
In Rio, however, organisers have provided 240 000 tickets for less well-known species, such as golf and rugby.
At Rio Stadium, there were empty places in the morning.
Even the beach flying ball in Copacaba sand has not been interested in the audience.
Jukka Centralsalo competed in London in 2012.
I've had a lot of people in the papers.
New way to protect the environment - Get the right to land
Helsinki Foundation will participate in the conservation of nature through the new ways.
The Foundation, established last year, acquires ecologically important habitats.
After that, private, companies and entities can redeem holders' rights in the land area by money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land from Lapland.
The country has been divided into virtual blocks that are open to the right of holders against payment.
The administrator receives 187 square blocks of the size of the veto right, which means in practice that no approval is required for each holder if the purpose of the land is to be changed.
There are also several areas where management rights can be acquired.
Acquisition of the right of administration is something concrete that can leave your inheritance or give you a gift.
You don't have to go and carry the banners or the handles somewhere in order to protect the environment, and the Juha Leviva fabric, who has acquired the right to control it, is justified.
The holder of the administrative authority receives accurate location data from his compartment, which enables, for example, a visit in the area.
On the Foundation’s website, the name details of the holders of holders’ rights are provided in the same map as the country block data can be found.
The canvas sees as a risk of natural conservation acquisition only that the Foundation’s activities change from its original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation has been set up as a foundation of general interest to promote environmental and natural protection.
The risk is that the Foundation would act in some kind of ethical or commercial way, but it should not be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation Haltija project is the protection of natural areas in such a way that they can be inviolable and peaceful.
The Foundation acquires land either by buying or by providing donations.
It finances its activities mainly through the sale of ownership rights, but the Foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The aim of the Foundation is to acquire more protection countries.
It also targets Finland's borders and plans land acquisition from Australia.
Helsinki Foundation presents its activities in a pop up forest at the Helsinki mall on 13-19 August.
The bike thieves are tormenting the big cities, banging Turkey - see the situation in your municipality of residence
The bicycle thieves torture Turkey from large cities in Finland.
There is more round than nine in the largest city that has been stolen this year.
According to the bike thefts reported to the police in Helsinki, the number of bicycles and their parts per thousand inhabitants have been stolen in the biggest ten cities in January to August this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti rose.
According to the police, there were four of the five wheelchairs per thousand inhabitants.
Instead, in Espoo and Kouvola, only about two bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
That's the big difference.
\"In other cities, there are double thefts in relation to the number of inhabitants compared to others, characterises police officer Tommi Reen.
Turku police are wondering why the city is at the top of the comparison.
It's extremely difficult to say why there's been stolen more wheels in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
“The generality of the records can be influenced by how much traffic is in the city and how much the wheel is in the top,” says Sergeant Teemu Äkäus.
The police government Tommi Reen is quite expected that Turku, Helsinki and Oulu will rise in comparison with the top.
The number of bike thefts goes largely according to the number of study and cycling cities.
Turku has a busy center, short distances and lots of wheels available for thieves.
“For example, Espoo is a very different kind of city where urban centres are distant and the bicycle is not necessarily a priority mobility tool,” Reen says.
In the whole of Finland, police information has become a little less wheel theft in January to August than in the corresponding period of last year.
But there is no cause for great joy.
In spite of the decline in recent years, the police will be aware of a little more than 20,000 wheels per year.
It means 50-60 each day and only around 4,000 wheels per year in Helsinki.
They're big amounts, Reen says.
In reality, thieves take more wheels, for only a part of the victims inform the police of the theft.
Reen calls on people to report on the theft of the bike, even though less than one case reported to the ten police.
A typical search of a bike theft is one where the police get information about theft right away and the thief gets caught in his blood.
“The results can also be found in other investigations when, for example, stolen wheels can be found in a drug case,” Reen says.
In Helsinki, bicycle thieves will be caught on their own weekly mission or in connection with police investigation, says Timo Leppämäki.
According to him, a round is being stolen, for example, from wheelchairs, indoors, warehouses, and wheelchairs, in practice everywhere where they are usually kept.
For individual bike models, most are stolen like Jopos in previous years.
The U-hole gives the bike a better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves take the bike for their short-term use, for example, but a large part of the stolen wheels end up selling online, for example.
They will remain on the domestic market.
At least the police have not come to know that the stolen wheels would go much abroad,\" Reen says.
According to the police, stolen wheels are common Finnish.
I'm sure some of you will buy a stolen bike without knowing.
Some may have doubts about it.
The buyer of the used wheel must be precise, as he may be guilty of a cover-up offence or violation.
\"The alarm bells should be played if they sell 16 wheels in their clear fields,\" Reen says.
Severi Hirvi, a special author of the library, carries a colourful Nopsa for his working day at Kallio's library in Helsinki.
She's had five pieces of bike, but none has been stolen, Hirvi tells me. “It's never been taken, it's been a good monk.
“ Perhaps this is not so attractive to thieves, but it does not necessarily have a hipster value, ” the Helsinkiic Horvi thinks.
In the box in Kallio, Helsinki, the quick-to-do Sibi Valve locked its bicycle with a small u-lock.
Now, the bike snuffed against the wall, but usually the Valve lock his bike in something solid, like a wheelchair.
“There is much to think about, for this bicycle is the most expensive thing I have to say, the Helsinki student says of his white bike, which the hull alone cost about five hundred euros.
\"The whole time you hear from your friends that the wheels have been taken...
- Mostly the bad ones, the dirty boys, the bad ones.
A bike was stolen from the guard from the house company a year ago.
Although the wheel had not been locked, Valve could expect it to be replaced.
Under 15 years of responsibility for your crimes?
Helsinki is experimenting with peer-review crews from the United States
In Helsinki, we will try the so-called peer-light crew to prevent young people from entering the criminal cycle.
Firstly, the experiment will be applied to people under 15 who are now under criminal liability.
We're missing the first young man to commit a crime.
The idea is that the jury will discuss the crime committed and impose sanctions.
A week later, the offender may join the peer-review crew to make up for his actions.
Other consequences may be a letter to the family, for example, explaining what has come to be done and what has been learned from it.
Tommi Laitio, Director of Youth, says that the model is not strict.
We have other compromise models that are used in parallel.
“All of them are directed in a more responsible direction, so that not everything goes down from the first mistake, ” says Laitio.
A model for the Vertaisval crew has been taken from the United States, where it is widely used.
The idea is that a young person, after his first crime, will not be in front of an adult panel, but will reflect on what happened to people about the same age.
The model has been tried once.
The Service Design Office, who followed the course of the service form of Palmu, Ikka Lovio, tells us that it was an abuse that was successfully investigated.
In particular, the first crimes under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with at all.
\"It's been a message to continue on the road you chose,\" Lovio says.
The Vertaisvalam crew is part of the Helsinki project of the Finnish Immigration Service, which is based on the City of Helsinki and the Me- Foundation.
Lovio stresses that new practices are offered to all those who need them, not just for immigrants.
More than 70 Republicans want the party to stop financing the Trump campaign
More than 70 powerful Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop financing the Donald Trump presidential campaign.
The newspaper of the United States news Politico, who had received a draft of it.
According to the newspaper, the open letter is addressed to the President of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus.
The signatories want the party's money to be channelled to Congress elections instead of Trump's campaign.
“We believe that the differences caused by Donald Trump, as well as his incompetence, incompetence and record indiscriminateness, threaten to bring to these elections a sound curve to the Democrats,” says Politico.
Only the direct orientation of all possible funds to Congress elections can prevent Republicans from drowning Trump's ornamental anchor in their necks.
According to the letter, the decision should not be difficult, since Trump's chances of winning the presidential elections will be reduced by day.
Politico writes that the letter is meant to be sent in the next week.
Among the undersigned are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the persons involved in the letter is clearly the Republican Andrew Weinstein, which is opposed to Trumpi.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from people who want to protect the party's majority in Congress and that it is not anybody's support.
A number of Donald Trump's actions are listed in the letter, which are believed to be a violation of millions of voters.
In addition, he is said to have shown dangerous authorityary tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working on national security announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump as president.
Clinton promises relief for families with children in the United States
In the United States, Democrat Hillary Clinton, candidate for democratic President, told us about the details of his economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm trying to be president so that the US economy can go well for everyone.
\"Donald Trump is trying to be president so that the economy would go well for him and his friends,\" Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of Clinton's plan is a massive five-year programme of USD 275 billion to improve U.S. infrastructure roads, bridges and airports.
This would be partly financed by rich tax increases, partly through private money.
The construction programme is a handicraft for American duunas, who suffer from the relocation of factories to low-cost countries.
Clinton called the programme the biggest investment in good-paid jobs after World War II.
We're a builder, we have to go back to building!
Clinton said.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to facilitate the position of families with children who work.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders when he stressed that rich people would have to pay their fair share of taxes.
And if the company leaves the United States to become a tax collector, it has to pay the tax on departure, Clinton said.
He is currently opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he had before supported.
I am opposed to any trade agreement that works against employees or wages, as President of the Court of Justice, Clinton promised.
According to the speculations published by the Washington Post before Clinton's speech, Clinton was going to criticise the Republicans' Donald Trump's financial programme, which was published on Monday, for only millions like this.
In the past, Clinton has appointed Trump's posars for a reduction in the amount of the Roma proposed by Trump.
On Thursday, Clinton stressed that he was the daughter of a small entrepreneur himself.
He reminded listeners of the small entrepreneurs whose invoices Trump had not paid, and the clothes that Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
If he wants to make America big again, he should start making his own products in America, Clinton was hiding.
These are Rio's viewers: Kisses have not glued Finnish tracks, but mobile application is interesting
Usually, sports games are seen in television viewer statistics as sharp mountain peaks.
The Olympics in Rio have so far not reached the peak audience.
At one time, the races have glued 12% of the population at the top of the screws: Tuesday night swims were followed by 615 000 viewers from the Olympics of Yle at the same time.
Due to the comparison: the EM games in general sports received almost 800 000 viewers at TV2 a month ago, and the EM games in football were fairly another million.
The most interesting of the Olympic species has so far been the cycling of Sunday night and the fifth day of the contest opened a teenage gymnastics, both reaching almost half a million viewers on the Olympic Canal at one time.
Top Sports Manager Panu Pokkinen is pleased with the audience figures and reminds us that viewers are first divided into several instruments in Rio's Olympics.
In addition to television, Finns follow the Olympics from Rio Arena.
We are pleased to see how much of the TV viewers are choosing the Olympics.
Television players are also divided into TV2 and Yle Fem channels.
The Olympics in Rio are the first sports games that Yle has owned a whole channel.
When the shipment comes 24 hours a day, and the viewers are from 20,000 to 500 000, it is a good base.
The viewers are smaller than in the 2012 London Competitions or in the 2008 Beijing Competitions, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of Rio's competitions will be in Finland at night.
Another reason for a limited interest - if it is now considered to be a lam - is certainly a traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken a surprise medal from the first fight, the interest would have been a pompped up with it.
In addition, general sports is just about to begin, as is the case with other Finnish interested species: sailing and riding.
At first, according to Pokkisen, the number of viewers has been close to what was expected.
When the general sports starts, the viewers explode.
Yle launched the Yle Rio 2016 mobile app for competitions, which rose to Apple App Store on the first day of the contests for the most free application.
By Monday, the application was loaded 150 000 times.
I'd say we're on the road to 200 grand already.
\"We'll only get the numbers of the viewers later,\" says Pokkinen.
Rio Areena has not worked with all users in the best way.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has come and the flaws have been corrected.
The use of Rio Areena has been associated with delays and other minor technical problems in the early stages.
The applications have been updated to correct errors.
The Olympics in Rio are more visible in Ylen channels and arena than any other sports event ever before.
The Yle Fem can monitor some species, and the radio Yle Püe communicates the races daily.
Olympiacs are not only perhaps the most laborer of Yle ever, but also the last ones that you can only follow from Yle's channels.
From 2018 you will see the Olympic Sports in Yle and commercial channels.
How deep is the lake of Finland?
According to official statistics, Finland's deep lake is the Sun, whose depth is 95.3 meters.
It may be even deeper.
Matti Kannela, a technical training teacher, found a printing paper of about 20 square meters from Ristisel, which was based on a depth of 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried to strengthen the observation by echoing it.
The method may not find a small depth of 100 metres, says the Development Engineer Jari Hakala.
So until now, the official depth is still 95.3 metres.
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 meters) and Suvasvesi (90 meters).
Over 80 metres of Saimaa, Toisvesi and Main Lake.
They have not been studied as closely as the sun.
Especially the base of Inarijärvi has not been carefully mapped.
It could well be found in unknown depths, Kannela thought.
If the deep lake is defined by medium depth, it is the Great Lake Jukajärvi, 23 meters.
As far as you are concerned, your sun is not able to reach ten deeper parts, and Suvasvesi is even further away from the tip.
Correction on 12 August at 2.29 p.m.: Corrected last song, where the deepest lakes were wrong.
Self-employed in the tax sector: Tax on pensioners is becoming more and more stringent.
The taxation of pensioners remains more severe than that of employees.
The individual says that the disadvantage came under the parliamentary elections and the taxation of pensioners was promised to equalise pay earners.
This is not included in the presentation of the government.
We think it should definitely be.
The promises given should be followed after the election, he says to the West Media.
At the beginning of this year, wage earners became unemployed, reducing taxation.
In the Parliament, the case heated the opposition's representatives, who were exacerbated by Mr Alexander Stubb, Minister of Finance, on election promises.
It's safe to buy, it's not growing.
According to Ihalainen, in the line presented by Mr Petter Orpon (Kok.), tax reductions are mainly about protecting and increasing purchasing power, since next year wages are not increased.
He says that tax reduction has a positive impact on purchasing power and employment if other issues do not increase people's uncertainty.
Ihalainen welcomes the desire of Prime Minister Juha Sipila (middle) and Orpo's messages to respect the competitiveness agreement reached at times.
He says that holding the contract is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy action in the government term.
It has been done with the power of social partners, so it must not be questioned.
It will be needed because the economy is so much for domestic demand and for people's own future.
In the event of prolonged unemployment
An individual appeals to the government that it would take on long-term unemployment in the budget line, at least to stop its growth.
In June, long-term workers were about 17 000 more than one year earlier.
He says that if growth is not stopped, the government's objective of rising employment rate is to 72% run away.
He warns that if the long-term unemployment challenge is ignored, the permit has a very large social fall.
Ambassador: There are no Finnish victims in Thailand’s attacks
At least four people died in the bombings that took place in Thailand last night and last night in Finland.
The Embassy urges Finns in the country to observe and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
The Finnish tourists who are going to be in Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but it is worth following the precautionary instructions of the embassy, says Westphalen.
In Thailand very few Finns
According to Westphalen, very few Finns are currently in Thailand, although it is difficult to assess their exact number.
The Thai travel period of Finns is up to one year.
The vast majority of Thai tourists come from southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after bombing.
The Embassy has tried to reach Finns in Hua Hin in particular in order to obtain information on the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town right now.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No information on the factor
According to Westphalen, there's not yet any information on the impactor.
The Ambassador believes that the events may be a Constitution for the political unrest of the divided society in Thailand and for the last week's referendum on the military train.
The Act was adopted in a referendum.
The referendum was not an open, democratic process.
People who reported opposition to the law were arrested in the country, among other things.
In the southernmost regions of Thailand, the ethnic-citizen conflict associated with the Muslim population, says Westphalen.
Muslims want to increase their sovereignty.
However, earlier attacks have not been extended to tourist destinations.
It's a big local holiday in Bangkok today, says Westphalen.
He says that the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day are celebrated in the city.
Traffic in the city is very little.
The impact on the day would have a profound impact on the safety of the authorities.
Thailand Police: In school it is not about international terrorism
According to the police, the attacks are local sabotage and differ from conventional terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been excluded, says the Thai police news office according to AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have died during the 24 hours when 11 bombs have exploded across the country, such as in the popular Phuket and Hua Hin.
In the popular tourist destination of Finns, the holiday island in Phuket exploded four bombs at night, reports the Thai newspaper Bangkok Post.
According to current information, they did not require death victims.
Two of the bombs blew up by the paper at Strong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where according to the magazine one person was wounded.
The popular tourist destination in Hua Hin, according to local authorities, has exploded four bombs yesterday and today.
At least one was killed in both double bombs.
In addition, at the village of Surat Than and in the town of Trang, at least one bomb exploded.
At least one person died in both attacks.
Surat Thani is also familiar with many tourists, for through it they are transported to Ko Samuin, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao Holiday Island.
The factor of the impact is unknown
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the warden of the military regime in Thailand is not yet known.
Bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We should not let people panic any more, he said to the journalists.
According to Gen Prawitz Wongsuwan, the Deputy Prime Minister responsible for Security, at least the attacks of Hua Hin and Trang are connected.
He told Thai BSB that the purpose of the factors was to destroy the country's tourism because all the attacks have occurred in tourist destinations.
The Finnish Embassy calls on Finnish people in the country to observe and avoid the most urgent tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
The Finns who are going to go to Thailand have no reason to cancel their trip because of the explosions, but it is worth following the precautionary instructions, says Westphalen.
In wounded Europeans
The attacks and victims of Finland during the night are known very little so far.
Last night's hit in Hua Hin has been given a little more information.
It killed a local woman and wounded more than 20 others, including at least nine foreign tourists.
There are at least German, Italian, Dutch and Austrian among the wounded.
At Hua Hin's last attack, at least three people were wounded.
Two bombs blew up the bell tower that was known to be visible.
Thai PBS tells us that the police have isolated Hua Hin into the area where they believe they have found another bomb.
Dead Than bomb was hidden under the governor of the county.
In the attack, the municipal worker died.
There's at least one wounded.
The chief of police interviewing CNN says that two bombs were also used in Surat Than's attack, which exploded at about half an hour.
According to Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The U.S. Party won the women's four fight
The U.S. Alexandra Raisman was the second point at 60.098 and Russia Alija Mustafina's third on 58.665 points.
Biles, 18, is still looking for tennis championships in Rio's competitions with permanno, jumps and booms.
Biles has managed women's exercise to a large extent over the last few years.
He had eight personal World Championships from the last three years.
He has won the four-to-one championships he won three times in a row, and last and next year.
In the U.S. team, Biles has achieved two teams of world championships.
It's hotter MM-metals for Biles with a jump and a boom.
Thailand Finnish entrepreneur: \"The person has no influence on tourism –
In Thailand Phuket, Esa Huovila, a real estate agency and children’s play club in the same property, is not concerned about the impact of Thai bomb attacks on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I do not believe that this will result in anything more wonderful, assess Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur in Asia for about twenty years.
The experienced entrepreneur has seen close to many tragedys in Thailand.
There's always something here.
First there was a tsunami, then an avian influenza, and last year a bomb attack in Bangkok.
Even if these past ones haven't escaped tourists, it's hardly this either.
Huovila's company's office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
Huovila heard from her own employee.
A worker called about nine local times and said he shouldn't come to the office.
Huovila says that both the ranch and the main street of Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to attacks.
Many of my local workers came to work this morning as usual.
They thought that the roads had been set up for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says and refers to Friday's celebration in Thailand.
The Patong tunnel was calm and the main blind movements were allowed to open about 10 o’clock at local time.
A lot of people on the beach had never even heard of the blows.
In half three days, Thailand’s time at Patong was normalized and much of the stores had opened their doors.
Based on the attack site, the explosion has been pretty small, says Huovila at the scene.
Later, this car was seen in the Kruunupy with Jouxholmint.
When the police got there, the car was set on fire.
The patrol found two men suitable for a description hidden in a nearby six.
Another man got caught right away.
The other one ran away, but the man was later found in the woods with the help of a police dog.
Men are suspected of the theft, theft and gross damage of the motor vehicle.
The police thank you for the clues.
Research Director on Russian leadership changes: Clear deportation
On Friday, a high-value leadership change was made in Russia over the years when President Vladimir Putt fired the head of his administration, Mr Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is a viroid 44-year-old Anton Vato.
He's an ex-graduate and he's been working as Ivanov's second-man.
Kangaspuro says that the reason for the release of Ivanov may be Putin's desire to prevent strong people around him from gaining too much power.
He adds that the recycling of management tasks is one of the ways in which power is used.
This is a way of preventing people from colluding with the president's independent power for themselves.
According to Kangaspuro, it is also possible that Ivanov has been caught or screwed with other directors.
Assembled Ivanoville
Ivanov, a member of the Putin's internal border, is moving to specific tasks in environmental and transport matters.
By means of a tape presented by the national media, Putin referred to the amendment as a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to other assignments and proposed a return to the Nano, told Russia Today.
Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's point of view, this is a clear drop in position.
Environmental and transport matters are not very high in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the top of Russian power.
In addition, Ivanov has played an important role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in KGB.
He was considered to be a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that old maps, such as governors, have recently been exchanged in Russia.
The older researcher, Katri Pynnöniem of the Foreign Policy Institute, says that it is more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's place is that Putin will change his immediate circle younger.
Isis fighters used civilians as a human shield in Syria.
They used civilians as a human shield to flee to the city of Jarabulus in order not to target them, said Sherfa Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, civilians were placed in hundreds of cars where they were taken to Jarabulus.
The Arab and Kurdishists received about 90% of the important city of Manbij last week.
It is estimated that tens of jihadists were left in the city at that time.
The corrected news was corrected at 7:30 p.m.: We were wrong to tell you that the civilians were running from the city, and the Isis fighters actually kidnapped civilians when they fled the city.
Professor: Legality of the Ministry of Interior is illegal
According to Professor Tomi Voutilainen of Public Law at the University of Eastern Finland.
The Voutilainen says to the STT that it cannot be based on the authority's own policies but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior previously refused to give the list of participants of the interior minister's opportunities to Ilta-Sanom.
The Minister justified the decision with the guidance of the Government's Office and the fact that the information had been entered in the Minister's calendar and not in the accounts.
The Minister's Communication Director tells STT that there is a need for a reform of practices at the Ministry.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show starts in Rio
Like last few years, Bolt's been running against time under valuables.
He violated his cover from the early days and had to leave the Olympic Games in Jamaica.
This has not been the perfect preparation, but I'm in a much better condition.
I've been practicing well and it's the key issue, and Bolt said at his press conference in Rio.
That press conference included small-scale samba dancers and fans who became fans.
Porina Bolt is surrounded by a footnote that the Jamaican star has risen in the period when the general sport has fought with doping scandals and a loose interest.
Bolt's previous defeat in the Olympic Games came to Athens in 2004, when he hurried out at the beginning of the 200-foot race at 21.05.
At that time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young promise to slow down the injuries and loose your training weapon.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began at a hundred meters, in which he crushed the world record and the independence of competitors in the time of 9,69.
This is harder than this.
A year later, at the Berlin World Cup, Bolt reached his career at the jurisprudence clock.
World record in Berlin at 9.58 hundreds and 19.19 two hundred are still in force.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is pursuing 200 meters of world record and 19 seconds of service, but no one but Bolt believes in its birth.
Sassala Bolt's very challenging is Athens 2004 100 Olympic winner Justin Gatlin.
Last year in the Beijing MM-final, Bolt defeated the American with only one hundred seconds.
During his reign in Beijing, Bolt has not been lost in the finale of the valuables once if he has only made his way.
In Daegu 2011, the 100th MM-final left Bolt without running because of the lightning spill.
Bolt will fill in for a long week after 30.
He's an old man in a young man's species, and Rio's races are his last Olympics.
The last finish line of career, Bolt, has set the next year's World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics who separate me from others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm under, I remind myself: this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago at the Sports Illustrated interview.

Phelps can't stop any historical gold from coming into the screen style
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, Michael Phelps, U.S.A., was swimming in the 22nd Olympics in Rio.
Michael Phelps has already won 22 Olympics.
At the same time, Phelps was the first swimmer to reach the same species’s Olympic Games in the fourth consecutive competitions.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54,66.
Japan’s Kosuke Hagino settled in confusion until China’s Wang Shun.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, but Helen Skelton of the BBC Olympics is laughing at the ants interview in the East Magazine.
Helen Skelton (oik.) on Monday is one of the most listed pages of this week on the website of the newspaper.
Next to the commentator, Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton doesn't have much stress if the somessa or the British press have a small spot on his exposed and special costumes.
The TV is a visual media, he's stressed.
Skelton's dressed in high-level shoes and has a dress that must have at least enough visibility - at least for the eyes of a number of conservative British soldiers.
However, the back steps are not allowed.
It's important to look good, and little cases are just a funny thing.
I'm sure Skelton will want to scare you, and maybe he'll be ashamed, but he's pressing that he doesn't want to be in the main role.
It's not about me, he says.
We're here watching sports, and the focus must be on athletes.
It shouldn't matter how I dress.
Can you imagine the case has reached Finland?
I can't, but everything that pays attention to how hard these swimmers are doing and how big sacrifices they're making is for me, Skelton's cheering up.
You know what?
It's a pain in the ass if it comes from dressing (a driver).
I'm just a little amused if this is someone's radar hit me.

The wind of Pejó-Sire was on Thursday.
The lady of Argentina dressed Tuuli Pejari-Siren on Thursday at the women's surfing day opening in Rio.
The wind was clearly broken.
The defendant admitted a breach.
He was stuck because of the cholari, and the others ran away, the Finnish head coach Joakim Wilenius told me.
The athlete thought of protest for a long time.
It wasn't worth doing, then, because it would have been useless according to the Olympics' rules.
I should have dropped into the water so I could have been credited, Pető-Siren said.
The Finnish was hanging on his desk until the last time he didn't want to get into Rio's dirty water.
The Finnish became 27nd place with the cholari.

7 specific issues which, according to science, extend age
Science has studied everything possible between the earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to bring extra years to the life of a person.
Some things include ways that affect the health of a person, whether directly or indirectly, in such a way that his life is extended.
Once again, things that a person cannot influence can bring him extra years.
Such are, inter alia, a tendency to central body fat or social status.
Regular shopping can extend age.
You don't always have to cut it, you know, just get a milk can.
Long-term secrets have been sought to solve many different studies.
Medical Daily presented seven strangeest research results.
According to science, all these things can bring more years of life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee drink has been shown to protect against certain types of cancer, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease.
The study at Harvard University noted that moderate coffee consumption is linked to the risk of reduced death, particularly with regard to neurological or cardiac diseases.
Once again, on behalf of alcohol, there are studies that suggest that the use of a courtroom - one of the three days - may extend life.
For example, one found that wine drinkers were older than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of a toothache can extend the life of a person even for more than six years, one study says.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents infection.
They can help to break up other diseases in other parts of the human body.
The study in Norway showed how laughing affected the lives of man.
Over 54 000 people were watched by the project that lasted seven years.
Those who laughed more were 35% more likely to survive after the experiment ended.
Sex, when sexual protection is taken into account, many studies show that health benefits.
In addition, it can extend age.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
In order for a person to have extra years of life, he should also get an orgasm.
Mobility will bring additional years, and it will not be disputed.
However, reaching a long age does not require an absolute solvency.
A study at Oxford University found that women with a large back, cholesterol levels were lower.
They also had more omega-3 fatty acids in their body.
The same investigation brought these issues into the lower mortality rate.
It was then a athlete or an actor who won the Olympic medallion, who is more likely to live longer than usual bully.
A lot of research has been trying to find a reason for this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that brings his life back to years.
Some researchers, on the other hand, suspect that the social status of a person is the result of a long-term age, which, for its part, enables, for example, the pursuit of recognitions such as the Nobel Prize.
A study to determine the behaviour of shopping more than 65 years old found that a person who was shopping every day was likely to become older than those who were shopping less frequently.
This is due to the fact that circulation in specific stores reduces loneliness.
It has again been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may precipitate death.
So count your credit card from your hand - online shopping has no effect.

On Friday night, there was a serious truck and a nocchallenge in the passenger car.
The accident occurred in Koske, mid-Friday between Kosken and Sorvaston.
The truck had been driving in the direction of Forssa, when the passenger car who had received it was on the same lane, hitting the right corner of the truck.
After the crash, the truck fell on its lane, but it started to burn.
The driver managed to shut down the fire himself.
The passenger car fell in the stream and then passed over the door to the roof.
The woman who carried the passenger car in 1972 remained in her car.
The Rescue Institute removed the injured driver from the car and was transported to the University of Turku Hospital.
The results of the female blow test were 2.02 promilla.
He's suspected of a gross rat drink.
The mail sent bulk boxes to the wrong city.
At Salon K-Citymarket, there were flaws in the box selection because the mail had delivered part of the load to the Walloon by accident.
Teija Halti, who lived in Pernisö, was on Thursday to buy depots from Salon K-Citymarket when she hit a funny sign in her eyes.
Unfortunately, there's a product shortage in the ivy because the Posti delivered our load to the Walloon!
We'll get more when Posti gets delivered!
So if you don't break in the lawn bowl, it's locked in the sign.
The sticky sign of the merchant is linked to the expansion of Posti's services last spring in order to touch lawns.
Ruohonlekukukuku is on the Post offer until the end of August.
According to Haltia, the sign was mostly amusing and he decided to share it in social media.
The popularity of the update hit me in the attic.
Media representatives have also been calling all the time, and the attention that has been raised is incredible, Halti wonders.
On Friday night, Halltia's update had more than 700 distributions on Facebook.
Haltia got her own favorites caught in a box of chandeliers, even though a few camps were empty.
The Jaakko Kaides, who was responsible for the operation of the transport services of Posti Company, was sorry for the damage to Ilta-Sanonom.
The background is that the three of the five sets were lost in the wrong place yesterday (Sinajoki) and we were no longer going to do the partial delivery (Saloon) on three, but we only took five stage today, Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanonom.
It was the first night of the evening news.
You know, you know, you know, Halti didn't get upset by the sign because she found out that she'd pick up all her own looseware.

I get the strength and zeal of your images when you're on the same road, the other one tells me.
In the spring, Lotta dropped the last kilos to make it now on a project.
At that time, he told the newspaper he wanted to finally get into a normal weight of 10 kilos.
In three months of a gymnastics, five pounds fell.
Wishing for a family of a woman murdered by a coward: Remembering the victim for the benefit of police dogs
A week ago, the family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Lovava, hopes that the victim would be remembered by a donation for police work instead of flowers and aggressives.
The Sipoo Animal Health Agency has published a Facebook update in which it conveys the victim's family's wish for donations for police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute at the Sipoo Veterinary Centre and that he had also completed his training there.
The veterinarian's office will remember with words that touch a woman.
Happy, smart, sense of humor and work in fear.
Good friend.
We still can't fully understand that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money goes to police dogs as a whole, primarily to the acquisition of secure links.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old local woman was murdered in her own house in Lovada's Koskenkyly.
The female neighbors have said that the victim of the evening newspaper was very animal-rich.
He owned several animals, including horses, dogs, cats, hens and cocks.
A 27-year-old man with a murder suspect didn't know a woman and they had no contact with each other.
The killer's tracking was accompanied by a police dog Börje, who was life-threateningly wounded in the arrest situation.
But Börje survived, and he's recovering.
The Court of Justice sent Post a judgment on the infringement of the Act of Equality
The post had no right to arrest the employee who refused to familiarise with the temporary staff, to assess the right of the judge of Kanta-Häme in his judgment.
Posti was ordered to pay most of the paid employee and EUR 2 000 as compensation for discrimination.
According to the judgment, the Posti could have arrested only a part of his salary, which was responsible for the whole day's work.
According to the Court of Justice, the employee had been placed in a less favourable position on the basis of his trade union activity, contrary to the equality law.
The employer had complied with the decision of the Union for Postal and Logistics concerning the ban on training.
During the last November post office, the PAU decided that Post workers would not be familiar with renting workers who broke the strike.
It's the first thing you've told me about the Kansas News.
Turkey's return to the path of respect for human rights
Turkey must return to the path of democratic and human rights respecting development, write Prime Minister Juha Sipil (middle) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps.) in his response to the Journalist Union.
Prime Minister Juha Sipil (medium) and Foreign Minister Timo Soini (ps) agree on the human rights situation in Turkey.
In his previous letter to Sipil and Soini, the Federation of Journalists asked for their concerns for Turkey's freedom of expression and press freedom.
Sipilä and Soini repeatedly tell Finland that the importance of freedom of the press and expression has been highlighted by Turkey.
Putin fired the chief of his administration in his place as a virtuous Naso
Russian President Vladimir Putin has resigned the head of the presidential administration, Sergei Ivanov, reports the Kreml.
The situation will be the son-in-law of the Soviet-Viro Communist leader, Karl Vaano, Anton Vaano.
The persecution is a 44-year-old former diplomat who has been Deputy Head of the President's Administration since 2012.
It will also be a member of the Russian Security Council, says Interfax News Office.
Vladimir Putin fired his administration to the chief.
According to the Kreml report, the Ivanov, which is a member of the deep internal border of Putin, will be transferred to specific tasks in environmental and transport matters.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had asked for a transfer to another task and proposed the Nano to replace it, says Russia Today.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet Union in spying on KGB.
Many considered Ivanov to be a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed president in 2011 before Putin re-elected in 2012.
The BBC: Tossing ManU to a game ban... can't be seen in the opening of Valoliiga
You can't see a football player in the field when England's Valoliga kicks into the weekend.
Paul Pongba's ban was followed by England.
As a result of Paul Pogba's play ban, Manchester United's acquisition is on the website of ManU against Bournemouth on Sunday, told BBC on Friday.
According to the British media, ManU paid EUR 105 million for the Italian Seura Pogba.
However, the England Football Association FA keeps him out of play because Pogba was a burden on Juvenile.
He received two warnings in the Italian cup last season, and it becomes one game ban.
That game ban has been transferred to England, FA told BBC.
Pongban's next staff is on the second round of the league on 19 August, when ManU meets Southampton.
At Flow, the big-time madness is a virtue
The exact criteria and ambitious visions of entertainment have established the position of Flow Festival as an internationally respected event, marked by the world’s world’s top artists.
Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
Festar diggers have typically expressed themselves by wearing their own clothes.
One of the main artists is the punk-legenda Iggy Pop this year.
The Flow Festival event area is set with artificial grass and art installation.
It has never been enough for us to have just a head and a bow, says the artistic leader of the event Tuomas Kallio.
The Flow Festival, which will take place in Suvilahde Helsinki this weekend, has grown from a small block festival to events of tens of thousands of visitors.
There is a simple question behind success: In what event would the authors themselves want to go?
It's pretty different in the production of events that we think this way.
Often, the goal is to achieve the level of necessity and act in accordance with the rules of authority, says Tuomas Kallio, the artistic director of the event.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would come to the end of this year.
The aim has been to raise the number of 70,000 visitors last year with 5 000 people.
Some interesting domestic and foreign artists are also seen here today.
The increase in the number of visitors is a good thing, because there is a way to fund it in some way.
On the other hand, we do not want to grow too much because, at some point, the mass would be like a flock of cattle that is directed in a vast way.
That's not what we want.
Over 13 years, the ideologicals of a successful event have been embroidered in such a way that 130 performers, art engineers and numerous restaurant points and drink bars have been partially shattered.
In addition to the main and smaller stage ships, 15 000 tents operate this year.
Kallio admits that the event could be carried out in a simpler way.
Maybe I'm a little bit of a big deal, but at the same time, we've been able to keep Flow's life.
If you lose it, this isn't our case anymore.
The greatest joy and reward for doing this is that today’s great visions are practically possible.
During the early 2000s, activities were very dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki for some EUR 20 000.
Last year, the net sales of Flow's share company amounted to approximately EUR 6 million.
It enables you to do things like the construction of that 73-metre tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves by wearing their own clothes.
In addition to the musical event, trendy young adults can be discussed in the community.
However, the event has not been clearly profiled as a particular form of fashion.
We want to break up, above all, with content.
Yet fashion phenomena also fit Flow’s dignity: curiosity and desire to interact with the environment, says Kallio.
This year, one of the main artists is the legend of a bunch, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
A man has a huge fan group in his own gene, but he does not have it the most typical performer with Indian music, pop music, flute and solo.
According to Kallio, Iggy was failed because it is probably the last time we see this on the job in Finland.
We are interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what's on the commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good, and in recent years he's done a hell of a good job.
The bombings on Thailand's tourist paradise were hidden in the flower bags... the tourists fled in their horrors.
At Hua Hin, there were two bombs on Thursday night.
At least one local woman died in the attack and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs had apparently been hidden in the flower suit and exploded with the help of the cell phones.
The bombs were placed on the street, most of whose customers are foreigners.
They were exploded at the same time that tourists started leaving bars and returning to their hotels, told the police representative of Samomer Yoosumran CNN.
From 1989, a wild animal protector, Edwin Wiek, who lived in Asia, referred to a much-blown picture of the attacks.
If the TV doesn't look good, you can look at it right here.
At least 11 foreign tourists were injured in Hua Hin.
The people ran against me and said that the bomb had exploded at the bars.
It happened in one of the biggest bars, told Swedish tourists Emelie Olsson Aftonbladet.
The next morning, the local time exploded two bombs at Surat Than.
At least one died.
The number of wounded is not yet known.
Very soon after this, even the Finns popular on Phuket Island blew up two bombs.
No one's knownly dead.
At the same time, a second double bomb attack was made in Hua Hin.
At least one died and three were wounded.
Also, one bomb exploded in the town of Trang.
The police told me that they found at least one bomb in Hua Hin, which had not yet been able to explode.
According to the Thai authorities, there are likely to be rebel forces behind the bombings that are not satisfied with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
According to the local authorities, it may also be criminal organisations.
According to Aftonbladet, the police have recently taken action by criminal organisations engaged in trafficking in human beings.
KSML: This part of the new standby forces will begin in a military situation first to fight.
In an acute military situation, the armed forces will only be ordered after several months of swearing the military light, says the Central Finnish.
According to the Secretary of Defence Training, Prime General Jukka Sonninen, for example, 5,5 months of service in the military situation, only those who are at the end of their training are capable of fighting.
According to the Head of Education, the service is first assigned to reserve owners belonging to the standby forces.
No backup or reserve owner shall be assigned a task without required training, says Sonnninen.
In the past summer, it appeared that the Defence Forces will begin to train backups for immediate preparedness units next year.
When necessary, units may be used for military action already during military training.
Pamela Tola got a big replacement from homehouse.
Actor Pamela Tola and his ex-husband, Pauli Waroma, have won the rough dispute from the apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The sale price of a double house had been EUR 330 000.
However, after trade, there was a serious problem of moisture in the house that caused dangerous microbial growth to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in 2014.
The sale price had dropped to EUR 132 000, so the financial loss to Tola and Waroma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple took the case to court and requested a discount from the seller.
The salesman denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the cart and the courtroom.
The court brought the judgment on the case on Wednesday.
It was in force for a judgment of the District Court which ordered the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for a discount.
In addition, the seller will have to pay a total of EUR 47 344 for the costs of legal and judicial proceedings.
The right to adjudicate a little because some of the household repair needs had already been known to the purchasers when making the dwelling.
The apparent construction errors, however, were significantly more serious than those presented, according to court law.
Tola was looking for a home of good fortune.
Tola told me in court that the couple had specifically sought a home of good fortunes because they did not want to take repairs.
He was born with the idea that the building was built in good condition and that there was no harm to the points mentioned in the rehabilitation report.
The Court’s report referred to the risks and disadvantages of ventilation and the lack of adequate management of rain and melting waters along the rock mines.
However, it was not apparent from the discussions that it would have been a matter of urgency.
Tola and Waroma realized that the rainwater from the rock might have to be slightly controlled within a few years.
Trades were made in October 2009.
Within a few years, it appeared that the humidity problems in the apartment were much more serious than thought.
In the audit carried out in 2012 and 2013, the building found microbial growth, which according to the Witnesses were due to both the rainfalls of the rock and the capillary rise of the land.
On the west side of the house, the air that was contaminated by microbes could, according to the inspector's assessment, be released through the receipt to the indoor premises.
There was a well-equipped homecare room, a basement staircase, a living room window manager and a basement washing room that enables health risks, limit values or skis.
The blades were built without permission
The Court also contested whether the dwelling had been expanded against the permit.
The Court considered that Tola and Waroma were not aware of the decision taken by the City of Espoo before the trade, according to which the permit had been made against the permit.
Among other things, the terraces had been built, even though there were no appropriate permits yet.
However, home problems were central to justice.
On the basis of the information received from the seller before the sale, according to the court’s right, buyers could assume that the building was suitable for living as such and that there was no need for measurable repairs in the near future.
Tola and Waromah felt that there was no particular reason to carry out a broader inspection.
The parties have not failed to explain their obligations, but the court observes in its judgment.
Karma archives: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to have children in the Nazis - also Finns in the register
In his recent article of Dagens Nyheter, journalist Christopher Anderson writes how the National Archives in Maryland, the United States, have recorded documents on microfilms, covering a total of 218,500 women who all wanted to marry SSmen.
Most women are German, but they also involve Americans, French, Dutch and Russian.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegians and 14 Finnishs and 31 Swedish women wanted to become Nazism.
The documents and registration cards are originating from the racial office in Nazi Germany.
The racial office was under Heinrich Himmler, SS Director.
No SS man was allowed to have children in Nazi Germany until he had been examined by a SS doctor.
The same applies even more to women who had to be able to bear up to 10 children.
According to Anderson, women were subjected to gynaecological studies to investigate the matter.
Among other things, the Rotu agency examined women's backgrounds by studying church books.
The purpose was to ensure that there were no Jews in the women's family.
Women also had to be prepared to give up their Swedish citizenship and to give the racial office a handbooked life stories and good recommendations from the close.
The Rotu agency wanted guarantees that women were very rich, very wealthy, and good national socialists, who were very German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as bride for SS men.
There is no record of the 14 Finns found in the archive documents.
The SS leaders created a program supported by the State, known as Lebensborn, in 1936.
The programme provided for inter alia that each SS person should have four children, either in marriage or outside of marriage.
Lebensborn homes take care of children born outside marriage and their mothers.
However, the programme was not very actively promoted, but the pages of the U.S. holocaust museum are reported.
Instead, Nazi population policy focused on family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by providing loans and support for children.
A German mother's honour was granted to women who had received at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between the Aryans and non-Aryans were legally prohibited, says on the pages of the museum.
The sixth of the beast-Siren, Nirkko rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko was placed in the third sails of the Finnjollian Day's first visit to Rio's Olympic Games, but remained a whole set of tails on the second day leaving.
Nirkko rose to eight times after five departures, but the failure of the second departure dropped him to 14th place.
The wind of Pejõri-Siren fought at the departures of RS:X class days 17 and three.
In the overall situation, Pejó-Siren is six.
In the 470 class, Jonah and Niklas Lindgren remained at the opening school of the day 23.
In the overall situation, the Lindgrens are in place 19.
Jari Sillanpään Satulin was recorded at the night of a couple of hours: \"I was so in the trunk...
Jari Sillanpää has been part of Finnish favorite artists for over 20 years.
From the cruise ship's barmaid to the thong of 1995, Finland's best sold soloartist as well as the star of dance ships and festivals, Sillanpää continues to be snooped and is at present at a whirlwind.
The book Jari Sillanpää, written by Mari Koppinen, was published today on Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells of her life and career in as good as evil.
The career of the head of the bridge rose to a total rise in his victory in the Tangokuin krona in the Tango market in 1995.
In the race, Sillanpää sang tanks, but he had already designed a little different music for himself.
In the spring of 1995 Jukka Kuoppamäki had written a tank with a slightly different shape at the request of the Sillanpää man.
One of the most popular pieces of Finnish music history was the Satulinna item.
The book says, however, that the recording of the songs did not go exactly according to the plans: The head of the bridge sang it on a tape in a terrible crash and only after a few hours' sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so in the trunk!
The head of the eye remembers in the book.
A great hit about the tatilation of a song would not immediately think it was sang in a hangover.
Although I wasn't at my best physically, it was still good.
I learned that it is not necessary all the time to insist on being perfect and perfect.
Another occurrence related to the most popular pieces of man, which is mentioned in the book, occurred almost twenty years later.
In 2013, Sillanpää resigned from her sillo partner and the case finally ended up in the texts of the gold box, which was published as single in 2014.
The book says that the songs ordered from Sarah’s Sõmäs were not as much as Sillanpää would have wanted.
The head of the bridge had imagined that he was making a record that tells the truth about his own life, but the words of the copy telling the difference were not true, but it was written on the basis of the news of 7 days.
In the news of the newspaper, Jar and the ex-serious distinction were explained as the reason for Jar's excessive celebration and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was a full Santa Claus and did not keep it in place.
According to the book, Jari called the record and refused to sing the song, but eventually ended up singing it and good.
In June, too, the British surprised themselves by voting out their kingdom from the EU.
Finally, 52% of the voters were in favour of the difference and 48% would have remained in the Union, even if the voting week's opinion measurements predicted the opposite result.
The British economis and economic institutions were almost unanimous in the EU.
No respected research institute or university flagged for the difference, although a few individual researchers were allowed to disagree with the power current of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the theme of the former President of the United States Bill Clinton election campaign, \"It's the economy, stupid,\" flew to the collapse of the British Brexit vote.
The Economis were shocked when their voice wasn't.
They were shocked when the economy did not seem to be the most important political issue.
The Economic Cheharan language
The Centre for Macroeconomics is playing in the latest monthly interviews with a professional experience in response to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that the economs and the voters did not listen because this time the voters decided on non-economic grounds.
One explanation for the loss of economic position is that people do not understand the economy.
Many still have the impression that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people employed, which is almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's off the right British side.
Many also have the idea that a fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it promotes the export industry.
In the opinion of the Economiscist, the voters did not believe the economic arguments, as the consensus of the economis did not sufficiently raise.
In particular, they were discouraged by the BBC's equality, which provided equal room for only a few percent of the economic scientists in favour of the European economist, as well as the overwhelming majority.
It was not interested in telling the EU's hostile press what IFS, IFM, BoE, CEPR and LSE and other economic masterpieces were concerned about the consequences of the difference.
Those far-reaching book combinations spoke face-to-face about economic growth, trade relations, government debt and currency.
And if the economis' messages were both listened and understood, they were not transmitted because the economists represent an elite with which the voters do not have common interests.
The academics like economists would have remained in the EU, but in small cities and rural areas the message was not effective.
Immigration is also a economy
The overwhelming victory argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
Immigrant takes your job, Immigrant drags your hospital, Immigrant uses you.
These arguments worked.
Every coffee shop has foreign workers.
How much more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every waiting room at the health centre sees immigrants.
How much easier would the British have medical days if they weren't there?
There are children in every school, including immigrants.
How much easier would the real British children get to school if they got rid of them?
Each municipality has foreign residents.
How much more space would it be if they were gone?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
However, the Economists failed to respond to them and, if they did succeed, their answers did not receive visibility.
Economists failed to explain that, thanks to immigrants, the British have more jobs, fewer health centres and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU migrants - are the net contributors of British public finances and their consumption will create jobs.
Aberdeen's real estate fund was reserved for Brexi in cash.
One of the funds was Aberdeen Acet Management, whose real estate investments are the Finnish Pertti Vanhanen.
According to him, Aberdeen was booked in time for Brex to draw up plans A and B.
A few weeks before the vote, in case the result was no, was put to the profit of plan B, or an EU-wide camp.
As a matter of fact, investors would start to withdraw their funds from the market.
Real estate funds normally do not have large amounts of liquid assets, but they could now be necessary.
We went to raise cash.
When Brexit happened on day 23, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid funds, Vanhanen says the only open-ended day of Aberdeen's estate fund, which was the subject of the news.
According to the old man, the normal level would be between 15 and 20 per cent.
At that time, the fund was worth HUF 3.5 billion.
The total value of the company's funds is about 20 billion pounds.
It was the highest in nine open real estate funds, says Vanhanen of all the open real estate funds of the British real estate funds.
He estimates that the lowest amount of cash in these funds was 10% or even below it.
Thus, real estate funds were earmarked for Brexit in a very different strategic way.
The funds closed the trade
When the camp in favour of the difference in the EU won, Europe got confused.
However, few weeks after the vote on the real estate market were quite calm, says Vanhanen.
Then there were two things that changed the situation.
The first was Mark Carney, President of the Bank of England, where he estimated that Brexit could be a major risk for commercial real estate operators.
In addition to real estate funds, Standard Life, he frozen his trade.
These together robbed the situation and raised it to the main interests of the Financial Times and BBC.
The situation was immediately compared to 2007 and 2008, says Vanhanen.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained calmer, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started to spin, and the fund had to close its doors.
The situation in Aberdeen was good because of the cash collected, but it finally had to freeze its trade for six days.
According to the old man, they did not really close the trade, but changed the pricing down.
In practice, investors were given time to consider whether money should now be pulled out of panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you don't have to take your money out now, it won't be worth it, because it would result in losses.
It calmed down, and most of them canceled the announcement.
It has been quite even since then, and now the market has been very calm for a few weeks, says Vanhanen.
He points out, for example, that there has been no similar crash in the Manner-Europe funds of Aberdeen.
But there was a lot of questions.
Unsatisfied attention to real estate funds
According to the old man, the closures of real estate funds were taking an excessive amount of attention.
Open funds, which were closed, account for about four percent of British property.
The Aberdeen lock lasted six days, and the company sold less than ten properties out of 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it might hold its funds for 2017.
At present there is uncertainty in the air and economic growth forecasts have been narrowed down, but the situation does not seem more severe to Aberdeen.
The major issues are now about the future development of the British national economy.
Despite uncertainty, the situation has brought some real estate investors even new opportunities, Vanhanen notes.
The price and the dollar exchange rate are at its lowest price for 30 years, and there is also a 15% discount on the market compared to the pre-Brexit vote.
The dollar player can now buy the same property at up to 30% lower.
There's a lot of willing buyers, Vanhanen says.
Brexit brought mines to the London real estate market
At two o'clock in the morning, the situation didn't look so much like that.
But at four, when Pertti Vanhanen, who was responsible for the real estate investments of Aberdeen Asset Management, rose up again to look at the results of the Brexit vote, the situation was another.
That's where you got it.
I realized that this is going to plan B, and Vanhanen says in his second home in Helsinki.
He was headed to work right away.
London City was already completely alive despite the morning night.
At the office, the TV tracks that were normally set out to be silent supported the news, and usually the silent people were completely silent when Prime Minister David Cameron entered the camera this morning to tell us about his difference.
When the market opened, the display choices were just red.
It was the morning that he never thought he was alive, says Vanhanen.
It is not for this reason that, despite myllery, Aberde, one of the largest real estate funds in Britain, ended on the day following the Brexit vote, which is, by chance, two real estate stores.
The feeling was confused.
However, the company was well equipped for an alternative, and that is why the situation was kind of peaceful, says Vanhanen.
Brexit vote started on repair
The vote was followed by a storm.
It broke down. The British leadership went on the switch.
The market started to anticipate severe falls on the British real estate market, and in particular in London.
London office accounts were expected to reach up to 20% of mines in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trade one after another.
Aberdeen did it for six days.
Now, the poison's cooled, but there's still some uncertainty in the air.
However, it does not look like the last summer holidays on the old man's face in Helsinki this week.
In his opinion, it is still too early to say much about what Brexit is following.
So much remains open: how the difference happens and how Scotland reacts to the situation, for example.
The development of the London real estate market has already been the first data.
The CBRE data on price developments cover about a third of the market.
According to them, prices of all London's real estate decreased by 3.3 per cent from June to July.
In London City office buildings, minus 6,1 per cent, Vanhanen is reading.
The figures are not so terrible, but they are monthly changes.
The monthly index was released in 1987 and only five months had fewer figures, says Vanhanen.
All equally large falls hit the 2007 and 2008 crisis years.
It is interesting, too, that Brexit was very quickly compared with the global economic crisis that started in Lehman and the US real estate market.
The old man feels that this is not a very good illustration, because now it is a domestic crisis in Britain.
There's another feeling.
The real estate market has not now seen panic sales such as that, but the willingness to sell liquidity to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
There's also a normal financial guarantee.
The repairs could have been in the face of any case.
As a matter of fact, he's not a miracle about the price correction... that could have been in the way of Brexit without him.
According to Aberdeen’s estimate, the prices of buildings in London and other parts of the world have been too high for many years.
For two years now, we have said that City and, in particular, offices are overrated, says Vanhanen.
So the fall began very high.
London's prices have been written up for four reasons, the Old List.
Britain's economy has grown strongly, the population of London is also growing.
The second big trend is that the real estate is the last class that is globalized, says Vanhanen.
New players from the Middle East and Asia have come to the market and more institutions and private investors are looking for real estate investments abroad.
London, known as the city, is an easy destination.
In addition, prices have fed low interest rates, for example, pension companies have had to look for returns on new ones.
This loan has been readily available - although, according to Vanhasen, debt shortages have now been used clearly less than during the boom prior to the crisis in 2008.
Turn it off, spread it out.
In London, the rise in prices was settled last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen also started to lighten its ownership in London, and last year he was a net salesman.
There was some kind of turn-out to be expected, and now it's here.
What from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, Vanhanen says.
He's not afraid to judge the future, but he says that there's hardly any rises in the promise.
The atmosphere suggests that there is a falling or even way forward.
The old man has already seen several moves up and down since 1988 in the real estate sector.
And he's still an optimist who thinks we're gonna find out what's going on.
If you're well prepared for risks, you're in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you've invested in a single market, it's too much for its victim.
If you've been scattered, the risks are also diverted, Vanhanen says.
The S Group begins to register shopping information in more detail
The S Group will soon know what you eat, as the Group of Commerce announced today that it would start collecting more accurate information on the purchases of its clients.
Up to now, when data have been collected for the final amount of the receipt, the group will start to dream about the products purchased at the beginning of May.
The S Group is coming here after Kesko, as the information on goods purchased with the plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to the CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
The product-specific information is collected with the consent of the customer and is used for marketing.
The most efficient channel is email.
Time has rarely been prohibited by the use of product information, Riitala says to the Economy House.
According to him, Kesko's not going to react to the S-Group's registration.
Kesko classifies its client already, according to the food purchases alone, to ten groups.
The classification shall be updated on a monthly basis.
Stock customers are also classified according to the number of purchases and the amount of money they use.
The information is used for the targeted marketing of the customer.
Product-specific purchase data are collected only from K-Group's own chains.
Partners such as Neste Oil do not give up their data.
Lidl Finland does not have a customer programme and is not on the agenda.
The Finnish Middle Market has its own Ykkösbonus stock customer programme, which can be found in the Electantalos, Siws and Euromarkets.
At present, we do not collect information at product or group level, we will remain at the final level of the receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made, and on the day, and the final amount of the customer receipt.
We haven't gone to that level like the K-Group or the S-Group, says commercial leader Anu Ora.
According to him, it is planned to reform the customer programme in the future, but the close trade will tell us about it later.
Ora does not, however, authorise the registration of product data.
Try at first
The SOK customer register and customer register have so far been relatively extensive.
In addition to personal and address information, basic information has also included occupation, education, housing and child birth years and previous personal data.
Persons belonging to the same economy and their roles are also registered.
The date and time, place, final amount of purchases and method of payment are recorded in the S-Etucard purchase.
In addition, the information provided by the S-bonus partners has been obtained from their cash systems.
From the beginning of May, product level purchase data will be stored in the Sokos and Emotion chains.
Instead, in S-markets, Prisms, Kodin Terro and ABC chains data are currently recorded at product group level.
For a longer time, customers have had the hopes that marketing could be more focused, says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of customer and partner activities of SOK.
The S-group says he'll inform his clients of the change.
These may prohibit the use of product-specific data for marketing purposes.
However, the data is stored in cats in any case, wanted it or not.
The applicant may check the information stored on the website of the S-Group.
For example, the cats are unable to access the data, to stress Saarikoski.
Video: Heila-litter is Tull's latest dog injury - the penis becomes the first explosive dog
The Black Labrador Outer’s kid is snooping five boxes of the same country at Helsinki Airport.
It will not go long when it is determined to sit next to the middle box.
The customs inspector Lassi Suntio will reward his Heila dog to play it with his favorite game.
From the box that Heila sat next to, there was a shattering seal on the square gas.
The flu is the first smell that Heila has been trained with, says Suntio, owner of Heila Dog.
Safety situation and access to online trade
Heila is the first dog specializing in the search for arms and explosives in Tull and is placed at the Helsinki Airport next year.
Work may take Heila and Suntion to other border crossing points and ports as needed.
However, the airport will be the main job for Heila, since the international security situation has changed because of the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The attacks in Paris and Brussels have resulted in measures in Tull and after the attacks have been confirmed, says Tulli’s inspector Mikko Grönberg.
The second access to training for weapons and explosives is to receive mail via the Helsinki Airport.
As a result of an increased Internet trade, up to 40 million mails are sent annually through the airport, including arms and explosives ordered abroad.
In recent years, the customs has made online shopping at Helsinki Airport, about 300 weapons, weapons parts, ammunition and explosives, as well as the discovery of their starting materials.
Heila is coming to work across Helsinki Airport.
It will investigate recorded baggage and mail.
There will be a great deal of benefits in the future when it can go through large container areas and spot areas that require more detailed research, says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of the test, Customs will assess whether arms and explosives will increase in the future.
Grönberg wishes to respond to the idea.
School with the Church
Heila-pennus training is coordinated by Tull's dog school in Kirkkonumme.
Suntio also attends training with Heila, with police and defense experts.
The police have a strong experience in training dogs and defense expertise on explosives.
Customs will decide together with other authorities what smells Heila will be taught to identify.
Heila will always be trained as necessary, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki Airport have Tullin's six drug dogs and a cash and drug dog Mass.
Labrador donor Heila has been chosen from a ten-adventurous puppy.
The selection criteria of the dog to be selected on the airport include a raid and a hunting visit, as well as a peaceful one, since the dog is involved with weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives at the home of Suntion, is a close associate to the customs inspector, but also a family member.
There's nothing without Heila to get home, Suntio laughs.
The fine-ass orders go to Heila for once.
The cameraman of the evening-Sanome will lose the camera's mike cover for the fast dog, but Heila will return the soft toy-looking shield from the instant-irti-command.
Work dog hard competition
Heila's initial training will be completed next year.
There are still level tests ahead, next in October, which assess whether training is sufficient for demanding work.
Heila can see jobs in Helsinki Airport next year if everything is planned.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot be able to iron the dog on top of the labor tapes, like Suntio.
The cost of one job dog is around EUR 60000 to 70000 per year.
Their working age is about seven to eight years, up to ten, after which they will retire to the care of their owners.
Working days may be long, from eight to ten hours, but active working shares last only ten minutes for two hours.
There's a lot of competition in Tull.
Heila's owner was about 20-30 Tull's employees.
Lucky hit Suntion, who has never had a job before, but has years of experience in dogs and control tasks in Tull.
The Ministry received its first Olympic medal - the people will have a day off
The Olympic Games in Fiji, less than a million inhabitants, are valued at the country's height so high that the government has appointed the 22th of August as a national holiday.
According to the Earth’s broadcasting company, the Fijian government confirmed the case when the championship was solved.
The day after the team's return, we'll have the day after that.
The hero team is also authorised to celebrate in their own country.
The Fiji Rugby Team is celebrating the championship.
The Guardian tells us that the finals were observed in the country in Suvala, where the scene had been set up.
Normally, only the Nazis are interested in rugby, but this game was united by our multicultural community.
Even the Chinese restaurants were watching the game, I heard them encouraging, said the Fiji Times supplier to Maikele Seru Guardian.
Drama in Rio - the Finnish winner passed out after the work
In his last attempt, Milko Tokola succeeded from 175 kg after a hard fight.
Tokola has a special and life-threatening feature as a lifter.
During or immediately after the cracks, he has passed out many times.
No one's really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola received 175 kilos of push and 145 kilos of hit.
His common result was 320 kilos.
Tokola tried to get her job in the last 175 pounds, as well as in the second.
With the third company, the weights rose as a result of a bitter scream.
The cranium was shaking under the weights until the jury accepted the raise.
The joy of the Finnish Creator was that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS acquired a viroist Prosan - Veikkausliiga - Ilta-Sanomat
The men's football player, Mr. Rovaniemen Palloseura, has concluded a long-term agreement with the Estonian eater Albert Prosa.
We're looking for our team's top player with the power and threshold to come to Finland and Raveniem with a small threshold.
With over ten players, we went through a lot of 50 players around the world.
The small crowd began to be separated as a good alternative to Prosa, the RoPS Coach Juha Malinen told me in the press release.
Prosa, 25, arrive at RoPS from the stable Flora, where he made a total of 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played in the Estonian National Team.
Prosan is scheduled to be with RoPS on Saturday at the Seinjajo where the Ravaniemians meet the ruling Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS had a need for a new attacker when Alexander Kokko, his last - season governor, moved to Australia.
The happy Modern Family Star meets again: the teen star shorts reveal almost everything
A modern Family Media series, known as Alex Dunphy, will once again be shattered by showing its proud body.
Winter was shot in Hollywood this week in minishorts that don't leave much of a imagination.
The Shorts revealed not only the actors' legs but also this backside.
The 18-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by making its style and use much more courageous.
The star has developed a number of tattoos in the pictures published in social media, with very few clothes and numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen dress up in very few costumes.
The Winter, on the basis of adultity, has recently published several pictures of itself celebrating.
If you don't see the picture, you can look at it from here.
Previously this summer Fox News asked experts why Winter had changed his public image so radically.
In that case, the founder and CEO of PowerwomenTV, Amy Palmer, suspected that Winter had a typical change in Hollywood form, from child star to adult.
He's been on TV for almost all his life and has grown in the Kardashian era.
He has learned that the more to show the surface, the more publicity and attention in Hollywood gets, Palmer tells Fox News and more that exactly the same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started in the Modern Family Series when he was only 11 years old.
The actor has become nervous about some of his long-term fans with an imagomic transformation.
It's not hard to guess where he's in ten years' time when he's already about as hard as he is, says a woman in Winter Instagram.
Instead, some of the women's fans are defending an actor and urges them not to care for criticism.
You look great!
I don't care what anyone else says.
You're an inspiration for many women, you're a young woman.
The Japanese want Nordic tourists to be lured to Finland: In autumn it is possible to see a random mirror aurora
The aim of the campaign is to attract Japanese to start the renovants from the beginning, Visit Finland reports the release.
Inari and Levi are the main destinations for Japanese retreading.
Revon lights are the cards of our winter tourism, and they are strongly connected to the heart and snowy landscapes.
There is a very high demand in the winter tours of Lapland, but we are now trying to increase the sales of autumn trips.
It is rare to know that the revontuise season begins from early autumn and goes far beyond spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurara, where the surface of the lake is reflected by the retro lights, making two stories of random, reports Visit Finland v. marketing manager Anne Lind.
Visit Finland’s main target group is wealthy 25-35-year-olds, Japanese people living in the city who dream about tourism and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
Tourists are attracted to Finland, including online advertising.
According to the survey carried out by Aalto University and the researchers at Turku and Tokyo University, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive painting among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would be looking for clearer unique views of Finland, and this revonult has a huge potential.
Nights spent by Japanese tourists in Finland have grown significantly more than other Nordic countries.
Last year they spent more than double in Finland than in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are interested in Finnish tourism as a target group because they spent more than EUR 80 million in Finland.
The Japanese spent EUR 183 a day in Finland on average, says Lind.
Britain had to settle in a silver rugby-7 contest when Fitz's master team won gold.
The impressive success of the United Kingdom in the seven Rugby Games was crushed when Fidzi won it on Thursday in the finals 43 to 7.
Fidzi taught masters in the ball handling, transfer, side fighting, support game, running lines and raa'a, and thus won gold – if there was the first Olympic medal in history for the country.
Tappio meant silver, which was a slightly thinr comfort to Britain, for it was the third silver of the country on the same day. They could be proud of their success in the rugby-7 tournament for the first time, where the team won New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The strong profit from South African Boks in the 7-5 semifinals earlier on the same day could have had a negative impact on the team in the finals.
Nevertheless, the Fidz team in this form would have won the British, even if the 15-year-old team had been in full power.
The fact that at least one Britishman gets his neck tomorrow is Ben Ryan, the chief coach of Fidz, the former English rugby-7 team coach from Wimbledon.
It's been quite an experience for Britain.
Eight years ago, they lost all the games at the Adelaide Sevens tournament in Ryan's training.
In Rio, they lost only one game.
The fight is painful, but progress is amazing.
Fidzi started excellently and presented his tactile skills to Britain as a reason of interest.
It looked like Captain Tom Mitchell and his team ran into a bunch of moving buses, and the world champions rose to 5-0 when Osea Kolinisau made a fall in the corner.
When it was four minutes in the clock, Jerry Tuwai made another goal right from the paint kick.
The situation was 12-0, and Britain had hardly touched the ball.
Mitchelli's great tattoo prevented a reasonable Leone Nakarawa from making a third goal, but it didn't take long to slow Fidz's running.
When the game had been played for seven minutes, Jasa Veremalua made the goal in the right corner, after which Britain was 17-0 losing.
Nakarawa made another goal of continuing, while the first half-time was still more than one minute.
After this, Vatemo Ravovovou fell into the UK team through the most invincible fights and hit the finish line.
After the landing, the opening period ended from 29 to 0.
It seemed that the Fidzites were born to play the rugbys of seven players, while the British are still in the role of the learner.
Which is very true.
Great Britain made massive changes in half the time and managed to arrest the Fidzilians for four minutes, which was a good performance compared to the first half until Joshua Tuisova made the goal thanks to the excellent team role of the Fidzites.
Dan Norton managed to narrow the situation to 36-7 by making Britain a paint in the left corner, but it had long since been lost to the islanders of the South Sea, whose fans singing in the audience, waving flags and dancing.
It was hard not to admire Fidz’s purely cheerful attitude.
Ms. Viliem has finished making a cake for the Fidzites by making the goal in the last few moments.
The pilli blows, the Fidzites spit on each other, and the British fell on the field completely crushed.
In the past day, Fidzi had won Japan's semifinals from 20 to 5 and the United Kingdom had taken the lead over South Africa in a tight semi-final where the balance was solved by Britain's goal.
Kyle Brown took South African boxes to the lead in the first half of the time, but Dan Norton crossed the goal line with his dazzling legwork and hit under the goalholes in the second half of the time.
Marcus Watson, who is the 15 player Rugby Team player, Anthony Watson's brother, sealed the victory and finally the hopsatala.
The coach's fight against cancer encouraged Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to fight gold
The more emotional the gold can't be in these races.
From the first bet, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning went on a $220 winning train to history and found an additional plan for their golden moment in Estacio da Lago.
Although they were two in the airs, as many as a third in the boat, coach Robin Williams, who encouraged them to the second consecutive Olympics in the women's twins; this makes them the first women in the history of British sport, who are in line with the achievement.
Their supremacy was undisputed; their victory was already in the 39th consecutive and once more record.
What we see is two great athletes joining the water as springs are, not entirely in line with the nature of success.
There is a large number of helpful hands behind each row, each of which has contributed to a double point of achievement. However, the most important of the assistants is the coach, where 30 months ago cancer was diagnosed, and who did not know at that time whether he would see this day.
Williams said the situation was tight at that time.
I had a bladder cancer, and the tumor was able to cut off.
Without surgery, it would have spread everywhere.
And the situation would've been pretty bad.
It changes a bit of an idea.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The triangle was lucky that Williams was able to start his treatment outside the seasonal season at the beginning of 2014, when the interruption caused as little harm as possible if, in such circumstances, it could even be said.
I needed money, so I had to get better fast.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the department six, nine, and 15 meters at a time when they said a few steps was enough.
That's where it starts.
The fight itself is already a journey, but this made it a little bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the two thoughts were at Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more normal in trying to overcome his own restlessness.
Captain Stanning of the British Royal Trucist Church, who had a tour of Afghanistan, says: “At this level I’ve been ravaged this week, which may be a little extreme, but that means so much.
It just tells me how much this means to me and how much we've worked with Helen and Robin.
For the last three years, Helen and Robin have been fantastic.
Without Robin we'd be nothing, so thank you very much for him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't hope for a better person with whom to train, or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost any competition for the last five years.
The twin has found an overwhelming rhythm to which their competitors have failed to draw the nets.
Even at the last 500 meters, when the New Zealand and Denmark twins began to approach, Stanning and Glover still had additional resources.
We were very close in a moment.
Helen Hoki-Pysy, stay with me.
It's very important that you don't get out of the way.
“We were happy to go well, and at the same time we were not trying to do anything wonderful.
We did not seek heaven today, we just wanted to make a good conversation and win the race that we did.
The twin will think about a year before deciding on his future.
Glover celebrates next month with Steve Backshall on TV nature programs.
Now he just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last competition.
It would've brought too much pressure.
\"After London, it took about six months to realize that I was the Olympic winner.
Everything was so new, and I was very stressed.
This time, it took about four minutes to figure it out.
This feels so much better, he says.
Iceland is changing the government of Panama’s currents
In October, Iceland organises early parliamentary elections, which are already required by the protestors who have been pissed off by Panama's information years in spring.
The so-called Panama paper revealed the tax evasion of many Icelandic politicians through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for the protestors.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, then promised to organise new parliamentary elections in autumn.
The election day has now been decided on 29 October.
According to analysts, it is difficult to predict how much last - day rage affects the election result of the autumn.
In the June presidential elections, criticism of the takeovers clearly showed, and the President was elected from outside the political stage by Mr Johannesson.
Trump said he was sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of the Obama Isis.
The U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump canceled his last speech.
He said he was sarcastic when he claimed that sitting President Barack Obama would be the founder of the terrorist organization Isisi and the candidate for democratic Hillary Clinton to be involved in the establishment of an organization.
The Democratic Party pissed off the speeches and called for an apology from Trump.
The commander of the army should never let anyone who can fall down that way, Clinton's quote.
In South France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the use of a brandin-utilizer that is popular with Muslims on swimming beaches, says, among other things, British newspaper Guardian.
The decision signed by Mayor David Lisnard states that going to the beaches and swimming is prohibited for everyone who does not have a good way and a bathing suit that respects secularism.
The decision also states that swimsuits, which express great religious ties, can increase the risk of order failures in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In the middle of July, 85 people died and hundreds were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove to the crowd celebrating the French National Day.
At the end of July, two men connected to the Isis attacked the church in northern France and killed a priest over 80 years old.
The quality of swimming water in the Oulu area passed through the leg - A bluefin tuna in Pykösärve
The water samples taken from official bathing areas in Oulu meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only bluefin tuna has been detected on the Pykösjärvi bathing beach.
During Tuesday and the middle week, the Oulu region’s environmental action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing areas in the Oulu region.
With the exception of the sea coastal bathing waters, concentrations of E.coli and intestinal enterococci bacteria in all bathing areas were reduced by the operating limits provided by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health Regulations.
The concentrations of E.coli and enterococ in the bathing water of Merinieme were confirmed on Wednesday, when bacterial concentrations had decreased below the operating limits.
The bluefin tuna sequestration observed on the bathing shore of the boat does not yet make the water uncomplicated, but in favourable conditions, the situation may change rapidly as a blue whirlwind, making the water surface a blue-green bed on board.
Environmental measures will follow the situation through increased controls.
If the bluefin tuna is turned into a bluefin tuna, this will also be reported in the bathing area notification plan.
Look at the results of the bathing water samples here.
M.K.'s Nasal Disaster: Over 80% of forest owners outside the forest
Metsä gift reduction is one of the tax changes in the draft budget of the Ministry of Finance for the next year.
It is proposed to reduce the tax on income tax, which would be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generation of the forest farm.
The Ministry of Finance's proposal for forest-deforestation has four objectives: to promote generations of forest farms, to increase the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest farms and to increase the supply of wood.
The objective of the Ministry is to promote entrepreneurial forestry.
The forest owner would reduce the clean capital income of the forestry industry.
Above all, the idea of making such a tool to promote generations of forest farms is good, commented Juha Jásrainen, Director of the Central Association of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, the urge to find a critical proposal for a tax change.
The reduction of forest gifts is presented as a function of the clean capital income of the forest-owner.
It is a return on capital that has been reduced to all other reductions.
The impact of the tax reduction would be greater in the opinion of the R & D authorities if the reduction could be made directly from the sales result of the tree.
The VM proposal leaves us with a reduction in the clean income of the forestry economy to prevent the loss of forest capital income which would be reduced in other taxes.
Such a person would benefit from tax, even if no tree was sold.
The calculation model is uncomplicated.
The average hunter can't figure it out.
The model also applies to only a small part of forest owners.
The tax reduction limit linked to the forest’s profit value is EUR 40 000 in the proposal.
It's been pulled from the Walnut's mind too high.
As such, he said, 82 per cent of Finnish forest owners were removed from the ceiling.
The model would have an impact of about 10% of the forest stock distribution, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the objective of increasing space.
Forest policy has taken over decades to reduce forest gifts.
It's the result of an ageing forest owners.
According to the RTD, the average age of forest owners is now more than 60 years and about half of forest owners are pensioners.
The powerful rager surprised the drivers with Himanga, two cars were closing in on the stream and ran into each other.
On Friday morning, there was a special chase on the Kala River Himanga.
According to the rescue facility, two cars of a successive period of time fell into the stream, after which the crash came in front of the driver.
According to Harri Pyyhti, after the day-to-day firefighter, the fall of his head is suspected of a powerful shattering.
Back in time there were two people in the car who were both transported to the hospital.
There's no more accurate information on their injuries.
The driver of the car he drove was not injured.
The accident occurred on the highway from 8 Himangas to a few kilometers to the Kala River.
Finnish research can help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatments
Recent research results from researchers at the University of Turku can help develop cancer treatments more effectively.
The findings of the Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska’s study group indicate that the hardness of cancer tumour increases the malignantness of cancer.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow as usual in such an environment.
According to Ivaska, cancer growth could be prevented under laboratory conditions by restoring the surrounding tissue to match normal soft tissue.
In the future, the effectiveness of anticancer medicinal products may be improved by focusing on the interaction between cells and surrounding tissue in addition to cancer cells.
The results of the studies have been published in the published Nature Communications newspaper in the field of cell biology on 4 August.
The Muhto's family home is still in the court, and the prosecutor also demands a murder sentence for another person.
The cabin of the Muhto family home continues to be in the court with regard to both convicted persons.
Two young men were sentenced to imprisonment in June from a family home in Muhoko.
The other eight years received 4 months of killing and gross robbery, among other things, as a young person.
The second sentence is 12 years of imprisonment for murder and gross robbery as a young person.
The accused was also sentenced to the risk of serious road safety as a young person and to the transport of vehicles as a young person.
The prosecution, the prosecutors and the man who was sentenced to a more harsh judgment were complaining about the court's judgment.
The D.A. requires a lower sentence on the murder of a young person for 12 years in prison.
They were in full understanding at the time of the act
According to court law, youngsters 17 years old killed a school home as a director of a child welfare service in July last year.
According to the grounds of the judgment, the 17-year-old who was sentenced to murder attacked the director sitting on the couch in the living room.
The director had been taken off the line and was able to take a young person into his room, when one youngster hit him with a suture.
The director was also strangled, beaten and kicked in the head, among other things.
According to a mental investigation, both convicted were in full understanding at the time of the act.
According to the right, young people had planned to escape family homes from at least the previous day.
Ice shark is the world's most long-lasting spine, increasing only at 156 years of age
The world’s longest living spine has been confirmed by the ice shark, reports the study published in Science.
In the north of the Atlantic, like the ice shark, floating around Greenland, or the holocaust, can live up to 400 years old.
The female will only grow when he is 156.
The fact that it grows only one centimetre per year is added to the life of the ice plant.
Only one species of shellfish is known to last longer than live ice sharks.
The researchers found their age on radio skiing.
Due to nuclear tests in the 1950s, some sharks had radioactive residues.
Based on these, researchers were able to assess the age of sharks.
The parent's age was estimated to be 392 years, but the throw in the direction or the other could be up to 120 years.
Donald Trump as an economic visa - People's News
Donald Trump America doesn't have to change the world.
Even a third of all the tax revenue of the State would not be paid if the change in Donald Trump's turnover in corporate tax is implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, in particular, through tax reliefs that benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax programme as revolutionary when he presented it on Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax would fall from 35% to 15%.
Without collection, it would be a really huge sum, $1,000 billion a year.
The upper income tax rate is now 39,6, after the reduction by Trump 33.
They'd give up all the inheritance tax.
Trump accused the State of over-regulation and bankruptcy of small businesses.
The environmental standards that have been decided on by the emergency must be renewed and the energy regulation must be broken down.
The Barack Obama health reform must be re-examined.
The management shall be appointed by experts, instead of bureaucrats,
According to Trump, trade policy is one of the main causes of the problems facing the United States.
Free trade agreements would be said off.
For imports from China, 45% and 35% would be abused from Mexico.
We'll offer you a new future.
Americanism, not globality, is our witness, Trump declared.
Donald Trump America doesn't have to change the world:
American cars come on the streets, American planes connect cities, American ships control the sea, American steel to raise new skyscrapers all over the country.
By way of derogation, Trump faithfully read the speech written by the assistants, even though the well - organized protests interrupted it 14 times.
Economists, including those close to Republicans, see Trump's program leading to a deep economic recession in the United States.
Hillary Clinton announced his own program on Friday, Finland’s time.
An attack on the past - People's News
The sea is forever mulling, but the actual attack wave will strike in the middle of Madrid - accounting with the past can begin.
That's the point of Pedro Almodóvar's novelty story.
Almodovar's previous guidance work Travelers (2013) was a small funky and roskin's satiric comedy, prior to the skin where I live (2011) the career of the Spanish tourist.
Julieta 2016 is located somewhere between those two works.
It's a kind of senile love, a relationship and family drama that has a mother-and-a-girl relationship at the center.
The story is simple and we'll see much of it in a long way.
Life seems to be a model for a middle-aged person (Emma Suarez), but then everything is at risk of being shattered.
In the aftermath of random encounterings, a new male friend (Dario Grandinetti) may be surprised at the end of the film.
In the form of a recovery and a long letter, Julieta times the stages of her life for her adult daughter.
He begins from time to time before his daughter was born, from the moment when he met this future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, Adraina Ugarte, who is a young teacher of Julieta, will rise from the TV-based series between Ommeltte (2013-2014).
Juliet's ageing has been treated in a way that can be considered a doll, but I would say that time is oddly and literally with a one-time ease.
The Almodóvar movies are often so characteristic of symourism, always with humor, while Julieta is a fair distance.
It is a flat-screened film with good music in place, a very sadly-like movie, which includes ingredients for life.
Instead, the typical visual color thickness for the Spanish director is stored and is being put in a small, quiet eye as a clean piece of action rather than as a working drama.
Diseases, deaths, or just sudden loss of the movie people, but the surface remains as Korean.
This applies especially to clothing: in the case of a no-person, you live from the scene to another, and the same applies to visible ears.
Almodóvar is precise in these matters, but the main point is that of this particular case.
When mechanically repeated, the impression is external and a little breathless.
Almodóvar has written literature on the basis of the three novels of the Canadian Alice Munro awarded in Nobel 2013.
Novellit has been published in the book Karkulainen: Reports.
Almodóvar has invested in the dialogue, resulting in a slightly even written literature filming.
The subjects would have been emotionally inextricably in a more dramatic drama, as much as big things - especially the pale guilt - the thematics of the movie.
Control and script: Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on Alice Munro's three novels.
In the main sections: Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, Dario Grandinetti.
The first night of the film is 12.8 p.m.
Government is trying to get the election trick - People's News
No new cuts will be made, hot ministers will be able to do so that basic Finns will not be totally collapsing.
However, the cut-offs decided in the spring are carried out by a rap shop.
No new surgery.
The four billion savings already decided are sufficient.
In this way, Prime Minister Juha Sipil (middle) and Minister of Finance under the budget line of Petter Orpo (kok.).
It is true that there are no new cuts in the VM proposal, since social security cuts were already decided in the spring framework.
Child benefit, pension, basic unemployment security and almost all other benefits linked to the pension index are cut by 0.85 per cent.
The duration of the unemployment benefit is reduced from 500 to 400.
Training cuts continue.
The Kunts haunt
Why do ministers so hard to stress that there are no new cuts on them?
Because next year is the election year.
The municipalities are held in April and are the most important heat meter during the election period, not the gallus.
It has been seen before that the natural result of government parties in various directions ruins the government's atmosphere for a long time.
The Gallupits, however, tell us that the basic Finns of the government are expecting a hit, even though the result of the previous elections was a modest 12.3 per cent, compared to the parliamentary elections.
Four years ago, the basic Finns received 752 new mandates, of which the price of influence in the right administration will be realised for most of them next spring.
The lifeline of the three political parties is about the same as that of the Finnish people.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of those who voted for it had the need for government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's visit to the Parliamentary Group have also come to the surface.
First of all, the fact that next year they will be made violently and, secondly, trying to soften the expectations of the Finns will not be clouded by new cuts.
Big cuts in 2018?
After a year, everything is likely to be different... if the Sipila government is still standing.
The government has set the goal of taking up debt during this parliamentary term, but the Petter Orpo's draft budget will owe EUR 5.9 billion next year, which is more than this year.
After the countdowns, the government has two options.
The first is to raise hands in the middle of the electoral period and to admit that the government is not able to comply with its own programme: debt is neither won nor even slow.
The other one's holding on to the program.
This means more intense cuts to the former in the 2017 budget line.
The budget would be run at least close to balance during 2018, and then in the spring, the election will be taken against what is coming.
The debt ratio of these activities is not good.
It is absolutely clear that the debt of the current activities is not felt, even though Juha Sipila is trying to relieve a positive feeling.
The curves presented by State Secretary Martti Hetemäen at the information meeting on the budget are unsatisfied:
The growth forecasts in the world economy have repeatedly proved to be overoptimistic, i.e. there will be no veto aid from the international economy.
After the collapse in 2008, Finland's economy has not just risen, except during the recovery policy that took place temporarily in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has increased by 35 per cent in this decade, with an average prolonged average of 34 out of 54 weeks.
Unemployment is now costing EUR 3 billion a year more than in 2008.
The current government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% in the middle of the next decade.
What's responsible?
In the spring of 2015, the debt compensation submitted by the left-wing union was rejected as it was considered irresponsible.
Next year, the maintenance of unemployment will cost about EUR 6 billion, which will in practice be fully covered by new debts.
This is the understanding of the centre, collection and basic Finns of what is responsible.
Question: A lot of tasks are to be left to the municipalities
Three of the four consider that the organization of day care, youth work and exercise of children is responsible for the municipality, reports the study of the KAKS - Municipal Development Foundation.
A clear majority of the people also take responsibility for the individual municipality, including libraries, culture, civil education, building supervision, upper secondary school training, and waste management.
The responsibility of the county is, in turn, the desire for a regional approach, special care, vocational training, universities of applied sciences and institutional care for disabled people.
There is no need to transfer the roles of municipalities to the State under the order of their respective responsibilities.
A low-aged track drunk ran behind the chase, running away from the police.
The 16-year-old motorcycle drove a police patrol away in Joensuu on Friday night at half a hour.
The police patrol tried to stop without lights on the motorcycle, but the young man left to run the police away from the fair speed.
The back-hole continued on the Sonkjaannantway, from which to the Sorronahotika and the smaller forest road where the motorcycle drove out of the road.
Even after this, a young man went running away, but a faster police officer ran to catch a fugitive.
The blow test for the driver showed 0.75 prom.
Nor did he have a driving licence that would justify driving on a motorcycle.
The case will be investigated as a serious threat to road safety.
The truck that was in the rocks fell into its stream.
The truck in the stone pool fell on Polvijärvi on Thursday night at 21.15 p.m.
The truck had drifted left in a curved corner out of the road and fell down its side.
The rescue facility raised the injured driver from the crash from the truck above the remaining door, together with the rescue helicopter staff and the first pilots.
The lifting of the vehicle remained the responsibility of the owner of the car.
The damaged truck ran into hydraulic oil, which was absorbed by the rescue plant into the well.
The police are investigating the cause of the accident.
The elderly woman disappeared this afternoon in the Air River.
The 87-year-old woman has been missing since the afternoon in Lahtikyla in South Ostrobothnia.
The police are looking for about 165 centimetres long, smart and good-looking woman with white hair under the jaw.
Findings and hints of lost movements are asked to call the Northern Status Centre's tip number 0295440513.
The ingredients of the major accident in the air... look at the image gallery of Parafest's ruins.
The massive damage caused by the flux flow of paraphest-fessivals.
Arto Pippuri, Chairman of the Joensuu Parafest Association, estimates that the festival will be able to reach its economic heart, and the event can also be held next year.
The last performer of Paraphest, Kalle Salonen, appeared on Friday night at the end of the main stage.
On Saturday, the program will continue on presentations held at the City Theatre’s premises from 13 a.m.
The art center in Ahjo is Parafest exhibition at 13-15.
The program will be organised as planned.
The ignition flow is generated in the lightning cloud when the rainwater and its weight trigger a falling flow of air.
Changes in the form of water in the open cloud bind heat, and therefore the falling air mass cools and grows toward the ground.
According to the Finnish Air Science Institute, there is a number of leak flows occurring in Finland during the summer.
It's hard to predict the path of the passing currents.
The fall flow hit the backyard of Joensuu's art museum at Parafest on Friday afternoon before 5:00.
There were about 200 people in the tents.
In an accident, four people were mildly injured.
There was one child in the river, who was easily transported to further treatment as a result of injury.
Air pollution by ageing Londoners
According to the study, the skin of London is getting older faster than usual.
The cause of an ageing of the skin is air pollution.
The British survey says Eventing Standard.
The British skin management company Caci analyzes London without the most toxic small particles and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many pensioners is two and a half years older than that of an elderly partner living in rural areas.
The old-age small particles of the skin are a very good dust pollution, which comes from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory diseases that, according to Eventing Standard, almost 9 500 Londons die every year.
Studies have shown that particles are small enough to penetrate the outer layer of the skin.
The Cac study found that early ageing is a risk, especially for the London people who are walking near the congested streets.
London residents can try to protect against air pollution, for example, with different masks, but a more practical solution is recommended for regular skin cleaning.
The brakes of the tractor betrayed a man standing in front of you.
The man had moved stones in his yard with tractors.
When he got out of the tractor and went to visit it, the brakes of the tractor cheated, and my tractor poured on the man.
The man was not left behind, but my tractor was able to reach a working man enough to be transported to the central hospital seriously injured in further research.
The tractor didn't get any further pain, for it ran into stones in front of it.
Rising with the newest power for the future
The river-based league-Riento, who plays in the Championships, leaves from better starting points than the man remembered in October.
The team's been together for three weeks now.
The joint sound is certainly better than in previous seasons, when the honours of the series have been darker than in Rienno.
Jani Säis, who is continuing as the head coach of the fight, is calling the new team an attempt and unity.
From the foreign triangle, Fred Musoni will begin his second season in Riga.
New faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who was in the Rwandan National Team, is a 205-inch hacker.
Garchet is respectively a passer, the brasilian has a size of 198 cents.
Through Josha, Katajan, and Jokipoi, to U.S. country team
Anne JPninen has played in almost all the Salibandy World Cups since 2003.
Now, in Tampere, there are already six-thousand races going, only 2013 had been missed since Canada had been better in North America's Carnations.
I was at work in Turku and playing with a bunch of women when I noticed the announcement.
The U.S. was setting up a Salibandy country team.
I got it, and here we are, J.P., 48, says it.
The partner was born in 1967 near New York City in Elizabeth.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was a year old.
In 1987 JPYPnen was able to study data processing at the University of Joensuu.
When I came to Joensuu, a species like that wasn't played at SM just like salibandy.
They were playing chess at the university.
I played basketball in Kataja and later in Jokipoj hockey in the SM series, Jyphen remembers.
The partnership played with the University in the Salibandy SM series of the period 1991-92, the following three were spent in Josba.
In addition to playing, he coached the company to the A-girls championship.
Women's SM series peaked on silver in 1995.
All in all, JP played in women's SM series by 10, the balance was 169 in 51+34=85.
The latest MS period is 2001-2002.

Beach Volley Master Essi Hasu's circle closes to Kouvola - SM Gold missing from the prize cabinet
Essi Hasu is about to stop playing as a beach volley player, at least after a temporary period.
The Beach old Finnish championships will be decided this weekend at Kouvola Sports Park.
In three days, medals are played in both adult and young series.
In cooperation with Kouvola Airporters and the Finnish Aviation Union, the SM-final tournament will be awarded six best pairs of each series of beaching.
The local color in the tournament represents Elimäen NMKY's raised Essi Hasu, who has been part of the Finnish beach volley flags for several years.
Today, Hasu, who lives in Helsinki, looks forward to games in front of a familiar audience.
I hope as many as you can get to the audience this weekend.
I'm sure there's going to be a great arena for Pesisstadion.
I haven't played in adult series very often in Kouvola, so it's great to play in the finals at home, the Hasu tunnel.
The Kouvola sedu set fire to Hasu's spark and gave good luck to a fine hobby.
There are great memories of childhood.
I started a flight ball at the E-girls of Elimäen NMKY.
The main thing is too big to play shirts, the knee shields in the ankles, and the great anesthetics and choreographers after the point, Hasu remembers.
At a small location, the sports club was a busy community where everyone knew each other.
The group's common spirit created an environment where it was nice to play.
All families were strongly involved in the operation, and the father of the teammate trained us, and our mother was the chairman of the company for a long time.
Essi Hasulle beach volley was already a natural selection of species during the junior period to the counterweight of the indoor balloon.
The song has been played on the riverside since the 1990s.
It's always been active.
I also followed the SM tour of the Juniors, thinking that I would be there some day.
Now this dream will come true when Hasu plays this weekend with Annina Parkkinen in the SM-finals.
Riikka Lotonen and Tarru Lahti after the tournament in the second punished twin goal is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We still lack SM gold from the reward cabinet, Hasu throws valuables.
A weekend in Kouvola may be in front of Hasu's last familiar audience.
At the beginning of September, new challenges are awaited for civilian work.
Yes, the international career is over after the Kisakallio tournament.
Otherwise, at least temporarily, Hasu plans to put the toes in the nail.

Solomon Koli went bravely as a farmer
As an entrepreneur, agriculture means risk benefits, sweats and perseverance.
A young farmer, Koli of Solomon, 25, became a farmer because he believes in a positive future also in rural areas.
Some two years ago, Koli and her little brother Valtter Kol started working as an extension of their home space.
Their father Mark Koli helps and advise brothers with his own experience.
The start-up of a rural enterprise meant debt and increase in order to allow bread to come from agriculture in the hand.
This has been my case since I was a little boy.
I've always been happy to go to the farm, and now that I've started as an entrepreneur, I've put everything in the game.
If you start something, I think it should be done seriously and properly.
In 2013, we left to build a vacuum drain, and first of all, the bank was not excited about it.
However, I was very bravely involved in the project and I have been fully involved in it, Solomon Koli tells me and more that it would not have taken place if he did not have faith in producing pure Finnish food and that everything would still be good.
The goal of Solomon Koli, who is raising meat cars, is to invest even more in his navet.
The work has produced results, for Solomon Koli has been elected to the top ten best groups of the future of the Earth’s Future magazine in the competition of a young cooking producer.
At best, he competes with the possibility of winning.
He will be able to vote on the website of the magazine until 21.8.
Bulgaria shall notify inflation for the first time for eight months
According to national statistics, Bulgaria's monthly inflation rate was 1% in July.
This is the highest value for several years (after June 2012) and the first time it rises to more than zero after October last year, when the country announced a 0.2% positive inflation rate.
The average annual inflation rate measured by CPI over the last 12 months (from August 2015 to July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (from July 2014 to July 2015) was –0.8 %.
The Consumer Price Index in July 2016 was 101.0% compared to June 2016, i.e. the monthly inflation rate was 1.0%.
The percentage of inflation since the beginning of the year (from July 2016 to December 2016 to 2015) has been -0.2%, and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
Compared to the previous month in July 2016, an increase was observed in prices of the following categories of consumer products: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), vehicles (1.8%), recreation and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%).
Prices decreased in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household appliances and fixed-term care (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
The prices of the following product groups remained at the same level as the previous month: alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
An anime effect of Snapchat is criticised for Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter was an anonymous, but some observers think it's racist.
With Snapchat's lens tool, some 150 million daily users can change reality and play with identity methods that approach absurdity.
You can turn yourself into an anaks, a dog or a character in the painting of Roy Lichtenstein.
Birds are unremarked, feature-creating tools that create more than 30 million more efficient self-declaration daily.
All delusions quickly come to public knowledge.
Snapchat's lenss have received a review of where it has been accused of favouring blackface or bleached skin sprays as a beauty test.
So when it offered some of its users this week a filter that turned their eyes into tips, distorted teeth and made the cheeks of the cheeks, called it a racist caricature of Asian people, \"yellowface\".
The critics also wondered whether these repeated conflicts were referring to a major problem that the company had with diversity.
The news and rage spread widely on Wednesday and wrote about it e-publications The Verge and Motherboard day after Snapchat told me that he had removed the filter.
The company explained the following: the lens was meant to be a tribute to the anime characters, not as a caricature of Asian people.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of offensive stereotypes.
Some were very attached to an anime version.
The Korean American art student Grace Sparapani, who was widely divided from pictures, said in her email that the lens was at least offensive and awkward.
He adds: “It’s hard to challenge the very tasteless Asian caramel in breast-feeding the filter’s strengths.
It shows that the filter is not just a \"yellowface\", but one that has been taken to a despicable extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company to avoid these cultural traps.
In American culture, it is known that there will always be endless struggle between diversity and social inclusion from companies' governments to Hollywood and the equipment we carry with us.
Snapchat’s great audience consists of young people, who are from ethnic background more diverse than their parents’ response. This may mean that they are likely to expect more subtleity.
“When one of Snapchat’s lenses creates a picture that violates the user, this type of thing will no longer be too easy to see, as it was before,” said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in the interview on Thursday.
Zhu, who works as the product manager and designer at the Medium publishing platform, decided on Thursday to remove his Snapchat account and encourage others to do the same.
In his article and telephone interview in the media, he said that he believed that ethnic conflicts reflected the lack of appreciation for diversity in the Snapchat recruitment practices.
Zhu criticises the company for most of the white and exclusively male leaders and decided to write on the Hashtag: #DeletSnapchat.
“It is either that there are no colourful people in their unilateral staff when they can make decisions like this, or they can also have colourful decisions, but their position is not such that they dare to express their opinion directly and easily,” says the Chinese-American Zhu.
Other observers agree with him, but Snapchat has largely failed to respond.
The company does not publish figures on the ethnic background of its staff, drawing on its position as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the ethnic background of his staff, but according to his informant, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on the under-represented groups and the promotion of participation within the company.
Zhu, for its part, says that he is keeping his Snapchat account closed and more: “I wonder if they really need more users like us to say that this is not OK.
According to the Congress Group of Experts, military officials have distorted the intelligence about Isis.
On Thursday, the Congress expert group published a report that officials of US armed forces, Central Command, changed intelligence reports to give them a more optimistic picture of the war against the Isis in Iraq and Syria than the events on the ground gave rise to understanding.
The presidents of the Sub-Committee responsible for Intelligence and Defence Finances (House Armed Services Committee) set up a working group to discuss the general dissatisfaction of armed intelligence analysts. According to the analysts, senior military authorities were embellished against Americans.
Central Command, in short Centcom, is the headquarters of the United States military forces in Tampa, Florida, and is responsible for military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
\"The intelligence polls approved by the Supreme Directors of Centcom gave a more positive picture of anti-terrorist actions in general than the facts shown on the field, and were more exceptionally positive than in the analyses of other intelligence services in the intelligence community,\" reports the press release on the report.
“Centcom’s events cannot be accepted – our soldiers suffer when false analyses are presented to high-level policy makers,” says Ken Calvert, California’s Republican representative.
‘The errors of Centcom’s management port extend to the highest level of the organisation.
The 10-page report gives details of the continuing problems in 2014 and 2015, which are included in the descriptions and analyses of the Central Community for American activities in order to train Iraqi troops.
Although the report does not contain decisive evidence that the reports ordered by the Obama administrative authorities would have been counterfeited, it gives an analytical picture, which gives an idea that Centcom leaders would have pressured them to give them a more optimistic view of the threat posed by Isis.
“In the first half of 2015, many of Central Command press releases, statements and statements of witnesses to Congress were significantly more positive than what was actually happening, ” says the report.
“As a first step, Centcom’s official made a public statement that a large military attack on Mosul could take place already in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, is still under the control of Isis.
“After months of research, this is very clear, ” says Mr Mike Pompeo, President of the Republic of Kansas.
“From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top intelligence leaders in the U.S. armed forces manipulated the intelligence received in order to reduce the threat of Isis in Iraq.
The Republicans set up a working group after obtaining knowledge of the doubts expressed by analysts that the personal intelligence data would have been manipulated.
The report, published on Thursday, will follow more detailed results, as studies will continue.
In addition, the Department of Defence Inspector has launched an investigation into Centcom's intelligence.
On Thursday, the members of the Committee on Budgetary Intelligence published their own results, which were partly consistent with the conclusions of the Republican Labour Group.
“In the period 2014 to 2015, Centcom created a too limited process to assess the intelligence of the Isis and Iraq security forces,” says Adam B. Schiff, a High Representative of the Committee.
According to Mr Schiff, this process has slowed down the publication of intelligence results, \"the morals of analysts\" and \"not enough differing views\".
According to Schiff and the Democrats, however, there was no evidence that the White House would have tried to pressure Centcom's analysts to adapt their conclusions to the pre-defined or political official line.
On Tuesday, Daily Beat announced the preliminary results of the study carried out by Congress.
In August last year, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Inspector of the Pentagon, which began as a result of the action of the Centcom analysts.
The Pentagon informant, Lieutenant Patrick Evans, when he reports that the Department of Defence did not comment on Congress's report as long as the inspector's investigation is under way.
However, he says: “The experts sometimes disagree with the interpretation of complex information, and the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defence welcome the health dialogue on these key issues of national security.
The investigation also has other follow-ups in addition to trying to determine whether the bombings carried out by the United States in Iraq and Syria have been successful (a claim made by one of several defence authorities).
However, the claims made last year could question how much President Obama could rely on Central Command and that it would give an honest assessment of the military operation of Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The criticism on personal intelligence is in line with the differences that occurred more than a decade ago, when Centcom's intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker published a study that says that the President's W. Bush government, despite the opposition of many analysts, supported only small troops in Iraq and took only a little time to consider what would be the outcome of the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the rebellion on Personal Intelligence.
According to the authorities last year, Hoker's working group concluded that, despite the opposite public statements, air strike in Isis's dominant refineries did not significantly weaken the terrorist group's economy because it had built temporary processing plants and thus managed to sell oil in the dark market.
However, the results of the study were not transmitted outside of Central Command, reports The Times in September.
The commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was critical of the last year when many legislators had assessed the statements of witness to the Senate were too positive for the war.
General Austin retired in April, and he replaced Central Command Commander, General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States will win the fourth double-check in women's groundhockey and establish its position in mid-term review with Britain
After making three goals in the victory, in the 6th-floor game against Japan, Katie Bam made the first two goals for the women's country team on Thursday, when the United States won India.
Five goals in two games could be regarded as a great achievement, but 27-year-old Bam was not sure if he'd done the same way before.
\"I have no idea,\" he says.
\"I'm not one of the people who keep track of what they're doing.
However, he knows: In his Olympic tournament, Americans have won four games and lost zero games and are divided first in their group with Britain, which continued to win their winning pipe on Thursdays to the Japanese chapters 2 to 0.
Britain and the United States are playing opposites on Saturday in the last game of the first round.
Each team survived the final match, which will determine which one will be placed as the first and the second of the six teams to form.
The first to avoid a longer period of encountering a tough Dutch team that won the second one as soon as possible.
No matter how it goes on Saturday's game, Americans have already raised their surprise success in these competitions, four years after it remained the last 12 teams in London's Olympics.
Bam was also in the team in London.
He grew up in the state of Blue Bell in Pennsylvania, and took his country hockey country for the first time only when he was 3 years old (his parents played the species in Drexel).
He was missed by the Olympic Games in 2008 when he failed to make his final player list.
After this, the 2012 races came, where he and his team had little success.
The following year the coach was appointed English Craig Parnham, and after which things began to change.
“Mutos was cultural, mental and physical, ” says Bam.
\"We worked in London was not what it is now.
We've made a full translation.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the painting account in the first half of the time by hitting the ball near the tyssyllabus.
India had come to the game without any competition, but it proved to be a surprising strong opponent and maintained a 1-0 situation until the third period when Bam entered the field.
Bam carried the ball long along the field left side, rolled on the middle surface, hit the ball in the paint, and thus brought the Americans to 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez made the last goal in the middle of the fourth episode.
The game was the first tournament in which the U.S. painter Jackie Briggs managed to keep the goal empty. In the first three games, the American goal had become one hit.
Briggs now lives in his success,
Same as Bam.
“Our attitude is now good, ” says Parnham, but how good it depends on the outcome of the Saturday game.
In the middle of the Olympichulin, the trampoline brings the Zen
No matter where it is, no matter how much time, the Olympics run into each other.
Rio de Janeiro events, competitions and fights seem to be the next intense message, constantly and everywhere.
As if the Olympics themselves were a flame-reflecting message capsule, moving from the archbishop to the swimmer, from the swimmer to the gymnastics and from the gymnastics to the triathlonist.
You can't open a TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop line, and avoid hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or Michael Phelps and Chad Le Clos.
And then there's a man named Logan Dooley.
The Olympics' first-time Dooley charm with a smile and might well be the name of all the lips that would appear and belong to the best viewing and listening times, would be popular by sponsors and would appear in good mind TV commercials if he were just a swimmer, a gymnastic or even a swordmaker.
But Dooley, from California Lake Forest, 28, competes on the Olympic Trampoliin.
Olympia fire does not equally illuminate all competitions.
The distance from the center, in part in the shadow, are less known sports sports, such as air pistolammunk, archery, ball ball and taekwondo.
We'll always have a bra, and we'll have a championship for a long time.
But if I get permission to write a modest story about my own special favor, I would like to draw attention to the slow charm of trampoline.
Although trampoline has been the Olympic species since the year 2000, its visibility for the last 16 years has been so limited that many people I have interviewed did not even know it was the Olympic species.
Ignorance can be regional.
The United States of America has played a role in the Olympics, but the country has never reached medals and has not moved to finals before 2012.
In men's trampoline, medals seem to go to the Chinese and Russian, and women's side of the medal are two Canadians.
China Dong Dong and Canadian Rosie Maclenna defends gold medals this year that they won in London.
Trampoliin, however, has the charm of the defendant, partly because of the uncivilised ear it sounds more appropriate for circus school than for the Olympics.
(In this connection, I confess that I am no expert, only a normal fan.)
There is a collection of its potential, which has been used in the cartoons during the endless bombings of the characters, but it also has the same dignity as gymnastics and swimsuits, i.e. in species that are inherent in trampoline.
The word trampoline comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means “split board”
The ambitious champions jump on a huge trampoline that seals them up to a height of nearly 10 metres. Before landing, the jumpers must make a series of acropathic movements, such as tours, skills and volts.
According to the official Olympic programme, the jumps are assessed on the basis of performance, difficulty and pilot time.
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 different countries compete from the trampoline gymnastics championship. 16 of them are men and 16 women.
The most common Olympic species are straight ahead.
When aiming for gold, the medals must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes over the goal line, sometimes back and forth the field.
In addition to the painting line or the starting wall, they also have another objective to which they are seeking a world or Olympic exhibition in TV-based reporting stations.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical – and is even enough to get the viewer to tears.
But I also find this a little tiring just in watching the races.
This trampoline offers a breathtaking condition.
Trampoliin's heading up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The gymnastics pulls up like an astronaut, falls down and snoops back up.
Of course, the species also include a competition aspect, and it is not easy, but it does not involve intense assault on paint and does not jump far, only a dreamy combination of time and gravity.
It's as close to Zen as the Olympics competition can be.
The women's race and finals will be held on Friday afternoon and will start at 13.00 local time and the men will match the races on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC will send the finals as part of the afternoon's broadcast, which will begin at 14:00 local time on the day of the bow.
In the midst of Olympia, there will be a peaceful and wonderful moment, which may be missed in the midst of the public lips.
And if awareness can only be increased by offering attractive male athletes and acting on them – as the United States' menmen Wall Street Journal recently suggested – then Logan Dooley is just waiting to take care of his new fan crew.
A whole generation protested in Ethiopia, a long-term ally in the United States
Violent demonstrations in Ethiopia
Government forces have broken down protests that call for political change across the board of Ethiopia.
According to witnesses, several protestors have been shot to death in contact with the police.
Is Ethiopia breaking up?
For the last decade it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa and a reliable ally in the West, whose economy has grown rapidly.
In recent months, however, the country has undergone anti-governmental demonstrations that are spreading to more and more regions.
Just last week, thousands of people were rushing into the streets, demanding a thorough political change.
According to human rights organisations, the government's reaction was pathetic.
According to witnesses, the police shot and killed several non-armed protestors.
The demonstrations are supposed to be at the end of last year or the videos described at the beginning of this year show how security forces are hitting young people who have been forced to stand against the wall.
The UN's leading human rights officer is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“I have always been difficult to keep the country united, and to move forward more difficult,” says Rashid Abdi, research director of the International Crisis Group of the African Saravi project.
Since Nigeria, Ethiopia is the second largest country in Africa, which has been promoted by the Western stabilisation countries.
The U.S. military and intelligence service are closely supporting the Ethiopians in the fight against terrorist threats throughout the region, particularly in Somalia. Only a few African countries, if anything, will be given such help from the West.
The Ethiopian economy has grown rapidly.
Its infrastructure has been greatly improved, the capital of Addis Ababa is even new.
The streets of the cities are usually calm, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is still far from the model of democracy, and human rights organisations have constantly reported government repression policy, the opposition in the country is very limited and dissident quickly.
Many people have been expelled from the land, imprisoned, killed or driven far into the wilderness.
But the situation may be changing.
“If the people are shattered, and it has no choice but to show its mind, ” says Seyom Teshome, a professor at the University of Central Ethiopia.
\"The young people are showing their minds.
A whole generation protests...
There are many subjects of dissatisfaction, always from land use to the curvature of the government coalition.
Last year, after the widely criticised elections, the ruling party and its allies received the last place previously to the opposition, which is the result of which they now rule the entire Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are growing at Eritrea's border, where the debilitated situation required hundreds of deaths in the battle in June.
Analysts fear that in recent years more or less degraded separatists, such as Oromo's escape front or Ogaden's public freedom front, may seek to exploit confusion and rearm.
There are many reasons why a bitter mood that has come down under the surface for many years now.
The first is obvious innocent: smartphones.
Only over the last few years, the Ethiopians have been able to communicate in social media when more favourable smartphones became common and Internet access improved.
However, even when the government repeatedly prevents access to Facebook and Twitter, especially during demonstrations, many can access the Internet through transmission servers that hide their location.
Many Ethiopian youths told me that this was what they called people demonstrations.
Another reason is the increase in solidarity between the two largest populations in Ethiopia, the Oromas and the Amharans.
Oromones and amharas are not natural allies.
The Amharans from the top countries of Ethiopia have long ruled the politics and business of the country and have engendered the Oroms, most of which are Muslims and live in the suburbs.
But this is also changing.
“The work is getting deeper and we’re getting under the same umbrella,” says Muatu Gemechu, director of Oromo.
The major demonstrations have just been in the Oromo and Amhara regions.
Many amharas and orphans experience that Ethiopia is unfairly controlled by a tiger tribe representing only about six per cent of the population and, however, is governed by the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason behind the rest is Meles Zenawin's death.
Former rebel leader Meles was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until he died in 2012 under the name of an unforgivable illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, capable of seeing behind the corner.
According to analysts, he was particularly skilled to detect the first signs of dissatisfaction and to use ambassadors who agreed to avoid the opposite.
“The current government lacks this essential instinct, ” says the conflict scientist, Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Haimariam Desalegn, entered Meles' boots from almost unknown.
Unlike Meles, who was from the North Etiopian region of Tigren, Haimaram is coming from the south.
According to the analysts, he has no trust in security forces managed by the tigre tribe.
Many fear this means more bloodshed.
For the previous time, similar chests were experienced in Ethiopia in 2005, when thousands showed their minds against the elections that were first tacted and then stolen by the government's analysts.
Many protesters were killed in post-veal rest, though the deaths were less than in the previous months, and the rest was stopped relatively quickly.
The development experts have praised the leaders of Ethiopia for long-term infrastructure planning, such as the new route, and the significant progress in combating poverty.
But the internal grudge against the Ethiopian government is clearly not an obstacle to strength.
And the grudge is to take a dangerous form of ethnic ethics.
In the last month, protestors in Gonar, the city of Ampharia, attacked businesses owned by the tigers, and the hate speech against the tigers is becoming more widespread in social media.
According to the analysts, the protests set up the United States and other Western allies in an outlying situation.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned, neighbouring countries for specific aircraft in Somalia, but according to the United States, the base is recently closed.
At the same time, when the West clearly wishes to support democracy, it does not want to see its allies in an already unstable region collapse.
\"This requires strict balance,\" says Abdi.
Donald Trump says he was sarcastic when he claimed to be the founder of the Obama Isis.
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to pull his words back into his last campaign, arguing that he was not seriously claiming to be President Obama and Hillary Clinton's terrorist group as Isisi's founders this week.
The clarification raised new questions to the Republican party about the ability of the presidential candidate to communicate clearly to the citizens of his country.
His supporters, who must try to defend their candidates, will also face a situation of pain in these stormy moments and explain the comments that he may not have meant.
Trump argued at the election meeting on Wednesday evening and repeated in various interviews on Thursday that he really meant what he said when he claimed that he had created the President and Hillary Clinton.
In the early Friday morning, though, Trump said that he said he had sarcasms.
Trump threw out his speech in twiit for the last day, when he said in several interviews that he was guilty of being completely serious.
When the radio stationman and the conservative Hugh Hewitz tried to help Trumpia soften his argument by stating that Obama was trying to destroy Isis, the Republican presidential candidate refused to withdraw his claim.
The latest critical storm rose when Trump tried to focus his campaign back on the economy when suffering rates were reduced.
Trump and Clinton kept their economic policy lines in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the subject again.
He warned on Twitter that Clinton's proposals would raise taxes, and he considered Clinton's speech to be boring.
Trump's been defending himself on a sarcasm before.
At the end of July, he received extensive criticism when he seemed to urge the Russians to hack Hillary Clinton's e-mail. Later he explained his comments by saying: “I was sarcastic too.
In this way Trump draws the limits of political speech and withdraws its words if necessary.
“I believe that it is his way of testing certain messages that respond to his supporters, and he sees how the supporters respond to the messages, and how to explain – then, in one way or another, depending on the reactions,” says Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who has observed the language used by both presidential candidates.
“But I also believe that he understands his claims and knows that they are round enough to pass through the different edges.
Instead of softening his statements to the election audience, Trump has turned his style even more tighter in the last few days when his suffering rate has continued to decline.
A new opinion poll by NBC, Wall Street Journal and Marist published on Friday said that Trump's suffering is significantly Clinton's lower in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, while the situation in Florida is very even.
While Trump usually tries to avoid asking for forgiveness from his provocative speeches, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words or not understanding his sense of humor.
But after becoming more and more focused on watching his presidential campaign over the last few months, Trump's jokes have put his faithful supporters in a awkward position, where they have to publicly defend Trump's comments, whether they are provocative or not.
One of Trump's most important supporters, former mayor Rudolph W. Giulian of New York, strongly defended the presidential candidate at CNN's interview on Thursday.
“I consider his words justified by political speech,” answered Giulian when asked if Trump was truthful when he claimed that Obama and Hillary Clinton were founded by Isis.
“It is true that before Obama Isis was almost unknown, a small organization called Obama a completely mistakenly \"lower series team\", and that is why it happened because he pulled the troops away from Iraq.
Most Republicans representing power have tried to argue that the Obama regime, in which Hillary Clinton was Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed Isisi to continue its efforts when it did not deal with the situation with determination in the Middle East.
Before Friday's election events in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter, where he accused them of suffocating and discriminatory attitude toward him.
He made fun of all the unscrupulous and pathetic TV commentators trying to find out about him, but he said he couldn't do it.
Some Democrats mocked Trump's explanation, and they just said it would show more clearly that he was not fit for president.
Due to an excessive rent increase, the coffee shop stopped opening at Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a slightly explosive coffee shop in Williamsburg, where only cash was made for the payment instrument, with no Wi-Fi, but which served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, the cafe was priced out of its streetside on Bedford Avenue, when the rent went unfair.
In the summer of 2014, Verb Cafe has become Soap Cherie sells cup-shaped soaps.
The locals view this as a middle-classization to prevent the loss of the coffee shop from being destroyed.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York changes, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is no longer there, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Verb is now a soap store.
But even though New York is no longer the same, there is also a new one.
Last November, Verb Cafe opened a new cafe to Greenpoint, just a fair mile north of its original place.
The new Verb coffee shop has Wi-Fi and can be paid with a credit card, but some of the employees are the same, and the atmosphere is still unmistakable.
Coffee is still good.
The owner and head of the new Verb Cafe is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-term employee of the old cafe.
He started in Verb in 2001 and worked there until the end.
When a customer offered to finance the opening of a new cafe, he said he was very interested in doing it.
Rodriguez, 36, preserved many things.
The verb space of the bagels from the same supplier as before and use the same espressone model.
In addition, it again introduced even the old Verbin lamps.
Rodriguez says, however, he wanted to try something new, and
added new products to the list.
There are bacon-canned cheese-sandwiches available and filled with caprises and rusty onions rings.
There's also dark-haired people on the list.
The coffee will no longer have beer, but instead of fresh juices made from fruit.
After having held the cafe for nine months, Rodriguez says that he noticed that the old standard customers started to visit Verbis as a constant stream.
“ Many of our old customers had to be priced out of Williamsburg, ” he says.
One of these is Rebecca Oliveira, who visited the cafe recently on Sunday.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and regularly visited Verbb.
After moving to Greenpoint, he made walks to the Verbi, who was still in Williamsburg.
When the Verb closed, he says he stopped drinking coffee for a while.
\"I realized I liked the Verb's coffee and culture,\" he says.
Now he's drinking coffee again, even though on that Sunday he took a chai contest instead of his usual ice coffee, which is also listed as a news.
Another long-term customer, Tom Rosenthal, was faithfully visiting the Verbis since 2003.
He used to go to the coffee shop before work and order the same thing without exception.
“I walked into the coffee shop every day for more than seven times as a machine, and there they already prepared my butterbagel with all the fillings, ” he says.
Photo: Rodriguez also wanted to try something new and brought new products to his menu.
Today, Rosenthal continues to have its standard product, but sometimes he varies from pekoni, hen eggs and cheese extracts to his bagels.
Rodriguez says it's not a shame that the soap store took the old place.
Soap Cheri's owners even offered to make a special soap for which Verb's own cold-roasted coffee is used for manufacturing.
We can still take the offer, Rodriguez says.
The Polish who used to live in Greenpoint have also accepted the coffee shop with pleasure.
One of the new customers turned the menu to Polish, and Rodriguez now tells us that he is looking for a suitable place to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
The new place has brought other benefits.
A local juice company wants to bottle and sell cold-frozen coffee at the cafe.
Coffee may also be extended to a adjacent building.
However, many customers have enough to get their old favorites from the new Verbis.
Joseph Whitt was a standard customer in Williamsburg, and he tells me his heart broke when the cafe was closed.
When the new place was opened and I ordered a coffee there, it felt like it was coming home, says Whitt.
- I've had the smell of a coffee shop.
A Square Meal
In March 1933, shortly after being president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat to lunch in his office in the White House.
As a culinary, President Roosevelt liked the luxurious foods of the Fifth Avenue restaurants, such as the Hanhenapist and Maryland turtle soup.
On that day his food list was less modest: the devil’s eggs (deviled eggs) in the tomato sauce, potatoes and desserts from the bone marrow.
“It was a sign of cultural solidarity for people who suffer, ” says Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe adds: “It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat.
The Brooklyn Heights couple works as a food history player.
Coe's latest book, called Chop Suey, tells about the Chinese kitchen in America, while the latest book of Ziegelman, namely 97 Orchard, says the story of the layered story in Lower East Side.
Their new joint work is the A Square Meal of Harper's publishing on Tuesday, which describes the history of American food during the great recession of the 1930s.
The Paris Party showed its own culinary solidarity in agreement with the supplier Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, which is a small and ordinary lunch bar near Flatiron cloud artist and was opened in the same year as the major stock resolution took place in 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered cream cheese and olive-filled sandwich and 57-year-old Coe for turkeys, potatoes and mixed vegetables.
When the supplier ordered the meatloaf, the couple said it was appropriate for the debate on eating a very large flat-rate period.
“Murries were very popular, ” says Jane Ziegelman.
People ate peanut murky, liver murky and beans.
They were made of substances that were cheap and inadequate.
Imagine your cancer as many peanuts that they're enough for the whole meal.
Andrew Coe's gonna be all right.
\"It must have been pressured in the stomach like lead,\" he says.
Before the major low seasons, the American dining table, especially in rural areas, served as much as you would like.
Women made food for agricultural workers, and breakfast, lunch and dinner were served with newly-fledged pies.
The Americans had just sent food to the hungry Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal is a chronic of ways in which the people survived when suddenly people had to give up on being high.
“This was a time when food became a central and uplifting topic for the Americans,” says Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
According to Ziegelman, a new cheap diet was the main food of valuable food types such as anxiety and pasta food, and the pasta food was called “a powerful means of using food stars, ” because the cookers could cover not so attractive ingredients with cream sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced with cheaper dried fruit.
The meat that had been the most important part of the American meal for years came from a sustainable use of luxury.
There were strange blends that were most important for meeting the calorie and food values, and not even the taste or even the healthy kitchen lake.
When conducting research for a book that also contains recipes, Jane Ziegelman prepared oven beans filled with peanuts used as a food type for the wedding time.
\"It couldn't have been popular at the dinner table,\" says Coe,
Ziegelman adds: “It was unreal.
The peanut butter and the garlic don't fit together at all.
This was characterized by a number of household prescriptions.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, acting as head of the Federal Office for Households from 1923 to 1943, guided the eating habits of citizens in an unprecedented and unique manner.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines and encouraged women to be precise budget makers and to respond to the challenge of making dusty, like carrot-kermaspaget.
The A Square Meal book is a celebration of historic taste.
Particularly tasty are reports of the government's reaction to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover, who gave me the cake to eat your weapon.
At the same time, when he publicly praised his childhood simple food on the iowan farm, he himself ate, like a millionaire and a sophisticated gentleman who had become of him.
He likes the continent's European kitchen, like fish and throat sauce, says Coe.
“He ate almost a hole in a gold - covered dining room, with his head a tuxedo.
He was very alienated by reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to set an example in his stomach.
As the book says in the book, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was not interested in the taste, the foods offered in the White House were not only the most boring in Washington, but also the worst prepared.
Many of the sheep-time dishes were rejected as soon as the country got back on its feet.
According to Jane Ziegelman, the continuation of tradition continues to be reflected in how we pay attention to calories and food intake and how science has been applied to cooking.
The Parish tells us that when he wrote the book, he began to understand the eating habits of Ziegelman’s mother, for example, why he could not throw away food.
He was really afraid that food would have to be thrown away, so say Coe.
“ People even began to get sick of his food, ” recalls Ziegelman.
\"For the first time from the windmills,
After the main food plates had been emptied in Eisenberg's lunch bar, Ziegelman and Coe took out their home-made plum food, the same one President Roosevelt at lunch.
“It’s called an ossification, ” says Ziegelman and more that giving an obvious name to modest recipes was a common trick.
There was no creamy juice, only plums, little flour, sugar, water and cane.
We hurried our spoon against a thick brown coat.
I'm surprised it didn't taste bad.
Coe played second time and third as well.
\"German nuts would do better than this,\" Coe says to his wife, sounding like a positive budget manager.

The judge of the United States Regional Court decided that Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to a full compensation for the fees for the legal dispute with Merck & Co Inc on the patent for hepatitis C patent.
Gilead was released in June for $ 200 million of damages granted to him for violations of two Merck's patents in relation to the success medications of Gilead's Sovaldi and Harton.
In a complaint lodged on Thursday, Beth Labson Freeman, Judge of the United States Regional Court, says that Gilead was entitled to leave the fees for defending the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which controls the market with the new generation of hepatitis C medications that can be treated with a high rate of 90% of hepatitis C patients.
The case will run until 2013, when Gilead and Merck challenged each other's rights and demanded the privacy of sofosbuvir under laboratory work. Sofosbuvir is an active substance in the medicines of Gilead.
American troops have taken over the city of Manbij from Isis
The troops supported by the United States have taken over the city of Manjib, near the border of Turkey, in northern Syria, when the last enemy fighters left the city, reports the force informant.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) group now divided the city to find the last Isis fighters hidden in the city.
A representative of the Manbij Military Council, Sharfan Darwish, member of the SDF, told Reuters that 2 000 hostages who were abducted by the Isis fighters have been released.
\"The city is now fully under our control, but we are still in search of missions,\" said Darwish.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 per cent of federal tax
On Friday, Vice-President Hillary Clinton announced his tax declaration of 2015, which shows that the incomes of his and his husband were $10,75 million and the real tax rate of the federal state they paid.
In 2015, the Clintons donated a million dollars to charity organisations, mostly from the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton made nearly $ 5.3 million in the form of talk fees, and, as Foreign Minister, Hillary Clinton announced that he earned $3 million in his library at Simon & Schuster's office at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The vice president of Clinton, Senator Tim Caine of Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton, published ten years' tax declarations.
The real tax percentage they paid by the federal government in 2015 was 20,3.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Caine continue to show a model of economic transparency,” says Clinton’s campaign assistant Jennifer Palmier in his press release.
The perfect opposite is Donald Trump, hiding behind excuses and canceling his promises to publish his tax information.
As a rule, US presidential candidates have always made their tax information public, even though they do not require it.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have appealed to the tax administration and are saying that it is the reason Trump has not published his income data.
\"Sirto is yours – twitton's campaign assistant Ian Sams, referring to the tax information on the candidate for democracy.
On Thursday, Mr. Michael Cohen, Special Assistant to Trump, told CNN that he would not let Trump release his tax data until the checks were completed.
The Trump's critics, including the 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members, have said that his refusal to disclose information gives rise to questions about Trump's own capital, his grants to charity, business relations and many other links, including relations with Russia.
Clinton has taken this issue and published a video online on Friday, where he brings out the prominent Republicans who are patenting Trump to publish his tax information.
On Thursday, Clinton raised the matter in his speech on the economy in Michigan.
\"Trump refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done for decades, and not public tax returns,\" said Clinton to the crowd.
According to the Politico online magazine, Trump did not pay taxes at all or cost just a little bit of two in the 1990s, and New York Times’s business column quoted on Friday several taxpayers and auditors that the situation could continue to be similar.
The Federal tax percentages have raised as a key issue for the presidential elections.
Clinton has supported the rule designated by billionaire Dr. Warren Buffett, which would ensure that over $1 million per year would pay at least 30% of the tax.
President Barack Obama is also in favour of the proposal.
Last week, at the Clinton election meeting in Alaska, Buffett, the headquarters of Berkshire Hathaway, was challenged by Trump, where both of them would reveal their tax information.
Buffet says that he has also been subject to the audit of the tax administration and that Trump is not afraid of the tax authorities, but of the voters.
Clinton's campaign has published tax returns until 2007.
Clintons, currently residing in Chappaqua, New York State, paid on average 32% of the actual federal tax between 2007 and 2014 and the actual combined tax rate they paid was around 40.5%.
According to Clinton's 2015 tax declaration, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was paid.
Their main investment was a maasculated ISI fund, and Clinton reported a dividend and interest income of $100,000.

Tomatoes filled with Chili powder in support of the protection of elephants in Tanzania
Natural protectors in Tanzania have discovered an unusual way to keep the elephants away from human settlement – the elephants are ashamed to throw out the condoms filled with chill powder for them.
Keino has proved to be effective, and a few years ago, the Honeyguide Foundation, in conjunction with the United States Nature Conservancy, has launched a campaign aimed at teaching volunteers in northern Tanzania how to protect their homes and farmers without harming elephants.
Some time ago, spears were used to silence elephants.
Friday is the world's elephant day dedicated to the protection of animals.
“We have seen the attitudes changed in these villages, because now the villagers can trust that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without harming them,” says Damian Bell, CEO of the Honeyguide Foundation in his press release.
First, intrusive elephants are ashamed by showing the flashlight and playing the horn.
If this doesn't work, we'll throw a so-called Chilipilvi.
The blended chill powder is placed in a condom together with a receptacle, and then the head of the condom is fastened in such a way that only the ignition thread is left outside.
When the ignition wire is lit, the condom will blow open and spread into the air a fine chill powder cloud.
Usually, one of the spice clouds is enough to drive the elephant away.
The last way is to throw a potion that shoots up the fire of joy that is known as a Roman candle and creates a loud and bright explosion.
The Jewish film director criticised the Berlin hotel for removing Israel's reference number from the Arab community – - RT News
The French film director, who was just a Jew, gave birth to the media trail after he revealed that the Berlin Kempinski Bristol hotel did not mention Israel's reference number in his land code list.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Shoah document on holocaust, was frustrated by writing an open letter to the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ).
On his recent visit, Lanzmann tried to find the hotel's guide code list for Israel.
However, it was not mentioned among the countries to which the room can be called directly.
\"How it is possible in Berlin in 2016, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been completely destroyed – as if it did not exist,
Lanzmann writes.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol offers the opportunity to call Israel through a separate call center.
The film director asked for an explanation about the hotel's reception.
Lanzmann writes in his reply to the receptionist upset him.
The recipient said that the removal of Israel from the list was a decision which was carefully considered by the management of the Kempinski Hotels.
The reason behind the procedure was even more upset by the film director.
According to Lanzmann, the official said: “The vast majority of our guests are Arabs, and they call for the removal of Israel’s reference number.
Suddeutsche Zeitung, the German Ambassador of Israel, Yakov Hadas-Handelsman, said that the case was “a great shame. ”
\"The recovery will knock us down and upset us all.
It's a shame.
And the more shameful it is when we consider that we are in Germany and that this is exactly the hotel chain.
There's no need for any more explanations.
We expect the hotel to draw the correct conclusions, says the ambassador.
The case caused quite a counter-reaction online, where it was called scandalous.
Some accused the Kampinski Hotel of simply giving up on the claims of the Asian customers.
“While” was stated in a publication that revealed the location of the hotel near the synagogue in Kurfurstendamm street.
Der Spiegel writes that the hotel had denied the charges quickly, called a mistake and apologized to Lanzmann.
“The order to leave Israel was never given out of the list of reference numbers, ” writes Suddeutsche Zeitung Kempinski Hotel’s representative.
It adds that the reference number has since been added to the list.
The police used tear gas and rubbers for the demonstration of Brazilian students
Students and police were brought together in Sao Paulo on Thursday, when they gathered together to show their mind about the government's reform of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubbers against protestors.
Mellake began when law enforcement authorities tried to break down the student group, resulting in police using rubber and tear gas.
Hundreds of students who wanted to show their perseverance to government plans were involved in the demonstration.
Mr Gerald Alckmin, Governor of the State of Sao Paulo, has proposed a savings measure with almost 100 public schools closed and 300 000 students invested in new schools.
Some of the protestors did graffiti on the walls where they were temporarily opposed to Michel Temer, who held the President's office.
The student demonstration took place only a few days after the streets were filled with the disfellowshiped President Dilma Roussef's protestors when voting for the Senate of the country on this matter.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71% – RT Business
After the exit of the package, the annual trade exchange between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9%, says the Russian Ambassador Levan Dzhagaryan.
According to him, the interest of Russian companies in business in Iran has increased since international sanctions against Iran were abolished.
“The Russian companies continue their relations with Iran, while the new companies are ready to enter the market.
The further increase in trade is, of course, one of the priority objectives of cooperation between countries, says Dzhagaryan.
He notes that during the first five months of 2016, trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015 and increased to USD 856 million.
“In particular, Russia’s exports to Iran rose rapidly by 91.5%, to USD 697 million.
Russian imports from Iran grew by 16 per cent to 158 million dollars.
The sale of machinery, land vehicles and weapons, says the ambassador.
Dzhagaryan also expects a record of Iranian tourists to travel to Russia this year.
“In the last year, the Russian foreign representation in Iran granted some 35,000 visas to Iranian citizens, most of which were travel visas.
In addition, Iran was, for the first time, among the first 20 countries of the tourist destination, whose citizens traveled in Russia.
And it is not too daring to say that the record of Iranian tourists travelling to Russia is broken this year, he says.
The number of Russian tourists in Iran is relatively small, and the ambassador hopes that they will change.
“I can personally recommend travelling to the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, who have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition,” he says.
Scotti Callum Skinner would go to paint when the British won the cycling gold
The Scottish Callum Skinner would praise the reputation of the men's team prince at Rio's velodrom last night, when the British Triangle defended the 2012 won championship in London.
Glassgowlainen 23-year-old Skinner was in the role of an anchor, which he inherited from his countryman Sir Chris Hoy from Scotland. The young man made the legend proud to thank the goal and win the victory from the New Zealand team.
Britain took the surprise victory four years ago when Hoy won her fifth, six, Olympics.
And they repeated the pace after they had settled only in the sixth of March at the World Championships in London, despite the fact that Hoy had left his career in competition.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of Jamie Staff specialising in the role of the first leader.
The price came out just the right time.
The Hoy decision to end the race also left the hole that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
The Scottish Skinner was a man to whom British trainers believed and in which they saw the potential he now redeemed.
Hindes, Hoy with the championship four years ago won by Kenny and Skinner made the Olympics an exhibition in time, but the first round in New Zealand was faster.
And the British Triangle won gold in the duel.
Hindes was exactly behind his tour, but Kenny was working on the team's leadership, which Skinner maintained.
A large part of the change was to change the strategy in such a way that the Hindes drove the pace to slow down by a greater shift, which enabled Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoy followed him as a BBC commentator and reached the Skinner, Kenny and Hindes' view of them when they entered the prize school.
Glasgowlainen 23-year-old Skinner says: “I’m flattered by the parallel.
I'm just trying to do my best and succeed.
We did the Olympics in the final, and we won the world champions.
It was amazing.
There's no better way to win it.
After winning London 2012 Hindes, together with Kenny and Hoy, admitted that he fell on the track deliberately due to a bad exit.
Later, he withdrew his word, and British competitors did not have a complaint.
This time, there were no problems related to the success of the sovereign.
Hindes says: “The feeling was like London, and all the flags of Britain were flying down in the audience.
Our team was united over the last three months.
We've lost so many world championships that victory in the Olympics seems amazing.
In other words, one competition, one gold medal for a country that won seven out of ten railways, both in Beijing and London.
If this is a measure of progress over the last five months, there will be a successful five days of debt.
As Kenny has shown his abilities, it is not impossible to imagine that he repeats Hoy's achievements and wins three Olympics in one of the Olympics.
This would mean getting out of the account on the six gold medals and on a one-way basis Kenny, who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoyta and was born on March 23 (as the magical date of British sports, which is also Steve Redgraven, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister).
It would be the same with Hoy.
Kenny will compete next in a sprint that starts today and settle in three days.
A Boltonian 28-year-old Kenny says: “I can only rejoice at this moment.
The team competition is always the best.
You can enjoy the victory together with your friends.
It's a little lonely to win alone.
He says: “If he wins two more gold medals, he must receive the value of the knight.
This was the only medal contest of the day, but Britain received more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke, and Owain Doull were the fastest of four men in the team team run.
Their time was 3:51.943.
The world record that was made in London in 2012 and which won gold is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (klo 22.42) will compete today on the second day of competition, and the focus of the attention will certainly be Wiggins.
He had a dispute with competition operators yesterday before the time when the operators invited him to measure his length.
In the corresponding women's competition, which will continue and end tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker, and Katie Archibald from Milgavia achieved world record time 4:13.26.60.
The British team can now trust that its great cycling team will take responsibility for the middle stage of the Olympic Games and bring a set of medals to the country.
After the actual exceptional demonstrations in Beijing and London, the expectations before Rio have been underestimated.
The background has been dramas, the least of which is not the termination of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of the claims of sex and bullying, and the end of the major athletes, such as Hoy and Victoria Pendelton.
However, the competitions held on the first night on the velodorum show that the already legendary reputation of Britain rises to the top at a perfect moment.
The future of Portland’s merger in the face of the end of the electricity contract
The future of the aluminium alloy in Portland, the state of Victoria, and thus the jobs of thousands of workers are at stake when the power company supplying electricity to the melting plant reported that one of the owners of the plant is about to cancel the delivery contract and it is expected that all delivery contracts will be terminated.
This is the result of the decision of the Victorian Government earlier this year not to continue the aid for which the factory is kept in operation.
A fixed aid of 20 years will cease in November.
Even 2,000 jobs are at risk from Alcoan Portland.
As a result, even 2000 direct or indirect jobs may be at risk.
The snowball effect can continue to grow, as the melting plant consumes about 10% of Victoria’s total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed Point Henry's merger, resulting in the closure of the English power plant last year.
The Alcoan Portland merger is losing money and is in danger of closing its doors.
The measures are in line with the years of the future of the factory, which, first of all, caused by Australia’s strong dollar and the recent factory’s production price.
AGL, which supplies power to a large aluminium alloy from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, says that it is expected that the other three merger owners will cease their contract.
As a majority owner, Alcoa and Alumina are joint ventures, owned by the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp own minority shares in the factory.
AGL says that it is waiting for the Portland production plant to operate permanently, which means that physical demand for electricity will continue from the melting plant.
The AGL states that the agreements are covered by so-called safeguard agreements, which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The termination period shall be 12 months and shall end in 2017.
‘As a result, AGL expects contracts to generate revenue in the financial year 2017-, says the power plant.
The potential return effects on AGL from the year 2018 to the year 2018 are currently limited by strong future market prospects for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL already says that it has reduced the value of contracts in its accounts by EUR 187 million as an advance to the termination of contracts.
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the agreements does not affect Alcoa's capacity to keep the merger operating or to secure the supply of electricity to the melting plant.
The American company reported that it had entered into a 20-year agreement with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to enter into force from November of this year, even though it still needs to find out why it has now withdrawn.
In view of the weak economic situation in the sector, analysts have been careful to assess both the melting plant in Portland in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.
Stephen Mikkelsen, an operational director of AGL, reported earlier in his speech to analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity at annual level and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
‘If these plants leave the market, this means a significant decline in demand (electricity) markets.
As a producer, it would not be good news for us, says Mikkelsen.
Cardashinit TV star Kendall as a cover girl for September Vogue
The fourth daughter of Kendall Jenner, Kendall Jenner, who is part of the Cardashian-Jenner clan, and his mother and managers, is the fourth daughter of Kendall Jenner, 20, who poses in the famous September issue of Vogue.
Kendall, who is the commercial growth of Este Lauder and has appeared in the fashions of Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday's Instagram account.
“ Looking at someone in a room full of my loved ones brought me to tears, ” Kendall wrote.
The release of the cover was a strange (or perhaps just following the Cardashianit series style?), a handbooked video of all members of the Kardashian-Jenner family (bairwives Rob and Caitlyn and everyone's favorite producer, Ryan Seacrest, who forgot his sister's cover. The video ends with a classic reverse: they were all planning a surprise party for their sister.
The plot is cliché, and it is used in almost all birthday days of the program (Secrest says: “You thought we had forgotten you, as sincerely as a child’s morning-TV cartoon), but Krisin had to get his other daughters involved in this publicity in some way.
Its appearance in Vogue's September issue means an undisputed new era of the Cardashianis.
Kendall's great-grandfather Kim could get to Vogue before (he appeared on Vogue's deck together with his husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue is exactly his own class.
September number is Vogue's most sold publication per year.
In fact, the number that resembles a fashion magazine attracts a large number of advertisers (the site of Fashion reduced the number of 615 pages in the 832 page teaching last year).
The publication of the newspaper of September number is expected to be so intense that in the previous two years, the images of the magazine have been released even before the official publication.
Previously on \"Naomi Campbell\", Linda Evangel, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have been more famous works of the model than models that are famous.
The Oscar winner and Dior-Manoskasvo Jennifer Lawrence were in the cover in 2013, and one year later, Lady Gaga was honored.
The paper describes Jenner as a success model for his generation, and although he would rather read among the famous works of the model, he is in quite good association.
These celebrities are not known for relatives, true-TV stars or children of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these).
They can rightly be called talented women who succeed in the entertainment industry more than others.
The Beyonce, who was in the cover last year, has one of the strongest years of his career, when he published his Lemonade album.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
Because of his real-TV status, Jenner's position in the fashion world will always be dark.
In June, Victoria's Secret's original model Stephanie Seymour criticised Jenner and his colleague Gigi Hadidi by calling them \"the horns\"...
These feelings have re-enacted the surface when the news about Jenner's presence on Vogue's deck came out.
However, it seems unlikely that the continued inconsistency will continue to grow.
Kendall Jenner is the cover model of Vogue's September number.
He's a super model, in the purest sense of the word.
He walks into Marc Jacobs' fashion show.
He's the commercial show of Este Lauder's music plants.
He and all his sisters are selling pictures of themselves through paid applications.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter, which he shot at the LIVE magazine.
And in his spare time, he appears on a real TV, maybe only as a way to meet his sister and his children.
Legal aid centres turn back 160 000 people per year
Every year more than 160 000 people in the most vulnerable countries will be turned out from legal aid centres and the sector will prepare for the effects that additional cuts in appropriations will already have on centres with extreme borders.
In the Netherlands, three of the five people already apply for legal aid and three of them – most of them are elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence and unjustified emigrations and similar injustices without resources.
Public legal assistance services with already overburdened burden are preparing for further cuts in appropriations.
As of June next year, legal aid centres are in danger of losing 30% more from federal funding.
James Farrell, Director of the Queensland Public Legal Aid Centre, tells us that according to the latest calculation report prepared by the National Organisation for Legal Aid Centres, thousands of people are already displaced annually.
If the federal government doesn't turn its decision, Farrell says it's just going to get worse.
“Queensland’s public legal aid centres are constantly under-represented, which means that thousands of people are being turned away when they seek out the necessary services, ” says Farrell.
\"The people who leave the vital relationships, the people under the invincible and depressing burden of debt, the families that are resigning, the workers who have been unwarrantedly fired – all have problems with legal matters, and this report shows that they are unable to get the help they need.
The Federal Government intends to cut funding by 30% from June 2017, which means that thousands of people with the weakest positions in Queensland will face complex legal problems without any help.
We call on the Chancellor of Justice and the Queensland Senator George Brand to give up these financial cuts immediately so that people can get the legal assistance they need.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its promise to bring legal aid to the national central level.
It is now time to take into account the needs of public legal aid centres and their clients, and the Government of Palasczuki must invest in this important work.
The Donald Trump campaign was brought up against the threat of an employee with a gun.
New York: The Donald Trump campaign was brought up when no action was expected to be taken after it was informed that the leader of the campaign in North Carolina had threatened an employee with a gun while they were driving to Jeep in February.
The event is described in a complaint from the former software teacher of the state campaign, Vincent Bordini, brought up on Wednesday before the State Court in Charlotte.
The Bordini says that he waited months for the situation to be handled inside the campaign before he, according to his own words, understood that this would not happen.
In his complaint, Bordini says that the campaign leader Earl Phillip put out a pistol, put his right front finger on the trigger, and put a pipe in Vincent's knee-sucker.
Following the complaint, the local and regional management of the campaign, Bordini learned that at least four other persons had experienced the same with Phillip.
Even if the gun doesn't trigger it, it's an accident, says Bordini.
It will only be two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused public rage when he said to the crowd in North Carolina that \"the supporters of the second extension, who will be held as gun owners and gunkeepers, can take action if his opponent Hillary Clinton wins the election and can be elected judges.
According to Trump's campaign staff, the media removed his word from the context and Trump did not say violence.
In his complaint to the campaign, I call for compensation for the uninterruptedness of the campaign, and for Phillip’s compensation for the abuse, assault and emotional suffering they have caused.
Trump's informant Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a message asking him to comment.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Charlotte's local news agency WCCB told me Phillip recently left a campaign.
No immediate answer was received for the call request submitted to Phillip's consulting company, Innovation Consulting Services.
The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been conducting a controversial campaign.

Britain must use the Olympics to expand Heathrow
Heathrow also stimulates the economy and creates prosperity – not only in local communities and London, but throughout the country.
For myself, this was the point that was most interested in Heathrow. As in London’s Olympics in 2012 we made a huge contribution to the benefit of our entire nation and all our regions.
The Olympics had enormous benefits for Stratford and East End.
We will do this again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses near Heathrow.
For local communities alone, we create 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40 000 new jobs, which eliminates youth unemployment in nearby areas of the airport.
As in London’s Olympics 2012, there are always people who believe that the expansion of Heathrow is too great a challenge.
As far as Olympics are concerned, I have learned that Britain will never be ready for them and that we will face an awkward situation in the eyes of the rest of the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they're going to be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to be overcome, but Heathrow answers every question he asked.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is also an infrastructure project that benefits many people instead.
Enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 180 000 new jobs and increase the economy by 211 billion pounds, bringing skills and employment to both the airport environment and the UK as a whole.
We have Heathrow's great working group, which has taken place on time and by staying in the budget of 11 billion pounds of infrastructure investment programme, which included the T5 terminal – which has been voted for the best flight terminal of the year in two consecutive years – and the T2 terminal, which was built in the middle of the two world's cramped runways.
They are now ready to produce the third runway, supported by a private investment of GBP 16 billion.
The London Olympics in 2012 were a great success for our country, and I am convinced that it will also be the expansion of Heathrow.
It is time for us to use the same Olympic spirit for the expansion of Heathrow so that we can guarantee the future of our trade and create know-how and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Board of Heathrow and former secretary of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus and Facebook advertisement in cat mouse games
The efforts of companies that earn their money from online advertising have become a cat-hiri-play, says one company producing Esto-programmes.
On Thursday, only two days after Facebook had announced its own website to prevent advertising accident programs, Adblock Plus published a blog in which it told us that users can update their esto software filters and thus again prevent community service advertising.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that he would change the advertising codes on his desktop site, making it more difficult to identify which parts of the page are advertising.
Now, however, Adblock tells us that he's figured out the new codes.
Adblock's informant, Ben Williams, wrote in his blog report that \"a full-time balling between the open source code advertising community and the copyists has been under way ever since the advertising project was invented, and that it is possible that Facebook will soon make its own repairs again.
The fact that the largest social media company in the world has been involved in the fight is a strong indication of how much concern the advertisingists have formed in the sector.
Globally, 200 million people use advertising works programmes, reports the study of Pagefair and Adobe last year. The figure has almost been fourfolded since 2013.
Facebook uses 1.03 million active users on mobile devices daily and mobile advertising accounts for 84% of advertising revenues on Facebook.
However, the company intends to invest in misleading advertising programmes in its desktop application, as according to the informant, mobile advertising esto programmes do not work in Facebook’s mobile applications and Instagram.
The revenue from Desktop advertising is still large enough, so Facebook considered it to be profitable.
On Tuesday, Facebook also told us to update the advertising tool for user settings so that users can control more how advertisements are assigned to them.
On Thursday, Facebook criticises Adblock's new filters as it also prevents some of the ordinary Facebook entries.
“This is not a good experience for users, and we are going to solve the problem,” said the Facebook notifier in his e-mail.
The advertising programmes are colluded and ineffective, and instead we have invested in the development of user regulations such as advertising tools in order to enable people to control the targeting of advertising themselves.
A woman committed suicide by leaving cars under a Swiss motorway
The victim lay on a highway in the middle of the night.
The police are asking for the help of the eyewitness on a motorway, as the first accident that occurred on Thursday, where a woman deliberately left herself under several cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 motorway in Vadi's canal near Morges shortly after midnight.
A woman did her desperate act by laying on a dark road, and more cars hit her, says Vadi's police when she was informed.
The victim was a 49-year-old Swiss woman, and her attempt was clearly a suicide.
She died at the scene.
According to the police, many of the carers involved in the accident have already been interviewed, but some have not yet been identified, and the police are asking them or other witnesses of the accident to report.
Lawyer Gilleshofstetter says in Le Tribune de Geneva that criminal investigation has been initiated, which is a logical step in this situation.
However, it remains to be seen whether charges against those who have been involved in the accident are being charged.
Is it impossible to avoid a collision?
It's left to the D.A. to find out,\" says Hofstetter.
Over the last five years, there have been two similar cases of non-responsibility for drivers.
According to the newspaper, in both cases a person walked in a dark motorway and the right to decide that drivers cannot expect to run into his pedestrian on a motorway in the middle of the night.
Last year, the police were released from a charge against him, which had been raised from the death penalty after he hit a man who slept on the A1 motorway near Paynerne one night in August 2014.
The court heard that a 22 - year - old victim had enjoyed plenty of alcohol and passed out on the road.
The Court considered that the method of driving a police officer, which was in response to an emergency call, was justified and the man lying on the road was in an exceptional and unforeseeable situation.
On Thursday, near Morges' accident, some well-known people are invited to call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus has been viable
According to NASA's new climate model estimates, Venus may have been viable.
NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) developed a model to explore Venus’s past with the same tools and algorithms as those used by climate scientists.
The purpose of the model was to determine whether the conditions in Venus could sometimes have been similar to those on the planet, even though Venus is hot and anhydrous and its gas charge is almost entirely composed of carbon dioxide.
According to previous presentations of researchers, Venus’s slow rotation speed is explained by its thick gas supply.
However, on the basis of the latest simulations, it can be assumed that Venus had a thin atmosphere similar to that of the earth, and has, in spite of it, been slowly rounded.
The model was also used to figure out the shape of the early Venus surface.
There were probably more dry areas on the planet than in Earth, but there may have been enough water and geographical variation to maintain life and prevent rapid degradation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 per cent smaller.
“In GISS’s design Venus is slowly running, and its day-to-day is almost two months away from the sun,” explains GISS’s researcher in the press release of Anthony Del Genio.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick cloud. Pilvikörs works like a umbrella and protects the surface from large parts of the sun’s heat.
As a result, the average temperature of the climate is up to a few degrees lower than the current temperature of the earth.
The model created Venus's story, which corresponds to previous assumptions about its development costs.
Even though Venus may have been viable, it has been exposed to excessive heat and UV light for several billions of years.
Its oceans faded, and the ultrasound light burned steamed water.
In Vedy's karate to space, there was only a thick carbon dioxide gas charge and a deadly greenhouse effect – i.e. Venus as it is today.
The researchers reported the results of the new Venus airspace model in the Gephysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is giving up his place as Avalanchen Coach
Patrick Roy resigned on Thursday as coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and vice president of the hockey company, calling for the lack of influence in the team's decision making.
Joe Sakic, Vice President of Colorado, confirmed the news and announced that the Society will immediately begin to apply for a new coach.
\"For the last three years, I've been the head coach of the Colorado Avalanche team and the vice president of the hockey industry, with a firm, passion and determination,\" says 50-year-old Roy in his communication.
“In the summer, I have long and hard thought about how I can improve the team, give it the depth necessary and raise it to a higher level.
In order to achieve this, the Vice-President of the hockey activity of the coach and the Society must be fully in line with the organisation.
He must also have a say in decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who hired Roy on 23 May 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
\"Patrick told me his decision today,\" says Sakic.
“We are grateful for everything that he has done for our organization, and we wish him everything good for the future.
Roy was awarded Jack Adams Award as the best coach for the league year in his first period as Avalanchen’s head coach for 2013-2014.
With his leadership, the Society reached 112 points and won the central division, but Colorado lost to Minnesota in the playoff games and had not reached the next two years.
Avalanche achieved 39-39-4 power points for the period 2015-2016 and stayed five points away from the Minnesota Wild in the second Wild Card place at the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame painter Roy won four Stanley Cups on his career – two in the Montreal Canadiens lines and two in the Avalanchen lines.
The oil workers in the North Sea start negotiations and stop the strike
The main negotiators will tell the oil industry of the North Sea pay gap when all the parties in the dispute participate in the new round of negotiations.
The Wood Group, which offers oil field services, has been held up against warehouses in the North Sea, in drilling cars under the control of Royal Dutch Shell.
According to the Joint Declaration by the Parties: \"Wood Group and trade unions Unite and RMT confirm that they have agreed to re-establish the process in order to resolve the dispute:
From the beginning of the next week, we will have a number of ongoing meetings over the next few weeks, dealing with recent issues.
The trade unions have recently established their activities, which, according to them, were their first for more than 25 years, as a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30%.
Due to negative market pressures, Wood Group cuts around 9 per cent of its contractors in the North Sea this year.
The reduction in company tariffs is in line with the decrease in prices of contractors working in countries by 10% in 20114.
According to the company, further cuts will give it the space to move, which is necessary for it to cope with the fall in the market.
Shell, on the other hand, has costed thousands of workers on its salary lists and announced plans to leave oil and gas drilling activities in up to 10 countries, which is how it seeks to enhance its operations after its mega merger with the British Energy Company BG Group.
The lower crude oil prices and the economic situation, which is the result of the UK decision to leave the European Union in June, create pressure on energy companies.
Mr Dave Anderson, a Scottish Member, met with the labour leaders earlier this week in order to discuss one of the major work reports that the North Sea has experienced for a whole generation.
According to him, the North Sea is vital to the region's economy.
“In the North Sea and the whole country, we need a economy that is of benefit to many, not just to the few,” says Anderson.
New North Sea projects are expected to be less than $1 billion in 2016, with around $7 billion spent over the last five years.
Kepler measure the speed of the stars in the Pikadie Star Force
The latest task of the Kepler Spacescope has been to measure the speed of speed of the stars, which has helped the astronauts to collect the most comprehensive list of the speeds of the stars in the Pikadie Star Force.
Based on new data, astronauts are able to determine why stars in the same universe run at different speeds and how tour times relate to planet formation.
“We hope that by comparing the results with other stars, we will learn more about the relationship between weight and age and even about the history of its solar system, ” says Researcher Luisa Rebull at the Caltech University in Pasadena, in the press release.
The star force of Pikadie is located 445 light years away from the Earth.
Many stars have been born about 125 million years ago, which means that they are about to reach their adult age.
They're running faster than ever right now.
With the speed of rotation at the top of the adult stars, large amounts of stars are dissipated.
These winds have a profound effect on the stars on their progress through the magnetic fields of the stars.
As the star ages, its speed of rotation begins to slow down.
Kepler will measure the speed of rotation for each star by monitoring the time between the appearance of the visible high-speed (which corresponds to the sun clouds).
The latest listed rotation speed data indicate that larger stars run slower than smaller stars.
Rebull compares stars to the dancers – the greater the bikes are slower than the smaller ones.
“We see Pikadie’s dance – that the slow ones are typically larger, whereas the fastest wheels are typically very light stars,” Rebull says.
Because of the close proximity of the Pikadie stars, it works as an ideal space laboratory to compare the attributes of the stars to the speeds of the rotation.
“Plaidi’s starring team offers a support pillar for theoretical models, both the younger and the older stars, ” says Rebull.
We want to get a lot more information on how, when and why the stars slow their running speeds and end their dances.
Rebull and his colleagues will present their latest analysis of the rolling speeds of the Pelades in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomic Journal publication.
