The Prague stock exchange has been reduced to the end of the trade
The Prague stock exchange corrected its losses after the fall of the morning.
Transactions with shares in the Czech Energy Industry (ČEZ) are estimated at close to half of the usual daily trading.
The Prague Stock Exchange continued to fall from the beginning of the Tuesday trade when it fell by almost six percent.
This time, the fall in Wall Street shares is behind the decline.
We also have a market reaction to the outcome of the American Parliament vote, which rejected support for the stabilisation plan of the financial sector there.
Posting shares in Asia
On the Asian stock exchange, a dramatic fall in shares was taken over on Tuesday, although indicators during the day were eventually deleted from some of the losses.
The Hongkongi Hang Seng stock exchange index wrote almost four percent during the trading, but later, part of the losses were deleted and reduced to about 2.5 percent.
In Hong Kong stock exchange, Hang Seng China Enterprises Index fell by 3.8 percent, markets were closed in Shanghai.
The stock exchange in Sydney lost more than five percent, but eventually losses decreased to 4.3 percent.
The stock exchange in Taiwan fell by 3.6 percent in the index there.
“The timing of the U.S. rescue is uncertain and affects the world’s money markets, ” noted Joseph Yam, Head of Financial Council in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong, although China is part of its own monetary policy, regardless of the Chinese central bank.
In Hong Kong, interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
According to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, American lawmakers should start negotiations immediately and the financial system support proposal should be adopted.
Otherwise, the threat is that other countries can understand the consequences of this.
U.S. shares' bloodbath
On Monday, the U.S. Parliament rejected the draft financial support for which $700 billion (almost 12 billion) should have been spent.
The legislators thus ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
Bush said that the draft would solve the main causes of the financial crisis and help stabilise the economy as a whole.
On Monday, American shares have been living in a bloodbath and the leading stock indices have been registered for the greatest fall in 20 years.
Dow Jones had almost seven percent, a similar fall in 1987.
The index was already before the vote, but as it turned out, the proposal was not accepted in the Parliamentary House, the index was released.
The Congress has come back: the US government can pump $700 billion into the banks.
The main leaders of the American Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush agreed on financial assistance in the wider form of the agreement and for the American financial system.
That's what they're voting for at the beginning of next week.
In negotiations on the approval of the rescue plan, US legislators have reached a breakthrough in the form of financial assistance for the US financial system of USD 700 billion (including the 12 billion increase).
But there's no win yet.
The Convention must complete some of the elements of the agreement before they can disclose the final form and vote of the law.
The draft financial system support will be discussed in the Parliamentary House on Monday.
On Sunday, Reuters informed the news agency Barney Frank, Chairman of the Committee of Financial Organisations.
According to senate sources, you can probably vote on the draft as soon as possible on Wednesday.
According to civil servants, it should be announced that the rescue plan will be approved, which is the first important psychological factor for the conversion of money markets.
However, thanks to the complexity of the mechanisms, there will be “silvering. ”
Paulson: The plan must be effective
“We have taken a great step.
We have solved our differences in our views on the form of the market stabilisation package,\" said the Bloomberg Agency for Democratic Nancy Pelosi.
He thinks the final vote can take place on Sunday.
The lawmakers met Henry Paulson on Saturday night with the U.S. Minister of Finance to give a final form to the government fund.
This should purchase non-sale mortgage assets from financial companies, which would cause financial companies to lose serious losses and jeopardise the stability of the entire system.
\"We are grateful for the final agreement on a draft that will work and which must be effective on the market at the same time.
The corrective draft must continue, but I think we are there,\" said Paulson.
Marking for Asian trade
The global financial crisis has a significant impact on the stock markets, which are slowing down.
According to Senator Harry Reid, the lawmakers are therefore seeking to agree at Congress on Sunday.
This is why they want to reassure investors before the start of trade in Asian money markets, where, due to the time zone, Congress's decision on Monday would have a first impact on trade.
However, it is not yet clear whether the two chambers of the American Congress will vote on the law, as is not the case at the last minute because of a problem.
Lawmakers hope that the law will be approved in the next few days.
However, the law is going through a number of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system shall be divided into two parts.
According to President George Bush's request, the first USD 350 billion should be available as soon as possible.
However, the Congress may block the issue of the remaining amount, which was set at another USD 100 billion and subsequently USD 350 billion, provided that it will have a feeling that the programme does not function.
Bush assessed progress in negotiations
Although this decision may be taken by the President, Congress may, however, overruled.
Despite these changes, however, the underlying idea of the programme, which was the acquisition of material assets for the purchase of the wrong mortgage securities losing their value, has remained, as hundreds of thousands of Americans are unable to cancel their mortgage loans.
\"We've worked everything out.
On the law, the House of Representatives should be able to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday, said Senator Judd Gregg Republican.
The progress made in the negotiations has also been welcomed by the President of Bush.
Mr Fratto, the spokesperson for Bush said that the president was satisfied with the Saturday progress and appreciates “the stabilisation of our financial markets and the protection of our economy.
Limiting bus end-burns
Christopher Dodd, President of the Senate Banking Committee, said that the legislators agreed on the financial responsibility for the programme, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of discounts and the timing of the draft funding.
The new law also restricts the performance of so-called bus-bus executives in the programme, and establishes a committee that monitors the basis.
The fund should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
“We worked hard on this and made great progress towards an agreement that will work and that will be useful for all Americans, ” Paulson said.
The plan also accounts for assistance to owners who have problems with the cancellation.
The government's mortgage purchases should create new deleters, with the aim of reducing the monthly write-offs of the debtors and enabling them to retain their houses.
Marek: Legal aid
David Marek, head of Patria Finance, says it's a good idea, but it's going to be very difficult to implement.
“It is because it is not possible to know what mechanism and price of problem-related active substances will be purchased.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government share losses between each other, ” said Marek, the website of iHNed.cz this week.
According to Marek, it is not so important that the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week.
“It is much more important that the Congress has already decided this week that the plan is supported, and as soon as possible, they will be blessed.
The spiritual importance of reaching an agreement on the approval of the plan is the most important thing at this moment,\" said Marek.
Double-floor pengela: MP3 player versus mobiles.
We help you choose
While almost every mobile can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a call.
It seems clear that it is only better to buy a phone.
Still, there are many reasons for you to get a separate MP3 player.
The choice depends entirely on how to use it and the needs of the future owner.
It's probably hard to get home a high-quality high-quality record player to listen to that latest Maxim Turbulenc album.
On the one hand, such music products do not appear on billboards, but there is no objective reason for this from a qualitative point of view.
However, if the shelf is filled with art rock, jazz or blues bagelite plates, it is likely that they dream of such a type.
This is similar to that intended for travel, i.e. compressed - simplified with MP3 music.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some, it can be unacceptable to issue eight thousand crowns for a player, as a Pink Floyd fan is likely hard to accept a 20-inch market earphone.
Two extremities, each of which has enough space.
There's a wide range.
The life span of the elements also counts
Some high-quality music players can do much more than just playing music, but also for what most mobiles are not at random.
No device is universal like the phone.
Besides the primary features, phone calls and text messages, you can play music and video, take both up, have a better-serious camera, even navigational.
And if we take into account the smartphones and communicators, she'll have a little computer in her pocket.
It's a miracle, since no fridge can grill and no television can shoot.
Multi-function mobiles have disadvantages.
The more functions you use on your mobile, the more you send the display to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy players.
Few mobile devices can play music for more than ten or twelve hours, much less.
In this respect, musical players (especially the simplest ones) are significantly more efficient.
On cheap phones, that's why you're not gonna play for more than a few hours.
If you make a phone call or call here, you should get even a charger for your job in order to be safe - it also applies to more expensive devices.
MP3 players will not have such a problem, even worse ones will be able to handle at least 9 hours of continuous operation with a charge.
The next problem arises when the music is added to your mobile.
Unfortunately, only a limited part of the devices has universal USB converter and not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few card readers can cope with adapter without mobile miniature memory cards.
The player does not need any special software with some exceptions (iPod).
Enough device from your computer to load music through USB.
The majority of mobiles and players already create their own musical library on the basis of the name of the performer, the album, the genre, or, for example, the evaluation of the user.
Some devices represent only wooden structures like Windows Explorer, and you know some of them (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Crown, smart phones with operating systems).
Players are easier to handle, mobiles know more
In choosing a specific device, you should be interested in the life span of the battery, the capacity of the memory, the quality and type of audio output, and, of course, the comfort of treatment.
If the music serves you primarily as a background and listens only for a short period of time a day, for example, the phone that plays MP3 is suitable for you.
And it's really capable of any kind of cell phone.
You don't have to pay particular attention to what music formats the mobile or player knows.
With MP3, each of them will cope and the final majority of the music that comes to you will be in this form.
The MP3 is one of the most extensive, and the majority of devices are also dealing with music in the WMA format.
AAC (a format used by Apple and its iPod) occurs less.
Better mobile phones also allow for online music shopping.
Enough to visit the appropriate pages of the provider (or other service provider) via mobile internet and buy the song or album.
This service, in itself, can be a strong argument for obtaining a musical mobile.
Unfortunately, the supply of service providers is limited to only single radio bands.
Prices are neither low nor low.
In general, however, it can be assumed that music will dominate the music industry in the future, just like this (by GSM, Internet or wireless Internet).
Most people keep their mobile equipment on their own all the time.
Any time you want to hear something, you're going to use your cell phone in your pocket while the forgotten MP3 player at home is lying.
However, it also depends whether he always wears earphones or at least the extremisms.
If not, you can use an integrated speaker with almost all the phones, but only a few MP3 players.
Many of the musical phones are likely to have the greatest advantage of the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than three thousand crowns.
Between three and four thousand crowns, you can get a fair walkman.
In most cases, however, you are restricted to the absence of a conventional earphone exit.
The best and technically best-equipped phones can go to up to 12 thousand crowns with traditional 3.5 mm diameter earphones.
However, the advantage of playrs is not only easy handling.
The simplest - in no way is it necessary to treat the cheapest players (see our selection).
The minimum function, the treatment similar to the previous standard tape recorder or gramophone, is obvious.
There is no threat of collapse in the form of an accidentally activated mobile internet and no threat to the huge account subsequent to the transmission of data.
What kind of device to choose
The best mobiles (e.g. Vodafone 527) are usually open on interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD type, etc.).
You can also buy the right card into up to two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
Basic types only support cards with maximum capacity of up to 2GB.
Only the most expensive people can do with up to 8 GB memory cards.
If you have a mobile and even a cheap MP3 player you want to buy, choose the Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or irivers.
Based on capacity (max. 2 GB) you will not have to spend more than 1 100 kronors.
If you are part of a more demanding audience, choose special mobile walkers (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsungs).
These devices also have a separate MP3 control button, so the comfort of the treatment approaches the MP3 player.
In the sector, Sony Ericsson received the most beautiful user interface for the same walkman series mobiles than for the separate MP3 players.
The above mentioned brands can provide an MP3 player with the same service in the same portfolio up to four thousand, but with a larger memory capacity (at least 16 GB) and battery life (at the same time 15 hours, up to 35 hours).
The first virtual service provider goes to Czech Republic this year.
Maybe.
The Czech mobile market is relatively advanced and our service providers are practically offering the same services as their Western European partners.
Nevertheless, we lack something here - a virtual service provider that forces classical service providers to reduce their prices significantly.
Maybe it won't be long now.
We have already written on the Mobil.cz website many times that Czech service providers in Europe are among the most expensive.
This has also been confirmed by the CJU, which has pointed out that the price of sms in the Czech Republic is more expensive than other countries of the Union.
Following the last step by the European Commission to regulate roaming charges, it may be a controversial situation - Czech mobile operators will be cheaper than some foreign customers.
How is it possible that Czech prices are so high in comparison with Europe?
The answer is simple, there is no competition that really wants to fight.
That might sound conflicting, as we have three mobile networks and our penetrations are high above 100%.
On the contrary, mobile operators would like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In many cases, Pavel Dvořák, President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office, has agreed that there is no place for another service provider in the Czech Republic.
Perhaps it is true that the classic service provider has probably not had too much chance with its own network (which is likely to be difficult to find a frequency already).
However, there is another option - the virtual service provider.
A significant price reduction has just been introduced by virtual service providers on the mobile market, which would then have to be addressed by classical service providers.
In the meantime, even before the market for large fish, such as Tesco Mobile or Virginia Mobile in Great Britain, sounds like them were heard.
However, it has been demonstrated that such providers have their place and can indeed be successful.
However, for example, we do not need to go too far.
In February this year, we informed you about the start of the virtual mobile service provider in Poland.
This service provider was not able to obtain more than 100,000 customers in a period of six months and become the fifth largest service provider there.
Meanwhile, the Penta Financial Group is behind Mobilking, which is also owned by U:fon in the Czech Republic.
The advantage of virtual service providers is the possibility of focusing on a much narrower target group.
In order to function effectively, the traditional service provider needs much less customers.
It does not entail relatively high construction, mobile network operation and maintenance costs.
Virtual service providers in the world generally appear as low cost - cheap calls and texts, which are often offset by less services.
For example, Tesco Mobile from Great Britain offers at least 50 percent cheaper texts than its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a very good move for a target group.
This service provider is specifically focused on men.
“The real men choose the Mobiling service provider, who they like who they can trust, ” says David Seibert, CEO of Mobil Entertainment Company.
It's hard to tell if the idea like that of Poland can come into play with us.
Miroslav Čepický, the spokesperson of Vodafone, doubted: “The Czech market is relatively small in terms of the segmental approach on which the majority of virtual service providers are based.
In addition, it is relatively satisfied in terms of the supply of services –
In the Czech Republic there is no chance that mobile operators will claim
However, it seems almost certain that if there is a virtual service provider in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
“We are talking about the successful expansion of this project, but negotiations in the Czech Republic do not seem too promising.
The opening of Mobilking will take place in other countries of our region,” said Jana Studničkova, the speaker of the Penta Financial Group in his interview with Mobil.cz.
In general, it was demonstrated that the existing mobile operators in Czech Republic are not over-represented by this idea.
On the contrary, they are trying to do everything they can to avoid any potential competition.
The GTS Novera group has not been keeping its interest in the launch of a virtual service provider for some time in order to take another step in order to become a real competitor in the company's account.
“We are very interested in providing not only fixed services for our customers but also mobile telecommunications services.
The sooner, the better.
We have once again discussed this option with all Czech mobile operators.
Some of them have already made progress in the negotiations, says Pavel Kaidl, the spokesperson of the group.
Maybe it's better time.
From unofficial information, it seems that the first virtual service provider can be lucky by the end of the year.
However, his birth is now surrounded by an untapped hearing.
“At this moment, we do not think that a fully-valued virtual service provider is a place on the Czech market.
The Czech market is very special in contrast to other markets.
So far, we have not been invited by a subject offering a complex and serious project in this area, mentioned the press class of Vlastimil Sršeň, Telefónica 02.
Other providers also refer to the specific situation of the Czech market.
Martina Kemrova, the spokesperson for T-Mobile, exceptionally agreed with O2, adds: “We have not yet noted any viable and bilaterally beneficial business projects that could continue to be based on –
He added: “In the T-Mobile network at the end of the year it is unlikely that any virtual service provider would appear.
At this moment there should be a specific agreement on our table to think in such a short distance.
Vodafone's attention is rather to meet its 3G licence requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: “We are interested in negotiating with potential virtual service providers, particularly in the area of cost and infrastructure sharing.
This is exactly what we think of clients as the most affordable.
The main strategy for Vodafone in this area is to develop networks shared by fast mobile internet:
Responsible agencies - a string with service providers
The mobile service provider process can be easily understood and the entry of another provider would lead to an increase in competition, a price reduction and thereby a reduction in their profits.
So why make it easier for us to enter such a competition?
When service providers have something important, they can cooperate, they can also testify to the husavon around the birth of the U.fon.
The greatest pressure on the CNU is likely to be around the birth of the U.S. company T-mobile.
This is witnessed by publicly available information on the ČTU website.
But right now, the U:fon is a good argument why we should not allow the entry of the virtual service provider.
Martina Kemrova added: “The environment of competition in the mobile market has recently been affected by access to the fourth mobile market.
In view of the nature of the Czech mobile market, it is obvious that the entry of another player into the market and services would be subject to high requirements.
However, given this attitude of mobile operators, the complete lack of interest of Czech regulatory bodies is quite amazing.
At the same time, it is not just about ČTU's attitude, which, unfortunately, is in the Czech Republic - unlike Great Britain and other developed countries - has no right to intervene in economic competition.
This is the exclusive responsibility of the Economic Competition Authority.
However, the Office is typically in relation to the whole problem.
\"The entry of the virtual service provider into the mobile market would only be possible after the agreement between the mobile service provider and the virtual service provider on the renting of the necessary infrastructure.
So far, no such contract has been concluded, since the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for traditional service providers, said Kristián Chlapua, on the external linkage of the Economic Competition Office.
A statement made so by the representatives of the service providers would probably not surprise anyone.
However, from the office that should represent the interests of consumers and, in addition, ensure that no one can recover from its market situation, this is more than strange.
In particular, if Kristián Chalo is added: “In the country where virtual service providers generally operate, we can see that their steps to the market have contributed to reducing the price of mobile telephone services.
However, there is probably no pressure on the market environment to function properly and to reduce prices.
In the case of a real shock, there is a perfectly consistent response from the three mobile operators.
The question is, is it really just a coincidence, and it's almost self-evident.
As in charging stations, only works of random and tough competition would be the same as the full amount of petrol prices.
‘In this case, the Office has not discovered the signs of the anti-competitive procedure, so there is no reason to intervene in any way.
No service provider has a leading position, i.e. no more responsibility for its market facts.
The tools needed to open the mobile market for virtual service providers are likely to be missing for the telecommunications regulator, mentioned Chalica.
The presentation of the market leader is one of the many points of debate.
Of course, there is an analysis of the relevant markets developed by ČTU, based on which telecommunications is the sole market in terms of economic competition.
In such a market, of course, no Czech service provider is in a leading position.
However, some legal experts also offer a different approach - it is always necessary to approve the network operator for the establishment of a virtual service provider.
And the mobile service provider - relatively logical - has a monopoly on its own network.
So in a specific segment, it's necessary to be dominant.
But even if we do not accept this argument, it should be a minimum indicator for UOHS that three mobile operators are likely to act in the same way.
The complaints made by interested parties (including the already mentioned GTS Novera company) show that, during the negotiations with all service providers, there are very similar obstacles.
Its responsibility is to send to the U.S.U., a relatively normal trick in telecommunications, with which the U.S. will take your hands off the whole case.
We've already met in a few similar situations.
Unfortunately, in the text of the recently adopted telecommunications law, the expansion of the powers of the CAU in the field of economic competition has failed to pass through telecommunications, although this has led to a number of experts hoping to improve the situation.
This is what UOHS representatives need to know well, but it is likely that others are in their interests.
It works when no one's watching
Meanwhile, the operation of some sort of false virtual service providers, from which several Czech mobile networks already operate, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own mobile phone service price lists, but which are only partially public.
It's the same multilevel marketing company.
For example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their mobile services.
The price lists of these companies are usually only available to the selected.
The magic lies in the fact that the company is acting as a classic corporate client against the service provider, which provides a large amount of SIM card.
Then you will receive special offers (and other discounts) as a designated client.
The problem is that all Czech mobile operators are not subject to similar conditions of trade.
“If there were cases that we were talking about, it would be a breach of the terms of the contract that we would deal with, and which could lead to the completion of the cooperation with that company, he answered Martina Kemrova on our problem.
But it is unlikely that the news on this kind of activity would not have reached the responsible members of mobile operators.
In particular, thousands of customers may be involved in the three mentioned companies.
In the meantime, no service provider defends such a procedure.
They do not have negligible profits from these companies and, unlike real virtual providers, they do not threaten their own official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns about possible problems: “The law allows similar speculations, however, only uses a negligible percentage of customers’ services.
In addition, they must accept that their phone SIM card does not appear on their names, so that it cannot be fully provided as clients of mobile operators in general –
But the U.S.U. should at least be weird.
There is also another question for the NEWS.
If mobile operators fail to see a similar procedure, why do they prevent the birth of a virtual service provider?
It should be noted that UOHS has relatively strong rights to expose such activity, and if it does not, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the service providers that there has been no such evidence and that commercial conditions prohibit it.
When we won't be the most expensive
As has already been said a few times in the text, the entry of virtual service providers on the mobile market has brought a noticeable price reduction for services.
In practice, in all countries where virtual service providers were established, classical service providers tried to prevent them from becoming more or less established.
The arguments they used were practically identical - too small, perhaps too satisfied in the market, problems with the quality of services, etc.
However, in the developed countries at this very moment, regulators were involved, which in no way protected the interests of mobile operators, but their customers.
Then it was either formal measures or informal pressure that the first virtual service provider, followed by others, was established.
Unfortunately, Czech regulators are giving each other the whole case.
Based on our experience, we can't get rid of the impression that the undisputed competences are good for them in these cases.
But let's not give up the fight.
If the background information is good and the virtual service provider is really soon to appear, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the providers would allow a virtual mobile service provider to be established, it would be difficult for UOHS to avoid any further interested parties being rejected (discrimination).
And in relation to the rest of Europe, we may no longer be making more expensive calls.
The new Czech hymns have four new versions.
Select Best
Listen to four processings of the new Czech state hymns.
Sunday, Sunday, the Prime Minister of Mirek Topolá, on the day of the Czech State, presented the new recordings of the state anthem.
The hymnust was placed at the National Theatre Music Hall under the leadership of Jiří Bælohlávek.
Four versions are available - with male or female solo, band or instrument.
Kateřina Kněžínkova and Adam Plachetka sing.
The authors of the change of the hymnus Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz website.
The Czech national song is considered to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
The Czech Radio has already told us that it has chosen young representative speakers who are expressive and popular to sing the various variations.
“Although from the beginning, both of them, and later at the orchestra, I tried to take care of the pure division, the clarity of the text and the harmony, ” he said.
The Czech state hymn will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song “Where Is My Country? ” was first recorded in the Rendi Theatre in 1834 in Josef Kajetan Tyl Fidlovačka, accompanied by the music of Frantishek Skroup.
It became popular, and people were spontaneously considered their own.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the state hymns after Czechoslovakia was formed in 1918.
After the formation of the independent Czech Republic, one of the seven state symbols remained.
What the “new ” hymnus
The transport company in Prague will deliver a chip card for the first time on Wednesday
Wednesday, October 1, 2008, describes himself as a date in the history of the Prague Transport Company, when the first passenger in the metros, trams and buses will enter the first passenger with an electronic coupon in his pocket instead of a paper ticket.
The coupon is currently available at about 100 percent, who have the Opencard chip card.
Passengers can buy 30 days and 90 days and an annual coupon (which will be valid as of 1 January 2009) and at the same time have access to their chips card in the information centres and offices of the Transport Company at Museum, Męstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
The coupons are already online via the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service was used by more than 400 customers until afternoon hours.
Those who are starting to use online trading can ultimately forget about the train stations' publishers, where they have had to keep up with long lines for the ticket.
The coupon can be purchased via the Internet and the Opencard card is also saved in one of the 13 branches of the City Library.
“In these places, passengers will have a bar with trained providers who will help interested people to buy the Internet and to save their money on their cards, ” said Martin Opatrný, the project spokesperson.
In addition to the libraries, electronic coupons will also be available for Opencard in self-service automatics in some halls.
How do these automatics look?
They're red, we're reminded of ticket managers, and the passengers may have noticed them at Roztyly, Budějovicka, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vlavatska subway stations.
“ There are currently five of them in the city, but it should be 80 by the end of the year, ” added Opatrný.
The coupon is checked by the driver instead of automatic
Treatment of start-ups tomorrow is easy.
It's just enough to insert the Opencard chip card and the coupon paid in the past goes away on its own.
The electronic coupons will be in place tomorrow, not only in the capital, but also around it.
So on trains and buses around the city from 300 to 499, which are mainly used to travel to the capital.
“On trains in Prague integrated traffic, fish stocks were seen with card readers to identify the zone presence of coupons,” explained Philip Draal’s inspection of the lines from the Polish public transport schedule by Ropid organization.
In buses around the city, card readers are built at the driver's wallet.
Therefore, when entering, the driver must not only show the chip card but also place the Opencard at the specified location on the money register.
This is how the driver checks out the coupons' validity.
“ For example, if the passenger needs to check the validity of the coupons, it is easy to ask the driver to do so, ” added Draal.
Passengers who don't travel with buses around the city and they won't remember when their coupons are running off, can go back to self-service self-services saving coupons on cards.
Information on the validity of their documents is shown here on the display of the device.
The Sudaneses wanted a referendum from the US.
The Sudanese Germans in 1945 requested the accession of Shamava to the United States.
This is evident from the letter in the collection of the Science Library in South Czech Republic.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under at least the United States of America's battery.
It is said that in 1945, a group of Germans from Sudan to the President of the United States had turned to the President of the United States.
This is also reflected in a letter from a private archive, which is currently being held in the collection of the Science Library in South Czeh Republic.
The Germans in Česky Krumlov are asking the President of the United States not to allow the return to the Czech Republic, which Hitler has already taken on the basis of the Munich Treaty.
“We correctly understood the situation, and we really want to be certain in words that American troops are, in any way, not suppressive or hostile to the German territories, but becoming a freeman, ” says the letter, “embers who bear the fate of Shamava in their hearts, ” signed by words.
Since the accession to Czechoslovakia to the Sudanese Germans is supposed to be, in addition to the knowledge of the Czech national character, there is hope for brutality, cruelty, not understanding, repression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the President of the United States to take over Shamava to the protctorate “now and forever”
“We cannot believe that, in view of the opinion of four million people, this area would be regarded as a foreign country that is pushing and depressing the minority and would not contribute to the victory of the allies, ” says the letter.
The reason the authors could not sign is said to be fear of the revenge of “Czech suppressors. ”
If, therefore, the President of the United States were to doubt the German opinion of Shamai, it would be enough to hold a referendum in Shamai County on whether its inhabitants want to become part of the United States and whether they want to live during the United States' occupation.
Although the text of the letter may seem somewhat naive to the current knowledge of post-war history, some historians have a good description of the expectations of the Germans.
Even if Czech Germans had to assume that they would be moved from the country, only few of them were recognized.
Some expected that the United States and Great Britain would agree to a kind of autonomy.
Others were confident that they would simply remain in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by Gustav Chaluu, Austrian journalist born in České Budějovica.
He served as a German in Budějovice during the war at the Navy in the Baltic Sea.
At the end of the war, when the British caught him and put him in a prison camp in Holštynsk, several dozen other Czech Germans came to him to teach them how to get them.
“ They were confident that when they returned home, the Czech language would benefit them, ” said Chalica.
According to German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war, no one calculated that Beneš will be removed from the country on the basis of the Beneš Decrees.
You don't think, you pay!
The emotional campaign is attacking leaders
The most expensive action in Czech history on road safety.
The media campaign on emotions, which the Ministry of Transport wants to start on Wednesday, would also be characteristic of.
The Minister's office in Aleks, from this campaign, hopes that he will blackmail the leaders of the dangerous behavior behind the government.
The 150 million campaign will be on television, on radio, on cinema, on the Internet, but also on flyers.
The leaders should be diverted from speeding and alcohol.
And you should also remind them that they're gonna stick their seat belts in before they leave.
First of all, young leaders, motorcycles, pedestrians, and not least, want to speak to the conscience of professional leaders.
And what's happening in commercials?
Emotional, primarily human stories.
The entire campaign is also witnessing this:
You don't think, you pay!
The term “non-thinking ” is written in large letters on the plate.
And in the bloodthirsty, the word “pays ” is mentioned.
This must indicate that you can pay for a moment's negligence with your life.
The audiences will be “serious” until 2010
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in the English countries, where the dramatic images of victims of accidents can be seen regularly.
They hope that this will reduce accidents and the number of dead people on Czech roads.
The advertising market was created by the Euro RSCG agency.
Pull it, drop it on the drivers.
\"The driver's system is in place.
For them, 'get rid of 'em,' for example, when they go through red, they save time.
The 'repair' is a threat of punishment or accident.
The driver should be reminded of the risk, says Martin Kořán, a transport psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
And that's why we need the information campaign in the press, especially the negative campaign, to be seen as a psychologist.
He thinks the driver's attention is less effective than any sign of danger.
“If the hazard warning board is fitted, it is likely that the environment and leaders will not be dealt with soon, ” warned Kořán.
Olmer would give back almost all the occupied areas in return for peace
Ehud Olmer, President of the provisional Israeli Government, spoke of the fact that virtually all areas occupied in 1967 were returned, namely, from the western coast of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Fennsíi, in exchange for peace with Palestinians and Syria.
He said this in an interview, published on Monday by Jedi Achron on a daily basis.
“We have to agree with the Palestinians, which means that almost all of them, if we do not give back all the areas (indistinct), he told Olmer.
“ We keep a certain percentage of these areas, but the Palestinians need to transfer similar percentages to the Israeli territories, because there will be no peace without them, ” he added.
He admitted that the possible return includes East Jerusalem.
“ The one who wants security in Jerusalem and in particular wants tractors and bulldozers not to go through his feet, as one of my best friends did, must give up a part of Jerusalem, ” noted Olmer, referring to two cities in July, during which some people were killed and a few dozen were injured.
According to the Prime Minister, it will be necessary to find a special solution to “the Temple Mountain, Holy and Historical Places in the Old City. ”
“The one who wants to preserve the Israeli sovereignty over the entire city must integrate 270 000 Arabs.
This will not work, he stressed.
Excluding Golan fensís
He also gave an opinion on the withdrawal of the Israelis from Golanfensí, which, according to him, is an indispensable condition for the peace treaty with Syria.
However, this would also require some effort from Damascus.
“I do not recommend peace with Syria on the basis of a withdrawal from Golan alone, ” warned.
“The Syrians know what they need to give up so they can get Golan.
They must give up their current relationship with Iran; they must give up their relationship with Hezbollahhal (Síite movement); they must provide regular support, which is provided by Hamas (Síite movement), by the terrorism of Al-Qaida and Dzsihad (serious war) in Iraq,” explained the Prime Minister.
Questions after an accident: Is the passengers' assistants illegal in the buses?
The law doesn't know them, they're not allowed to walk in a distance bus.
With regard to the tragic bus crash of Student Agency, the question was raised near the Italian Padova, whether passengers and passengers could travel on the bus.
“If we were to comply strictly and formally with the law, the passenger's accompanying activity is in conflict with the transport law, ” says Karel Hanzelka, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Transport.
Last week, a twenty-two-two-year-old passenger who was probably caused by the driver of a truck crossing the bus.
The poor girl sat next to the driver at that moment, the bus was at the least safe place, although two more seats were reserved for her.
The bus may crash, or suddenly brake, even at the moment when the passenger is serving coffee or offering a newspaper.
There is a role in whether the bus has its place under the licence.
If the bus is not homologized, passengers must sit.
Student Agency has no long-range buses; it is also confirmed by the company's director, Radim Jančura.
“We tried to find a solution with this miniature, and at first the movement of passengers was not allowed.
However, this has been withdrawn and we have come to the conclusion that passengers may go to room during the journey if they have their own meeting,” he said.
The law does not know the flight crew.
\"There is no clear legal definition for the role of passengers' assistants - no legislation regulates this position.
However, the carrier does not have any legislation prohibiting the provision of services.
The Road Traffic Act only knows the concept of a vehicle engineer; its rights and obligations are not defined; it makes it less clear that Hanzelka is a spokesperson.
Mr Pokorný, director of the Road Vehicle Operation Department of the Ministry of Transport, on the contrary, considers that the law is correct to address the problem.
‘Does it depend on whether the bus traffic permit has its place of residence?
And this is over, “he says.
Carbuses may be discriminated against by cities where there are and are limited to maximum speeds and places between the city and higher speeds allowed, and seats with maximum speed and maximum permissible speed, with safety belts.
As on the plane, say the expert.
Jaroslav Hořín, BESIP's transport safety expert, does not see a major problem in the movement of passengers on board the bus.
“In the course of continuous progress, there is no threat, we can compare the situation to the service on the aircraft.
I'm not sure when there's swelling in here and the flight crew can beat their heads up.
“But if the bus suddenly brake, of course, its physical laws are in place.
Same as city buses or trams.
The safety of passengers must be solved by the carrier by internal rules,” says and also considers that the problem in terms of law has not been solved.
Jančura is ready to remove services
Student Agency offers passenger accompanying services as the only bus carrier.
I'm working on 200 passengers.
The director does not consider their profession risky after the accident.
“I, however, will have the impression that the handling of passengers is risky, and I will also stop it.
Coffee and newspapers can be received by passengers when boarding.
It would also be cost savings, ” says the Bible.
In his works, he justified the lack of safety interests of passengers investigators Alexej Litvin, the director of Asiana, operating a fraction of flights compared to Student Agency.
“ We do not have passengers, we are opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later, it ends with some fatal injury, ” said Týden.cz only a year ago.
There's been an incredible tragedy.
A young passenger pilot from Pzeň, who worked for the company for two years, died on a scheduled flight to Naples.
The Slovenian truck was likely to bend out of the stopbar without using a direction indicator and to stop the bus.
The driver of the bus suddenly tried to get out with a maneuver, but the right front part of the bus hit.
The fact that two reserved seats for passenger crew rest were sold is rejected by Jančura.
\"These places cannot be booked on long distance flights, blocked, \"
The company wants to sue the truck leader.
By compensationing the daughter's family, the agency does not expect the court to judge, but also the financial compensation for the victim.
Rule-amendment?
In the distant future
In order to clarify the movement of passengers passengers on board the bus, the law change could be reported, where more than a year has been employed by a 30-man expert group of the Ministry of Transport.
‘ However, the group did not achieve any specific results.
Car buses are not so much, the point system deals with maximum speed and mobile use on the highway,\" says Hořín expert.
“The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of passengers’ assistants to be something that would basically threaten the safety of passengers,” says Hanzelka, who said that the inspection of the safety of buses is within the competence of police and labour agencies.
The dysseldorf hope goes beyond Frankfurt
The letter to the bank's colleagues from the WestLB Board does not narrow in great words.
As a result of the merger between the financial institutions of the düsseldorf financial institution and the Deca-Bank of Franque, the central capital market organisation of the financial group could be created - a letter published on Monday.
WestLB would bring such a business into such a business as a profitable “competence block. ”
Such a relationship could give rise to further mergers in the final-run state banking sector.
This is the reading of a board of directors seeking to prove his ability to act in difficult times.
For the uncertain WestLB bank is still under huge pressure.
Not only the EU Commission, but also the Federal Financial Services Service Authority, which has recently been informed by the North-Westphalia province government to limit the deadline for finding a lasting solution.
However, it has been a long time for savings money customers between Deka-Bank and WestLB, which are famous for investment funds, to have been a subject of a relationship - a francfurti section.
Franz Waas, Head of Deka-Bank, announced at the end of August, that the bank in Mainzer Landstraße and a province bank, such as Helaba or WestLB, could not understand.
However, Deka's board of directors, one half of which is represented by the Land Banks and the other half by representatives of the Mint Finance Associations, instructed the Management Board to continue negotiations with WestLB on joint business activities.
In this context, the capital market business or certain parts of it may be involved.
However, negotiations - set financial circles - have just begun.
The name of Mr Deka-Bank, one of the main employers of the Franque financial sector, is not the first of all about the consolidation of the savings finance sector.
For a moment in 2003, Deka-Bank seemed to join the Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba.
However, nothing of this third alliance has happened.
The plans were hardly publicized by the government of the Province to be able to speak against Helab's interest.
After that, the other two banks couldn't find each other.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz was instead sent to the Lattgart Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.
However, again and again, the idea of the relationship between the Deca-Bank and the Landbanks has been raised.
Last time, however, Günther Merl, the Helab Executive Director, spoke against the plans of mergers with his bank.
Nevertheless, it is worth recognising that there is a need for the convergence of the various banks of the majority sector.
Now, the relationship between BayernLB and Landesbank Baden-Württemberg is expected to be the first after the elections in the Bajoran Province.
This is not necessarily good news for Helaba.
If pressure on additional mergers increases, potential partners can slowly lose weight.
In southern Germany, it could only be a younger partner, where the financial crisis has been significantly better than the München and Stuttgart banks.
With WestLB, Giroverband Hessen-Thüringen, with 85% of his business in Helaba, ruled out fusion at the beginning of the year.
There's no better way to keep NordLB.
However, such geostrategic considerations mean only one side of the coin.
On the other side, the question arises as to how different business models of individual banks work together.
Merl stated in June that the German Chamber of Fines and Courtesies had not yet given an answer to the crucial question of the business model to ensure the future of the Land Banks.
Finally, it is possible to cut WestLB, but they do not want it to be obvious.
Thus, the letter from the board there also indicates that they are pursuing a “complete solution. ”
How this can be agreed with the merger of each unit with Deka-Ban, it is still the music of the future.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the weekend ofolas.
It's the first time I've ever seen Luca for the third or fourth time.
But now Elena's here as her girlfriend, and so everything's different, says Luca.
Next to the five-lit barrels of Kaiser's brand, there's a man with a strong body cover and he proves to be about 200 people who travel to Oktoberfest, how deep they sound from the throat.
Elena's gonna have Luca's face first, and then she's gonna kiss him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
Four buses depart from the parking lot near Puorta Nuova railway station at 23.45 p.m. – distinazione Monaco, paint della oscillating for a trip, arrival is expected at 6.30 p.m.
Three buses are mostly for Italians, and only Brazilians travel in the fourth.
In one of the corner of the parking lot, the South Americans had already played a song next to their flag, and they started celebrating during the night.
And so loud that it's not for the Italians, say Marco Guarda.
Buses are owned by Marco wearing long-steel jackets and wide silver-silver glasses.
He's been traveling to Oktoberfest for five years. He's only been on three routes this year.
At night, in the day of Oktoberfesten, home at 22.30.
The accommodation would only mean unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The road costs 75 euros, including the Bajoran Caiser beer, accident insurance and German alien driving - a German course in Marco Frankfurt.
And they're already putting their buses into the night towards the motorway, Brennero.
No beer, no beer yet.
The bus will be quiet soon, the passengers will sleep.
All right, they're gonna need their strength.
In Brixen and Holzkirchen, many Italian buses are taking a short break in front of Munich.
When Marco's group arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at half a week according to the plan, there are nearly 50 other buses coming from Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco's got one last piece of information, he's describing the plan of war.
First, everyone pick up the yellow hat.
On the left side of this section, you can read the letter “Oktoberfest” next to Marco’s travel agency: “conoscersiviaggiando.it
Second, “When the beer can be opened, running, ” says Marco in the morning.
\"Futás – Book of places in the rear part of the tent and run.
“Not in advance, for we are caught, and not all yellow hats should sit on the same pillows, but spread out in the tent.
The one-piece basket costs €8.25. He screams Marco.
And don't forget the tips.
\"Show security guards that they behaved well.
As you leave your places, they take care of them.
Third, “Be back here at 7:30 a.m. this evening, you understand?
And now we're heading for Wiesn.
On the way, one of the men, as a guide, places yellow hats on trees, boards, and even one of the great Bajoran crowds on election posters.
Prepare for withdrawal.
This is the second weekend of Oktoberfest, which is known as “the weekend of the ools. ”
There are no precise figures; 50 000 people who cross the Alpocon's beer tents are allegedly ten percent of all visitors of the weekend come from Italy.
The Munich Police Department confirms seven South Tyrol police officers, Italian volunteers assist the Bajor Red Cross, which includes about 200 medical care in national statistics for Italians to take the first place, before Austrians (about 80) and Germans who need the lowest level of the drummer (about 60).
Among the Italians, he was particularly fond of the Hofbräu beer player.
Dreamless nights for the Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, stressed by Peer Steinbrück Federal Minister for Finance only last week.
It is even lucky that the politician used the word “in relative terms ” and even stated that the German banking sector was not saved by critical developments.
Because this is what happened this weekend.
Daxon's noted Hypo Real Estate (HRE) company received a billion loan from the German banking consortium to protect itself against market tourism.
A person who knows the situation on Monday informed Reuters that credit subsidies would be set at EUR 35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate has to pay interest only after the part used.
The money is partly from private and partly public banks.
In the background, Depfa's subsidiaries are loss-making.
According to a newspaper, Depfa, a state-funded Depfa loan gave money to long-term projects, and it has been very short-term - which is no longer possible due to the infidelity on the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s cash reserves decreased by 95 per cent to EUR 2,37 million and its equity ratio decreased to 1,6 per cent from 1,45 per cent.
The current income and net revenue from the money trades fell to zero compared to the same period of the previous year, from credit credits to claims and certain securities and from the liquidation of the credit business with a reduction of more than 70 per cent to EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the higher revenues resulting from the reimbursement of ex-post accounting costs for the restructuring of the former Depfa group, as well as the reimbursement of interest under the Regulation and the business of companies in the context of the concession, the revenue deficit of 16% was relatively moderate.
After privatisation in 1990, the former State financier was first allocated to corporate real estate loans, which were then separated from Aeral Bank.
As little money could be sought by classical state funding, Depfa has been more strongly involved in infrastructure projects and in the joint projects of private investors and the state (prive-public-partnership, PPP) and has expanded its activities internationally.
The value of subsidiaries should now be accompanied by descriptions that have a significant impact on the performance of the group.
The fact that there was no dividend payment.
The dividend has already been reduced to the third level by 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has become a significant state and infrastructure financier since the adoption of Depfa.
Compared to other financial institutions, interbank market refinancing is more dependent as it does not have client deposits.
With the collapse of the American Lehman Brothers investment bank two weeks ago, the lending of the banks has been cancelled because the banks are keeping their liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term assets to refinance some of Depfa's credit portfolios, about EUR 50 billion per year.
According to the Hypo Real Estate Communication, the group's funding needs are covered by the loan for a transparent period and the company's protection is currently largely protected from the influence of inoperative international financial markets.
According to other sources, the funding is guaranteed by the end of 2009.
Mr Funke, the Chairman of the HRE said, on the other hand, that the Hypo Real Estate Group should not use the money markets for the foreseeable period.
The German Federal Bank and the Federal Financial Service Authority (BaFin) see that the capacity of the Hypo Real Estate Group is now guaranteed.
This gives the bank's shareholders and creditors hope.
But because of the dynamics and incompetence of the crisis, certain cannot be involved.
It is not even possible to make full use of funding.
But the opposite cannot be ruled out.
After the late Saturday night news that the bank was still at the edge of the bankruptcy, the temporary rescue of the equal could not reassure the fields.
The stock exchange decreased by 75 % to EUR 3.30.
On the other hand, the bond exchange is quite well maintained.
While debt items in the first place are barely changing, the exchange rates of the underlying bonds have fallen significantly.
In particular, the crisis affects the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and can affect the running times beyond 2009.
While the Hypo Real Estate bonds have previously appeared to be an alternative to speculative investment, their value needs now to be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system, the expansion of the banking crisis and the fact that the financial institution brought the crisis almost to the house by taking Depfa.
As long as the central banks, governments and non-hazardous business banks are still ready to support the system, it can be derived from the cancellation of the benefits to the deadline.
Or it will happen, which currently almost no one dares to hope that the financial crisis will succeed in the next 15 months.
However, according to the reports on partial nationalisation, the likelihood of certainty has now been purely rememinent.
For long-term creditors, the decision may be to separate from their investment at night.
Short-term investors may, however, make use of the sale to provide reserves for taxes payable after the exchange rates of the coming years.
Secrets of Sylvana and the Intruder
When Sylvana Hiltropin 16-year-olds must be introduced to Tachibana High School on the first day of teaching, girls begin to be snooped: The German girl is full-time!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from the mangoes in the new O.R. blog about Japan.
“The first day of teaching in Japan.
I was really excited.
I was on my way to school.
I'm living on the side of Tokyo, heading to Kavaskai, and I'm on the train for 40 minutes at Tachibana Highschool.
I had to find the way alone, and luckily, I wasn't wrong.
It seems that the beginning of teaching in the Tachiban does not take you as seriously as home in Also-Saland.
The students start to chat from eight hours until 8 o’clock at 40 o’clock in a short conversation with the teacher, the ‘home room’.
But before the teaching began, I had the order to introduce myself.
But I'm not the type you want to talk to people, especially in front of a class of 40 students.
Since I haven't had my school uniform yet, I picked up an old maid's skirt, and she's got a shirt, a blue knee and a black leather shoes.
So I was standing in front of the cathedral and trying to put everything out correctly: “Sajonara,vo nor Sylvana....
At this moment, I was very happy that I started studying the language for the last two years.
All 31 girls were whispering, moaning, and waving, and I kept hearing the word “saying. ”
I've known this from my manga.
It belongs to the basic language of Japanese girls, and it means “cute, sweet, ”
Then I got to my place quickly.
The girl sitting next to me was a great smile, a privilege to be planted next to the exchange halls.
The rest of the clock was pretty quiet, but when the bell sounded, they ran off in a regular manner.
Everyone was talking and laughing at me, and their questions were a hole in my belly - and it's quite difficult to understand the Englishness of the Japanese.
In the break, everyone then packed their insides.
My guest made me a lunch like this - it's completely different from the boring German ten-hour sandwiches.
I've got spiced rice, little sausages, salad made of beans and alkas, fruit and meat made from a kind of tofuba.
Most of the time, I don't know what I eat here in Japan.
Foods look strange, and they have a whole new taste.
It's just that everything's really good.
Yeah, maybe except for the salty sleek, Brrr.
In Japanese schools, the inside is not just lunch.
A girl might be giving a boy her own hand-made inside, especially made by an artist, in the hope that at lunch break, she can get to know the boy more closely.
I read this in my manga comic book.
I wonder if I can watch this here.
“ Because my friends in Japan were just asking me when I told them that I wanted to go to Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
\"Because he simply charms me \"
After all, for years, I've been reading the most popular mangoes.
And to understand more about comic books and culture in them, I started to study Japanese sometime.
So it was perfectly clear to me that I had to travel here sometime.
Because I'm attracted to tradition and customs.
And they're in big trouble here.
Japan, on the one hand, is the country of the latest techniques and trends - and on the other, is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And since everything was so well organized, I have never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I've ever seen in my life,
The rats have emotions too.
A rat or a mule is running away. Does that mean he feels fear?
Joseph LeDoux's neurologist is convinced of him: animals also have emotions.
But how can it be examined if they feel the same when they behave like us?
Over the years, scientists have published their articles in the “Edge - Internet magazine. ”
SPIEGEL ONLINE is a series of answers to “What it takes to be real without being able to prove it. ”
I believe that animals have emotions and other sources of consciousness without being able to prove it to me or anyone else. It is true that we cannot prove that we have other people.
In this case, however, we can at least hope that the basic configuration of each human brain will be the same.
However, as we look at other species, and we break down the questions of consciousness in general, we come to a difficult field because the hardware does not match.
When a rat is put in danger, it does the same thing as many other animals: he pretends to be dead, a fugitive or an attack.
People behave in a similar way, resulting in comparable subjective experiences from some researchers.
But I don't believe in that.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to take over our own subjective experiences.
On the one hand, human consciousness-related flows are almost always included in the lateral pre-rontal brain test (as a result of the short-term memory and the role of implementation/control functions).
This wide area for man is more advanced than for other mammals and seems to be completely lacking in other living things.
At least the aspects of our consciousness that depend on the preferred brain, such as knowing who we are, or, in the case of design and decision ability, it can reasonably be assumed that man is different from other mammals.
An additional dramatic feature lies in the linguistic nature of man: Since human experience is a significant part of the language, it is often said that knowledge depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
However, even if it did not depend on the language, the language would certainly influence, so animal consciousness, whatever it is, is likely to be very different from most of our knowledge sheets.
It is therefore difficult to establish how knowledge can be in the case of other animals.
If consciousness cannot be measured as an internal and subjective matter, and because of our own experience with special hardware, your research will cause serious problems for us.
Most of my developments relate to the content of conscious living, but there is also another aspect of consciousness that is likely to be easily accessible to science.
The knowledgeal processes of the animals could be examined without regard to the strains of animals, and this is exactly what happens in experiments on the short-term memory of the mammals, in particular in the example of vizualisation.
However, in the case of this assumption also examined by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, they rely more on the nerve relationships of consciousness than on the remote mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Interestingly, this idea also highlights the importance of a pre-rontal brain layer in the establishment of vizualisation.
What is the consequence of these emotions?
This leads me to the activation of an emotional system, such as fear, in the brain that is aware of his own activity.
What we call fear is, therefore, the mental state in which we are in when the activity of the protective system (or its consequences, such as physical reactions) is involved.
Thus, the emotions are closely linked to the areas of the pituitary that are characteristic of the main mammals and in particular to man.
In addition to the linguistic nature, perception is applied to fine levels, because with the help of words and languages we are able to distinguish and categorize conditions that we write them to others too.
On the other hand, Antonio Damasio is of the opinion that emotions come from simpler activities in the body sense of the brain and the brain stem, as well as Jaak Panshep, who is more focused on the brain stem.
Since this network, during human evolution, has not changed very easily, it can play a role in a broad sense of species.
I can't tell you how theoretically I can't call it, but I think it's unconfirmed.
In both cases, the Bank considers that what appears to be fear in rats and humans is likely to be the case: How can it be checked whether rats and people feel the same when they act alike?
A cockroach escapes in case of danger, does he feel fear?
In my opinion, only similar behavior is not proof of the same experience.
Although the neurol comparison continues to help, rats and humans have a similar brain stem, the cockroaches have no brain.
But the brain hole is responsible for the emotions?
And even if this could be proven for humans, how can we prove this to be in rats?
I think rats and other mammals, but maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have emotions.
But I don't know how to prove this.
And since their emotions are likely to be essentially different from ours (based on special circuits and languages of human consciousness), I am looking at the emotional behaviour of rats rather than emotional emotions.
In any case, progress in this area is a lien at the neurological level if we measure the same level in rats and humans.
As for rats, I don't look for the language and the consciousness, not the emotions, because I don't know if they exist.
It may seem to others to be a short-sighted attitude, but I'd rather move forward rather than keep clashing against the wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
Platini, President of UEFA: Time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Vaszjunik declared that preparations will shortly be subject to direct responsibility from the President and Prime Minister.
“The government sees the trust in Ukraine in the decision of UEFA in the Bordeaux decision and the evidence that they believe that Ukraine is able to organise the European Championship together with Poland,” said Vaszjunik.
“This does not mean amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun, and there are many more to be done in both countries:
As regards the construction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports, both host countries are absent.
It is possible that the number of EB stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste any more time.
We need to work with a weight check,\" said Grigorij Szurkis, President of the Ukrainian Football Association.
\"The UEFA will keep an eye on us all the time. \"
In Poland, they were going for even more radical steps.
Following several scandals, the National Olympic Committee suspended the leadership of the Polish PZPN Federation, replaced by the independent inspector of Robert Zawlock.
The Commission agreed on the initiative of Mr Miroslaw Drzewiecki Minister for Sport.
\"The threat of the colloid is that PZPN is unable to operate according to the rules,\" Drzewiecki said to the Polish PAP News Office.
“In Helsinki, we assured Michel Platinum, UEFA president, that this will not adversely affect the preparation of the 2012 EB.
Only in the past season had to be classified as a number of first league teams due to manipulations in the lower class, and eventually the league star had to be postponed.
The uprising Dennis Quaid will cut back
The actress wanted to advertise a new film, she was talking about her private life in the interview, and now she's had a problem with her ex-husband, and Ryan, a former husband from Hollywood, Dennis Quaidet.
The one who's squeezing - and he's cutting back
The late war of roses at Meg Ryan - Dennis Quaid ex married: seven years after their divorce, the two actors in Hollywood are fighting each other in a terrible fight - before the public.
In an interview with the American InStyle magazine, Meg Ryan said the reasons for the divorce last week: “Dennis has long been unfaithful to me, which caused many pains.
And only after the divorce, he found out how many women Dennis was cheating on him.
The spiritual strip was due to Ryan's new press work on his film, “Women, ” which tells the story of a adultery.
Dennis Quaid strongly responded to the cryout of a unfaithful husband: “The 54 - year - old actor said to the newspaper New York Daily News, ‘ The Unhappiness repeats the story of our relationship, ’
Moreover, it is “a pity that 16 - year - old common boys, Jack, are repeatedly reminded of many pains and changes caused by divorce to a child. ”
While Ryan lives alone since his divorce, Quaid grew up again and recently became the father of a twin couple.
Hence, his answer closes with the following page: “My life continues to go on anyway.
I can be happy to know that I have a wonderful family in which everything is fine.
Prices of air tickets and hotel rooms are reduced
In the first half of 2008, European flights and accommodation were cheaper than in the previous year.
According to an ongoing study, flights in Germany were less than 50% cheaper.
The prices of the planes and hotel rooms were again more favourable - so it can be summed up in one of the studies of American Express travel and financial service providers.
The company analysed the data for the first half of 2008 and, after the first quarter price increase, there was a significant price drop in the second quarter.
After rising prices on the hotel market for years, accommodation has become cheaper.
Between January and March, prices rose by 6.9% in 41 of the 48 cities examined compared to 2007.
However, during the period from April to June, prices were already 3,6 per cent lower than in the previous year.
This trend was most clearly shown in Paris and Rome, where guests had to pay 30-37 percent less than one year earlier.
The reason for this is that American Express sees the low exchange rate of the dollar, which led to “the slow travel of American tourists. ”
The fall in hotel room prices is more affected by financial centres such as Frankfurt or London than industrial cities such as Hannover, Kölnt or Stavanger.
In Norway, the rise in hotel prices is a European record of 26.3 percent.
In the first quarter, there was a growing change in prices of flights.
Due to the shrinking of kerosene, passengers in the tourist class had to pay an average of 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and long-term flights with high fuel consumption fell by 29.2 percent.
Between April and June, prices of air tickets in the tourist class decreased by 12.5 per cent from the previous quarter, but prices in the business and first class only showed a much lower trend.
In Germany, prices fell even more than in other European countries.
Between January and March prices rose by 11.9 per cent, the second quarter decreased by 23.6 per cent.
According to the study, the price of domestic flights in Germany decreased by half.
The reason for the price reduction is partly due to moderate economic growth - the company claims.
There are a number of segments of demand in the aviation market.
On the other hand, as a result of the Open Skies agreement liberalising air travel between the US and Europe, the pressure on the competitive situation is increasing.
The tense situation is demonstrated by the fact that airlines are going to break their losses and that many airlines reported bankruptcy during the first half of 2008 - only 24 airlines in Europe are affected by this.
HSV 1:0 beats Gladbacho
A gollel and simple methods have been put to the head of the table by Hamburger SV.
Luhukay, Borussia, is still not able to find a team that works.
Kristoffer Klein enlargement Deep flight for the national selected Markko Marin.
The gladbach player only played late, and the raise came back from the gate.
His message, exactly, left his lips convincingly.
He just knew he was right.
“We have the need for the second goal, ” said Hermann Rieger, in the corridor leading to the arenas in Hamburg.
Not much happened in the catacombs, the break ended, and most of them sat back in their place.
Rieger had his physics therapist for almost three decades, a greater authority than a few hair-dankers.
Thus, the request was found to be a hearing in the competent place.
Cornelius Jol has been snooped by a assistant coach, and has been able to show his thumb in agreement.
Cornelius is the chief coach of Hamburg, Martin Jol's brother.
The same was his order: Here with the second goal!
The execution of the order has not been completed.
“ Today it was not always nice to see, ” later Marcel Jansen introduced.
Bastian Reinhardt was more “imaginative of things. ”
1: 0 (1: 0) golos results can be attributed to Mladen Petric’s headset of Hamburg (11); and the fact that the very weak Gladbachachians could not cause pain to the weak burgers.
“ There was a great victory, ” took Martin Jol together.
Hamburger SV is now 121 years old on Monday.
The viewers have celebrated themselves on Saturday afternoon, the blue sky above the arena and the table showing on the screen, showing their team as the top of the championship.
It's a birthday without a party.
“ We know where to do this, ” said Marcel Jansen.
It seems that the certificate between the table is more of a flag's inexplicability than the dominance of the HSV.
Although the team finds itself slowly because of its late-aware collections, the Neves and Silva of Brazil, the Capus Petr and Jansen, who was acquired from FC Bayern, but is not yet brillir.
“ We need more sense and action, ” said Jol.
After the resuscitation
Wall Street is scared.
The first news on the failure of the rescue package has led to a temporary drop of 700 points by Down Jones.
That was the greatest loss in his story in one day.
Later, Dow strengthened some time.
At 20:30, the world’s most important stock exchange barometer was at a minimum of 5 percent and stood at 10.579 points.
Nasdaq, a technology dealer, fell to 1548 points by more than seven percent.
At this moment, the largest loser in Dow was American Express with a 14% loss, followed by the Bank of America with 12 percent.
None of the papers have been strengthened.
Goldman Sachs' shares fell by nearly 10%.
Only a few days earlier, Warren Buffett bought shares in the bank.
In the context of the rescue, funds are planned to be made available for the purchase of so-called double mortgage securities.
However, they want to pay gradually not at the same time.
In addition, the State would receive stock options from financial institutions which could be applied in the event of a proper development of exchange rates, reducing the burden on the state's balance sheet.
European and US and share exchange rates
The billions of aid for European and US banks do not dispel investors' doubts.
Hypo Real Estate is a German big bank stock exchange, and he's stuck with Dax.
The American Dow Jones indicator will decline despite the planned rescue by the state of the money market.
The spectacular exchange rate losses of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have been reduced to the German share indicator (Dax).
Despite the rescue of the federal government and private banks, the value of the real estate in Munich fell to the quarter, the Commerzbank weakened by more than 20 percent.
Dax is a psychologically important 6000 point limit, and it has been recorded at 3,7 percent minus 5839 points.
The stock markets have been forced to knees around the world.
Wall Street was opened in New York with a significant loss.
Investors fear that the US government's $700 billion rescue package will not be enough to boost money markets.
Dow lost 334 points in the first hour of trade, i.e. 3.3 percent to 10.809,25 points.
The U.S. Parliament wanted to vote on the rescue plan, the Senate vote would take place on 1 October.
The rest of the European stock exchange is also known only one direction: in London, the FTSE indicator showed a 3.2 percent weakening, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, the Japanese Nikkei index fell to 11.743,61 points after the initial strengthening.
In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index slipped back to 18.286,90 points.
The Indian Sensex indicator was dropped to 506,43, i.e. 3,9 percent, and closed to 12.595,75.
On the Mdax stock exchange, Arcandor's shares have weakened following the announcement of the capital increase.
Sal. Oppenheimer's private bank recorded 23 million new shares.
In the commercial and tourist context, he also announced that Thomas Cook's shares were not sold.
Dark material affects the flight of space probes
A mysterious phenomenon has been causing inconsistency among researchers for years. The dark matter affects the speed of space probes during the so-called swing-by maneuver.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity cannot be fully correct.
The “Ulysses ” space probe flew in outer space for nearly 18 years.
Soon, we'll have to find a way to get the ice cream out of here, because of the long-sleeving fuel pipelines.
Over the years, scientists have been causing confusion about a mysterious phenomenon of swing-by anomaly.
The swing-by is the gravity of the space probes, which will provide an additional boost in the gravitational space of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
So the probes can save a large amount of fuel.
The European research plant Cassini-Huygens, as well as Ulysses, used this physical trick.
However, what has been amazement to researchers for years: flying objects are not fully behaved as it would be expected under the ancient gravitational law.
Instead, there are abnormalities at speed.
The probes are going to get faster or slow down.
The physics have always found no explanation for this effect.
The phenomenon was baptized for a swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that perhaps even Albert Einstein's general relativity principle cannot be fully correct, which will raise the weight of the material as a curve of space.
Stephen Adler's American physics, the Princeton Institute for Advanced Study, continues to believe that Einstein was not wrong and that swing-by anomaly is trying to explain with the so-called dark material that the astronauts discovered in the universe.
“ For the anomaly, dark matter can be responsible, which may be found near Earth, ” says Adler.
There's only ten years of experience in the world's archives about the existence of dark material.
A gravitational force that can be observed for the effect on other celestial bodies is clearly expressed.
However, the material itself is wholly invisible, i.e. any electromagnetic radiation of any kind, in particular visible light is not released or beat back.
Scientists calculate that the entire mass of the universe consists of a good fifth of dark material.
Tourists kidnapped in Egypt
After spending ten days in their kidnappers, the tourists in Egypt were once again free - strengthened by the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs.
The Sudanese kidnappers claimed a ransom of millions of euros.
In the shooting before the hostages were released, six hostages claimed to have lost their lives.
Five German citizens were kidnapped in South Egypt.
There are already negotiations on the ransom.
Again and again, Germans become the target of kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE will report the most important cases.
European tourists are free in Sahara.
This is what the Egyptian state television, the Al-Arabija Arab TV service, and the Italian media have been reported.
According to the reports of the Italian Sky TG 24 televisions, the Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the fact of release: “Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
At present, we are examining their health,\" said Frattini.
The five Germans, five Italians, and a Romanian citizens, as well as eight Egyptian escorts, are safe and safe - reported on Egyptian public television.
19 participants in the desert expedition are supposed to be on their way to Cairo.
The reasons for the shooting before the hostages were released are still vague: According to an Egyptian security officer, the hostages have already shown their willingness to release the hostages when the Sudanese army suddenly killed their hat.
“The problem has been solved.
The ransom was accepted, said the official.
“The trial was only about the taking of hostages, when suddenly there was “a surprise. ”
On Sunday, the Sudanese soldiers shot six kidnappers in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt, and two were arrested.
The hostages requested a ransom of EUR 6 million from Germany; the money should have been handed over to the German wife of one of the hostages.
‘al-Maszri al-Jom’, referring to a German broker, reported that the release of hostages is extended because the kidnappers are concerned about their own safety.
According to the report, hostages are released after payment of the ransom for women hostages.
Men are being held by kidnappers until they find a safe escape route.
The German delegation in Cairo refused to take a position on the report.
\"Deathing suicide, the violence of Ammopapai
He said in court that a woman committed suicide because her stepfather had been assaulting her for years.
The 57-year-old Michael Trerise spent 6 years in the Cornwall County Stithians prison after confessing his eight-order violent rape attempt.
The Truro Criminal Court has learned that he regularly tied his stepmom fish, Stephanie Randle, between the age of five and seven.
In a statement by Trerise, he wrote: “I feel alive for her death.
At the hearing, Randle was killed at 34 years old in a home in the district of Mutley, Plymouth. On 1 April 2007.
When he was living in Coventry, Trerise tied up and tied up his garbage before the mergers while his mother worked in a brewery.
Trerise resigned from his wife in the 1980s and again elected Cornwall.
She moved to Plymouth.
However, during the trial, it turned out that Miss Randle, who spent a lot of time as a volunteer at the National Trust Memorial Organisation, was persecuted by the horrors of repeated violence twice a week.
In 2006, prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Miss Randle, who had previously loved to surf and bike, said his friends, “Morning Dead, ” and“ Telling About Life, ”
In April 2007, his father Terrance Randle found him dead in his plymouth apartment.
He probably strangled himself with a bag.
Mr. Randle had a meeting with his daughter’s stepfather, who concluded her testimony in a letter: “I bound and bound her eyes.
I wasn't sexually upset.
I feel responsible for her death.
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You are an extremely strange fetisist, and I am sure it was terrible for his victim, especially if he was only seven years old.
This unpleasant family novel ended with the victim killing himself.
The fact that if it did not do so, the case might not have been brought before the court, however, is even more thoughtful.
The judge added: “I would like to draw attention to Stephanie’s parents ’ impact on the daughter of the crime you committed over the years.
If this did not happen, it would probably have been a hopeful, successful and happy young woman.
He was charged with a major data loss officer.
According to BBC's announcements, in violation of official secret, the government official who left classified documents on a train in June.
The man was sent to the Ministry of Defence when he left two strictly classified documents on a train to Waterloo.
The documents were sent to the BBC before they were transferred to the police.
This is the slightest accusation of breaking the law, and there is no suspicion of a deliberate offence.
According to Mr. Frank Gardner, the secretary to the BBC State Department, the step was a surprise to many people in Whitehall.
“ They believed that the Ministry of Defence and the government would treat the case as an internal matter, ” he said.
An employee who cannot be called was charged under paragraph 8.1 of the Act.
The State Prosecutor proposed that the charge against the officials be brought by the Metropolitan Police on account of the man's relatively sensitive work on the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he lost included secret surveys on Al-Qaida and the capabilities of the Iraqi army.
He was informed about the decision on Monday, and then moved to an unknown place from his home.
The housing cooperatives pay the B&amp;B account
Great Britain's housing cooperatives can charge an account of over 80 million English pounds after saving Bradford &amp; Bingley Bank.
The government spent 14 billion pounds to protect its deposits at Bradford &amp; Bingley.
The interest on this loan will be paid by all companies that use deposit holders' money, including 59 housing cooperatives.
According to Adrian Coles, the President of the Association for the Building of the Houses (BSA) says that companies and members of the House must pay.
The refund of the 14 billion important loans will eventually take place after the repayment of the Bradford &amp; Bingley mortgage.
However, in the meantime, an interest rate on an annual basis is charged to 700 financial companies that use loans.
The BBC has confirmed that the 59 housing cooperatives are one of them.
It is regrettable that institutions that have so far been careful must now pay the accounts of the institutions that were much less careful.
Adrian Coles, BSA
We have learned that each company has to pay in proportion to the amount of deposit in its possession.
The Ministry of Finance estimates that the amount of the loan will reach 450 million in 2009.
This means that companies have to put aside 81 million pounds to pay the first-year interest rate.
Adrian Coles, Director General of the Association of Building Companies, told BBC that the measure was unfair.
“It is embarrassing that institutions must pay the accounts of much less careful institutions that have been careful when the housing market is up and running, ”
According to BSA, no company has been destroyed since they started operating in 1945.
“In all respects, we need to examine this matter in the next few weeks to decide how to protect housing companies and members from a significant amount of account, ” added Cole.
The interest due in 2009 will cover 7 months from the end of September of this year.
A full annual interest rate will be paid in 2010, which can be twice the current one.
As housing cooperatives are self-help organisations, without shareholders, members will eventually have to pay the account, whether through higher fees or lower interest rates after their deposits.
The price of milk is increased by five cents per litre
In Jersey, people have to pay more for milk.
The milk industry in Jersey has announced that it will increase the wholesale price of milk by more than five pences per litre from Monday.
This year, this second price increase since the twopenny rises in February and following a survey carried out by an advisory company.
Resellers themselves decide whether to pass the price increase on to consumers.
Before the increase in February, the last wholesale price of the milk in Jersey changed in 2002.
He rejected the request of a former parliamentary representative of Bangladesh to defend himself in free custody
The Bangladeshi court rejected the request for protection of former parliamentarian Sheikh Hasina in the Free House, which means they can arrest him when he returns to the country.
The lawyer said that the court refused to defend him in the Free House on the accusation that 50 million fines ($729,700) had been blackmailed by a businessman during the time of Parliament's representative.
This case is just one of the many charges of corruption against it.
Sheikh Hasina was released this month against his old political opponent, Khaleda Zia.
Sheikh Hasina will have to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but the party, Awami League, insists that the temporary government of the country supported by the army first give her full freedom.
According to the reports, although it was conditionally placed to go abroad for medical treatment, it is not clear from the terms of free access to footing that he could preserve his freedom when he returned to the country.
Your lawyers say you're going to appeal to the Supreme Court against the decision of the Court of Appeal.
“The appeal court rejected Sheikh Hasina’s claim for bail that it was not necessary, as it had been temporarily placed on the loose and attended treatment abroad, ” we found out from a lawyer named Rafique-ul Huq.
\"We will appeal against the decision of the Court of Appeal,
According to his lawyers, he needs to be protected in the Free House so that he can return to the country and prepare for the December elections.
One of the leaders of the Awami League on Sunday said that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after 17 October.
Last year, the temporary government supported by the army took over, but in June they released him from prison to go abroad for medical treatment.
Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia both deny all charges against them.
Concerns on the Afghan Police Prevention Programme
According to the United Nations, almost 200,000 Afghan children have been excluded from the recently organised polio vaccination programme for Taliban violence.
Last week, the United Nations vaccination operation in six provinces.
However, they said that for security reasons they could not reach children living in the south of Helmand and Kandahar.
According to a UN Secretary, all this happened despite the Taliban's promise: they will not attack or prevent the work of thousands of staff who have been vaccinated.
Rejected BSkyB's appeal on ITV
They rejected the appeal of BskyB against the decision of the Competition Committee, which instructed him to reduce his interest in the rival television network in ITV.
The Competition Court required BSkyB to reduce its share in ITV from 17.9% to 7.5%.
In the past, the Committee found that BSkyB’s share was hampered by competition and would have an unfair impact on the company over ITV.
The BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 and therefore effectively prevented NTL from being renumbered to Virginia Media in the purchase of ITV.
In April 2007, the Competition Authority announced that BSkyB’s share purchased from ITV threatens ITV’s independence by encouraging the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
The director of Virginia, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom's supervision were all opposed to buying.
The BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of ITV's share would be pointless and disproportionate - especially since BSkyB said he would be willing to give up his voting rights.
Further investigation of U.S. prosecutors' case
The U.S. Attorney General appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the loss of nine US prosecutors in 2006.
The step was to criticise the decisions of government officials by the report made by the Head of the Court’s office on the case.
The report was considered by the White House officials, lawmakers and former chief prosecutor, Alberto Gonzalest.
The investigation was ordered because it was a fear that the state prosecutors had lost political consideration.
Nora Dannehy, special prosecutor, will now investigate whether officials who were hearing the investigation tried to stop justice by lying.
“The serious allegations of a possible crime have not yet been investigated, and have not been clarified,” said Inspector Glenn Fine.
One of the main proposals was to appoint a special prosecutor with the power to commit witnesses to testify.
The series started by removing nine state prosecutors from the US judicial wallet in December 2006.
At that time, they said that the state prosecutors were released because of their weak performance.
However, later it turned out that the lost state prosecutors had nothing to do with it than many other colleagues.
Some state prosecutors took part in the criminal proceedings of high-ranking Republican Congress members, while others refused to participate in the investigation of allegations of electoral fraud against Democrats.
The U.S. Attorneys are investigating the government's order and conducting court cases.
They can be lost at any time, but they can't be removed from their position for political reasons.
The head of the court records back then, Mr. Alberto Gonzales, has become the target of attacks by the chief prosecutor of state for the loss and finally resigned.
A number of other officials of the judicial wallet also gave their resignation.
Gonzales' report has largely assessed the role of the case. He said that the main prosecutor's \"principal responsibility\" is the responsibility for the discharges, the \"responsible\" role of the administrator, and \"presponsibly removed\" from the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, former assistant of older Bush, will be judged by the fact that they did not cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf Epposa will receive recognition
The rock star Meat Loaf will receive recognition for the epic hymnus of the Q Awards award bar “Bat Out Of Hell”.
The singer who will receive his special golden prize next week at the London celebration said that he considered it an honor.
The nine-minute, fifty-five-second song of Meat Loaf was the titled song of the album of an ordinary garden.
Coldplay received the most entries for this year's prizes, four were added to the candidate list.
Paul Rees, editor of Q magazine, said: “There are some songs that cross the borders of time or genres, and “Bat Out Of Hell, ” such as:
The song that Jim Steinman made was very loud, and that sound was Meat Loaf.
The song started with almost two minutes of instrument.
It appeared in 1979 as a small disk, and it got to the 15th place on the Slagerlists.
However, the album Meat Loaf-Bat Out Of Hell had been present for almost nine years in the Slagrelists and then sold over 40 million copies of it.
Meat Loaf - a real name Marvin Lee Aday - has recently been having health problems. Among other things, in 2003 he had surgery after he fell on the stage.
In 2007, he had to cancel some concerts due to heveny inflammation.
Later it turned out to be a cyst on the tone.
An unknown large city street, often forgotten, and may soon be sold
New York City has thousands of beams, tours and other sideways. Some of them are famous, others are merely doing practical functions.
However, many experienced taxi drivers and long-lived local residents would find it hard to tell where the Extra Place is, mostly because they've never heard of it.
The little street is in East Village and heading north from First Street - without reaching second street - between Bowery and Second Avenue.
About 9 m wide and 36 m long, and much more like a dusty alley than a main traffic route.
No street signs.
You can't actually find it on a standard map.
But the street has miracles.
It's there, for example, the builder of the recently built First Street luxury buildings.
He wants to regroup Extra Place and make sure that the new buildings' shops and bugs can get to a cleaner road.
The wonderrs of the street include the long - lived neighbors who were caught in the sand street, that was the only remains of the past before the renovations.
However, the owner of the street, the building conservation and development department of the city, does not intend to stick to it.
This month, at a meeting of the Regional Management Committee of the District Government, representatives of the city and Avalon Bay submitted a proposal that the builder would buy the street.
However, the Committee would like to see the street stay in the city and ask for a new plan for next month, Susan Stetzer, head of municipal council number 3.
“ There are very few areas in the city, and we want the Extra Place to remain in the city, ” he said.
\"The proposals for the renewal and management of Avalon may be in place, but we also want to guarantee that they will remain available to the public. \"
A few months ago, Avalon Bay announced that he wanted to re-attach the small street and he would like to have seats.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the street was first made public at this monthly meeting.
Michele de Milly, the spokesperson at Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the street, they do not insist on its possession.
“The main aspect of Avalon Bay is to refurbish this masoned alley and to transform it into a pleasant public watch, ” she said, adding that the city suggested its purchase.
Seth Donlin, the spokesperson of the House of Buildings, said that the city really wanted to sell the street, and noted that the office was responsible for the development of the buildings, and not for the management.
Compared to Bowery, Extra Place is not of much historical significance.
Some say that in 1802, Philip Minthorne’s great estate was divided between many children and no one held a claim on the narrow ground.
The punk-rock monument closed in 2006, the rear exit of CBGB opened to Extra Place, and perhaps the street's most important picture of the Ramones-Rocket to Russia's album.
“ It was a good location, ” said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
“He had garbage, clothes-sleeveds, barrels and posters, and wooden leaves and ropes, ”
Some residents, including bloggers, who write about how they own the middle class East Village, oppose the sale of Extra Place. They argue that this piece of public property, whatever it is, must remain in the possession of the community.
Others refer to Extra Place as rare, which is a practically unchanged piece of the city and which must be left at peace.
Jeremiah Moss, the New York Book of Jeremia’s missing New York, wrote his blog writer, the bitter nostalgia of the city’s death, on the cover of the story of Extra Place, published in 1952 by the weekly newspaper The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: “The Extra Place is a narrow, small dead end, which is still dark during the day, bounded by rusty, iron-made storage doors and flattened windows, and where the wind carries one week’s newspapers in the channels.
The street, apart from a few exceptions, looked the same a few nights ago.
A rat ran through the end of the street, next to the back door that used to lead to CBGB, and now it belongs to a higher price store.
The walls were graffiti, and an empty, 0.75 liter beer bottle was lying next to a threw, fresh newspaper paper.
Some of the walkers said that the Extra Place would rarely remember, but they thought it would be possible to refurbish it.
Fields told me that he thought some people were underestimating the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
“ I spent the most beautiful years of my life in dark, weary and disgusting places, ” she said.
Debate on Bilingual Education: Continued exposure to the English language environment
In this part of the Education Observatory Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi are discussing the position of candidates on two-language education.
Lance T. Izumi, who, at the Pacific Institute of Public Policy Research, is an experienced researcher of California studies and the director of education research, is “It’s not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs a school opportunity, ” co-organist.
It is not easy to go to Spanish-speaking voters.
Barack Obama's proposals for education are also included.
According to Obama’s campaign, “the students in Afro-American and Spanish are significantly less likely to obtain a degree than white students, ” and that is true.
In order to overcome these performance differences, Obama’s education plan explicitly supports English students, among other things, \"transmit two-language education\".
However, the question for Obama is whether its commitment to dual-language education, which focuses on school education in non-English languages, is above all concerned about the fight of major performance differences.
Take, for example, the Sixth Street Prep contractual primary school in the east of Los Angeles County.
Most of the students at the school are Spanish and low incomes.
More than a third of whom have recently arrived, students learn English.
However, 100% of the fourth graders achieved excellent results at the state mathematics exam in 2008.
Similarly, 93% of fourth graders completed excellent English language and literature tests.
This incredible performance is not appreciated by the instrument that Obama would prefer.
Sixth Street places emphasis on repeating, practicing, constantly evaluating skills and rejecting objections.
In addition, and this is what Obama should take into account, according to Linda Mikkels, the director of Sixth Street, the school educational principle of students studying English, is a complete assessment of the language environment.
The essence of the method of baptism is the almost exclusively use of English in teaching other objects.
Mikels, who opposes the two - language education, said: “We had a great success in walking into a classroom without seeing who was the student who came back from Mexico 12 months ago.
“It’s working for us, ” she concluded, “it’s working for us.
Would Obama set schools such as Sixth Street Prep to teach other, significant Spanish and English students?
The results achieved by the school should be made clear to make the answer, but because of its own partner's education policy (national Educational Associations have long supported two-lingual education), and since they are also consistent with the two-language education themselves, we cannot be sure of Obama's reaction.
Although he agrees that immigrants need to learn English, Obama has recently expressed an esteem of the question when he said that people should not be so concerned about the “indirectly English mivolt” of law enforcement.
Instead, he said, “They should be in touch with their children to speak Spanish. ”
If Obama really wants to achieve a reduction in the differences between results, he should seriously study the models that work instead of looking at them and taking them into action.
Oil prices fell steeply due to the economic concerns
On Monday, oil prices fell steeply due to concerns that the rescue plan for the financial markets in America will not be able to revitalize the economy.
Stocks of crude oil fell by seven percent back to $99.80 at the New York Trade Exchange.
Prices decreased by over $20 a barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, the stock exchange was inspired by the Wall Street financial confusion and a few powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After the price of July was paid as a barrel of USD 145,29 per barrel, it was returned to almost $90 per barrel at the beginning of this month before the incalculable uncertainty of financial markets had been re-imposed.
On Monday, the concern brought the investors back to power even after Congress leaders announced that we managed to agree on an economic rescue operation that is the greatest in history this weekend.
The news had a shadow of concern that the financial crisis would not be over for a long time.
On the latest events of the crisis, Citigroup will buy up the bank business of Wachovia Corporation, announced by the government on Monday.
In the meantime, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partly nationalized the European financial globalisation, Fortis.
According to the analysts of Barclays Capital, as a result of the desperate weekend negotiations, “it seems that the rescue has failed to re-establish the interest of stock exchange. ”
As the economic situation deteriorates, it is expected that demand for goods, such as oil, will also decrease.
“The future of the stock shares, interest rates and foreign exchange market has become uncertain worldwide, ” said Deutsche Bank, an analyst to investors.
\"We believe that the market for goods will not be avoided by the \"pad\" -
From the point of view of the stock exchange, the biggest question is the extent to which your US disease is infected, especially China,
As the decline in economic growth has led to a decrease in oil consumption, the banks' analysts had a decline in their expectations for the next year, reducing their forecasts for oil and gas prices by 20% for 2009.
With his second quarter bra, the team set up his record.
After spending more than eight seasons in the Jets' fair than anyone else, defensive himself in position, Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen everything.
But then he looked at the opening of the second quarter on Sunday, when Jets turned a non-pointless game into a sensational match.
“ I have never seen anything like it before, ” said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the game of Jets and Arizona Cardinals was fully aligned with the dark clouds in the sky.
Brett Favre, Quarterback gave Laveranus Coles a 12-yard touchdown passport. This became a perfect advance for a afternoon during which their cooperation was significantly improved.
Favre gave Coles two more touchdown passports in this quarter, including when two cornerbacks fell 10 seconds before the end of the half-time.
“ I didn’t feel sorry for the trouble, ” Favre said about all the passports he gave Coles.
\"Pokoli is a good player.
So far, we have been able to communicate well with each other, regardless of what people think.
While Favre and Coles were playing ball, the defense stopped Cardinals' controller, Kurt Warner.
The Darrelle Revis, who plays in a cornback position, caught a bad shot and threw it back with 32 yards that got touchdown.
Eric Smith, the sapphity player touched another pass, and he got the ball.
David Bowens, linebacker managed to hit the ball out of Warner's hands.
This last turn could have been the most amazing mozzane in the match.
However, when the Cardinals lost the ball 10 seconds before the end, and the Jets got it, Jay Feely fired 20-yardfield goal, thus setting the result of 34:0.
This was the best result the Jets has ever achieved in a quarter.
When they asked the Jets coach Eric Mangini to characterise the game's delusional nature, he said: “The second or the third quarter, ”
When they told him that in the third quarter, the Cardinals acquired 21 points that the Jets did not get one - Mangini said: “I must say that I enjoyed the second quarter much better than the third one.
We've got a lot of points in a short time.
Gebrselassie will decide her own world record
The Etiop Haile Gebrselassie once again showed why many people consider it the best middle and long-ranger in Berlin when he made his own world record on Sunday, and he became the first one to run 42.2 miles in 2 hours.
On a comfortable track, Gebrselassie fixed 27 seconds of her previous result of 2:04:26 in Berlin last year, with a victory of 2:03:59.
By the age of 35, Gebrselassie set up a world record of 26 different areas in order to win a World Cup or world record from 1500 meters to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie missed the Olympic marathon in Peking, fearing - which may have proved to be too cautious - that air pollution would further worsen her asthmatic problems.
Instead, he called me the Berlin marathon.
In almost perfect circumstances, at daytime, at 9 °C, at the end of the 13 °C - won Gebrselassie on Sunday, incredible, 2 minutes at 56 seconds per km.
Since the marathon has not started before, such as Gebrselassie, and Paul Terga from Kenya to the longer term, the Maraton record has decreased for more than two minutes in the past decade since the Brazilian Rondo da Costa won the result in Berlin in 1998 2:06:05.
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie told the reporters that two weeks ago, she threw in her legs and couldn't train for two weeks.
It's obvious that he's fresh during the forced breath, and he's not rusty.
“ I’m glad to see you, ” said Gebrselassie to the reporters.
“All things were perfect.
A week ago, I began training again, and today I had doubts, but finally everything was fine.
He received some criticisms - especially from Kenya, Ethiopia, the Eastern African rival - that he uses too many aid tools during his competitions, usually avoiding many world-famous marathons, leaving him on the road as if he was running on the track and putting the world record in front of the competitive spirit.
However, this criticism hardly reduces Gebrselassie's grandeur in the long run.
Gebrselassie reached the ground below 1:02:04 with four septuous operations in Kenya on Sunday.
The two leading fields, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, gave the rhythm to Gebrselassie after the emigrations got out.
Not much more than 4,8 km ahead of the goal, Gebrselassie left Kwambai with one last sprint, who secondly reached 2:05:36, five minutes fixed on his best individual.
Kamathi got in third place at 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, who is now a German citizen, has ended a remarkable year with the seventh fastest victory of 2:19:19.
The World Cup is held by the British Paula Radcliffe with 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36-year-old, won the results of the London marathon at 2:24:14.
It was not possible to participate because of the alleged back-up of the Peking Olympics, but it quickly healed and won the Berlin marathon, where it improved its individual peak five minutes ago.
He won the contest with a smart estimate: he first allowed a group of four people in Ethiopia and Kenya to move forward, and he would take a significant lead, and he would come after them about 30 km.
Etiop Askale Tafa Magarsa was aiming for the second time at 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop in Kenya became third with 2:25:01.
A separate city, the pride and trials of the black people
In the park of experience in Greater Orlto - a few miles away from everything that shines, loud and huge - there is a quiet small town where the pride and complications of African American life were born.
Eatonville, the first pure black city that was integrated into the country, and which was a childhood home of Zora Neale Hurston, is now no longer as simple as it was described in 1935: “The five lakes, three crocodiles, 300 brown skin, 300 good swimmer, a lot of guajava and two schools, without prison,”
Now it's a waste place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have already attended the annual Zora festival, and the Eatonville festival is held in honor of the most famous female writer of Harlem-Resesan, Hurston.
Yet, in many respects, the city described and described by him as a tourist attraction, which is also mentioned in the Florida guidebook issued by the Federal Church of the Church of Europe Project.
In the 1930 ’ s, when Hurston, according to his writing, the city blacks often refused to share their true thoughts with white people who “know little about us that they don’t know what to do ”
Even in the year when the black presidential candidate Barack Obama calls for an open exchange of views on racial issues, many people here are untrusted against the looks of outsiders.
“ We look forward to telling our story, ” reported the 59 - year - old Hortense Jones, who lived here all his life and a member of the oldest church in the city.
\"I must say in good faith:
Eatonville has been characterised by victory and battle paradox for a long time.
At the same time, the historical model of blackouts is a community of nearly 2400 people where poverty indicators reach the national average double.
Partly, the literary node, and part of it is an example of the American slavery, sometimes seen, sometimes praised, southern, urban, black culture, which flourishes in the shadow of oak trees.
So it's not surprising that the residents here are both proud and protective at once.
The image of Eatonville has been important since Zora (that's what everyone calls Hurston).
In the books written in an honest, strong dialogue, such as “Mules and Men” (1935) and “Their Eyes Were Watching God- (1937)” presented his hometown to the world.
The Florida guidebook has transformed the city, which is next to the 17th road. This road leads to a location in the history of black and human dramas from the long-standing center of Florida.
Hurston, who was brave in life and literature, even the drums, introduced his readers to Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke's business, and then looked into a more confidential sphere.
He wrote: “We find the modern public school right from the road, with a brown base of white, carefully kept courtes and playgrounds, which Howard Miller cares about, although he can hardly write and read, ”
He mentioned the widow Dash's new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn sells all kinds of drinks and everything you need in temporary accommodation.
So, a few hundred of them, Hurston linked Eatonville to autonomy, but at the same time, unwritten, remarry, and sex.
It's clear that the Fodor's guidebook was different.
This description really didn't like everyone.
“ Zora told me things as they were, ” reported the 90 - year - old Ella Dinkins, one of Johnson’s girls. They were made immortal by Hurston who quoted the song of the screamers that the men sang about their beauty.
He added: “A few people did not like this, ” he added.
Hurston is still remembered here as the first speciality who often visited home after his family moved to Jacksonville in Florida.
The 77-year-old Augustus Franklin reminded me that when Hurston came into town, he usually arrived without notice in Chevrolet, smoking, and in long-sighted cities where people were even proud of their dignity.
Most of the people were charmed, said Franklin, but there were many boys.
“ People were always happy to see Zora, ” said Franklin.
However, on the terrace looking at the lake of Sabela, where Hurston was most likely baptized, he added in his chair: “I have stayed too long.
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor, and his books were no longer published.
It seemed that, together with most of the world, Eatonville forgot about it.
Although he was ever a popular writer, the contemporary Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived before.
In Eatonville there were no significant monuments or large public readings.
“ I don’t think they understood how much he enriched the world or what he left us at all, ” said Valerie Boyd, author of the book Hurston CV issued in 2003.
The turning point came in 1980.
The officials of Orange County wanted to build a five-way road across the city instead of the two-band main street, the Kennedy Avenue, which was an important part of the community's life.
The expansion Orlto has already penetrated the Interstate 4 motorways on the west border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still on foot after a difficult historical period.
Among other things, forced integration has brought an end to the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the fights related to racial mixing were fuelled by hatred with society.
“ At that time a group of white boys came through, and they threw oranges and other things on the side of the road, ” said Franklin.
\"There was a lady who died of this.
They threw a Greek girl out of a car.
In 1955, Hurston questioned the decision of the Supreme Court for violent integration, thus stating the “Brown v. Board of Education” decision: “It violates my race, in any event, respects my race, ”
Today, the inhabitants say that the degeneration of schools was positive in some respects, weakened the unity of the Eatonvilles, and undermined the confidence of young people.
“ Black children are used to killing them, and I remember that man has treated his teacher in the morning and evening, ” reported N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins’ daughter, the manager of the nonprofit organization called Eatonville’s community.
“ This lasted until the students and teachers came from a common place, ” he added.
“ We did not hug our white teacher because he was a white teacher, ” said Nathiri, “it was cultural differences between us.
However, human rights have helped many others in the rise of Zora Neale Hurston - in black writers, actors, and artists who have gone beyond prejudice, as he has done, with clear confidence and lines as follows: “How can anyone deprive themselves of the joy of my company!
This is understandable to me:
In 1975, Alice Walker wasted himself on Hurston's unmarked grave, and he began to fight to give back his reputation.
Five years later, Robert E. Hemenway, written by a well-known Hurston biographer, was brought back to America's role models.
The road construction project would have started just when Eatonville's most famous daughter returned to the center of attention.
And this time Hurston's old neighbors thought he was a rescuer.
In 1988, the community started organising a Hurston festival to show us what the county would destroy with its main path.
Thousands of fans came to the opening event two years later, and many people have returned to the ceremony in January.
A few years later, the county stopped its road construction proposal.
“The five-tracking of the main road has led the community to relived and fully connected to the speed, which means true civil pride, ” said Nathiri.
Boyd said in a simpler way: “Zora saved Eatonville.
The victory over the road construction project helped to change the image of the city itself.
More and more people outside the city appeared than Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started to go to church in 1993, and locals began to re-assemble the past.
Eatonville was included in the national historical record in 1998.
In 2006, the new one-level library (named naturally from Hurston) was opened, the refurbished and built on Kennedy Avenue.
Eatonville continued to have Florida cakes: not only 10 km from the center of Orlando, but sometimes it feels like a suburban bystand during summer rain; it is as small as when 27 black families were founded in the 1880s.
(90% of the inhabitants are black today)
They're still taking caution over outsiders who come here looking for the story of Eatonville.
Most interviews require prior authorisation, and some things, such as Eatonville's oldest fresco, which is represented by a white man painting black and working on the earth, should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, including self-employed Jones teacher, who is particularly attracted to the lively red, are afraid of being misinterpreted by their separate community.
And yet, as the Hurston festival grew wider, the pride of the hometown has grown.
Especially young people are looking more and more at Eatonville, as Hurston saw his own tree: no better, no worse, as proud, creative, foolish, and confused as other racial and ethnic groups in America.
A real civil bond is silenced by Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, who plans to return to the local government after college, or the police, to work to help him.
And it seems that the younger ones have learned to describe Eatonville correctly, such as the 11-year-old Winter Park twin: Alondra and Alexia Kenon.
“ Most people who travel here think that this city is nothing compared to others, ” said Alondra Kenon recently after worship on Sunday.
“ But if someone stops and makes a little time to get to know his history, it is a very beautiful city, ”
We all speak the language of finance here in New York.
Nothing on the surface has changed.
If the tourists didn't care about the newspaper furniture and the huge TV shows at Times Square, I wouldn't notice they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never find out that with glass - walled, bee-shaped offices over their heads, bankers and venture fund managers who have held power in New York, since 1929, they have been living the hardest days.
The couriers are still going through their metal teaspoons on the flights, delivering trays with muffins for breakfast meetings.
Men of Spanish lips are still squeezing among the blocks, carrying 50 pounds of extremities as human mules, which hang on a loop like that on shoulders.
The office workers are still in line for their sweet bakeries at the food cart on the sidewalk, and it's still impossible to get a taxi between 4 and 7 p.m.
I didn't feel like it was any crisis until Thursday afternoon, despite every emergency news, I didn't decide to open a new bank account.
I was also deliberately planning to do this in my local account of JP Morgan Chase's bank in the afternoon peace, but there were now or 20 people standing in front of me.
Not from his bank money window, where money can be collected or paid, but from the customer service counter, where old customers order a checkbook, tourists ask for directions to the Macy's store, and where new customers open a bank account.
Many of them, later I learned from Starr, who ordered me, from a banker, with the same intent as I did.
However, unlike me, they have already taken their money from smaller banks in their residence, such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
Money was collected from so-called savings banks (which are like housing cooperatives), credit cooperatives and small-town savings funds that operate only in one state and are allegedly treated as family members.
In the last year, 15 banks like this went quietly destroyed.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion of capital, was under bankruptcy, and when New Yorkers went home for the weekend, another bank, Wachovia, made savings of $440 billion.
The office and shop employees in front of me, fearing another collapse, have transferred their money to a bank that seemed safe to the bank that makes most capital injections on Wall Street.
The simple people in New York have become an expert in finance over the past few weeks.
A woman on her phone at the local Chinese store spoke of Lehman Brothers bank and her huge director-in-chief Dick Fuld as if he complained to a lazy colleague.
And Lynn, who's been talking about Brad and Angelina, or my food delivery as usual, changed the subject of my house's uniform, 50-year-olds.
So he told me after I went to the bank: “I invested all my savings in money market instruments.
I've changed, I'm not risking...
Musulman graves were abused, while Austria was on the right side of the keyboard
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left-hand Austrian Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter, from the right-hand side of the Belgian party, Vlaams Belang, took part in a protest in Antwerp on Thursday, 17 January 2008, on Thursday which was presented by the “Registants of the Iszlám”.
There were signs of traffic signs that used red lines to describe the Mets.
According to the police, the extremes on the extreme left are responsible for the breeding of the Muslim funerals in Austria, which took place on the same weekend when the parties on the extreme left were significantly advanced in national parliamentary elections.
He had over 90 graves in the tragedy cemetery near Linz, some time between Friday and this morning.
The perpetrators drew Jewish symbols, such as David's star, for example, for a few graves, but according to the detectives, they were just trying to hide their extreme motives, which stem from hatred against the Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear whether the incident can be associated with elections in some way.
A spokesperson of the local Islamic community said that “a great deal has been done, ” the tombing of the tomb, which was not long before the end of the Muslim religious month, Ramadan.
Meanwhile, Austria will conduct a conscience test following yesterday's parliamentary elections in which the political balance language is right-hand.
The two extreme parties, which obtained almost 30% of the votes, were campaigned for a strong anti-immigrant law for the Future of the Party of Freedom and the Federation, and some of their logos were stamped as critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, president of the Freedom Party for more than 18% of the votes, expressed the campaign against heads and bourgeois, as well as his rejection against foods allegedly linked to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, the party spoke of “European brotherhood, ” which would prevent Islam from being strengthened.
He wants both parties to ban the construction of the Mecs and myself, arguing that they are the political symbols of the ongoing Islamicisation of Austria and Europe.
According to the public polls and analyses carried out directly after the extreme winners, the change was largely due to the young voting base, who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Garry Glitter was banned from a foreign travel
Garry Glitter, a known rock star for rape of children, was banned by the court from travelling to France and Spain.
The judges then decided to ban Glitter for six months that he notified the authorities of his intention to travel through France to Spain.
The U.S.D. has obtained the ban on travel by Thursday after submitting evidence to the Court of Justice of the judgments on rape against the child against the Glitter.
Glitter, in real name Paul Gadd, was not represented in the case of Ashford Magistrates in the field, but in the lawyers of Corker Binning.
A court speaker said: “On Thursday, 25 September, the U.S. police filed a request to the Ashford Magistrates Court for the prevention of the planned journey to France and Spain by Paul Gadd on 25 March.
“Paul Gadd did not show up in person, ”
64-year-old Glitter has informed the authorities of his foreign travel intention, because that is why he is bound by the law applicable to those involved in the register of sex offenders.
You should inform the authorities if you intend to travel abroad for more than three days.
It is also required to notify the police at least seven days before the planned visit.
If you do not notify the authorities, you may be sentenced to five years' imprisonment.
The Kent Police said they don't want to talk about the specific cases of Glitter County and the possible whereabouts.
We learned from the U.S. talk: “The Kent police are doing everything they can to protect children within the country and abroad.
“We believe it is easier for someone to check if they do not leave the United Kingdom because there is a comprehensive system here that allows us to deal with potential risks more effectively.
\"The main task of the Kent Police is to protect Kent's population. Through close cooperation, we continue to monitor the behaviour of persons in the register of sex offenders and in the county in order to minimise potential risks to the population\"
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for rape of a 10-year-old girl.
After his release, he flew to Bangkok, where he should have taken a plane to London.
However, he claimed that he felt bad and refused to fly to London.
Land authorities did not allow the passport investigation, so they finally flew to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also did not allow entry into the country, so he flew back to Bangkok, where officials of the county police and immigration agencies insisted that he return to Great Britain.
Finally, on 22 August, he arrived at the Heathrow airport terminal 3, and he remained there until his lawyer David Corker went to the court of West London, Luxembourg, as according to Scotland Yard's request, he was admitted to the records of those who committed sexual crime under a court order.
Glitter used to spend four months in prison in the United Kingdom in 1999 for taking pictures of child rape.
According to a Ministry of Home Affairs, Jacqui Smith, Secretary of State for the Interior, was pleased to see that Glitter was not allowed to travel to France and Spain.
“I do not take pictures on stage, because I would like to introduce the artist from a personal page, Günther Bauer Photo Artist
No decorations, no furniture, no dancing shoes.
From the center of the flamenco master's body, without the excitement of the action: to get to know the ordinary face of the dancers.
The artist on the one hand.
On the other hand, the common man.
And these two sides cannot be separated, except in intimate, distant moments, when we can find a personal movement, we can seize the depth of a captured view, or we can admire the unprepared, yet express hands of an artist who is not doing stage performance.
The photo series of German Günther Bauer Flamenco-people combines the theatre of singer, dancers and guitarists with this less known ordinary side of the masters.
Through the photographs, flamenco's unique iconography is presented from different angles.
The exhibition, which is part of Flamenco Photography Day, reflects the international importance of flamenco from day to day, considers the creator, adding that Flamenco-people could be anyone, as the monitor sees that these images are not typical of artists.
These people on the street are artists who can bring passion, sadness, joy to the stage... and rob the audience.
But stage photography isn't a good idea to grab their personality.
Their personality and character are the deepest of their beings.
I wanted to create an indoor atmosphere that allows me to acquire the personality of the greats of the flamenco with the help of the camera.
The Cante de las Minas festival gave impetus to Bauer's long journey in 1997, during which portraits of flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers were made with a record camera.
These portraits, thanks to the camera and the theme selection, quote classical photography.
However, the use of different stilisistic tools is breaking up with traditional image design and suggests modernisation. The following thought truly reflects Bauer’s vision of the flamenco: “This is a music with traditional roots, but it changes from day to day and is always impressive.
Not the dance, not even the song or the music itself, but rather the artist's personality and character make the audience magical.
In the days, the guiding principle of works that can be seen in the El Fotómata Gallery is the search for a meeting with the essences of the art column, which becomes visible through perception, existence and display.
The famous shapes of Flamenco, including Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morene, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, have the names of this photo collection of 60 artists.
The project also became a flamenco-antology, about which a album of portraits at the exhibition will soon be released.
Bauer’s passion for portraits for the portraits for two years has been repeated by a series of “SportART project” by Veteran athletes.
Although the concept of Flamenco-people differs slightly from that, the photographer adds: “I really like to take pictures of people, to know them and to enter their lives for a longer or shorter moment.
In my opinion, photography is the hardest piece of art in the portrait.
You meet people, you meet people, you bring people together with people you don't know sometimes, or just have a few minutes to take pictures.
But in spite of these circumstances, I always try to fulfill my ideas as a photographer.
The exhibition of Flamenco-people, selected from the contemporary Flamenco portraits, can be held in El Fotómata Gallery, Alameda de Härcules, under the number 20 El Fotómata, until 16 October.
According to Vargas Llosa, the novel he works on is “a ready strength, ”
The location and the act are still unknown, but Mario Vargas Llosa is also struggling to write a new novel.
At the Hay Festival Segovia event yesterday, an equal writer for the Irish Nobel Prize said that his current work was “made strength, ” and “any sign that we should not write, the novel.
“If I were smarter, I would not, but I am going to do it and I hope I can do it at some point at the end of the day. With these words, he closed his presentation at the festival of ideal, thought and opinion exchanges, which has been received by writers, historians and journalists for four days in the city of Aqueduct, and thousands of visitors.
“ The city and the dogs, ” author, was one of the most outstanding participants in the celebration of literature, and he also replaced the hopes attached to it.
Vargas Llosa won the Hay Festival Award voted by the participants, Dickens, a former edition of our friend.
For my audience, the hour was short, during which the writer of the potato had an amazing memory and a great amount of humor told me how he had developed from his special adventure of reading passion and his calling for life; how he believed through the method of writing, hard documentation, repair and rescription of inspiration, how he had been able to convince his writers Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas, and what his stories are built on.
The Latin American novelist acknowledged that it was impossible to measure or demonstrate whether books would change our lives, but added: “I do not think that literature has a purely fun or a tisavire experience, ” because it affects people and makes them think, so he asked the writers not to allow them to be tempted to take responsibility for their conduct.
The weather is shorter for Pozoblanco, and the horse bulls are missing.
Traditionally, the horsey bullpox, as the closing order of the Pozoblanco festivals, was deleted from the show yesterday morning after the future horse-to-go stormers found the arena unsolicited.
As a result, the Committee decided, with the agreement of Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, to stay with the bullock.
The weather changes have thoroughly ruined the series of festivals, since two of the three events could not be held.
On Saturday, the rain was left with the second bull.
The future main players, José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista Castilblanco, would have fought bulls.
So it was only on Friday.
The winner, Daniel Luque, was brought home three ears as a trophy, raised to shoulder after a sophisticated and aesthetic struggle.
In the same afternoon, by means of the two bulls of Aleandro Talavante, he obtained a ear as a trophy, but it could be thanks to the audience rather than his own performance.
However, El Juli was followed, who had little contribution to the ageing of the reputation of the Los Llanos arena.
With the second bull, after a comfortable journey, most of the audience managed to get out of the sun.
In his condition, a two tons of abdomen transporting van tried to escape road traffic control
Four o'clock in 50 minutes.
The Basque District Police are conducting traffic checks on the administration of Armiñón (Álava).
The Authority will stop a van in which two travels, and passengers will try to escape the measure.
The shipment, more than two tons of abdomen, but it wasn't noticeable.
The detectives were after the passengers, and one of them, a 28-year-old man was arrested, and they identified him as A. A. J., reported the Basque Government Department of Internal Affairs.
The captured man is accused of drug trafficking and prosecution.
The case occurred in the administrative area of Armiñón, where the employees of the Álavai Forgalmi Board carried out traffic checks on N-1 motorways.
When they wanted to stop the van, the driver refused to obey, suddenly gave gas, and then left the inspection site.
The detectives took him after him, then the vehicle stopped at the stop line a few miles away, and his passengers fled from the highway to a forest area.
The Basque Regional Police finally captured one of them, and after having examined the Iveco Daily branded van, he seized its shipment of 2178 kg of abdomen.
In the rear of the vehicle, the police authorities have been forced to carry out a more thorough investigation and to assess the drug.
In addition, the verification has shown that the vehicle's false registration plate does not match the information contained in the van's documents and therefore, because of the breach of public document.
The Basque Regional Police are conducting an investigation aimed at arresting another suspect, who, as we have already mentioned, escaped from the highway and, on the other hand, the origin of the drug seized.
The 28-year-old defendant A. A. J. was transported to the police to conduct the necessary interrogations and then court proceedings started within a few hours.
They arrested Heather Locklear because he was under drug control.
Heather Locklear, the popular Amanda of the Melrose Place series, arrested by the police in Santa Barba (Kalifornia) this weekend because he was under drug control.
According to an eyewitness, he was trying to leave the parking lot with strange maneuvers in Montecito - reported to People magazine one of the spokespersons of California traffic surveillance.
According to the witness, around 16 o'clock, at 30 o'clock, he pushed the gas to the Locklear Battalion, he tried to move the engine forward and back to the parking lot, and he went through his sunglasses several times in the backway.
Shortly later, the eyewitness, who probably didn't recognize the actress at first, saw Lockear stop at a nearby highway and get out of the car.
He also informed the police because “he was concerned about Lockler’s life...
When the police arrived, the actress sat in her car, which partially paralyzed the traffic on the highway.
“ She seemed to be aZavart, ” the patrols took her to a specialized center for drug and alcohol testing.
According to a police spokesperson, the actress was a co-operative and almost immediately excluded alcohol consumption, and the speaker also said that, based on the first impression of the officers, they thought Lockear was under the influence of a drug.
Lockleart was arrested and suspected of driving under the influence of an unidentified drug. Around 19 hours, he was transported to a local prison where he was released a few hours later.
Lockler came out of an Arizona sanatorium two months ago where he was treated with anxiety and depression.
Llamazares calls on the IU (United Left) Federation to deal with Silva
Gaspar Llamazares, the Secretary General of the IU and the United Left Representative said today that the regional Federation of the developments will make a decision in the case of Seville's former Youth and Sport Council, Francisco Manuel Silva. Silva resigned last week after she was accused of obtaining family benefits with her position.
“In these matters, I am a far-reaching federalist, and this case is indeed the competence of the donor organization, ” pointed out Llamazares to the procedure that the party should apply to the former member of the City Council in Seville.
On the other hand, President-in-Office of the IU stressed that, in the event of any irregularities that Silva might have committed, “in the light of transparency” must be kept in mind: “At the IU has always been flattened in order to ensure maximum transparency in such matters.”
He added that the part of the training was also a strict code of ethics for civil servants.
“Mousic blood, ” Garci epics
Benito Pérez Galdos was inspired by José Luis Garci, who is bringing the famous French anti-Jewish rise in the blood of May, which, with its nearly EUR 15 million budget, is the greatest creation of cinematographer.
Accordingly, the director tried to illustrate the human flow and social analysis of his well-known novelist work. Today, in his film presentation Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, Garci told the public audience of actors.
The blood of more than two and a half hours of Mayis is presented on Friday at the cinema, and later the Telemadrid mini-series will be spread over four hours.
José Luis Garci, a great admirer of Galdós' literature, has made his childhood dream with this shooting. This is thanks to Esperanza Aguirr, because he has been entrusted with the Madrid Convention three years ago to make a monument for the 200th anniversary of the Madrid events of May 2.
The 15 million budget was fully financed by the Madrid Autonom Republic, and Garci was given a special opportunity: he could present the country with a flawed decoration and a sign.
However, the director expressed his regret for not counting the budget of Alatriste or Goya's Phantoms, which were more than double in May's blood. It was therefore forced to leave a few scenes of the script, which, as many other times, were recorded together with Horacio Valcárcell.
So he went to the usual working method of the Reaper, and he took the scenes with actors who had already started the tests before the shooting. Casting was not, because Garci thinks that he was “responsive, ” and because, as he said, “the director's masterpiece is part of the theatre and the procedure to find out what's going on in the industry we work in. ”
More actors in May's blood, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo, did not go to the camera for the first time.
Garci, who may be proud of four Oscars and an Oscar prize, considers that this year's candidate for the Hollywood Academy of Sciences, namely, the blood of May, the seven French billiards, and the young generation of Vaks, who were finally elected, was not represented by the young generation of Spanish cinemas, “Wherever it should be presented. ”
Garci's film doesn't count as a prize.
“In your opinion, you’re working for the poster, and then you realize that it’s just a matter of happiness, and you’re finally happy to have one more film ready, ” says Garci, with 30 years of professional careers behind his back.
Isabel Bayón recalls the life and art of the Seville dancer, Tórtola Valencia
A Flemish dancer in Seville also recalls me as a dancer in Seville.
From the Catalan father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and the donor mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela) Carmen Tórtola Valencia was born in Triana and moved to London at the age of three.
He was an artist of free dance and an expert in East Dance.
During his moving life, he fought as a pioneer for female equality, whether Isadora Duncan, Virginia Wolph or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was a Buddha and a vegetarian, and he fought against wearing a fertilizer that prevented women's freedom of movement.
He blew up a dance and aesthetic revolution in a wary Europe, and his life was a waste of Isabel Bayón.
“I wanted to work with Pope Gamboa, ” he advised Tortola, whose personality was truly impressed.
The flamenco dancer said: “It is not our goal to tell the story of life, but to capture his spirit.
I thought of the addresses of his dances in flamenco styles.
For example, from his “pillar dance, ” guajira, or the“ snake’s dance, ” the Tango.
“ He danced very well, and others believe that my style is characterized by this, ” he says.
The light of the performance is raised by two extraordinary participants: Miguel Poveda, after the open door, now sings again at Isabel's performance; and Matilde Coral, who, in this case, specifically wanted to work with an earlier disciple.
“Matilde is developing the older Tortoola, the mature woman.
I am pleased that he said yes to the request, it is very encouraging that he performs in my play.
In addition, Júsz Torres and Paco Arriaga performers and guitarists, Miguel Ortega, El Pulga and Moi de Morón singer; El Payaro batter, Rafa El Viola king, and Juárez Juanfra, who “plays a constant character with the love of the real duret, ”
The piece also presents the life of a woman who lives in London, but also travels to Europe, and it also reaches a distant landscape, including India, the United States or Italy.
“I wanted to remember him because his personality had a great impact on his own age, but now he is no longer known and is even less valued than his work, ” says Bayón.
The performance starts at 20 o'clock this evening at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
At the end of the Triennium, the journal of a newly married poet is also published
The first illustrated release of a newly married poet's diary will be presented in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in May 1916. The presentation will be part of the programme series entitled Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium (2006-2008) organised by the Cultural Commission of the Andalus Regional Government on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the award of the Industrial Nobel Prize and the anniversary of the two of their deaths.
In this way, the closure of Zenobia and Juan Ramón Triennium is the re-opening of this work, the restoration of the International Congress in New York, the Nobel Prizes Memorial House and the “Juan Ramón Jiménez: The bright summer tree”. This year, the exhibition was opened in May and was scheduled to visit New York.
The Andalús Regional Government's Cultural Committee has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the reputations and works of one of the most widely married poets of Perdo Tabernero and Jacobo Pérez-Enciso.
Without Paul Newman, it's not such an attractive America.
“God sometimes produces perfect people.
Paul Newman was, too, “
The quote comes from an actress named Sally Field who worked with Newmann in the film \"Sensorship\" and reflects the shock and inability of Newman's death in American cinema and throughout America.
How hard it is for Oscar to get.
He retired in 2007,
And he was generally ill,
But he's still ordering everyone to die.
“ Some inability to put our feelings into words, and I have just lost a good friend, ” said Robert Redford, “the existence of a better life and this country, ”
No one was afraid that she might get ridiculous or overdo it.
One of the heroes of cinema and home went away in a particularly dark time, which was covered by fear of terrorism and market conditions, the despair of the American self-esteem and the desperate search of dignity.
When such difficult times and many easily lose virtues, and there are very few people we can look at, we don't have to be Luis Cernut to admire Paul Newman.
In the eyes of humans, she was testing the beauty and justice of the platonic.
Richard Nixon was a formal enemy and protector of lost and won cases, starting from the anti-pharmaceutical foundation established for the memory of the firstborn son of the drug overdose, pending the creation of a domestic bio-food brand.
It was a real gift to a country that was difficult to overcome the culture of self - sacrificing nutrition.
The fiery wave of wonder entered all Hollywood, regardless of nationality and origin.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, says he's not a man, he's dead in a era.
Another English, Oscar winner Sam Mendes, said that Newmann and his joint work clearly meant the summit of his career.
Russell Crowe, the bad guy from Australia called him Newman right the biggest inspiration.
“ He has made the laser very high for all of us, ” stated George Clooney, who may be one of the few who is trying to follow Paul Newman’s lifestyle today: they require honesty and private life away from serious and cameras.
It's not always easy if it's even possible in the midst of today's media jungle.
Still, there's someone who's trying, and Paul Newman's a role model.
Once divorced, but then lived a faithful marriage with Joanne Woodward for 50 years, and certainly would have had many occasions for infidelity.
“ Why some burgers are waiting for French meat at home, ” he said.
In heaven, you may be proud that your girls on earth are also fans of what is not very common in America.
“ None of his designs were as proud as the faithful husband, the loving father, the caring grandfather and the devoted man - friend role, ” he says.
The madrid Olympics are a rough way
Indeed, many of us have dream of a Madrid Olympics, and after the 2012 Olympics failed, it may be 2016.
But, I'm asking if we're really ready for it?
Because if we're out of yesterday's race, I don't think so.
It was called a perfect race, but, in my view, it was the worst of many I've ever been.
The mass of misconceptions was described, and if it were to be assessed once, and I would be the examiner, clearly the result would be a failure.
But let's move on and start at the beginning.
The nonsense began with the takeover of the serial number, which was why they had to arrive earlier.
This is not a problem yet, but if you go sooner, at least get everything at the same time (including chip, to avoid a job later).
Well, that's not what happened.
First only the row number was transferred (first indisputable, only as soon as possible) and (after the usual line of work), how surprising it was, only the S T-shirt (second incompetence because I had the exact XL size)!
What world do we live in?
Or did they decide to save money and buy cheaper, smaller T-shirts?
But anyway, these things are still going to be broken compared to what happened on the day of the race.
In addition to having to go over the chip at a terrible time, it took 15 minutes to get a job from the arrival, and even the backpack had to be given off.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is unclear in the case of a race with more than 11.000 people.
So, as expected, the competition started, and we haven't given up the backpack yet, and when we finally made it, it was even worse.
In addition, the rain has made the waiting for more than 40 minutes more pleasant, as has been defined by public and stand-surrection attempts.
I think we're getting 500 sure pneumonia by tomorrow, and some of us, including myself, are not getting our real time.
If they asked me about the perfect race, I wouldn't think of that by any chance.
So I think we can continue to dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft (virtual) is looking for reception
At the MIT emerging Technology Conference, Microsoft presented the development of a new image recognition and human interaction system, a kind of - non-smart - artificial intelligence, which, however, is able to perform some of the basic tasks. For example, Microsoft can call a taxi (or a vehicle in the company's territory) on the basis of the information it hears.
This ‘reception’ means a camera and a design and facial power system that can recognize how many people in the room, who they are - even notes what clothing they wear - and hears and understands the keywords of their conversations.
In addition, you can group the present people on the basis of your conversations.
On the display video, the reception lady identifies a third person, but she knows that she's not part of the company that's talking to her, and she's not an employee of the company.
He asks if he came to visit someone and he'll make sure he's in a hurry to help him soon.
All this without a blue big screen.
That's impressive.
But this is of course the music of the future.
At present, the company has more important things to do, such as developing a new version of the Windows operating system.
A lot of people said this week that Microsoft's strategy has changed.
Windows 7 will be smaller and will contain less accompanying program.
Steve Ballmer realized that if the computers were only running the necessary programs instead of a lot of commercial trash, the machines would be five times faster - bravo, Steve, that's something.
The Spanish version has been invented, given that Microsoft has added extra functions and extras to Windows so far in all new versions.
Change of direction will change.
Microsoft's right, the operating system is increasingly in the background, and the software itself.
When Google Chrome appeared on the net, I joined the theory that Google did the first step to be a Windows competitor.
Many have correctly acknowledged that a browser is not part of the operating system.
The operating system will always be needed because it is an essential element in the hardware and software dialogue.
You play the same role as your wife or husband when you want to say something to your mother-in-law.
That's right.
He will never disappear, but we need to count on the death of the operating system, not absolute, but relative.
Ballmer's statement this week supports this thought.
People are paying less attention to the operating system and increasing attention to the browser.
The computer is only turned on to open Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and more and more time for browsing than we spend in the world of windows.
What is there to do with the system?
Less is sometimes more.
And Windows 7 is less, much less to be at Vista's.
It's less difficult, less stressed, less complicated.
Microsoft's aim is to integrate its services more on-line, and to ultimately report an alternative to Google.
All they need is an example of why.
At the beginning of the month, I made this photo in a conference room for Microsoft users in Redmond.
On the drinking machine, a poster calls them to use the company's browser.
In 2006, an independent study found that 66% of Microsoft professionals used Google to browse the Internet.
By the way, the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was announced last week.
Not at the beginning of 2009, but at the end of the year, and more in 2010.
Microsoft will probably try to throw Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 into a single market.
The cell phone is becoming more and more a computer function.
But the slide, given that Android and iPhone are already on the market, will certainly ruin their business.
Le Fabuleux Marcel
This was borne by Pablo Picasso in the Costa Azulon, Leonardo di Caprio Edward Zwick Véres diamond, and by Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's cross-section, as well as by one of the main costumes of the well-managed gay shopping community.
And even if we're on the list of specialities, we can remember the peace figures of the emigration's kacquencing chief.
What are we talking about?
I mean, as the Englishman is called “tank”, but any competitors of any one of them must not compete with Fabuleux Marcel de Bruxelles.
First of all, because of his elegant name - although he is among his friends only “Marcel”, which he has thanks to sport,” the legend says Marcel Cerdan, who was named after his lover, Edith Piaf.
Marcel's excellent cotton material, unisex's smell, his special emblém and his small (to be recognized) Belgian flag are also found among his competitors. The latter is carried in the back of the T-shirt.
But the Belgian company doesn't just make tank tops.
The sports fans, retro boxers, cashmere cardigans, wool pants, seamen, baby clothes, minisors - and we could all sort of be amongst the company's products.
And they're all in the category of comfortable underwear,
Even though it's unfortunate to have to wear them as underwear.
They're too good for that.
“I would love to be a young mother; no matter who the father is, ”
He was very similar to his brother, but he was able to accomplish himself.
Monica Cruz is small and fragile, but it's full of energy.
At present, Cruz sisters want to play a more serious role in the fashion world.
For Monica, modeling means much more than some pretty and beautiful girls give their name to something.
He was involved in the promotion of Mango's new headquarters in Paris, as well as the transfer of the busiest fashion fees sponsored by the Spanish company.
It's getting warm and gentle.
What are you actually doing in Paris?
We will present Mango's new fall-win collection, which we have planned with my brother Pennelop. In addition, we will participate in the publication of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' second competition and the gala dinner for Valentine's Honor in the Opera.
It's a pretty thick day, it's true, but it's very exciting.
This is your fourth season at Mango's company, where did you get the inspiration for the new collection?
We both love the cinemas of the '50s and '60s; we've taken a lot of things from there.
And then, many times I just walk into town and watch women dress up, how to change and choose their clothes - it's one of my favorite downloads.
You work as a dancer, an actress and a fashion designer, you're a versatile woman, aren't you?
That's what I think, too, but it's the three things are connected, because there's a lot of them in common.
When I was a kid, I was interested in clothes, I couldn't wait to go to my grandmother, and I could hide in my aunt's lockers.
Well, that was you on the Khan, he almost got up with a fun party.
And then, as a dancer, I always tried to listen to my dress.
You know, we dancers like to come up with our own style for hours and tests, so we can have fun when we look in the mirror.
And in the role of an actress, you'll really identify with your role when you get the costume.
You see, it's connected to everything, and I have all due respect for the designer and their expertise.
You were celebrating your 30th birthday.
Oh, no.
I feel better than ever, I love the 30s.
I think women are really worth it, they've experienced enough and they're making less mistakes in their lives.
And the biological watch doesn't worry.
I've been doing what I've wanted since I was a kid, and it's got me in great inner happiness.
And you want to be a mom or not?
Of course, I know that I'm a mother because I was born as a woman, and I'd like to be a young mother, and I don't want to miss it at all.
As far as the future father is concerned, no matter who he is.
I want to raise my child in happiness and great love.
Let's say a few words about the movie last year, you've been shooting more movies that you haven't even introduced.
Yeah, and I'm looking forward to coming out.
I, who started in theater, am very impatient and restless, want everything right now, but of course I know it's impossible.
I look forward to showing you the last hour and finding the tomb of Christ.
I wonder what you'd say to them...
I know you've been debuting me on the runway with Naomi Campbell for a few days.
No, that's not true.
I didn't go as a model on the runway.
I've known Naomi Campbell for a long time, and he's simply invited me to a charity fashion show in London, which was arranged by his own organization called Women for a better world. I chose two of my own Mango collections.
People don't even know how kind-hearted Naomi is.
There's so much about him, so I know him, and I can make sure half of him's not true.
On the other hand, I always look at the good side of your activity.
He asked me for a noble case for the fashion show, but if he wanted me to stand on his head, I'll do it.
If the fate of women living in the third world is a stake, I don't know anything.
The back-up drunk drivers will be obliged to install Alcolock.
The Ministry of Interior would require a car to install a structure that would prevent the start of a vehicle if the driver was in a state or did not blow into the structure after three drunk driving.
The proposal was presented in June and is currently being dealt with by the Public Prosecutor’s Office, according to which the pilot project will last for a year.
As the purpose of the project is to return to the market, the car driver will also have to participate in a repetitive course of transport education.
In addition to the Directorate General for Transport (DGT) and the Institute for Road Safety Technology (FITSA) will participate in the experiment.
According to statistics, 30-75% of car arresters are back in the car because of the drunk driving.
This would be prevented by Alcolock, since the system connected to the vehicle sets the alcohol content of the breath in the body. If it is higher than allowed, or if the driver did not blow into the apparatus at all, the system will not allow the car to start.
The cost of an instrument of more than EUR 1000 would be the result of an infringement.
A 2007 US study has shown that vehicles equipped with such instruments may reduce the number of infringements by up to 65% in the first year after installation.
In Spain, it is estimated that this rule could save 115 people each year.
The measure is focused on infringements for two reasons: on the one hand it is easier to prevent crime from becoming a criminal offence,
on the other hand, it is easier to introduce, as the implementation of the legal reform takes place in the usual field, while the necessary reform of criminal matters would need to be amended as a basis.
The instrument is not yet available in any form of trade in the Spanish market, although it has already been installed in some industrial and public service vehicles in experimental mode.
The House of Representatives will vote tomorrow on the initiative of the Spanish Socialist Labour Party, which - for a French sample - calls for the installation of the system in school buses.
In Mexico, closed shoes
In English, at the time of the program, 17 hours at 40 minutes ago, the Spanish Air Force Hercegi Party was landed in the chair of the Benito Juárez airport in Mexico City.
The sun was already down, but it was so hot that we could only see the royal party leaving the plane using our hands as an observer.
At the foot of the stairs, the Spanish ambassador and other senior personalities were standing.
A few hours before I asked a cab driver on the street if he knew that the Spanish Hercegi couple would come to the city for official visits.
Okay, well, you won't have an airport transfer today for a long time... a woman here or something...
No, no, sir, the lady's Spanish, she's just been here for a few years.
- Yeah, or...
But the Mexican press knows all about the Princeship Party and the importance of their visit.
A lot of people are waiting for the airport hangar in red carpets, a sequence of 27 sailors who see the protection of dignity.
Herceg, smiled, dressed in sea blues, and then the princess gets her long hair in her wind, caught in her clothes, but not in her usual shoes that flash her toes - they may have warned her that she's a storm in Mexico City.
They stop and smile at the cameras for a moment, then enter the room where the official reception comes.
In their hotel gate - one of the four biggest hotels in the city - they are expected to be the reporter of one of the pancakes of Mexican television.
The most valuable fashion fee
To give a fashion award, the world's most suitable place is undoubtedly Paris, and today's fashion designers are the most sophisticated and undoubtedly Valentino.
Mango has recently announced the second invitation to the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, which aims to internationalize the young talents of fashion.
The prize is 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, however, Sandrina Fasoli, the first winner of the first competition in the palace of Mango under the Paris boulevard Haussmann 54, saw his own design clothes, and without a little bit of tears of strength.
By the way, this company's second largest business in Europe has recently opened at 1335 square meters.
The biggest deal is in London.
We finally found ourselves at a luxury dinner at the Garnier Opera in Paris, in the middle of the statements of the ceremony and thanks to Valentino for the jury.
The presidential table of the gala dinner prepared by Mango showed me even more spectacularly in the company of the most lived Chagalok.
Nati, who recently died with a heavy heart and sorrow, wore one of the company's pieces and some of the breathtaking jewels of ELAH.
Andik, the owner and owner of Mango, had fun with the guests. Rothill's bar was so knightly at the university that they eventually stayed without a suit because they were both gifted to a lady.
Monica Cruz came to the store in his own design pants and shirts, and at dinner he wore a sexy long black dress. At night's opera party, Gaya Toledo was so excited in the ballet room that, ingesting the old times, he was in the middle of one of the bars and a grand plie-style.
Inés Sastre didn't attend the palace visit, but he showed me some photos of his son before.
The next day we were delighted at Oliver Martinez - he was two meters tall and motor - and John Travolta also arrived at the hotel with Intercontinental Paris. He brought his own sheets and towels with him, and he said, \"He doesn't ask for any insight into the room.\"
Stars under the Paris Star Force.
Oh Ià là, c'est la.
1001, stress solution number
It's not 1,000, it's 1,000, and there's a way to turn off the chaotic and horrid routines.
Another good news is that we can find them in a single book coming to the bookstore on September 30 to bring peace with you.
It's almost tortured at 7:00 a.m., but it's even worse to think of the speed of life that the world hastened today than today.
The office's name is tension, and the computer's back pain.
The stress is the population disease of the 21st century.
But there are no one or two ways to overcome daily fatigue and overcome problems at work.
No, this number is equal to exactly 1001.
In addition to yoga positions, classic massages or “spa” treatments, Susannah Marritot offers a wide range of opportunities in his book so that everyone can find a solution that can be adapted to their most pleasant and free moments.
The stress-solving piece bears the address of the 1001 relaxing method, and the resulting rest comes from the Pearson Alhambra y DK publisher to the bookstores.
If you are convinced that stress can hardly be removed from the world of work or personal relationships, this manual will certainly inspire you in your faith.
In addition, it also serves other ideas that help all of us to relax, such as tips on how to get closer to nature or how to make up to 100% of natural foods.
If your adrenaline levels are too low to refresh your body and become a central problem in the life of stress, it is time to get back in the photo, relax and concentrate on reading.
Those who speak in dreams
Some kids talk at night.
I'm not thinking of those who get up and tell them completely what happened to them that day, but about those who speak during sleep.
The phenomenon may seem scary to the first, but it's really harmless.
It's called the predisposed sleep disorder somniloquismus.
Very common, especially among children and adolescents.
I'm sure they've told more people that he spoke at night.
The frequency may be completely rapsodic (e.g. only once in a high fever disease) or more regular (day, week or once a month) and the child usually does not remember anything the next day.
The display cannot lead to a single trigger.
It is often mixed with other sleep disturbances, such as nightmares, night-suffering, night-sitting (enuresis nocturna) or sleep procedures, but it is not lawful.
As we have already mentioned, there may be an accompanying phenomenon of high fever, or even stress, or increased excitement.
In any case, it's been a little researched up until now.
The intensity of speech is also very variable.
It may be dead, calm, may be associated with words, mortifies, but it may also occur in the form of yelling, crying or longer speech.
If the phenomenon is very intense, it is recommended to observe the child and to turn to a specialist. The examination may reveal whether there is a problem that causes great anxiety in the background and can therefore be resolved.
As we have already mentioned, it is not a cure for a positive phenomenon, as a result, unless there is any other possible form of sleep disorder (e.g. sleeplessness or stress).
However, we can do a few things, see a pre-mix measure:
Let us note that the child stays calm before bed.
Choose calming games and avoid watching TV shows or series that scare the child or aggressiveer.
For children that are prone to nervousness or are more likely to relax, we teach some relaxing methods to find inner peace easier.
This will help the child to sleep more calmly.
If he starts talking while he's asleep, we'll try to keep the rest of the work.
Remember, this is harmless for the child, and they won't remember anything the next day.
Useful advice
Don't wake the child.
It would be unnecessary, because the kid doesn't know, but he'd push you out of sleep.
Even though he talks, he actually sleeps and rests.
Remember, if there is multiple severe anxiety, turn to a professional or reveal what causes the child to suffer from severe anxiety.
If you speak plainly (this is the worst case), do not start asking them to find out anything.
It would be unnecessary because during sleep, it is not so conscious that he gets his thoughts together.
On the other hand, you will hear the speech, but you will not see the dream images associated with it, so be careful with the interpretation of the hearers and possible conclusions.
Don't ever tell the kid they can ask you about his secrets at night.
Not even a joke.
This has caused a lot of anxiety.
So the most important thing is not to worry, because it's just a few minutes of harmless episode.
At last Illhaeusern
After a long deep flight, Illhaeusern's team has finally taken a new boost and won again on the domestic track.
Although there was no Fergelous game, the yellow-blacks were once more in a situation where one of them could eventually win.
The pace of the match was not too tight, as the attackers were hard to feel the right rhythm.
The first gate shot was taken by the captain of the guest team, Kauffmann, but the remote ball just touched the upper corner of the gate. After that, Illhaeuser took up and followed each other by the shootings: Fonderflick tried with a remote shot, and Hirn shot above the gate. Romain spötol and Diebold also tried to use a remote experiment to push the protection of Dannemarie.
On the other side, players put themselves in a block in the middle track, and only Riahi, the heir.
The beginning of the second half-time was promised to be crucial: Riah and Temporale were first placed on the Dannemarie side. After this he was born the first goal: After Diebold's first shot, he was taken out with an excellent position by the illhaeuserni Marais and then sent it to the gate (53 minutes).
However, Illhausern's gourmet could not long have enjoyed glory: twelve minutes later, he was forced to leave the track, so his teammates had to continue the struggle in human poverty.
Dannemarie, however, couldn't take advantage of the advantage: they didn't cause much trouble for the domestic team, who just got a little back in order to strengthen their protection.
Sarkozy meets the angry fishermen
Before flying to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy's gonna take a field trip to Bretagne.
On Monday, the demonstration by fishermen affected the traffic of several bretons and Normann ports. Therefore, the President of the Republic decided to visit Le Guilvinec's port of Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet the representatives of the protesters.
They promised that the president would be “in a constructive spirit, ” and expressed their hope that Sarkozy would come with specific proposals.
The president's visit coincides with the meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Control set up by breton fishermen with the aim of initiating action against the increase in the price of gas oil, as the oil price exceeded the average record price of EUR 1,14 per litre.
According to David Martinon, the President of the Republic, he will discuss with the fishermen the solutions to help companies regain their competitiveness and make working conditions and wages safer for seafarers more secure.
The fishermen are determined to await Nicolas Sarkozy's arrival.
In the Tuesday morning, traffic slow demonstrations were held in Morbihan and Calvados County, with which nearly 10 km of long distortions were created.
They also paralyzed the transport of Quiberon's yacht link, but the roads towards Belle-île have not been closed.
The Quiberon was located in the peninsula with road towers.
On Monday, sailors have already proved their determination. In the morning, tyres and pallets were set on fire before the fuel stands at the Brussels ports, while demonstrations were held in Concerneau and Saint-Brieuc.
This was followed by further movements in other ports of the Atlantic and La Manche. In the Vendée County Sables d'Olonne, for example, fishermen did not board, while in Le Havre some 20 vessels were blocking commercial ships.
The fishing nets of La Turbelle and Le Croisic in the county of Loire-Atlantique were removed from the huge oil-refining block in Donges.
On the other hand, Boulogne-sur-Mer's fishermen decided to wait for the Wednesday meeting to be held at the Ministry by deciding on further steps.
In Le Guilvinec, the Board of Appeal should decide on its next step and its participation in the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris on Tuesday.
However, some breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the leaders of the National Fisheries Committee, since the Committee did not support their aspirations.
“The strike continues, ” said Liline Cariou, President of the Loerient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen who are not paying taxes for gas oil are currently about 50 cents per litre, but think that the operation of a vessel would only be profitable if the price of gas oil fell below EUR 0.30 per litre.
The wonderful Paul Newman
“Butch Cassidy and Sundance kid, ” had an unforgettable label at the home of Connecticut, 83 years old due to death and cancer.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes have also paid their respects to an actor who died when he was 83 years old, Paul Newman.
Embraer does not change its transport plans in 2008
Despite the crisis that threatens the global economy, the Brazilian airline company plans to deliver 215 aircraft this year.
The fourth largest aircraft company in the world, Embraer can keep the plans and plan to deliver 215 aircraft in 2008 - confirmed Fredrico Fleury Curado, President of the company.
In the first half of the year, the company delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company accounts for a large part of the Chinese market, in particular for 30-120 aircraft.
Embraer has now delivered a total of 41 machines to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG would sell more than 15% of its assets
The American International Group, which was set up by the US financial authorities, intends to sell more than 15% of its assets so that he can repay $85 billion in advance - announced the cost of the Financial Times.
In addition to its international-level life insurance and US pension insurance activities, the AIG would be more than a large part of all its other businesses - clarified the paper, which quoted resources close to the case.
According to the Times, the AIG Board of Directors was established on Sunday night to examine the possibilities for sales.
AIG did not confirm this information.
The asset stock that AIG intends to sell includes the aircraft leasing company International Lease Financial Corp, 59% of TransAtlantic Holdings' reinsurance company, as well as real estate portfolios and private equity investments - adds the Times.
However, according to the newspaper, there is no final decision on sales yet.
AIG should quickly obtain liquid assets to repay the USD 85 billion loan approved by the U.S. Government, thereby taking the risk that it will have to make up up to 80% of its capital and lose its shareholders in an appropriate proportion.
Study by Paris Historique on the Morning Meeting meeting
The New York Stock Exchange reported a historical decline on Monday after the Senate refused the Paulson rescue plan. The Dow Jones Index fell by 6.98% (which means almost 800 accurate reductions) and Nasdaq was 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Averyge index (DJIA) was reduced by 777,68 points, thus closing at 10 365,45 points.
The biggest decline in the index (684,81 points) has been registered on 17 September 2001 when trade re-launched following the terrorist attack on 11 September 2001.
Nasdaq 199, based mainly on technological papers, was closed at 1,983,73 points, while the index of Standard &amp; Poor's 500 increased by 8.81% (i.e. 106,85 points) decreased to 1 106,55 points according to official closure data.
The Wall Street Stock Exchange was also weakened at the opening, and when the Senate unexpectedly rejected the bank rescue plan to restore market balance, it started to fly deep.
In exchange for 228-no-voting votes up to 205, Members refused to provide the funds requested by Mr Henry Paulson's Minister of Finance.
The plan was set by nearly two thirds of the Republicans.
“In this regard, the market had bad signs, as Congress seems unable to approve a plan,” says Lindsey Piegza, a financial analyst of FTN.
“It appears from this point of view that the market was calculated on this plan, ” added, and she expressed her concern that if they adopted such a plan a few days later, it would be “ too late. ”
“If the plan is really condemned to death (...), then at Fed (American Central Bank - the Wednesday) and other central banks will have the order to deal with the crisis and the credit conditions will continue to be tightened up, ” warns Brian Bethune, the leading shareholder of Global Insight.
In order to further enhance the sense of urgency, Pegza adds: “A new and new financial institution will go bankrupt every day in the United States.
After Washington Mutual's bankruptcy on Friday, the authorities made sure that Wachovia's banking branches were purchased as rival, Citigroup.
The crisis in Europe has accelerated rapidly, which called for emergency measures to rescue banks in the UK, the Benelux States, Iceland and Germany. This indicates that the market – not just an American crisis, but a global crisis – has added the FTN Financial Analyses.
The bond market has been significantly satisfied.
The yield of a 10-year-old state bond to Friday night fell from 3.827% to 3.632%, and from 4.357% to 4.161% in the previous day.
Obama won the first television match
Friday's first debate of the two American presidential candidates was followed by another one, which had to decide that John McCain or Barack Obama would be released as winner of the match.
In no surprising way, both the Republican and the Democratic campaign leaders have said their own victory in the television couple followed by a third of American households.
According to David Gergen's political analyst, although John McCain's action was honorable, it was not enough to “beginful ” to stop its popularity: this is demonstrated by five weeks of surveys before the presidential election.
According to the Gallup Institute, the Democrat candidate is better at the fight: according to the results of the public opinion survey on Saturday, Obama has a five-point advantage against McCain (44% and 49%).
The 39% of those who have been asked for the most calculated, yet undeterminated, say that Obama will win, while 25% of them count as McCain's victory, according to a CBS survey.
Obama is expected to further increase its advantage by her partner, Joseph Biden, with a great Thursday's role. Biden's first and only public debate with Sarah Palin.
However, Bill Clinton warned me this weekend: “It would be hard to underestimate Palint.
He has good instincts.
McCain, who has been in his 70s, never shares his own, undisputed foreign policy experience and stresses his opposition to these issues, which have been at the heart of their first personal meeting.
“It seems, Senator Obama doesn’t understand that, ” he said, several times.
“I don’t think Senator Obama has the necessary experience and knowledge of the presidency, ” reported McCain.
This is the main attack area that has been used since yesterday's Republican TV ads.
Obama, on the other hand, stressed that he represents the future.
He didn't let himself be disturbed: he was confounded and clearly stated.
He stressed that he was able to make good decisions and restore a picture of the United States in the world.
“McCain still doesn’t understand, however, Obama has already “cut back the weekend’s broadcast of a Democrat advertisement, which puts the Republican leader’s eye on the fact that he has not yet measured the impact of the crisis on the American-Tutca people.
“ During the ninety minutes of the debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, ” announced yesterday Obama’s twenty thousand people gathered together in the rain in North Carolina.
Even the words of the “middle class, ” or “workers, ” have not yet been put out in his mouth; the confusing situation in the financial world is undoubtedly in favour of Obama, which the Americans consider most suitable to save the economy that is at the edge of the collapse.
“The next seven turning points could prove to be, ” said Charles Schumer yesterday, Senator Major Democrat.
According to Mr Rahm Emanuel's Democrat, one of the veterans of the Clinton Government, Obama-a economy has such excellent incentives as Bill Clinton during the financial crisis in 1998.
In the light of the democratic presidency, the current crisis is \"the final judgment on the poor economic policy for eight years, created by Mr Bush with the support of Senator McCain,
In spite of the stock exchange fluctuations, the illinisi senator reconfirmed that he would be able to reduce the tax burden of 95% of Americans. He added that his primary objectives include the creation of possible energy independence of the country by using renewable energy sources and the development of a health insurance system.
McCain, on the other hand, plans to set up 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
However, both presidents carefully excluded the questions relating to a bank rescue plan of USD 700 billion (470 billion), which was adopted last night by the Congress.
Minsk: “They have noticed that the election was taking place here, ”
Young people and opponents protested on Sunday night at the capital of Belarus to reject the expected outcome of parliamentary elections.
On Sunday night, hundreds of whites gathered on Minsk’s main square following the closure of the polling stations to protest against the cursing of election results.
Although results have not yet been published, many young people have protested against President Alexandr Lukashenko with the following words: “Diktator, please give up. ”
Some people admit that they didn’t even go to the vote: “Why would I go? They do what they want to do with my vote, ” says a young man.
The protestors do not believe that the regime, which tried to show itself in good color before foreign observers for the purpose of communicating with the European Union, would be ready for a democratic system change.
If the elections were to be made clear by observers, they would be able to remove sanctions against the country under which they refused the visa from 40 white leaders and some bank accounts were frozen.
In opposition, however, the elections did not take place clearly.
“We had been held from election committees, and our observers were unable to participate in the voting accounts, ” said Jurij Potyemkin, a member of the 12 parties, so a very heterogeneous United Democratic Forces coalition.
“The changes were only nominal, ” stresses Aleksandr Milinkievich, the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and the leader of the pro-European movement. “The point is to calculate the votes and, in our case, this executive power.
If the delegates of the opposition enter Parliament, it means that they were appointed and not elected.
But their access to Parliament enables them to have a place on television, to sit in the regions of the country and to submit legislative proposals.
The opposition must therefore be coloured in political life, because \" dialogue with the European Union must be started\".
In the same way, if our heavily devoted economy against Russia is in crisis and we are unable to renew it, we risk losing Russia's authority.
But we want to be independent.
The opposition is afraid that the European Security and Cooperation Organisation following the election process will accept the outcome of the vote as valid.
They stress that the participation rate seems too high, and the wide organisation of the pre-voting vote ( 26% of the voters took part in Minsk) gave any manipulation.
“They noted that the election was taking place here, ” asks the leader of the Social Democratic Democrats of Aleksandr Kozulin, who was last released from prison in August this year as a political prisoner.
There was no one in the polls.
And there will be up to five opposition representatives in Parliament, while those who are most in line with the leadership will be in place.
The silence of the night goes back to October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the central electoral committee will succeed.
Blood is safe again
President Francine Décary had a good reason to celebrate yesterday, because today Hema-Quebec became one of the safest and most effective blood tax companies in the world.
What is most important is that he managed to regain confidence in people, which seriously inspired the effect of the blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s.
As known, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross blood supply service were infected with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV) and hepatitis C viruses in the 1980s.
In February 1994, the Government of Canada launched an official investigation under the leadership of Judge Horace Krever, following drama and general assembly, with the aim of finding light on the circumstances that led to tragedy and making proposals to avoid future similar cases.
While Judge Krever's late report was submitted, some provinces set up their own committee to design a new blood treatment system for Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee carried out this task.
Following the Gélineau and Krever reports, two blood supply services were established in Canada: one is the Hama-Queberec serving Québet, and the other is the Canadian Customer Company responsible for the supply of all other provinces and the two territorys.
“When the Hema-Queberec began its activity in 1998, nearly 38% of people had confidence in the blood supply system of Quebec,” recalls Dr. Décary.
The situation was desperate.
“In the years to come, however, the safety of blood products and our work in this area have resulted in the recovery of people’s confidence,” says Décary proudly, that nearly 94% of the people in Quebec have already believed the Hema-Quelece in early 2008.
However, Dr. Décary does not forget that “the confidence is a very fragile thing, ”
Since the creation of the Hema-Québec on 28 September 1998, it applies the precautionary principle.
During this period, a number of cases have been discovered in Europe when Creutzfeldt-Jakob’s disease has also been infected - the doctor tells the company that has been running the company since its establishment in 1998.
“We had no idea if this disease was spreading via blood.
Therefore, we have relied on one of the most important recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau reports, which is that if we are uncertain and are at risk of developing a serious disease, we must take exclusion measures. In this case, Creutzfeldt-Jakob is a disease that causes brain damage, which will inevitably lead to death.
Therefore, in April 1999, we did not accept blood from people who have spent more than a month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
A few years ago, there was no doubt that the disease spreads through blood.
This case has convinced us that it has made sense to apply the precautionary principle “
In 1999, a technique that allows the HIV virus to be diagnosed with a much more sensitive diagnosis is the nucleoside acid test (NAT), which is directly capable of detecting the virus in the blood of blood donors, not the antibodies that were formed against the virus, for which the tests used were built.
With the NAT test, we can shorten the window tradition, which keeps us from infection until we can show the virus in the blood by means of our technical devices, explain the specialist.
This period was reduced to a shorter period than one week.
Thus, there was a significant reduction in the risk of blood clots being infected with blood and not to show this.
These improvements have greatly reduced the risk of developing AIDS through blood transfusions.
Today, the risk of someone getting blood infected with the HIV virus is 12 million to one.
“In other words, this means that 12 million blood products should be distributed until someone is infected with the HIV virus.
Since the Hema-Quebec distributes 400-500 thousand blood products each year, it should take more than 24 years to make such a case happen and someone infected with HIV virus through a blood preparation.
I think that anyone can accept or write blood transfusions today in order to restore health - claims to be the first leader of the Hema-Québec.
\"The challenge of the coming decade will be to maintain the reliability of our products.
We never know what new pathogens are going into the system.
It was only last year that the chikungunya virus was published on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, gets in the blood with insect bites.
Therefore, we must continue to be present at all times,” continued Dr. Décary, who stressed that outside the emergency reserves, the Hema-Quebebec had to provide sufficient permanent reserves.
“The ageing population also increases needs.
As anticancer treatments have become more aggressive, patients often need to replace red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also affects the population of blood taxes, as the number of people on the network is only 3% of the population in Quebec.
However, every healthy person, at least 18 years, who fulfils the conditions of competence, can have blood every 56 days, i.e. six times a year.
On average, 14% of applicants do not accept blood because they have been infected with AIDS or malaria, and those who have been in a country where malaria is destroyed are not entitled to blood transfusion for one year.
“This makes 3 percent of us have enough reserves to meet the needs of hospitals.
It's very rare we're out of stock.
However, we need to increase the number of blood vessels to the extent that the old ones are getting older because they can't give blood after a while.
But it is very difficult for people to convince them to give blood, but it is harder for them to keep them and make them look like regular blood vessels.
In this rotting world today, man hardly has one hour to give blood to go, but Francine Décary is sorry.
Hema-Québec, an annual budget of USD 297 million, provides not only blood products, but also human tissues, such as bone transplants, heartworms, tissue and skin tissue, which are used for people almost seriously burned.
These tissues are analysed, converted and frozen, and then placed in the Hema-Quebec, which also treats one of the public stem cells of Quebec.
The hair can only be obtained as medical waste from gypsum disease, which enables the treatment of stem cells with severe diseases (e.g. leukemia).
“Some weeks ago, we celebrated our bank in the thousands of cologne mints and planned to take down more than a thousand new samples each year.
At the beginning of next year, we are likely to start offering these for organ transplants, ” explained Dr. Décary, who says that the Köldökszsinóvéneksztő-leasement program is now very popular.
“Many mothers are sad because they do not have the opportunity to do so, ” it is indeed true, since the Hema-Québec does not have the way in every hospital in Quebec to make this complex and costly program available.
Football - The Impact in advance
The Montreal Impact team beat Seattle Sounders to 3:1 last night on the USL-1 sign, and the combined 4:3 result got into the premier. This was a quarter-final second and final match for the results to be played in the Saputo stadium.
The final goal was to get Antonio Ribeiro in the middle of the match in 90 minutes.
While it was the first half-time without a goal, in the second time, the two midfields of the Montreal team, David Testo and Rocco Plancentino found it in the enemy's net.
Roger Levesque, the only one on the Sounders team, managed to play Matt Jordan's gate.
Let us remember that in the first match on Friday, Impact 2:1 was defeated from Starfire Complex in Tukwila, Seattle.
Impact's in the prelude with the Vancouver Whitecaps.
Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder team, which won out of Whitecaps by 3:1, won by 4:3, however, Whitecaps got into the prelude with a total result of 5:4.
Impact is expected to meet Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the matches are specified today.
In Diohhej - Kovalev's winning goal
The Canadians' favorite triage is waiting for the next season.
Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn led three great attacks, and finally, the Canadiens won the Florida Panthers against 3:2 in the Centre Bell last night.
Kostitsyn, the first one of the meeting stars got a golt. Plekanec has two, and Kovalev has closed the match with a golpass, which was the fourth victory from the six team's preparations.
The match was decided by Kovalev, who took out the only goal of the shooting.
“I’m not ready yet, ” warns the Russian player.
\"There's another game to feel really good about myself...
“ He tried to get a lot out of himself in the first third, ” noted Guy Carbonneau.
“ But I think the outcome of the game was happy.
He was given a huge innovation.
Charest's northern aspirations
The Prime Minister will not rule out that the election will begin this year.
Hardly the meeting of the Liberal Party ended, Jean Charest was already on his way to Jean-Talon of Québeci, where the new Minister for Health, Yves Bolduc (left-hand) is going to win in the interim election to be held today.
“Reducing our last great Northern border, ” says Jean Charest, who had set a long-term goal at the last meeting of the Quebereci Liberal Party in Légis, who also enriched the speech with visual elements, while the president was trying to focus on the point.
During his presentation, the pictures like the “Moulin à images” were placed behind his back.
The three giant recordings followed each other: barriers to water power plants, mining, Quebec on ‘Google Maps’, maps...
Such spectacular tools are used during election periods.
The Prime Minister, however, refused to guarantee at the press conference that the election would not start this fall, although he added that his time allocation would be very tight.
The ‘New Economic Area’ plan, the fourth pillar of the Prime Minister's future, includes a Labour Convention with France, an agreement between Canada and Europe and a number of agreements planned with Ontario.
Recently, the opening to the North (i.e. the northern region beginning at 49 degrees) was often presented in the Prime Minister's speeches, but it has never held a presentation on this subject.
However, the Prime Minister has only made it difficult to explain why he considered North as a treasure mine full of great opportunities, but he did not talk about the time factor, investment amounts, or a specific order of importance for future projects.
Only a few development opportunities have been highlighted: water plants, forestry and, in particular, mining, which will further boost the growth of the countries in which they are closed and the reconstruction of public infrastructure.
In the north we found – nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamond – Charest.
This area, which is “two times the size of France, ” is our territory, Quebec.
Not only in us, but in us, the Prime Minister repeated it, stressing that it intends to create a national founding myth.
He pointed out that Quebec's development was largely determined by its relationship with the North: the gold fever in Abibibi, the quebetic design work, the James Bay...
“ This is our future, ” he added, after considering the huge map behind his back, having held a stage break.
The northern part of Quebec’s 70 % area is also included in the Labrador section, which Quebec has always demanded, told the Prime Minister at the press conference.
“This is our historic resolution, which is confirmed by all the governments.
There is a border line on which there has been no agreement for a long time, and when it comes to it, I reconfirmed the same resolution on behalf of the government.
On the other hand, “in the light of climate change, we must reconsider our vision of the North, ” said the Prime Minister of the Northwest, talking about the passage that will open every year as a result of the collapse of the Arctic ice.
In the view of the Prime Minister, in this new geopolitical environment, it is important to take care of the area.
And what about the natives, Indians and Eskimos?
The Prime Minister has stated that the Government of Quebec has given them special attention and that the plan will bring many benefits, especially for young people.
The two ministers, Pierre Corbeil, and Michel Létourneau, who were former Hungarian ministers of Parti Québécois, have already begun to negotiate with about thirty local communities.
Benoît Pelletier has also started working as a ministerial committee in which Juliet Boulet (Ministry of Transport and Natural Resources) plays an important role.
The Prime Minister does not exclude the possibility of a large meeting, not necessarily a summit, where there is a “common vision”
North development would otherwise be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan, coordinated, integrated and environmentally friendly, promised the Prime Minister.
Jean Charest described this ‘water’ as in line with the ideas of former Liberal Prime Ministers.
\"As the former liberals, we think differently: our goal is to create new opportunities for growth and development from the challenges:
This was, by the way, one of the returning topics for the weekend that began with the great cocktail party, which celebrates the 50th anniversary of the election of Jean Lesage.
One of the decisions adopted suggests that the Beauharnois plant be crossed into the dam of Adélard-Goodbout.
“Our politicians, including the Godbout, the silent revolution and the national expansion of water plants, or the Bourassa, known as the father of the James Bay, knew how to rock the future, reported Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he also quoted another - true, conservative work, namely John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister of 1957 and 1963, “Roads to the North”.
With regard to the plan of the Eastmain1a-Ruper Water Force dam, President Charest emphasised that the deployment was planned for 2012.
“ This is between us, but I plan to be there, ” he said, “and he accepted his statement by a loud Tapsvihar.
The Prime Minister, who said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not in 2009, did not exclude the possibility of a vote this fall, which the law will also allow.
He stressed, however, that his calendar was already full, since he was carrying out tasks at the Chinese meeting of the Federal Council and at the Québec-New York Summit.
At the end of the week, the Liberal President has proved to be an excellent platform for the development of nationalist decisions, which have been approved almost without thought.
I would also like Quebec to appoint members of the Canadian Radio and Telecommunications Council, and these members have the right to veto decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition, on the other hand, had a skeptical acceptance of the main points of the North Plan.
The leader of Parti Québécois, Paulina Marois, has re-introduced the North Quebec development policy introduced by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to Marois, the Liberal Government in 2003 has rejected the application of this policy.
If they did not, “we would hold much earlier, ” said Marois, in agreement with Mrs Françoise Mercure, who was elected as a candidate for today’s Jean-Talon vote.
The ADQ opposition party supports the Government's acceptance of the North Plan.
“ However, we would like it to be a simple play of color, ” noted Sébastien Proulx, who replaced Mario Dumont, who returned from his freedom today.
Leaves - A Ended Country
Vic Toews, Minister of Harper’s Cabin (in particular, Minister of Justice) took the courage to call Louise Arbourt Canada’s ‘neighbourt’ last summer.
So shame a woman who has fought for the truth and deserves all of our wonders - that is very much telling about the people around the Prime Minister and about Stephen Harper himself.
This is our government, who did not transport its own citizen home from the Guantanam concentration camp, some of the Western countries concerned.
This is the government that absolutely does not consider the fact that Omar Khadr was still a teenager when he committed criminal offences.
This is the only government that, despite Canada's signing of the Geneva Convention, has refused his word and lets a child soldiers fly under inhuman circumstances.
The only government that's making a puppethouse out of justice is investigating a defendant's guilt.
Let us remember that UNICEF, Amnesty International and Canadian lawyers are also demanding the return of Omar Khadr to obtain a fair procedure in Canada.
And our government has an eye on the culture: it doesn't matter that a young adult has been completely destroyed, and that many years of torture is likely to end his fate for a lifetime.
Although we are not yet aware of this, we are currently under-democracy, but there is an under-represented destruction of our rights, freedom and democracy.
So the time has come when there is no more morals: they can easily beat, torture and imprison any Canadian citizen in accordance with the authority of a government leader, which was so far a minority (and what could come after October 14...?).
Many voters believe that salvation can be found at a party that boasts the virtues of the Force, the Law and the Order. They do not see that this government is on its feet covering the values that the good news and dignity of our country may have been due to.
Dear Toews, it's more of a shame - not a place to look for.
Opinion - Barrick Gold orwell
On 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, Deputy President-in-Office of the Canadian Barrick Gold Mine.
After Orwell's development, Garver states that the world's largest gold-producing company has launched a $6 million defamation action against three authors and a small-scale publisher for an initiative such as the \"public debate\".
Although the judges are independent and impartial, their decision, especially in chewing cases, is not based on truth, but on law.
It's not surprising Garver listened deeply to this fundamental difference.
For Barrick Gold, would it really be the best way to destroy anyone whose position is contrary to theirs?
In spite of the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada must spend considerable sums on defence and combat in an uneven fight where lawyers supported by almost inextricable sources of mining on the other side have a host of lawyers on the other side.
In such an uneven fight, however, the tactics are often used to destroy the defendant and the friendly agreement, which not only silences the opponents but also scares those who try to re-examine the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, he should have expressed his views before the public opinion.
Although in a number of other countries where Barrick Gold is active, this happens differently, the parties in Canada are generally not bottting each other, but saying their thoughts.
Therefore, the mine would have had enough to open its books and files and prepare for a real debate in a press, media, publications, paying for independent research teams that could have revealed the question.
But it seems that Barrick Gold doesn't trust the public opinion, and with a move, he misinterpreted the applications and letters written in the protection of the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Mr Garver could explain how he could initiate a debate, if at the same time he ignored the opinion of this public?
In his Deputy President's mind, this word is probably just about lawyers paid by the bus, not Canada's overall nationality: the meaning of the concept is therefore quite limited.
In a democratic state, the freedom of speech is also a condition for other people.
However, Barrick Gold doesn't understand it - or does not want to understand - that the authors and publishers of Noir Canada are largely supported by the public because he condemns the harsh course of the mine.
The public opinion is ready to listen to Barrick and to make a judgment, but on the basis of civilised arguments, rather than by a court of silence for many. (The ‘public debate’, by the way, also called in writing the authors of Noir Canada in order to refrain from using this expression.)
In addition to the surreal development of Garver, the Barrick Gold process is an open attack on the freedom of university research and the search for justice, which is the building blocks of all democratic societies.
In the whole of the procedure, he denies the right to quote authentic resources, to debate facts and interpretation, which form the basis for spiritual activities.
If a country like Canada can only study and discuss issues that do not like the rich companies of today, who will take courage to do so?
If Barrick Gold really wants an open and transparent debate, this could be done according to the scientific standards that the authors of Noir Canada apply.
You have the right to answer.
In our university, we have long been able to deal with disputes, differences and conflicts.
The imaginative procedure of Barrick Gold shows that, contrary to its claim, there is no interest in conducting an open debate.
This is a loss for both the world of universities and the institution of public debates in Canada. It is time for governments to finally introduce measures limiting the legal procedures for such abuse.
Wall Street rescue - The Democrats and Republicans have agreed
The presidents of the Bush government and Congress Republican and Democratic Democratic Republic finally agreed yesterday on the economic rescue, which since the Great Economic crisis in the 1930s has been the biggest set-up plan.
The $700 billion American dollar plan, designed to contain the financial crisis on Wall Street for months, needs to be approved by the two houses of Congress.
The main points of the plan are: more effective monitoring of implementation by Members; new mechanisms for the recovery of planned public funds; new provisions to keep the number of houses booked for failure to pay; access rights to the payment of managers of the companies receiving assistance.
Henry Paulson, U.S. Secretary of Finance, Nancy Pelosi, President of the American Parliament and Judd Gregg, member of the Republican yesterday, announced the good news a few minutes before midnight after the two-day marathon trial ended.
“We have made a great deal of progress towards a solution that will work effectively on the markets,” reported Henry Paulson, a representative of the Bush Government.
“We have done everything in our power to save the real economy and the American citizens from the current crisis in Wall Street,” explained the Democrat representative.
“ The most important aspect is that if we do not do this, then it will be a huge shock, chaos and confusion in the everyday lives of the Americans, ” said Judd Gregg Republican.
The trial has been speeded up in the last few hours fearing that another failure would have a detrimental effect on the mood of investors.
The stock exchange has given themselves a deadline for the agreement until the opening of the morning.
The two presidential candidates who joined the negotiations delayed their accession to the negotiations were willing to reach an agreement, however expressed, not happy that the situation had grown to the end.
Senator Barack Obama owns the extension of the agreement with elements such as the preservation of household ownership or the payment of the management of the companies supported by the State.
“When we ask taxpayers to take certain extraordinary steps because of the irresponsibleness of other people, it is not too pleasant.
On the other hand, these steps are necessary, ” noted an American television show.
And when he asked if he would vote against the proposed plan, he replied: “I would like to know the details, but I hope so.
“What I have read in great lines shows that it is something we all need to digest, and that we can move on.
The opportunity to do nothing is simply unacceptable, ” he said.
According to the 700 billion-dollar plan, the taxpayers' money would buy double claims from the American financial institutions, some of the unspoiled assets that are at risk.
The plan was preceded by a crisis that took place for 14 months, which triggered the pain of the real estate loan. This first led to the collapse of risky real estate loans (secondary mortgage loans) and then to other debt-to-loans (trade) securities transferred and ultimately caused the loss of liquidity resources and the accumulation of banks and financial institutions.
The first draft agreement was dropped by a group of Republican representatives last week.
It seems that we have managed to get out of this dead end since the Democrats agreed that certain \"toxic\" tools of companies in difficulty would rather be provided by the government rather than purchased.
In order to ensure that all members of Congress are satisfied, a provision has been included in the plan, which provides that if the government has to bear losses for five years in the framework of the programme, it may impose new taxes in order to recover its resources.
The first part of the new plan would be to pay a $ 250 billion instalment; this could be followed by an additional 100 billion if the President considered it necessary.
The remaining USD 350 billion will have to be approved by Congress by another vote.
In exchange for assistance, Washington will acquire shares in supported companies by which profits are distributed and can be sold after the crisis has failed.
The Federal Government will have the opportunity to delay the reservation of mortgage credit property covered by the plan, and it may also impose the maximum value of the remuneration and compensation to the managers of the companies affected by the crisis.
The authors of the plan would like the plan to be voted today by the House of Representatives and by the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite their efforts, however, it is still not certain that the plan is approved.
Yesterday, there were repeated statements against the plan, both among Republicans and Democrats.
“It is quite clear that Washington does not hear your voice, ” announced Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the house’s financial committee.
\"Yes, we have serious financial problems.
Yes, there are solutions.
But there is no one that would favour taxpayers:
Brad Sherman, a Democrat, who is the leader of a small assembly called \"Scheptic Group\", presents things differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“ Several hundred excellent economic specialists, including three Nobel Prize scientists, wrote to us to ask for Congress: do not hurry and look carefully at which path he chooses, ” said Sherman yesterday.
In Europe, it has again been understood at the same time that we are dealing with a global crisis.
After a crisis meeting, the three Benelux states announced that they State a part of the Fortis banking group in value of EUR 11.2 billion (16.3 billion US dollars).
The intervention of the Governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary after the French government announced that BNP Paris did not buy its competitors at the edge of the bankruptcy after the loss of EUR 2 million (EUR 2.9 billion) due to the crisis of secondary mortgage loans in the United States.
With Fortis's 85 thousand employees, one of the 20 largest European banks and ten largest insurance companies.
“This is not the money that was thrown out, ” said Dutch Minister of Finance of Wouter Bos yesterday.
“We have the right to vote and influence in the bank.
This is exactly what depositors and households appreciate now that the situation promises to be uncertain.
Meanwhile, on the other side of La Manche, the British government seems to be preparing to nationalise another bank, which has been hit by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the government would take over the total of the ongoing loans of the Bradford and Bringley Bank, of which the real estate loans amount to GBP 41 billion (US 75.5 billion).
The Spanish Bank of Santander announced yesterday that they would buy the British bank's subsidiaries and their clients.
After this Northern Rock, Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank that the British government wants to state since the start of the crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Congratulations to the actor's server
The eyes of beautiful aursies, some say, were the main bats, others thought it was the most important weakness.
Have you ever been released from Narcisic mirror by an American actor with a charm smile?
Yeah, I don't.
By its shame, sensitivity, and natural talent, he also stood away from him the rough style that is the spirit of the real great monstrums of the art world.
But what a huge career he's been running!
Paul Newman died at 83, lung cancer on Friday's control, and he was one of the last icons of American cinema flower age.
There was less monumental personality than Brando, who was like him, and who waited for a long time as a rival on the film screen. In his Serbia, he was more and undoubtedly more vulnerable, but he also declared freedom and the destruction of dramatic conventions.
The mix of blood is often caused by extraordinary children.
Newman was born in 1925 in Ohio as a German Jewish father and mother of Hungarian origin.
European roots contributed to the birth of a symbolic form of American dream.
He didn't think too much of himself, which only increased his merits.
He was a fan of the idea of a “self-made man” and the idea of a fighter who broke into the Pacific War. At the beginning of the 1950s he studied at the University of Yale and then at the Doctor's Studio in New York before he broke into the theater, television and much later on in the cinema world.
In 1979, in addition to being a professional driver of civil rights, he was seconded to the 24-hour race in Le Mans. He was also considered a sex symbol, even though he had been happily married to Joanne Woodward since 1958.
Now we can never know the shadows of the life of this mysterious, closed, active actor, who hated show business, who has always been a mystery.
He was an honest man, in the least sense of the word.
Paul Newman's death at the end of the week shocked the cinemaists: in his great roles, we can see only on the black screen of memories.
In front of us, the seventh American art, which was designed by continuous changes in cinema, is over 50 years ago.
We remember that “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ” is mixed with a busy cowboy (1969) and a young man in the sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) who was in the role of “Macska on the hot puppet roof ” in the Tenssee Williams processing in 1958.
In recent times, we can remember in the image of sensitive Mr. Bridge, who is faced with his old age by the fact that his marriage has not replaced his hopes.
Paul Newman also saw a lot of other faces in his movies.
In his film Robert Wise, Valaki, a life-long criminal boxer, Rocky Graziano, was born in 1956 by Newman's acting career, originally designed for James Dean and transferred after his death.
He also played a sympathetic criminal in the brilliant work of “The Great Balice, ” which won Oscar for the best film in 1973.
Robert Rossen’s genius film (1961) created a coercive billiard player and returned in a similar role in Martin Scorpese’s film entitled “The Color of Money. ” In 1987, he received a single Oscar award from nine candidates.
It's changing times, but it's always the same face: it was him.
It's always been like that.
The change in periods of his career was marked by a change of time.
The younger ones are primarily known for George Roy Hill’s cultural film, “Currents, ” (1977) where Reggie Dunlop, is not a training coach working with common methods.
On the other hand, Rajongoi, mentioned by Coen brothers, was seen in 1994.
The film Sam Mendes, entitled “The Way of Suffering, ” closed in 2003, the last time he appeared in the role of a Irish major.
Unlike a lot of movie legends who left the film screen relatively soon, Newman stayed in the reflector light for a long time, even though he was convicted of Hollywood along with its silence, light and image.
Bertrand Tavernier, French film director, considered not all humorless as “the living cáfolata of the underplay, ” said his game was too powerful.
However, the profession was not always kind to the handsome Paul Newmann, who had long fallen into the lap of the film.
Yet, he played a lot of young and successful characters: he was more capable of reinvigorating, with perfect credibility, the nerve disease, alcoholic, misguided or hopeless figures of society.
As a director, Newman showed a less well-known face: deep down in his soul, he is truly an eminent and sensitive man.
In 1968, he drew a fine portrait of a melancholy woman in the main role with his wife, the Canadian writer, Joanne Woodward, in the film ‘Rachel, Rachel’.
The film “Harry and son, ” made in 1984, reminds Scott of his son who died of drug overdose.
Yesterday, Newman’s numerous admirers remembered the actor. His close friend Robert Redford (who was with Robert Redford, the great bahé, and the “Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid” played together) said: “His existence made my life better and the world better.
The joy of being generous and being alive: this was the secret of this great actor's vibrating personality that we have just lost.
In addition to his legendary career, his comments on civil rights, the environment, the fight for independent film production and Hollywood's extremisms are clouded.
We've often seen his face smile on the packaging of sauces, words, biscuits and other foods.
However, revenue from such sales has always been transferred to the foundation established for children with disease.
Newman never sat on his beards. He's always committed to the trade.
In his letter to his five daughters, he wrote: “Your fathers always and constantly were imaginatively grateful for the star of happiness.
It was a privilege for me to be here, ”
It is also a privilege for us to follow through on the career of such a brilliant and generous American artist.
It was like a citizen, everything.
What were they doing in Zuschlag & Tsai's account factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the trial of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and his associates will begin.
The politicians and their partners are accused of continued and commercial fraud and other crimes, including document fraud, which is particularly serious.
According to the D.A., the funds received were used for their own purposes, and the performance of the tasks was often demonstrated by unrealised accounts.
In total, public and municipal funds, some 65 million forints, traveled to the Youth Left, partly into the pockets of some.
The method also described by the investigating authority was that the funds received were taken up on the basis of cost calculations which had not been carried out and that the associations had never complied with the undertaking.
According to the D.A., most of the accounts were fake.
These were obtained on the well-zed capital market, and the circulars were manufactured on Kiskunhalas.
Which companies would be called the account production, including on the Balaton region tour to which János Zuschlag sent István Lados.
According to his recent statement, he had to look at both our lives and our restaurants.
He requested an invoice of his consumption, which was then prepared for the applications of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the social and labour register and the municipalities of the capital.
In the majority of these, István Lados noted with his partner, the Watch Lord, who, according to our information, wrote most of the reports necessary to obtain the aid.
One of Lados’ studies was a beer house.
According to the two accounts issued by the Zuschlakes in 2003, the guesthouse provided food to the ninety-person group of Commissioner Pont.
However, so much, according to the CEO's claim, they would not have been able to access the guesthouse at the same time.
Similarly, for the Right Future - later together with the Third Year Foundation - the format and content of the account issued in the summer of 2002.
A badacsonomaji pension was only three rooms, and more than ten people couldn't sleep in it one night, but the account was about a hundred and thirty guests.
However, the fantasian print fillings were over-remarked even when they indicated Pigal Kft., which, according to the information provided to the prosecution, was not included in documents for the Right Future and the name of Hoppa.
The head of the company, the farmer Farkas, told the hvg.hu that when they called and showed him accounts, he knew it was about false documents.
“The stamp had the wrong name of our company and the tax number.
He added: beyond the formal reasons, it was not clear that hundreds of people were settled in the account, because they had a total of eleven rooms with no such facilities.
In addition, the account also talked about eating, while their restaurant was not working long ago.
The zealous account makers did not follow either the fact that the travel agency they looked at was organising only foreign roads, so that travel in Hungary was marked as a service on the cash payment account, which was also not compatible with the company’s accounting practice.
Moreover, as the investigation revealed, the VAT was included, where travel activities to countries outside the European Union were not VAT-free.
Among other things, there were four documents issued by Hotel Révfüllup Kft. for the Right Future, since the company’s services are not charged by the specified 25 % VAT, but by 15 % VAT, and the hotel employees only issued a machine invoice, while the invoice produced was manual.
In addition, the ‘producers’ invoice was broken down by the fact that for a company road freight was identified as a road transport activity by means of a case-by-case procedure, which was not carried out by the company based on the original investment advice.
Moreover, because of minor differences - insufficient account format, not real stamping - it was broken down that the accounts for the Third Year Foundation, the XXI-Saaaad Cultural Association and the Commissioner's Point were fake.
As in Ravenna Bt. or in the case of the White House, whose representatives denied that the accounts had been issued.
For example, the counterfeiters did not observe that the Hub Kft. had been eliminated at the time of the year (2001) when he had eaten for the Young City Association, which is why the company's insurance officer - knowing that he would have filed the paper.
They made me known.
The other group of account holders is composed of those who were aware that they had to issue a fictional account.
The Esély Budapest Foundation has issued an invoice for the Third Year Foundation, at the request of the Young Left - Young Socialists.
The head of Collab Kft., according to the prosecution, was one of the defendants, Györfi Ludovic, who took him to issue a fictional account.
He also worked with Zuschlagék, Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation, which in 2003 saw the Foundation for the Right Future, Atlas Association and the Red Sprinkler Association with accounts of five million HUF, which were not in the background of real economic activity.
No money movement, because the completed accounts were resorted after, but these organizations have already forgotten to present them in their documents.
The following group of companies issuing the invoice includes those linked to the defendants.
Thus, the supplier of the supply of fuel and motor vehicle trade, although not found there, was Kubatov Iván, the Ukrainian managing director of Delta Trió Kft...
The company also issued several accounts in October, November and December 2005 for the sale of computer equipment at around 18 million HUF.
According to the findings of the investigation, these accounts were purchased by Cash Investment Kft., a small Kuukushasis who has been liquidated since 14 September 2005.
This company was the manager of a Romanian man who, as well as Kubatov, would have forwarded the company documents between 2002 and 2005.
We understand that Cubatov, during the investigation, acknowledged that on behalf of the kft, he had issued an invoice to Atlas, Hoppa and the Co-operation for the Third Year Foundation, and that he took their countervalue.
On the request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian architects were founded on Fa-Bani Jos Fa Industrial Kft. and Jos-Invesment Bt.
In fact, none of the companies did work, which the defendant said was the reason they didn't get a job.
However, the company has benefited because, at the request of Saint Zsolt, the accused partner of setting up the company, he has issued invoices on behalf of the companies to the associations associated with Zuschlag: Atlas and Y-Generation.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trio, Fa-Bani Jos, If Investment and Linaxtrade gave a total of 15 accounts to the organisations Kubatov, worth HUF 14.2 million.
The D.A. considered that 10 percent of the amounts entered in the accounts and the VAT hit Cubatov's mark.
The man even used Si-Beri Bt. for the exhibition of fictional accounts, they were manufactured for the offer of Commissioner Pont.
The Y-Generation and the Association for Modern Hungary in January 2006 submitted a tender to the socialist party's public-profit organisation, the Dances Mihály Foundation (TMA).
They also won between 500 and 500 thousand forints, but the amounts were not for the purposes set out in the tender.
To prevent this from happening, five fictional accounts received from Works Team Kft. were submitted to TMA.
These accounts were otherwise found in the search of Árpád Kemecsei in his office at the educational register.
Some of the defendants in the trial, as you did at the D.A., are likely to report on the way in which the accounts were manufactured.
Interestingly, if you're the first-rate defendant, John Zuschlag decides that you're going to step up the veil on everything.
His testimony so far is not too detailed, and although he has promised to speak more widely, he has not done so yet.
The question is whether it is in this interest, and perhaps most of the damage, 50 million forints in the head of the socialists had a deal with it, and Zusi will take the fall.
By the way, who could have been offended by today, for his application to alleviate the circumstances of his detention, i.e. his arrests, were constantly found in deaf ears.
While perpetrators of far greater damage and non-exhaustive economic crimes can walk freely or at least wait in their own homes for the end of the current procedure against them, they do not have the opportunity to do so.
Psychology of overriding: Why do we issue more money?
In auctions, buyers tend to give more money, overestimate the goods.
This well - known and seemingly irrational behavior has been discovered by the neurological-economical foundations of the New York University.
According to a study published in Science, people do not want to fall under a type of competition, such as eBay auction, so they pay too high a price.
The research tried to explore the e-play of the nervous system with the help of experimental auctions.
One of the volunteers was lotteryd, the other group played a auction, while the functional magnetic resonance (fMRI) method was examined into the active brain areas of the pilots.
In both games, the participants could win money, but during the auction game - in which the overplication of the other party - the complex under the striatum, under the brain charge, was intensively operational when the game was lost.
This area of the brain plays a role in the mechanism of the nervous system’s awarding mechanism.
Therefore, according to researchers, the build-up of the price can be explained by avoiding a severe reaction of striatum.
In support of their theory, the members of the research group continued to carry out a financial follow-up study.
In this three groups have lactated against a partner in different circumstances.
The control group was simply informed of the real value of the product in question, and they made their bets.
In addition, another group has been promised that if you get out of the game, I will get another $115.
On the other hand, the third group received just 15 dollars before auction, but the members of the group lost this money in case of losing auction.
The difference between the two groups was, therefore, that for one of them, the loss was highlighted for the other.
However, as evidenced by the hypothesis of neurologists, the members of the team of players were willing to hold higher stakes than the control group and the open force group.
“These results cannot be derived from the theory of any previously existing economy.
That is because only the joy of winning and avoiding risk explained the phenomena of auction.
Only the neurological imaging methods helped resolve the contradiction between these two theories, so that we have just reached a third explanation, ” explained Andrew Schoter, professor of the economic transformation of New York University.
Hepatitis: when should we see a doctor?
About half a billion people in the world suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary, chronic liver disease is mentioned among the leading causes of death.
The number of domestic hepatitis infected patients can be increased to 100, but only seven thousand are treated, for which reason: patients often do not know that they are infected.
The designation of hepatitis is a combination of infectious livers caused by various viruses.
In their symptoms, there is a lot of similarity, typical of inflammation of the liver and yellowness, but their pathogens and caused diseases differ from one another.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E via the food channel (e.g. infected with food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and body fluids (swelling, vaginal discharge, swallowing).
Travelers are certainly worth protecting against A and B virus, with no vaccine against C.
The symptoms of hepatitis occur two to three weeks after eating the infected food, generally with a bad feeling, weakness, abdominal pain, nausea.
After this, yellowness on the skin and on the whites of the eyes, the faeces becomes clear, the urine becomes dark, the healing may take two to three weeks.
A million people worldwide die in the most severe type of disease, liver cancer and liver sugar caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason for this is that it is estimated that only every tenth of the infected patients will receive medication.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: if you are not treated, liver fat may lead to liver cancer.
Most infected people don't even know about their disease because the pathogen destroys the liver's cells under control, and in many cases only 20-30 years later the first symptoms occur.
Thus, it is very important to prevent early, carry out regular screening tests.
In three groups, there is much more than this type of disease than the average: people who have had blood transfusions before 1991, drug users and tattoos.
At present, 200 million people infected with chronic hepatitis C virus can be found in the world.
Since the disease can already be detected by a routine laboratory test, it is worth turning to the doctor when you experience any symptoms of unknown origin.
In time, recognising the disease can be cured, the virus can be removed from the body, thereby eliminating infection and preventing cancer from developing.
September 30, the World Day of Hepatitis, held in 2004 for the first time throughout the world by organisations representing patients.
It aims to draw attention to the importance of chronic hepatitis caused by viruses, the causes of developing and early recognition of the disease.
Does anyone who believes in God hurt less?
According to a recent research, religious faith works as a kind of pain-restriction, which may have made it easier for the deaths of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists of the University of Oxford carried out an interesting experiment, examining how godlyism affects people's perception of pain, announced the British Telegraph.
In the context of the rather bizarr investigation, 12 Catholic believers and the same atheists were treated as electros while all of them were studying a painting representing the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude much of the pain.
Thanks to human brain decomposing techniques, it was also found that Catholics were able to activate the part of their brain that was responsible for controlling pain.
The first study is in a series of studies where scientists, philosophers and theologians, along with the academics, are also involved in different parts of the university.
The test was carried out exactly as a rocking device was attached to the left hand of the test subject, which provided the electroshock.
The researchers asked the participants in the experiment to look closely at two paintings, the image of the Szssoferrato, which was painted in the 17th century, and Leonardo da Vinci, with the Lady Hermelin, who was painted in the 15th century.
The researchers of the study hoped that the sight of Virgin Mary would create a religious state among the believers, while the image of da Vinci was chosen because it was not too different from the other and was considered to be restful.
The experimental subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner machine, during this time they received 20 electroshocks in four consecutive parts, while watching either religious or general images.
Catholics reported that during the sight of the Virgin Mary, they felt “safe, ” as they were“ concerned, ” and“ calmed down, filled them with peace. ”
While watching the religious picture, 12 percent less pain was reported than when Leonardo was created.
Miguel Farias, who himself participated in the study, believes that a similar effect can be achieved with any strong image, even with atheists, should be found only in the appropriate photo.
“ We should find a picture of whom they feel very positive like a mother or a father, ” said the psychologist.
Tom Wright's English bishop welcomed the results of the research.
“The exercise of faith should and in many cases change our personality, ” added Wright.
After the excellent results, is it just a question that if Leonardo or a similar caliber painter display the image of a Madonna to the believers, how would it affect their pain control?
Would the sight of the quality virgin Mary mean even better results?
You're what you share.
On his tenth birthday, you can tell Google: you can at least as much as you can find in people's pockets as above their heads in the sky; you know where they have vacations and what they care about.
And that's still not enough Eric Schmidt, one of the main people of the company.
However, as regards the skeptics that draw parallel from orwell, they do not see the essence of web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently declared to the Financial Times that Google’s main purpose was to collect more personal data on their users, and this is necessary to keep themselves in the original aim of Google founders, which said: “Let’s get all the information from the world into the system. ”
According to the said Google Manager, after ten years of world-wide work, the company is only at the beginning of the process of handling all the information.
The question of what will be in five years' time, Schmidt replied: he would like Google to answer questions such as ‘ what I should do tomorrow’ or ‘ what work would really fit me, ’ but until then, the software cannot answer such simple questions as these, because they cannot satisfy users.
Not all internet users are aware that search warrants are correctly recorded on the Internet and the IP address they have been asked for and the visitors have left after the search.
For example, through the Personalized Search launched two years ago, users can store their own surfing backgrounds, see what they were looking for, what they were looking for, and by doing so, they will generate much more personalised hits in the long term - based on the same logic Recommendations, which will provide us with products and services based on our previously stated and confirmed preferences.
What if they use my data against me if they see what I do? - they ask users who are concerned about Google's data monopoly.
In most cases, the degree of potential power represented by the company may be scary, not the guilt, fear of punishment, the freedom of the public, or the rebellion against power in the Internet, triggers countermeasures.
However, it is confirmed that all the terms sought are not only recorded but, where appropriate, they may be handed over to a third party, in such legal cases, there is no protection of the personal rights of Internet users.
This was the most intense example of recent times, perhaps the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google transferred information about pedophiles on the Community side of the Orkut, maintained by it, to the Brazilian Government.
In May, however, Internet users who were concerned about personal rights could not be called up when the company successfully proved its right in court with the EFF's electronic law enforcement organisation against the FBI: in these circumstances Google cannot be forced by the majority of the Constitution to provide classified information requested by the FBI.
(The Federal Government has successfully fought around 500,000 websites and thousands of search words, which have been referred to the strengthening of the child protection law that has been adopted in the past years, but has not managed to obtain the search lists of individual users and to obtain a full website and keyword list for two months.)
Therefore, Google's judgment is very controversial: buyers of those who are holding their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and their private lives are arduous by starting to use Google's services and rebel against the rebelling multi-circuits in a conservative imij.
Meanwhile, U.S. genetic culture and its enthusiastic computer fans, activists, user-consuming predators can see the next generation of big companies, the \"strategic corporations\", unlike rivals, Windows has been used as a global conqueror, although both fight for the same purpose.
This may happen because Google does not request user identification code in a way that is different from Microsoft, does not ask for money for applications, open, free, constantly updated source code and software package to be much more accessible, younger, and cooler with official software history.
However, it may also occur that the genes are able to accurately see the problem of personality rights and the Internet, which is just one of the most frequently spoken keywords in recent years, the web 2.0 drew.
The web 2.0 is not about co-laboration, it is intended to leave traces of us and use the communication channels that are available to us, and while these levels vary individually, the point is the same: we show ourselves.
An average young person can also lead a profile from Facebook to Xang, and they can also be linked to other services such as Twitter, or a child listed in his musical habits.fm, and they can all be linked to tracking systems such as FriendFed or Blip.fm, which are stored automatically on Flickr or Picasa.
While we can read a number of exemplary cases that reveal: the girlfriend finds out easily when she sees the morning photo of the common friendly circle, that she has spent the evening with her cheating friend or she can fire a company's employee only because she describes her honest opinion on top of the blog: a certain concept of private life has been completely overrated for now.
Those who live an online life consist of what they show of themselves, which is the basis behind the behavior of young people today.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least wants to avoid Google's monopoly, it can do it (for example, starting with a Google search system, but not deliberately leaving a trace with Scroogle).
For example, the number of people who are not registered to Community sites with plans to prevent them from being included can be replaced by alternative versions from the editor to the image manager and news reader, which are not linked to giant server parks and which do not create the best profile we have before.
Public opinion does not expect so much secret when Google shows the whiteness of his teeth.
The company's current worth of $156 billion is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel (124 billion) or Coca-Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising sites threaten the revenues of advertising agencies, and services introduced at an increasing rate cause serious headaches not only to Microsoft but also to a number of other software developers.
However, critical observers also find the counterpoints for the restorative: for example, the senior management has completely rejected the opposition of employees, after raising the fees for the company’s guardianship, the company’s management has found it too costly for the employees to eat more often on a daily basis, but it is all broken down by the fact that Google has even kept its head before the Chinese government in 2006 and according to their agreement, the company is filtering every invention that violates good taste and the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal rules of the company sounds like a new service is not being announced in advance, only when it is already in use, but it is certain that the problems of the coming months and years can move the world at a new point: while some believe that Google's book and magazine project has taken on board such dimensions that the company will soon face the United States Supreme Court, others from the Health system, because we can build a complete health profile on our previous findings, doctors and problems.
And the fact that Google is building a genetic database can also provide a good basis for the next generation of sci-fi writers, the novel of popular Cory Doctorow, the Scroogled point orwelli sounds to describe the future in which a man can only approach the Google data very well.
Two young men helped the Asian double killer in the assault.
Two young people were interviewed by the police in the case of the ozdi double murder, and they were considered to be assisted in the murder of the crime - said the speaker of the Mayor of Borsod County on Tuesday.
Young people admitted to the action on the ground, currently being accused of crime.
The two young people, according to their MTI information, are protected free of charge.
Crime can be punished by imprisonment for up to 5 years.
The suspect of the OZD double murder, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in advance arrest on Sunday.
Pre-planned, profit-making, crime-in-the-life murder is suspected of being committed to several people.
The investigation revealed that 23-year-old young men were more than 53-year-old men.
The suspect didn't want to settle his debt, so last week, his creditor was cheating on a place in Ozdi where he ended up with him and his nine-year-old daughter.
According to MTI's information, the young man was prepared to commit the crime, and it is also a sign that he committed the murder with a gun that was stuck on the scene.
The police are investigating the circumstances of the weapon and its use through expert expertise.
The stock exchange in Warsaw made an offer to buy the stock exchange in Prague
Two hundred million euros - about five billion Czech kronors - was offered by the Varso value exchange to buy a 100 percent stock exchange in Prague.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles in spite of the fact that the stock exchange in Warsaw was previously excluded from the potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for this is that the stock exchange in Warsaw is in state hands.
99 percent of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60 percent of the papers during a few months.
E15 Czech economic journals are new to know that Polish offers represent the highest amount offered so far by interested parties for the stock exchange in Prague.
According to Czech pages, the Vienna exchange, the Nasdaq transatlantic stock exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the London stock exchange and Deutsche Börse submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, chief of the value exchange in Prague last week, said that among the interested parties, Varsó would be the worst new owner, and it did not rule out that this could lead to the end of the value exchange in Prague in the future.
The value of the value exchange in Prague is estimated to be 5 to 10 billion crowns of market experts.
According to the shareholders' agreement, about 90 percent of the papers would be sold.
The biggest owner of the value exchange in Prague is Patria Finance’s investment bank with around 25 percent stakes, followed by Ceska Sporitelna Bank 14.7 and Tiger Holding Four S.r.l. at 13.5%.
From a European perspective of the financial crisis
European newspapers, which led to their growing international financial crisis in Tuesday, are already “the 11th of September”.
The global financial disaster is due to the President of the United States - accused of the Roman La Republica - the president was not even able to list his own party behind the bill that was set up in the wound, which aims to remedy the desperate situation...
Instead of another Pearl Harbor, mentioned by Warren Buffett's billionaire investor, it is more appropriate to talk about the second September 11th.
Some of the Madrid press sees a crime in Washington.
According to El Mundo, the lack of political leadership there has brought the world economy to the edge of the collapse.
The risk of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing, and then the whole world will suffer.
Bush's plan was not perfect, however, following the Congress vote, the threat is that Washington does not offer a political instrument for dealing with the crisis.
The world economy is hanging in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations of the history of capitalism are taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored - shows the Geneva Tages-Anzeiger.
Some states today can still give rescue belts to the baffling financial institutions, and they can save them from bankruptcy with taxpayers' money.
However, if more banks collapse like dominos, then neither the funds nor any further adjustments will be sufficient.
In the long term, it is necessary that the Member States of the European Union go beyond national self-esteem and centralise control over the shared financial markets.
Only on Monday, more than €100 billion were received by vulnerable financial institutions - reminds the Vienna Der Standard that they are increasingly realistic about the concerns that European taxpayers, like the Americans, have to go deep into their pockets in order to remedy the crisis.
The EU has so far not been seriously concerned with the crisis, which, as a tsunami, is going through the old continent.
“Maviours ” do not need to have a hundred billion euros soon, but it would be good to record: in which case it is reasonable to reach taxpayers’ money in order to prevent greater damage.
The dongo flight is modelled by an intelligent car
What would be the best way to develop the technologies that are capable of avoiding conflict if it were not to imitate obstacles in the world of nature?
Like bees.
In the surprise project on CEATEC in Japan, the doping bees gave the strategic thought to Nissan engineers to build the next generation of impact prevention systems.
In cooperation with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built the BR23C biodegradable robotic control system, a robotized miniacom that was transferred to bees with its properties, with the ultimate aim of helping to develop a system that eliminates all the collisions.
During the flight, all bees develop their own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety shield - explained at the exhibition Kazuhhiro Doi, CEO of the technology PR and research brand.
Its role is important for the complex eyes of the uterus, which can be seen in more than 300 degrees of sight in every direction.
To copy the function of the complex eye, engineers touched the idea of laser remote.
This will identify the obstacles within a distance of 2 metres in front of BR23C, calculate their distance, and send a signal to the onboard micro processor, which will immediately transform into an operation to avoid impact.
During the fraction of the second, the barrier will be detected and the carbot will then change the direction immediately by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to avoid the impact.
In any way contrary to the current system, this avoidable masonry takes place in a completely stimulating way.
“If this were not the case, the car robot would not be able to respond quickly enough to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Head of the Mobility Laboratorium and the car robot project.
In an incentive and immediate response, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and internal layer of safety shields, a layer where the impact is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process should reflect what a bee does to avoid other bees.
This process must be in the blink of an eye.
However, unlike bees, the difference cannot be directed upwards, downwards or crosses, only can be two-dimensional and only in the direction of the turning of wheels.
In this way, instead of an infinite opportunity for bees to avoid the other bees, only driving motion and acceleration has been used as an option available to the car robot.
BR23C uses lithium polymer batteries that are easier and more energy density, which means that their life span is longer than the lithium-ion version.
Andoh says that an incentive intelligent reaction is important, not the ability to process data, to store even less.
This structure should only process and respond to a few incoming signals per second.
There is no need to preserve them and react with an intuitive logic based on previous manoeuvring data, so it uses only a few dozen kilometer memory.
There's no need for gigabámájt, or a large-scale memory.
This is the first step to develop the technology for immediate removal, which, according to Nissan's estimate, can be involved in serial production cars within ten years.
More applications may be used to combine the unit with the GPS satellite navigation system to drive the car to the specified end by avoiding the obstacles on the road.
He's got a name for the poison kid.
The written version of the $700 billion economic rescue package law for the purchase of poor loans for banks has been completed in several instalments.
They spend half the money in the first round.
According to the Eastern Coast time, during the further negotiations after midnight on Saturday night, Congress leaders have reached a décor in a total of $700 billion rescue packages, which has been announced in the Reuters for days.
We have made a serious progress - said Nancy Pelosi, President of the U.S. Parliamentary Democrats, who says that there is only one more time left to put the agreement on paper.
The compromise on the package was supported by both presidents, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Minister of Finance Henry Paulson said on the outcome of the compromise: the programme will work and it will be effective, but it is also necessary to do more. Pelosi says it is not about saving Wall Street, but about turning the economy's wheel.
The written version of the package was released before opening 8 on Sunday nights (i.e. Mondays in Central Europe) of the Asian markets, but did not give rise to a spectacular run on the stock market.
The House will vote for the first time on the draft economic emergency legislation for 2008 on the law Monday and will be in the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night, and the news about the settlement was welcomed in the White House.
We are satisfied with the progress achieved last night, and we appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilise our money markets and protect our economy - declared Tony Fratto, the spokesperson of the White House.
The programme would otherwise have been different from the original proposal for Bush administration, which would have told us that $700 billion would have been spent on buying low-quality debt securities.
It is now possible to spend up to half of the EUR 700 billion in the first round as soon as the Congress is expected to vote on this matter on Monday, and the Ministry of Finance is buying back securities with a bad rating of USD 100 billion, and it depends on the decision of the President.
The programme will be monitored by a separate body, including the President of the Federal Reserve.
The spending of the other half of 700 billion depends on the new decision taken by Congress.
Under the law, the Ministry of Finance may apply a combination of tactics: it may at the same time buy bad loans, mortgage bonds and mortgage bonds as well as other types of \"toxic\" loans.
The purchase may take place in the framework of auctions and directly by the authorities of the Ministry.
The legislation allows the companies concerned to participate in an insurance programme where the financial wallet guarantees the means of concern, for which companies will pay a premium corresponding to the expected damage.
Henry Paulson said that the law would provide the necessary tools to avoid the systemic risk of the collapse of a large financial institution, whether it is a wide-ranging purchase of the American financial system or a large financial institution.
We will take the necessary steps to be ready to introduce the law, as soon as they sign it, he added.
However, banks who are in trouble and waiting for state aid may expect their exit money to be restricted by the government, which is simply called gold umbrellas overseas.
The restriction of payments will only take place in certain cases, and the restrictions will depend on how the Ministry of Finance will assist.
In essence, the restriction means that when the Ministry buys the auction, an additional tax will be imposed on the gold umbrella unless it is retired for the distribution bank manager.
When buying the wrong loans directly, the government will be aggressively involved in ensuring that the management money is not over-excited.
It is part of the picture that existing gold umbrella contracts do not change, the restriction applies only to new ones to encourage participation in the programme.
This is the first case in American history, that there will be a legal restriction on remuneration for directors - commented on the measure by the chairman of the Parliament's Committee on Financial Services, the Democratic Party Barney Frank.
In addition, in the banks participating in the programme, the State will acquire the right to acquire shares, thus reducing the risk of taxpayers, as they can eventually win the transaction, as the economy and the saved bank are at its feet.
The bill states that in the next five years, the President should submit to Congress a proposal on how to get taxpayers the expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed doubts about the plan.
This is not what US citizens have asked for, that is, does not protect taxpayers' dollars, has been reported by a representative of Darrell Issa Republican in California.
A colleague of Ohio's Democrat, Mary Kaptur, said that the measures were the same as those responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.

Domestic sales prices in the manufacturing sector also increased slightly by 0.1 per cent compared to July.
The largest increase in prices occurred in August 2008 in the leather product, footwear production sector (2.8%), mainly due to the increase in the price of the bag and the production of sands 4,6 percent and to the 2.5 percent monthly increase in footwear production.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials resulted in significant monthly increases in the chemical production of the product at industry prices (1.6%).
The drop in prices was due to the treatment of petroleum (1.4%), the production of electrical machinery, equipment (0.9 %), and - to a minimum - of wood processing (0.1 %).
The prices of paper production, publishers, printing activities have not changed.
In the other manufacturing sectors, we measured an increase of 0.2 per cent to 0.9 per cent.
In August, prices increased by 0.3 per cent in the electricity, gas, steam and water sectors representing a significant weight in domestic sales of the industry, mainly as a result of the overlapping effect of the official gas price increase implemented from 1 July.
In the twelve monthly comparisons, in terms of domestic sales of manufacturing industries, prices in the oil processing sector increased to the greatest extent (32.4%).
Production of metal processing products in the sector was observed at 13.2 per cent in food, drink, tobacco production, 11 per cent price increases.
Price reductions occurred in the manufacturing of textiles, textiles (2.5 per cent) and electrical machinery (0.3 per cent) sectors.
In the other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price increases was between 0.6 per cent and 9.1 per cent.

Our home payment instrument has fallen by 1.7 per cent over a month compared to the euro, by 7.1 per cent compared to the dollar, compared to August 2007, by 7.5 per cent to the euro, with a 15.9 per cent increase compared to the dollar.
Don't you need a visa for the United States next year?
Kinga Göncz sees a good chance of entering into the U.S.-Hungarian visa waiver agreement on 12 January - the Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke about this in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarians.
In his opinion, \"Now everything depends only on time to build up an electronic entry or check system across the sea\"
At the same time, he called attention to the fact that there would be no entry permit in the new system, but tourists would have to register before they started.
The Hungarian head of diplomacy is now negotiating in Washington.
He will meet with Minister of Foreign Affairs of Condoleezza Rice, who will hand over the Republic of Hungary's Interest Order to the Csillaggal High Representative and to attend meetings with the Democratic Party of Barack Obama and the Foreign Policy advisors of John McCain Republican.
The bank rescue kit is next to Barack Obama and McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain, both the president of the two great American parties, provided the government's $700 billion bank rescue package on Sunday, but there are politicians who are calling for the Secretary of Finance's resignation.
Following the talks of the Congress and representatives of the Administration in Maraton in Sunday morning, they announced a principle agreement on the bank rescue package.
The financial package for the crisis on Wall Street and for the recovery of frozen credit markets has become the central issue of the presidential election campaign.
Obama and McCain also point out that they are more suitable for their competitors to take the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the latest surveys, due to the background of economic issues, Obama has once again benefited from some advantage, the advantage of McCain, which he obtained after the Republican Convention, with the candidate for Vice-President Sarah Palin.
Obama expressed his hope that the 700 billion package law would quickly be adopted by the Congress at a campaign meeting in Detroit.
He stressed that the proposal included consumer protection passports that he supported.
“Now we must act, with responsibility (...) your position, savings, entire industries, the stability of the entire economy is at risk,” said the 35 thousand mass.
He didn't mind calling McCain's economic ideas a long time ago.
McCain explained in an interview with ABC that “we all find it difficult to swallow (...) but nothing is simply a way to “
The Republican Senator stated that the proposal included the setting up of the Finance Minister Committee and the restriction of the discharge of the summit leaders, which he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain didn't have a real role to play in the negotiations, but he had a daily relationship with the minister.
Nancy Pelosi's President announced on Sunday that the House of Representatives would hopefully vote on the bill on Monday.
The German language field’s eye
The camp on the right has become more self-evident to the voters within the camp - so Der Spiegel analyzes the weak role of the CSU in Bajor country.
The Haiders are ready to govern Austria to prevent red-black coalition.
Der Spiegel (spiegel.de)
In his online release of the German newsman on the left, Franz Walter, the revolution in Bajormaa, analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of CSU.
According to a well-known polytologist, CSU's erosion started well before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took over his office.
Christian socialists have renewed Belarus for decades - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of age is the whole Christian democracy, so is Angela Merkel's problem.
The failure was not quite surprising for the CSU, but a process ended on Sunday, which was likely almost ten years ago: a state party's indisputable hegemony has ceased.
It's been ten years since the CSU landed 47.7 percent in 1998, for the first time since the fifties, under 50 percent.
This was repeated three years ago at the 2005 Bundestag elections, so that's what's been mentioned in the Stoiber era.
The reason for this is consistent modernisation carried out by the CSU in the province, which devours its parents.
Sociologists have been predicting this for 40 years, but they were wrong in the pace. However, there could not be any consequences for CSU's loyalty to secularization, educational results, the entry of East and North Germans into the developing regions of Belarus.
Modernisation is accompanied by an increase in opportunities, and the political consequences of this can be seen.
The camp on the right has no contact but within the camp, the voters have become more self-evident, critical, self-righteous.
It is also noticeable that in the last few weeks, the classic civil groups were most distant from the CSU; those with free employment, industry, graduates and higher education.
There's been a 40% reduction in CSU support.
Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Conservative Bécsi Journal, \"Who, with whom? The parties are concerned with the confusing domestic policy situation after the Austrian elections.
SPÖ intends to negotiate with ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits SPÖ's intervention in internal affairs.
BZÖ is open to negotiations in every direction, the Greens do not want to negotiate the coalition.
The election took place, now all around the coalition; in the debate on public service television, it was hardly allowed to be seen by the parties to their cards.
President Werner Faymann SPÖ confirmed that he wants to negotiate with ÖVP.
SPÖ wants to show that it is possible to cooperate between the two parties - in certain regions and in the social partnership.
The question is whether a coalition with Wilhelm Molterrel - the current President of the OPP, as well as an alternate, could imagine - Faymann left it open.
As you said, Schüssel-Molterer's course was set up at any rate.
Repeating this direction is not going to happen.
Molterer responded carefully to the red bids.
As you said, there will certainly not be effective cooperation if Faymann attempts to intervene in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
To mate the opposition, or to enter the coalition, the parties are fully open for the time being, the issues must be discussed within the CSD.
President Jörg Haider BZÖ has once again been opened in every direction.
“How we prevent red-black coalitions, we are ready to assume government responsibility,” said Haider.
Járóka: To break the vicious circle of poverty, segmentation
Today, in Paris, the European Summit on Gender Equality began this year, with France's host country, representing the Presidency of the European Union.
Járóka Lília, a well-established representative of the European People's Party, has pointed out the education segment in his message to be one of the main speakers in the professional consultation, because this is one of the most serious obstacles to violations and enforcement of Roma children.
The high-level conference - on behalf of the French Presidency - Mr Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs and Mr Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
Representatives of governments, the European social partners and the most significant representatives of European law enforcement and civil society organisations in the field of equal opportunities have been invited to the consultation.
According to the press release of the Fidesz EP representative group, the Roma, in addition to discrimination at work, are primarily short-schooled from the labour market.
“The vast majority of Roma young people do not have secondary education and, as a result of poor quality basic education, only an insignificant part of their higher education can get higher education, ”
He also stressed that education has a key role to play in the enforcement of other human rights as a fundamental human right.
Investment in early education for Roma children can mean strengthening the economy of the EU Member States.
According to the honourable Member, it is necessary to raise awareness of these links in the broadest range of Roma and not Roma.
As early as the Roma student begins school, there are opportunities to become productive members of the labour market; through taxes on income and consumption, they contribute to the national budget.
\"The Roma must, on the right of their European citizenship, ensure their right to quality education and ensure that their low-quality and isolated education is eliminated,\" Járóka Lília said.
According to the representative, the objective of the European Union and its action-oriented coordination is essential for the immediate acceleration of school degeneration processes and for this to be the correct implementation of existing and planned anti-discrimination strategies.
\"We must break the vicious circle of poverty, rape, unemployment, and give Roma children the opportunity to contribute as a full citizen to the future of Europe,\" Járóka said.
In the light of the European Year of Gender Equality for all, the European Gender Equality Summit, which has been held in Berlin since last year, aims at providing a unique forum to promote the objectives of equal opportunities and non-discrimination at European and national level.
CSU: grace for a transitional period
In the end of October, you will decide the fate of the cub of the Huber-Beckstein duo.
Despite the huge election fall, the head has yet to fall, and the personal issues have been reported at the Bajoran CSU summit.
Erwin Huber, and Günther Beckstein's head of government, remain in place, a question of how long the mercy takes.
At the last weekend of October, the fate of the 17 percent catatrophy will be decided by an extraordinary couple.
The members of the many anointed couple have been able to sense: they do not insist on their chairs with all their strengths.
By doing so, the group and the angry members of the base were trying to cool down, one day after “bajord tsunami ” they demanded personal congeners because of the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago - true, even with the leader of Edmund Stoiber at the top of his career - the Christian social union gained 60.7 percent, but now, after a year of the hit against Stoiber, he ran only 43.4 percent of their strength.
For 46 years, CSU was “one ruler, ” accounting for 18 percent of German GDP in Bajor.
The conservatives continue to count high on the Hungarian economy in a key southern region, and in the future they will certainly be forced to co-ordinate.
As one of the first signs of the settlement within the party, the Vice-President Horst Seehofer, who is the possible successor of Huber, and the Federal Minister for Agriculture, will also be present in the narrow investigation team that will begin to reshuffle with the free voters who are organising with the liberal FDP and with the right values on a possible government coalition in Munich.
It's strange to say that on the list of Free Answerers, Gabriele Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was used as a pair of buffers in Huber-Beckstein, and then was unsatisfied with the great local politician.
CSU leaders now turn all their energy into something to stabilise Beckstein.
The transition will have an active role to play in the background too, Stoiber, the former head of government and former CSU president's political career on 28 September.
In Huber's Monday, he'd made a number of dazzle remarks towards the CDU, and he thought that they would have earned much more support from the brother.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted defeat to warn CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the election of the Bundestag in September 2009, Merkel could not be a Chancellor if the CSU, which plays a significant role in national success in 2005, has somehow not been put on its feet.
According to Merkel, the frustration of the fiasco is difficult to imagine, the loss of the CSU's soil will not have a negative effect on the great coalition in Berlin.
Which, of course, is relative: the wounded CSU will not be easy to handle, and the social democracy crisis will continue.
SPD has achieved its weakest result since 1946 in Bajoria by 18.6 percent.
Locket: 110-0
No opposition representative entered the Belarus Parliament following the Sunday elections.
According to the Russian observers, this was explained by the illegitimateness and stability granted in the country of Aleksandr Lukashenko, the European Security and Cooperation Organisation (ESSC), however, by the illegality at the time of the vote.
The EPJ sent 450 observers from 43 countries did not recognise the elections.
Although the adoption of a hundred and tens of thousands of countries is without prejudice to the opposition for a decade, before yesterday's elections, the opposition, called the United Democratic Forces (ODS), was seriously hoping that, as a result of the amendment of the Constitution, the 2006 Presidency's mandate for a fourth time to renew his mandate in the Parliament, which was also discussed in its pure elections, would allow the appearance of some opposition representatives.
The ODOS thus stopped the pre-arranged ankle.
In the background of opposition expectations, Russia was to improve its relations with the EU, where Lukasenko and several high-ranking politicians were not allowed to enter, due to the policy situation of the anti-democracy.
The ESF pointed out that, when assessing the electoral campaign, it focused more on positive moves, not on the shortcomings, such as the ban on the third start of the opposition candidates.
However, the EBEZ's Monday's rapid report has already challenged the campaign - during which the opposition candidates could not have appeared essentially in the press - and in particular that the opposition could not have been present at the vote.
At the same time, the opposition believes that there is an understandable improvement in the political system: political prisoners were released, and Minsk is also willing to engage with Moscow for a smaller conflict, continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, which is falling from Georgia, although Russia - with which Belarus is forming a federal state on paper - is already a month of independence in the two areas.
- We have taken two steps forward, one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - said to our page, Mr Milinkevich.
According to the opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election, it is desirable that this be maintained, despite the fact that “the authority was afraid to let in even one opposition to the incessant Parliament.”
The opposition does not intend to oppose actions, seeing results, rather trying to send a message of need for economic reforms to the voters.
Of course, we have a lot of problems, and we have to print opposition papers in Russia, and the local authorities are making obstacles to the presentation, but I can see that more and more people are supporting change, including the elderly, said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that Lukashenko's regime, which considers the main result of social security, even the layer of officially supported pensioners, is not appropriate.
- The country's debt, the increase in its commercial deficit, was a matter of time before Milinkevich felt that it would bring about the collapse of social security.
Unlike the opposition politician, the Russian observers regarded the elections as democratic.
Sergey Lebegyev, who is the leader of the mission of an independent United States of America, told the Russian intelligence agency Ria Novosztyi: “No, people believe in words, but people believe in actions, ” so the lack of opposition is a proof of maturity of white elected people.
Brunetta: \"Reggeli only before working hours\"
In the history of Chigi Palace, single-door doors have been installed for exit and entry of workers.
From today on, this new measure will come into effect against those who block and then drink coffee at work.
The anti-clockwise novelty was presented today by the Minister of Administration Renato Brunetta and Mr Mauro Masi, Secretary General's Office.
\"Brunetta said, \"they serve better and more effective work, reduce gaps and increase services\"
‘The new, more responsible and transparent period is followed.
This is the real reform - stressed Brunetta.
Chigi Palota will complete all the buildings of the Council of Ministers.
According to Masi, it is also important to use a symbolic approach to the use of a rolling capacity.
The secretary-general said: “The workers have approved the action, everyone has cooperated.
One by one, breakfast is over at work, no more coffee and briskets.
Brunetta smiles: “A good little cappuccino in the morning at seven o’clock, capable of wonders, ”
At the Roman Public Administrative College
In a discussion, the minister stated: “In three months, 50 percent of the public health shortages were reduced, which means that over a year, over 600,000 people have worked more.
He added, however, that the Italian administration should be made more efficient.
, whose wage dynamics, according to the Minister, were twice the size of the private sector in the last 8 to 10 years, and were well above the inflation rate.
At the same time, thousands of people have been gathered together, joining the application supported by the Italian Organisation for Environment and Consumer Protection to protest against the provisions of the Brunetta Regulations.
“As the Minister of Administration is proud of the data supporting the reduction of disease deficiencies, the 'unsuspects' war continues to grow,\" says the Consumer Protection Association.
Italy has gathered thousands of honest and hard-working administrative staff to send out a force to the illegal requirements of the regulation.
The regional administrative court shall, inter alia, attack the abolition of additional food for reasons of service, the extension of the periods of stay for workers in sick leave at home, which means the period within which the patient visitor may appear and a number of other aspects included in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Occupational accidents: According to Napolitano, prevention is more important than anything else.
In Italy, 2.500 accidents at work occur every day, of which 3 deaths end, 27 end with persistent disability.
According to data from occupational accident insurance, close to 1.200 deaths occurred in the workplace in 2007.
The numbers bear witness to the seriousness of a phenomenon that is still one of the most common causes of death, and require almost twice as many victims as murder.
Today, Anmi organises 58th time in every province of Italy, the day of victims of occupational accidents on the second Sunday of October, to draw attention to this dramatic problem by institutions, social organisations and mass communication.
“The worrying data reported by Anmil and the tragic events of recent days also support the significant role of prevention in accidents at work,” announced Pietro Mercandelli, President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitano, in his message to the President of the National Association of Balesti Rokkantak.
The Head of State was genuinely aware of the “constant commitment of the community to the prevention of work, the protection of the interests of workers affected by the accident, the assistance of the family members of the victims and the capture of public opinion”
“The tragedy of this kind and the interest of the media and public opinion, and in reality we have to face dramatic, repeated and repeated cases of day and day again, ”
Napolitano publicly admits: “We are struggling with a lack of resources, financing education and information is crucial.
In particular, in-school initiatives aimed at providing direct information to young people who enter the world of work are of particular importance.
It is our duty to maintain interest in the phenomenon, not to allow attention to be paid to the social importance of the issue, as well as to more effective legislation that needs to be brought into force.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the House, stressed on his part that “the serious and social significance of the accidents at work that have occurred with the death of all of us, and the institutions will require that they stop this as soon as possible. ”
“The data on accidents at work show a slight improvement, but the number of deaths of this kind is still extremely high,” noted Pietro Mercandelli, President Anmi.
At the same time, we do not want this decreasing trend to be dilated, because the greatest tragedy in the fall of attention will be:
\"We believe that at general level we are still not doing everything we can to overcome the phenomenon, which could be solved through a complex action programme.
In our view, more rigorous supervision and control would be needed - he stressed that Mercandelli - and he stressed the need to intervene more closely in the field of labour education, starting with school education.
“An additional effort is needed to inform and capture public opinion.
What is most necessary, however, is a more responsible employer environment for a phenomenon that poses a social problem.
After that, Mercandelli assessed the gradual deterioration of the protection net for victims of accidents at work and the ‘aid direction towards which the system is drifting in recent years’.
“The aim is therefore to give workers back the security of their insurance, because the fate of those who suffer an accident cannot depend on the nature of the lawmakers, where they are self-determination measures,”
Hearing damage can be caused by MP3 players
It can cause hearing damage to a portable player’s hearing devices for longer and high volume, such as MP3 devices -
In its report published in Brussels, the European Commission, the Scientific Committee for New and New Identifyed Health Risks (SCENIHR) announced its opinion on today.
“ The expert opinion shows that 5-10 percent of people who have a permanent hearing loss for more than one hour a day for more than five years can listen to their portable music player with high volume, ” explains the explanation.
“ It is worrying that young people who use high-level portable music players and mobile phones in mass and practice are not aware that they can turn back on their hearings, ” said Meglena Kuneva.
\"Scientific surveys present an undisputed risk, which we urgently need to respond to,\" said the EU Commissioner.
The most important task is to inform consumers and disseminate information on this.
In the light of this opinion, we must also review existing control systems so that they can function properly and keep pace with the latest technologies.
Brussels called on the independent scientific committee to examine the problem in view of the spread of portable music players and the increase in the number of young people exposed to their noise.
\"The researchers confirm that we have cause for concern, and the European Commission, in cooperation with the Member States and stakeholders, is ready to examine the possible measures to protect children and young people from the noise generated by portable toys and similar instruments,\" said the Committee member.
The current European Safety Regulation sets maximum sound levels for portable music players in 100 dB, however, increasing concerns are accompanied by data on hearing damage resulting from excessive use of such sound sources.
At the same time, there are solutions such as reducing noise price levels and duration by which these hearing damage can be significantly reduced.
The EU Scientific Committee notes in its opinion that the maximum current value for noise in the workplace is higher than that for workers who listen to music with high sound (more than 89 decibels) for five hours a week.
If someone listens to music for a longer time in similar circumstances, there will be a risk of permanent hearing damage after five years.
This affects about 5-10 percent of the users who use the portable device, which could mean 2.5-10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno will set up the Committee responsible for the future of the capital
Today begins, until March, the results are expected in June.
This agenda was set up by the Capital Government on the functioning of the Committee called \"The future of the Central Town of Romania\", which was gathered this morning at its new headquarters behind the Catracella Baths.
In the next six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 Committee members will draw up Rome's guidelines.
After the end of March, the General Assembly and the municipal committee will evaluate the study and plans to submit in June the capital strategic plan officially approved by the Board of Governors and Gianni Alemanno.
\"This is a fully independent committee, in which all political, social and cultural ideas are represented - stressed by Alemanno - to develop proposals for the ideas of the development of Rome for which political decision-makers, the General Assembly and the Government Committee can rely.
There is no conflict of competence, only a platform where great plans for Roman good can be established.
In March, after his work, the committee will be divided because he has a mandate for a time.
In June, we are presenting a strategic plan based on the work of the Committee called \"The future of the Roman Capital\", the Prime Minister said.
For those who consider the Commission to be unnecessary, referring to the lack of binding force of the opinion it has put forward, Alemanno responds: “All of them depend on what work the Commission will do and what quality proposals it proposes to the table.
If the quality proves appropriate, as in France, in the case of the Attali Commission, which I am sure of in Rome, it will have an important role to play.
The strength of politics is often fragmented in daytime affairs and in the management of urgent cases occurring from time to time.
On the other hand, we are looking further ahead of the long-term and are planning a longer-term and committed to working towards the development and future of Rome.
The mayor of Rome wishes to state that “the Commission cannot be considered a ‘no waterhead’ because it is entirely free of charge, it is not going to go into any euro of the Roman citizens, and it is, on the other hand, intended to promote thought and to involve the best minds in the capital. ”
According to Alemanno, “the need for an open and flexible strategic framework that enables our city to jump the quality that he needs so much, thinking about his future in a united spirit,”
About the future in which the mayor of Rome stresses: “It will not only be limited to the current municipal framework but will be much further away, ” we see not only the future metropolis and capitalist status in it, but also the role that it can play as the capital city of Rome, Europe and the Mediterranean.
Obama, the first anti-American president, we'll show you why.
A well-known American politician, who claims to be independent, wrote: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first Jimmy Carter, who decided to ruin the American economy and had close relations (as a private person today) with my enemy Islamic.
As the election time approaches, attacks against Obama are becoming more frequent.
A Miami lady wrote on the Internet: “This man is full of ambitions.
Obama's unscrupulously believes that he can gain the highest dignity of a nation that has so far had two governors and five senators in black.
These attacks are not true; of course they are racist, but they do not answer the question of whether they will be a good president, and then there are public polls: they indicate that Obama will win, and that they will have a significant advantage.
Even in this case, he listens to his emotions and does not think.
In the middle of the South States, a massist magazine wrote this in its ledger: we know that in the voter, the real American country will give its vote to whom.
The side of American thinking is shown here, which remains hidden until the last moment.
\"Just talk about what you want, and we'll know where to put the shirt, Obama, or McCain.
Some swear: If Obama wins, they'll leave the United States.
There has never been such words until now, when the success of the black candidate is almost certain.
At the same time, despite all this reasoning, the Democrats' winning weapon is George Bush himself.
1,500 people were asked about the mistakes they made during Bush's term of office? 89 percent responded to Iraq.
America's changing.
This nation lost 50,000 soldiers in Vietnam, and it's been hit by flying to the country.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost their lives and Americans didn't have to pack them.
The majority still believe that Iraq was Bush's weak spot.
There's a huge task for George W.
The United States: Economic collapse is already felt by journalists, the time has come in the editors. Many are blaming the Internet because of the printing press.
The PEW Research Institute asked 500 American journalists about how they feel about the future situation and spiritual power of their profession.
Well, right now, almost every journalist's pessimism about his own future.
However, it was not stated clearly that their concerns would have been reduced in terms of authenticity.
They don't feel as isolated as they used to.
American journalists have a problem with money.
We believe that the crisis in 2008 is a failure of a powerful economic model.
There are further serious problems with the newsroom, i.e. restrictions on the editors of the newspaper.
If we do not want traditional journalism, in the sense that the great public has understood, to be a minimum, this problem must be resolved - the journalists asked.
Today, well-seen and complex pessimism characterises American journalism.
Sixty percent of journalists and senior leaders working in the press are convinced that national zurnalistics are on the wrong path.
At local level, 65 percent of journalists are in upper management position.
Printed against electronic press.
People working in the press have no difficulty in seeing where the world network is going.
The largest publishers are trying their way to the Internet, which many people believe is the “murder ” of the printed press.
The “economic pressure” of journalists has increased to 79 percent.
The 500 journalists who asked acknowledged that he would be able to take a train next to technology in the hope that it might be for the benefit of zurnalistics.
Today, in the U.S. press, there's a gap between the editors, the directors, and the scientists that work for them.
At national level, 56% of leaders are sure to share their information with others, while at local level this ratio can only be 23%.
Some of these are linked to a certain place of work.
At national level, 47% of leaders fear losing their jobs within three years.
For journalists, this ratio is 30 percent.
In America, the “safe work” issue is constantly on the agenda at the team level (for our editors.).
Only 13 percent of journalists have contracts.
In the case of a large nation such as the 300 million inhabitants of the United States, where thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and Internet service providers operate, employers generally recommend as much as they want, so the thing is, ‘kell or not,’ on the basis.
The directors usually get a high salary, and the editors can earn $100,000 a month in addition to the payment of the pension and health insurance fee.
Freedom, on the other hand, is quite complicated: in the first year, the day x is also in the third, until after a certain time it reaches the maximum of 15 days.
But American journalists, according to their own statement, often “be sick ” over the year.
Everything is a climate function.
UNIPOL: FINLAND: DANILO COPPOLA GROTTAFERRATABAN MARAD
Carmelo Rinaudo, President of the Second Criminal Court of Rome, refused to apply for Danilo Coppola, who would have wanted to travel from his residence from Grotaferrata to a Roman apartment.
An investigation is being conducted against Copopla in the context of an agreement on the exchange of shares in Unipol - BNL.
Last week, during the procedure against him, the house arrest was released and changed to a residence permit for Grotaferrata.
Lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, claimed that the real-estate man could travel from the rural small town to the capital.
However, according to the Court, these Influences (which the prosecutor has proposed to reject) would allow the company to influence and access the evidence it has brought against them.
The elite is in danger
The phenomenon was felt a few days ago when the House of Representatives did not vote for the $700 billion rescue package submitted by the White House: a significant part of the Americans was more interested and interested still in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
This is supported by the New York Times yesterday, which informs us that, due to the current crisis, a break occurred within the Republican Party, which shows an ever greater division between the traditional, restrained, federal institutions and business circles, the eastern coast approach and a new line of anti-C Washington and the financial world in the Central and South states.
This direction has been demonstrated in a critical way during the parliamentary vote referred to in the introduction.
However, the above event is just one of the major changes that the economic transformation that is still going on has to indicate or be seen, and not only in the United States but also in the whole Western world, and perhaps even beyond it.
It seems that the crisis, in the USA and Europe, has been speeding up those flattening phenomena that are already in this new atmosphere and are finally coming to light.
The first such phenomenon is the return of a double category of re-actualisation, State sovereignty to public knowledge, a kind of re-nationalisation of the economy.
The crisis affects banking institutions that also maintain close links with the rest of the world, but mainly, and quite widely, people and families who live in a single country.
This, on the other hand, is a direct political challenge for those on the government: what to respond to the difficulties and objections of those who are otherwise elected.
So the crisis seems to be global in the same economic sense, but in a political sense almost exclusively national.
It seems that political internationalism is essentially outside the coastline: this is an essential evidence of the European Union, which, while establishing a uniform political direction between different interests and national strategies.
So everyone expects intervention from each national government, rescue package, recovery and new rules, but most importantly, opening up funds: as only individual states have economic resources in a position, a financial set that can make things right.
They also have the means and the powers to use them: in these circumstances, they have two invaluable resources that are likely to have no other market and no international organisation will have such an extent.
In other words, the new emphasis placed by the crisis on the nation state is fully in line with the fact that economic growth in recent times is characterised by an increasing importance that is closely linked to this concept: this is territorialism.
Paradoxically, while we were convinced that we had already entered the network, the increasingly sophisticated technology into the world, and we were convinced that the global financial world was destined to dominate the world, we had to see that our future was increasingly dependent on things that were not the least lost, such as water, production and oil.
From things that can be delivered from one side of the planet to another, they can still fully be linked to a surrounding place.
So then whoever controls the area has a lot more bats than those born in a place where there is no crop, no oil and no water.
I would also turn to the second novel, a kind of fracture line.
Anyone who says that the area, the state, the government, is necessarily saying politics, in other words, driving.
From this point of view, the economic crisis seems to produce two mutually reinforcing phenomena:
On the one hand, an objective recognition of the need for credible leadership is needed for those who can handle the events.
On the other hand, the current leadership, in particular, leads to the loss of full credit for economic leaders, who proved to be completely inappropriate and have demonstrated that many areas still ahead.
The two together have even deeper importance and, in a sense, more worrying: the feeling of loss of credit, impatientness, incompetence and isolation, which affects the entire leading elite in more Western countries.
It seems, therefore, that the population is becoming more and more convinced that the time for social elite at the summit has passed. It has passed before they have done their own, their experience, their lifestyle, their culture, their word complex, they would have made themselves feel more and more of the opinion of the majority.
Together, the need for leadership, and in the recent times the public voice is revealed in sudden changes, such as the gain of conservatives to power in Austria and Bajor, the collapse of the working party unit in Britain, or the rebellion against Bush from American Congressmen (and perhaps the victory of the Italian right).
It seems that the traditional elite, parties, programmes, and even say that with its customs, press and representative intellectuals in college, you are increasingly less and less capable of representing what is going on in the deeper regions of Western society for some time. Furthermore, the economic crisis is growing, spreading and potentially able to create more and less and more massive initiatives.
Despite all this, “the impending rebellion of the masses, ” to speak frankly, would be excessive.
But it's nothing to do with an open eye.
We can go with a super powerful trigger on the wall.
With the help of a super powerful glue to defeat gravity and walk on the wall like Spiderman.
This was set up by several American research centres and by a group of four institutions close to the solution.
With only 2.5 square centimetre glues, researchers managed to attach a body of 100 pounds to a vertical wall and keep it there.
The American magazine PANULMÁNY - Science published the discovery of some of the researchers of the University of Dayton, Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and Air Force Research Laboratory.
The substance created by the research group has already been produced from the further development of specific, so-called carbon nanotube structures.
“We need to imagine the glued operating principle as a package of tube systems similar to spagetti, ” says Zhong Lin Wang, researcher of the Atlantic Georgia Institute of Technology.
The researchers have drawn the idea of the foot covered with gypsy microscopic cracks, which provides perfect slaughter to the animal.
The tests with various materials, such as glass, teflon and scaling paper, have confirmed that the new glued ten times more effective than the tops of those seals, at the same time, will be easily removed from the wall, explains Liming Dai, a researcher of the engineering arm of the dayton University.
- “This material can be useful as a temporary glue, ” adds Liming Dai.
We can go on the wall just like Spider-Man? Perhaps, but researchers think more of a less impressive use than connecting electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes lead well to heat and electric power.
More applications can be found in space research.
The superheroes can wait.
MUSIC KUTATÁS - the University of Berkeley in California is also experimenting with a new glue.
According to an article published in the American Chemical Society c., California scientists have introduced an adhesive made of hair-like microfibre material that goes through self-cleaning during the movement on the surface, so it always provides a perfect grip.
No fruit juice.
Care must be taken with grapefruit, orange and alma.
These high-vitamin drinking drinks, which are mostly popular during the summer, are used in combination with certain life-saving medicines, alter their absorption, as a matter of case-by-case confirmation or reduction of their effects.
David Bailey, professor of London University of Western Ontario, reported the risks of concomitant use of candid or fresh fruit juices and certain medicines. Professor at the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia: a glass of grapefruit, orange or apples can reduce the absorption of certain life-saving medicines, thereby preventing their beneficial effects and endangering the health of the patient.
Grapefruit juice has already been placed on the defendant's stand before, when it turns out that it is able to increase the effects of some antibiotics, antibiotics, anxiety, heart rhythm control and neurotics to toxic levels.
KOKÁZÁZOS MEDICINAL PRODUCTS - Two years ago, the Italian Medical Institute itself published the news in its official journal, and also warned doctors and patients to take the risks of these co-administrations seriously and to monitor what they drink when taking medicines such as Diazepam or Metadon.
NO CSAK GRAPEFRUIT - According to researchers, orange and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit the effectiveness of medicines.
A list of active substances that inhibit grapefruit and other fruit juices could be set up.
Michele Carruba, Professor of Medical Department of the State University of Milan, points out: “This kind of discovery is usually immediately addressed to various national and international pharmacies, who, if necessary, ensure that the data contained in the information provided by this medicine are changed.
That is why we should always read the information on the medicinal product that we intend to take, and if something is not understandable, let us not influence ourselves, but let us ask our doctor or pharmacist clearly – he stressed the specialist of Ansa Institute.
Paul Krugman received the economic Nobel Prize
The American Paul Krugman received an economic Nobel Prize, an analysis of the territorial relationship between commercial models and economic activity.
55-year-old neokeynesian Krugman, taught at Princeton University, and a well-known publicist of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the greatest judges in the economic and foreign policy measures of the Bush government.
After the terrorist attack in September 2001, when Enron went bankrupt, Krugman announced in the New York Times that the last event would have more decisive consequences than the collapse of twin towers in the history of the United States.
This forecast was not a little debate, but it was also put in the eyes of the farmer in a number of ways, but now we know it was accurate.
“I am surprised, and I am a little shocked that at the scandalous collapse of Enron or the Worldcom, the public interest has come out of hand, ” said Krugman at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, a member of the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a \"roppantly valuable farmer\", but also spreads his criticisms of the excessive liberalism of Bush government in a rather \"aggressive style\".
Open Office, third edition of the “Microsoft Anti-Pack”
Today, OpenOffice.org 3.0 is an open software package that increases personal productivity, which aims to increase the scope of the Microsoft Office's free alternative, both from home to office users, from free-of-chargers to public administration.
After almost a year's work by SUN Microsystem and voluntary developers, the new Open Office will come to the public with more novelities: outside the welcome screen and the re-thinking, less specific user interface, offers several important innovations. For example, Apple Mac OS X's compatibility with the operational system and supports the new ISO standard ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2 format.
Special attention was given to the Office’s compatibility with the 2007 system, so Open Office can open new extension Microsoft documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
It is interesting to have some other specific features of the module, such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations. This may be useful in sending files via email. Another feature supports importing PDF files into the graphics module by maintaining a website layout.
We can also create PDF documents on this surface, combining typical Adobe format with table manager or text editor elements.
Sharing within applications has also been developed through a number of improvements: the administrator supports the joint use of workbooks, but prevents cross-checking each other's work. Each employee's comments are marked with different colors, which help to identify more easily at the control stage.
Some companies are already working on the fact that OpenOffice’s few functions are also available on the Internet (on the cloud), so the final version may be presented in the weeks to come.
The Italian version, after you have been on the mirror pages since Friday, can be downloaded from the following address: http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0/download300.html
The software package is also available for Linux, other than the usual Windows and Mac OS operating systems.
On request, we can either take the installation CD at our home or at our workplace.
Freeness is likely to be the most attractive in terms of the distribution of home applications, but the Open Office program package is now trying to put it in the business sector, as there are many administrative and school projects.
There is no shortage of educational, advisory and service services that are ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which can open up new business prospects.
The Open Office consists of five basic modules: Writer, a text editor for Word; Calc, a table manager for the replacement of Excel; Impress, Powerpoint presentations; Dbasse is the most known user for Access; and finally Draw is a graphical module.
The 2008 goal is to get 5 million downloads. However, if we consider that the new version is already at 3.600,000, this figure will probably be higher than expected.
Kohl's results are positive, this is the fourth doping case.
At the last stage of Tour de France, another positive pattern was produced by one of the participants, Austrian Bernhard Kohl, which competed with the Gerolsteiner team, who won the best mountain trico in addition to my booking.
The news was on the Equipe Internet site.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth racer, the Italian Riccardo Ricccę and Leonardo Piepol, as well as the German Gerolsteiner racer Stefan Schumacher, who produced a positive result in Cera-test as the third generation of the EPO.
Kohl's blood sample, like the tests carried out in the last few weeks, has been studied by the laboratories in Lunanne-i andchateney-malabry.
If control tests confirm positive Cera results, Austria will lose third place and will be banned for two years according to the requirements.
The report on the positive outcome of Kohl's third-generation EPO was confirmed by Pierre Bordry, the Head of the French Anti-Doping Agency, and informed the Associated Press news agency: he indicated the positive doppinger results to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrians were able to stand behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, and win the best mountain-breathed trick.
REFERENCES: THE NEW YORK OF THE FREAT OF THE COURSE, IN THE GLOBAL?
In Italy, only recently changed from a country of immigrants to one of the liked target of immigrants who were attracted by the attraction.
This is why the “Belpaese” is becoming a racist nation? This is the New York Times, which, from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre of Burkina Faso, has been murdered in Milan last month, because he stole a box of biscuits, is a long article dedicated to the debate about racism in Italy.
The case is well characterised by what is called the paradox of New York Times: in the northern regions, “the strongest integration and the highest employment, at the same time “the support of immigration and Northern League, ” is also the strongest in the country.
In order to support the increasing tension between Italians and immigrants, the NYT also refers to cases in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
In fact.
The new laws required by the League, which would strengthen the lawn in relation to immigration and facilitate the deportation of illegal immigrants, have been set as an example of mood change in Italy.
This trend is also highlighted by the Pope and the President of the Republic: “Giorgio Napolitano XVI. Bened with the Quirinale Palace and noted that the state and the Church work together to overcome racism.
Students can get a room with expensive rental fees or up to €900
The market for accommodation granted to universities is not affected by the crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, a student can pay up to 900 euros for a single room in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples and 600 in Rome.
“The phenomenon has now become such an amazing measure, which, due to the total cost of the families, has closed the wide layers of students from learning opportunities,” explains Laura Mariani, head of the study office of Sunia. “In these cities, high demand for students has distorted the market to such extent that a general process of defamation against local residents has been introduced, ”
In most cases, real estate offers also contain a number of irregularities: non-registered, non-registered leased contracts, combined leases.
According to Sunia, it would be necessary to take an extraordinary measure which, through the review of the tax system, will provide an opportunity to maximize prices.
The survey details show that they also require €450 for a bed in Milan, Brianza; the price of the single room is €650 (Bande Nere) to €800 ( Lambiate, Udine and Fiera), but you can reach €900 (Vittoria).
In Florence, an average bedcase costs EUR 350/400, a room costs about 700.
In Bologna, where the students live in a small area near the university, a bedroom costs € 250/280 if double and € 370-500 when it comes to a single room.
In Rome, there are about 600 euros per person and 450 for a bed in a double room in close proximity to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna).
They are somehow cheaper (550 euros for a single room) in other universities (Ostiense and Cinecità).
In the suburbs you can save all: 300 euros is spent in a single room in a bed and 450 in a single room in Pranestina, Centocelle and similar districts.
In Naples, they want EUR 300/450 for a bed, from €400 to €600 for a room. The highest price is in the area of Polclinico, Vomero and Colli Amini.
In Bari, you have to pay EUR 250/350 for a bed and at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are at the same absolute value, but they represent a greater weight within the city's budget.
In cities such as Perugia, where students outside the EU often look for accommodation, there is another disorder: rental fee requested from foreign students is about 25-30 percent higher than for Italian tenants.
Good-bye, old Cinema Paradiso, old cinema halls have been sacrificed in the cities
Conventional movies are locked in for the Multiplexs.
“ A city where there are no movies, a blind city, like a face without eyes, ”
The images made by the director of Giuseppe Towere are presented efficiently, which is also in the Italian capitals, but also in rural areas.
The deportation of the cinema - the appearance of a large multi-term cinema in the suburbs and, as a result, the separation of one-rooms located in the city centres - is an inevitable and irreversible process, but at the same time wears all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
“ It’s like a friend who’s gone away, ” says the director of Cinema Paradiso, “the film that announced Oscar’s prize 20 years ago, and the grand prize of the Cannes festival, a story of lira in a small town cinema, after a movie that may have been lost forever.
The largest association of operators, the data reported by Anec, is clearly spoken: in the last five years, 316 traditional cinemas closed. The largest losses were recorded in the cinemas in the big cities: 10 cinemas closed in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 in Turin, and 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected are Emilia-Romagna, which has lost 82 single-room cinemas, then Tuscany (44) and Lombardia (41).
And that, for their disappearance, we are not more likely to prove that Italy's highest number of newly opened multi- terminals in this three regions: in the last five years, the number of rooms rose in Lombardia, 81 in Tuscany and equally in Emilia-Romegna.
“The number of units in Italy has increased irrationally, ” says Paolo Protti, President of Anec. “It is up to us to build new facilities, but the survival of the existing ones should also be ensured, because when a city movie is closed, not all roads are willing to go to multiplexes.
Not to mention the outstanding financial funds intended to support operators: the State’s outstanding debt is approximately EUR 10 million.
From an ethical and moral point of view, it is a shame that the government will not comply with the legislation in force.
An annual amount of €16-18 million would be needed to maintain the market.
This is the first Italian city, which, in its concern over closures, has decided to address the problem in order to protect and boost one-tier cinema in the suburbs and downtown, through an agreement between the municipality and Anec.
The provisions would include tax incentives for operators and benefits for the public to facilitate accessibility: viewers can park in restricted zones and in certain parks with preferential tariffs.
\"We are working on this initiative,\" says Giuseppe Turnatore, and I hope that other cities, even by introducing other measures, will follow the example of Bologna.
But it is also certain that traditional cinemas should be able to fight with the power of multiplexes, to improve the quality of sound and image, because today's audience is much more demanding.
The preservation of traditional cinema was always an important question for me: the closure of Supercinema in Bagheria - where I spent my childhood and youth - gave me the spark that finally made Cinema Paradiso, although I've been working on it for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome 25 years ago, so when I go to the closed Rialto or Quirinale to see the posters covered in dust, I'd rather turn my head.
Close links between politics and 'ndrangheta, arrested mayor of Gioia Tauro
“The mayor of Gioia Tauro supported the interests of the Piromodel clan in municipal decisions,”
There have been serious charges against the mayors and al-Police of the Anti-Calabriian Directorates General, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, as well as the mayors of Rosarno, Carlo Martelli, who were arrested this morning for external participation in criminal conspiracy.
Bilincs took the hand of Gioacchino Piromode, the leader of the clan and the public administration, and the lawyer nephew, who has already been convicted of participation in a mob-like crime cooperative, and has imposed a compensation of EUR 10 million.
“The lack of legal and moral rules of all works, which are more of a good taste, are written by state prosecutors, and the two local authorities have expressed their intention to pay the Piromodel lawyer an advisory fee.
“This would have been the official entrance of the clan to the city hall, which would have given additional opportunity to control and control public administration, which is already significant.
Agazio Loiero, President of the Calabrian Assembly, does not hide that there is a number of concerts between local institutions and organised sub-worlds in the region: there are areas where the spread of the mob is stronger than anywhere else where the competition will not be inevitable.
Many local politicians, however, resist the pressure of 'ndangheta,' they are the heroes who remain clean.
The arrests this morning are the continuations of July events, when the police announced they were able to finish the Piromodel clan.
At the end of April, local politicians were dismissed from their mandate for municipal administration. Gioia Tauro's municipal committee in 1991 has already been divided, even because of organised crime and the assumed congregation between local government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the religious democracy at the time of the distribution, took the lead of the right-hand coalition in the second round of 2006.
Botrányt cried when County House ordered the municipal committee to disband.
He referred to the court as Marco Minniit, then Minister of Home Affairs, and accused him of planning everything with a political purpose. However, the court explained in the arrest order signed this morning that the Piromodel had been excluded from requiring a change in the A3 project.
According to a hearing with Dal Torrion, the state prosecutors write: “It was necessary to meet the demands of a large group of entrepreneurs known to be close to the Piromodel family, to subsidize the decisions of the municipality to the clan’s interests.
The energy comes from the waves, and now the big ones come
An inexplicable energy source, representing 70 percent of the surface of the planet, which is only now discovered by large international energy companies
Hulls, sea currents, currents, and renewable energy sources, to which giants like Chevron, who are trying to get their hands on.
They've been searching for a hundred years to get energy from the sea's movements. In the '70s, during the first oil crisis, research has increased.
Around 1980, when oil prices were reduced, the idea of using marine energy was set aside, but today the need for environmental protection and the rise in oil prices will give the sector a new boost.
According to the London World Energy Council (WEC) 2007, 15 percent of the world's electricity demand could be covered by marine wave facilities.
This amount is twice what nuclear power plants are currently producing.
In addition, there would be currents and currents.
The giants are down.
Enersis was the first company to commit to marine energy and signed an agreement in 2005 on a power plant in North Portugal.
It seemed a revolutionary move when the signature was announced.
It has been two years since then, and more and more companies have been putting down vodka with marine energy, including those who have so far been committed to traditional energy.
“ Chevron studies technologies that exploit the energy of the oceans and considers the possibility of cooperation with us, ” announced the speaker of one of the American oil companies, Wall Street Journal.
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining the necessary authorisation for the launch of a project in Alaska for the exploitation of marine energy issued by the US Energy Committee.
It is not a matter of small importance, especially if we consider the USA to continue oil extraction in Alaska, and even President Bush has recently launched a plan for further drilling.
Besides Chevron, Verdant Power Inc, New York, and Ocean Power, New Jersey, are also the road to energy from the sea.
The technology needs to be developed.
According to experts, it is still a matter of initial technology, because the energy from the sea does not dispel doubts about the environmental impact.
The existing facilities, such as Portugal or Scotland, are both small and therefore do not cause too much problems with respect to ecosystem.
However, in order to be able to produce more energy, facilities that have a greater environmental impact are needed.
There are various options: Ocean Power uses, for example, a combined bonus system.
Waves and push-ups are transformed into hydraulic pressure by plungers and cylinders placed inside them.
Pressure's turning a turbine, and it's feeding a generator.
The electric current is on cables that draw below the sea to land.
There are also four similar types of facilities in the planning phase that are waiting for a federal permit. Some of the energy produced would be used in a military facility.
On the other hand, Verdant Power has already started to produce energy for a shopping mall and a parking lot using six sub-sea turbines located in the East River of New York.
At the time of the flood, the movement of the water will turn the turbines' laps, and this circulation will feed the generator.
Verdant said that he had a long list of partners waiting for authorisations only for energy use.
There's a current on the hoolls.
Currently, different attention needs to be paid to the potential of the flood.
Although it is a periodic phenomenon, the current is more predictable than the wind, the sun, or the waves, and it is therefore considered to be a more reliable source of energy.
New York, Maine and Alaska, as well as the other coastal states, spent $7.5 million in 2008, to extract the energy supplied by the flood, which is expected to increase to 35 million in 2009.
