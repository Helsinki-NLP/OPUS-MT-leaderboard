A gray stone building.
I found it in the attic.
Tom was waiting.
Look at you.
It's time to rest.
He explained the rule to me.
I'm resting.
This old building isn't worth taking care of, it's better to break it down.

That's enough.
I locked the door.
Death is one of two things, or destruction, and the dead is not aware of anything; or, as they say to us, a real change: the migration of the soul from this place to another.
Don't ferret me.
That was a silly question.
If you read the book, can you lend it to me?
If you're gonna stop saying I'm not nervous, I'm probably not that nervous.
That's only natural.
What are you doing?
I'll put my passport back in the vault.
Tom felt it was a waste of time to translate the letter to Mari.

Something's not right.
Don't be a bit of a mess.
I need a room close to the elevator.

Did you hear about yesterday's fire?
I know what I did.
I guess you've already packed up and ready to go.
It's hard to believe the time has been clean and sunny all this time.
For most people, it's very confusing to speak in public.
Kick me!
When did you work in Boston?
No one knew who did this.
What are you talking about?
How old are you?
We're going to the classroom.
Tom's busy.
There are people who can be easily influenced.
I don't understand why I shouldn't do that.
It's not a bad idea.
Which way are you going?

When were you the happiest?

Stop it, you fix it.
I'm shocked.
Will that affect me?
I always drink two cups of coffee in the morning.
I grabbed Tomi at the elbows.
I don't know where Tom's umbrella is.
That's the last straw.
I ran all the way to the station this morning.
That was great.
Maybe I'll eat it later when I'm very hungry.
Is there something between you two?
Don't ask why, just do it.
My dream is to be a teacher.
That's very nice of you.
What time did you have breakfast?
Smell this flower.

Can you forgive me?
Who's staying?
I want to learn French next year.
I'm awfully inconvenient with kids.
Tom's 13, but he still believes in Santa.
Why aren't you still sleeping?
I hope I see her again.

It worked wonderfully.
There's more houses behind the houses.

Is this dangerous?

He lives in another state.
I work to live, but I'm not living to work.
Be there exactly then.
He knows everything about cooking.

Can I make some suggestions?

I found a place to live.

Get me some snacks.
None of us are cowardly.

And what can you show me?

You should watch the cake.
It's such a tinglitan music.
I have to change.
This manga is quite popular in China.
I'm crazy.

May I introduce myself?
He had all his money.
How nice.
I need to talk to him.
It's cold.

I did it like I didn't understand it.
Good sense of humor helps in difficult situations.
You got it?
I'll see you later.
That'll be interesting.
They're gone?
I have black hair.
The day before yesterday was hot, but it was lighter today.
We need to warn Tom.
I'll see you next week sometime.
Stop it.

Please be a little more careful in the future.
That was so dirty, Sami.
He doesn't have many friends.
Are you at liberty here?
Who hit Tom?
Tom and Mary answered at the same time.
Have you ever played Petanque?
There are fashion socks.
I couldn't figure it out.
I can't follow your logic.
What do you want to do in the future?
Tom's safe.
We understand the purpose.
No one was there.
All my questions have been answered.
I knew you'd get in trouble.
Tomi has a guest.
I feel sharp chest pain.
I'm willing to risk it.
How can you say that?
I don't want to go to bed.
I don't believe a word of it.
It's my birthday in November.
Did you guys behave well today?
You're stupid!
I worked hard last month.
Tom slept on two assembled chairs.
Here, your beer.
Is that a problem for you?
Why did you buy this bike?
Who wrote this?
I got you!
I felt very lonely.
I'm going to see my friend.
Stop yelling!
Time will depend fast enough if you read something.

You're poor.
Push yourself.
I'm disappointed in you, Tom.
I can do it right away.
Where were you when I needed your help?
The coffee's ready.
You love me just because of my black hair?
I must have heard that voice somewhere.
The doctor suggested going to the hospital.
Breakfast.
I'm not paid well.
Why are you yelling?
My family isn't too big.
Please step forward.
There are more cars on the road in summer than in winter.
I hope they're okay.
Tomi had to know this was gonna happen.
Tomi's a little obsessive.
My sister loves Tom.
It's late.
The back face!
Tom's not cheating.
We have to pay the tax.
Tom looked down on the ground.
They're not responding.
Keep doing what you did.
Eat some.
We'll take care of it later.
I'm Israeli.
They've entered the forest.
How can you expect me to pay for this?
Tom asked Mary where John lived.
If it hadn't been for the map, I'd have lost it.
I think he's coming.
It's tomorrow's day.
You're left-handed, aren't you?
Can you tell me exactly what you really want?
My wife left me.
We don't want anything from you.
You know where the problem comes from.
What are you looking at?
It's unlikely Tom knows where Mari lives.
Three ice creams, please.
Tom's in the pajamas.
I've been waiting for you.
Tom's moo.
Nobody lives in this house.
As far as English is concerned, no one can settle.
Sponge for it.
You're not gonna die.
Tomit got fired?
My horse is white.
You got me.
We have to be serious.
The museum is open today?
Tom's not because he's standing at the edge of his heart.
The wifi doesn't work for me.
I'm gonna wash it again.
Do you learn English every day?
Good luck with the competitions.
That's not gonna be enough.
Looks like it.
I didn't sleep.
Tomi's request is at least twice mine.
No one can see my tears.
She was born in Mohammed Mecca.
Tom and Mary twins.
Mark the words you don't understand.
Who's the smartest person you know?
I want everything to be fine at this time tomorrow.
The hot summer days have ended and they have been replaced by cool winter days.
Why me?
I've never thought of that.
No one's seen.
I'm the boss, aren't I?
My son came to my room.
Tomi doesn't look happy to see us.
After Tomi's death, his wife got married shortly.
Tom's the ace of bees.
I didn't do what I should have done.
Do you have Tom's tattoo?

Did you find anything?
Keep this thing away from me.

It's possible to expand the dress.
It's almost ten times a day.
That's very white.
They left last night.
We've never played a concert in Boston.
Tom may not know why Mary's not here.
Don't worry.
Good-looking people look good, regardless of what they're wearing.
You look like Alma with a circle.
Tom's on the table now.
It's dangerous here.
I can't stand this noise.
It's so nice to meet you.
Tom doesn't trust anyone.
Tomi's rich, but Mari's not.
We should probably go.
I like coffee.
You know who Tom is?
I'm willing to buy it for you.
We understand.
It's gonna be a new day tomorrow.
Give us a presentation.
The world is a mess.
Tom's losing.
They're playing baseball after school.
They took the two of them.
You've done a perfect job.
It's stuck in the photo.
Tomi wants to buy some books.
Here's the sun.
What are they going to do?
Tom was driving the attack.
Tom almost never eats beans.
No, it's not my house.
I live in New York.
We're out of coffee.
We're having a beer!
What would you do if that was your child?
My kids don't lie to me.
I'm not proud of my daughter.
It never ends.
They're both laughing.
I wish you wouldn't do that right now.
I tried to help Tomi.
Your soul is ruined by hell.
I'm a fever and I'm a pain in my head, and I think I'm gonna be sick.
I'm getting in.
Take this off.
He won his love.
He left a class.
Can you give me that cup?
In my opinion, Twitter is a waste of time.
Come on, touch me.
Tom asked me the same thing Mary asked me.
The moon belongs to no one.
We were born to this world for a reason.
I helped Tomi decorate her Christmas tree.
I forgot to buy Eve flowers.
We didn't do it for Tomi.
He could have kissed me goodbye, but he didn't, he just walked away.
We're not that poor.
He's working for pay, not because he's enjoying it.
I know who's hurt.
I'm independent.
By tonight, the shadow of the tree reached the wall.
He's a good friend.
He's made a serious scientific discovery.
Tom's computer holds hundreds of gigapons of hermelin tapes in the secret folder.
Why are you so tired today?
My appetite's gone.
How many people do you think we should invite for the party?
Tomi doesn't have a lot of books.
I have doubts if it will work.
Let's go wash it up.
He's not there for sports like I am.
I have a phone.
Tom went back to the hotel.
Do you have a TV?
What do you want me to do with Tom?
I feel better every day.
I feel hot.
What do doctors say?
I forgot your last name.
Please help me.
He didn't say anything.
Why do you apologize?
Tom's afraid he's being beaten.
Did you know Tom left home?
He likes trains.
We're home today.
I saw Tom dance with another girl.
No one was in the room.
Tom dumped his girlfriend's photos in the fire.
I'm going to go tell everyone.
Step forward.
You're hypocrites.
It reminds me of a girl who I've ever known.
I was on the list.
Give me back my book.
Although we've done everything we can, we know we're not going to win.
It was close to suicide.
That was my finger.
My mother didn't say that.
Tom didn't know his water heater was holed up until he got a huge water bill.
This is our secret.
Why are you restless?
I'm sorry, but I didn't fully understand what you said.
It was a fire near us last night.
We better go, Tom.
Probably need a little sleep for all of you.
I'm pretty sure Tom won't eat that.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets in trouble again.
I'm on my way to the plane.
Are you home?
The mountains are surrounded by clouds.
That's my problem.
How can I understand you?
He's in the kitchen.
I should have done that with you.
Maybe I don't want to eat the same thing again today.
I assume Thomas was right.
Here's my membership card.
I'm the only one who got Thomas to help.
Tom's out there.
One of my bikes is an investment.
I don't often have lunch with Tam.
It's over, isn't it?
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I'll keep it warm.
That sentence has not yet been translated.
Tom's expecting too much.
She's very upset.
Man's not from the monkey, except for some.
We're fine.
Tom wants to learn to surf.
I'm having a hard day today.
Here's your bag.
It's an intelligent man who's discovered something that's more interesting than sex.
Tom wears a fun costume.
They both loved him, and they both loved him.
I can't stop by to laugh at it.
Try someone else.
Remember what you said.
Cut your hair.
He's just drinking bottled water.
Personally, I find it more enjoyable than conventional sex.
That's unbelievable.
After a short wait, he started to do stupid things.
I need volunteers.
Tom and I know the truth.
That's a crime.
Tom's gonna cook.
Do you have an e-mail address?
You're stuck, you're not ready.
Tomi knew where Mary put her car.
You should get some sleep.
Tom and Mary don't live in the same state.
Look!
Don't keep your bike in the barn.
Sometimes I go to a movie.
Thomas never lived in Boston.
Don't criticize me.
He was looking for something in the dark.
I'm not gonna throw Tom out.
Tom's got 20 bucks out of his pocket.
I didn't want to tell you that.
I'm not going to Boston.
Tom was supposed to go home early.
The prices are rising.
Clear your eye.
I didn't buy the car.
How much is the bus ticket?
You're not doing anything!
Is it hard to say French?
I see a house.
Just so you know, it's a really bad joke.
He's playing poker with us.
Did you like the show?
The food in the cheese is delicious.

Take us into town.
It's been three months.
Tom's got a grip on him.
Just that he started reading the book when someone knocked on the door.
I was on my way to work when the phone was ringing.
I feel uncomfortable.

Thank you for being me.
They've got everything they need.
He's always on my side.
Nobody likes a hangover.
He's comfortable.
It's all right, it's over.

I like things like this.
It's up to you to go there or not.
Why did you become a lawyer?
I made a choice.
You shouldn't wait long.
Tom seems to enjoy the party.
Why doesn't Tom want to come with us?
What a mess!
How annoying.
Tom put the boxes together next to the wall.
It's common knowledge that the bear likes honey.
We've been winning.
Don't bother getting up.
I'll see you soon.
Did you ask them to wait?
I'm asleep. I'm late for school.
Where's the phone book?
I'm fine.
Cats will be mice.
He parked his car on an empty tent.
This is his Christmas present.

What a wonderful place!
I wish we could do something for Tom.
I'll keep that in mind.
The house was big.
We're happy to accept your offer.
I went on foot.
It wasn't Tom.
How about we go out to dinner tonight?
Dreams have come true.
Don't lie to me.

I'm a marine.
There's a lot of giants growing up in Florida.
Tom's too young for him, isn't he?
Tommy, can you hear me?
I couldn't take the wedding ring off my finger.
It's just that I don't want to die today.
Tom's ready to come home.
It was like a father to me.
You're gonna regret it.
Help's on the way.
Do you speak French in Canada?
I wish I could do it.
Keep it up.
I hope you don't mind if I leave early.
Come on, like you are.
I expect you to join us.
You woke me up.
I'm looking for my phone.
He's got a hanger.
No one can stop me anymore.
Who did you see?

I need an interpreter.
You understand the language of women.
I think Tom's still unemployed.
Attention, please.
I'm ready to help you at any time.
We're gonna fix this.
The batteries are dead.
He found me a good seat.
Sooner or later, we'll all die.
You didn't sleep well last night, did you?
Are you fucking kidding me?
Tom applied for the job.
He couldn't hide Tomi's disappointment.
We tried to warn you.
I found their head very complicated, unlike the esperant, which is very simple.
You better watch out.
Tom likes kids.
It's washing today.
This is so wrong.
Tomi touched my hand.
Who brought this?
The floor is full of glass caps.
These bananas aren't mature.
Let's hide behind the curtain.
But I don't have any iron.
I think you were right.
Where did they keep the wedding?
I swim in the river.
It wasn't the first time they did this.
The water is cold.
It was a beautiful summer day.
Sometimes I feel stupid.
