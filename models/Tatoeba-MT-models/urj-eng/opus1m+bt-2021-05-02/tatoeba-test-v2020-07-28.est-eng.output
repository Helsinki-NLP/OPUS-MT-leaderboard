He almost drowned in the river.
Deadly!
Tom's not a very good driver.
It would have been better if you hadn't come today.
His proposal is not very important.
Czech, please.
No way!
He's wrong to think he came to see her.
My wife is pregnant.
I'll write a letter.
Stop, please.
Hold on!
I became his friend.
Tom was obviously disappointed.
I'll wash that shirt.
Aren't I beautiful?
You're on the list.

Maybe next time you listen, if I ask you to be careful.
Sorry, it's not your call.
I bought it for my girl.
Is your mother home?
The investigation is ongoing.
I like the language of the provans.
Anything!

I'm a woman.
They kissed in the rain.
I'm a Russian.
It's a lot easier.
We went to London.

Tom put the door on the chain.
Haven't I suffered enough yet?
It's the truth of life.
Eat till he's hot.
I have to wear boots.
As I understand it, you were the last person to see Tom.
Here's the address.
Tom was really treated very unfairly.
Tom respects your opinion.
We have what we deserve.
I slept at 10:00 last night.
We should talk about it.
Are you going to buy a dictionary?
Here's what you asked.
This house is too small.
I have nothing to do with it.
The box was full of corn.

He's got three daughters.
Paul was right.
She's drinking water.
There's a lot of pictures in this book.
An event that shines as a little can lead to an excellent result.
You did your best.
In Hungary, I have a friend named Borat.

How long have you been together?
I just wanted to know if you're in trouble.
Where are the books?
Everybody looks tired.
It's a normal attitude here.
I'd like to borrow about three hundred thousand dollars.
Who are you?
He turned on.
Turns out it's not a crime.
Looks like the money's out.
The book's on the table.
I'll meet him once a week.
Tom's gonna kill me when he finds out I told you about it.
Apcikh!
It's okay.
It's not a dog.
This is my third week.
Gold money turned out to be much more valuable than it was thought.

It smells good here.
We know that now.
I'd better call Tom again.
Do you have a dictionary?
When's Tom coming?
Did you feel an earthquake last night?
Does Tom know what Mary did?
Things don't always go the way we plan.
What are you doing here?

Is that enough?
What I remembered most about the movie was the last scene.
I'm a college student.
You should tell me what you're thinking.
Take it easy.
All the doors are locked in the house.

Where's your friend?
I have two nephews.
I better go talk to Tom.
We can't afford anything.
The leaves are falling.
Tom heard about our conversation.
This is my e-mail address.
She's a beautiful woman.
Tom didn't understand why Mary had made such a decision.
It's not the only thing I have to do.
Dead?
Come on, Tom, it's fun!
Year after year.
What's Tom doing lately?
I'm learning English.
Hello, Tom.
Where are the kids?

It's Sunday.
Of course.
I'm trying to find him for you.
I'll give Tom a message.
I love chicken.
There's a lot of good things about being beautiful.

Here you go.
I've managed to make an incredible mistake.
Tom's hands are dirty.
Obviously.
How do you and Tom get along?
I didn't have much choice.
How'd you figure it out?
Did you have to share a bedroom with your sister-brothers?
You're very kind.
I forgot to tell Tom.
I built a new house.
What's your favorite football team?
It's a beautiful dress.
Just follow your heart.

Excuse me?
Africa is the shadow of mankind.
Tom's the one with the car.
Get out!
I took a train to Boston.
Help!
They're watching.
What's wrong with you?
I want ice cream.
Call me.
It's one of the biggest birds in the world.
I'm not from Boston.
This cave is full of bats.
We're serious.
Tom talked to Mary quietly.
Hang on!
I have a big request.
Are you ready to go?
This has happened before.
I'm very shy.
Say hello to your father for me.
‚ÄúI‚Äôll be in class in time, ‚Äù I thought.
It's not a hard question.
It's a secret. I can't tell you.

Focus on your work.
I took a while to get used to the Venice accent.
Good night, everyone.
It's easy to say.
I'll explain it to you sometime.
That's your problem.
Tom, tell me the truth because I'm gonna find out anyway.
It's not that long list.
I've tried to overcome my modesty, but no matter what.
I have a tree.
I can't find Tom.
I won't hold you back.
I wish I were with you.
Wait!
I'll do it next time.
They're going.
Good morning, sleepy.
Everyone wants to meet you.
Drink with me.
Tom doesn't like how Mary laughs.
Not all Brazilians enjoy the Carnival.
I wish I was next to you.
Keep it down!
I can't approve of it.
What time do you have to go to bed?
Tom faked his mother's signature.
Don't you know what this is?
We're all living together.
