and know if you, people are always rocking towards me
and you feel pained by the chest
And you say there's pressure in your chest.
Anyone in the family who has heart problems, heart disease, heart attacks, high cholesterol, high blood pressure
Are there any symptoms or other problems that you notice together with muscle pain?
Is there anyone else sick like you at home with the same symptoms?
Do you feel any other symptoms?
Have you ever felt a breath?
Are you still feeling pain of chest?
'Cause it's the flu season.
But we can't also isolate breast pain from the heart
But the more important problem now is this chest pain
and I feel difficult breathing.
but I know a lot of people are rocking towards me
But we have to handle every chest pain very seriously
but now you can breathe properly?
I really forgot the cause of this chest pain
Does it feel like someone has bathed your chest?
still feels like a breath
Are they complaining of the same disease?
Do you have a chronic problem such as high blood pressure or something?

I think it's a little flu.
Does it feel like there's someone very heavy sitting on your chest?
All the precautions of headaches are in fever at the same time.
It hurts in the middle of my chest.
stress like chest pain
In my chest
In the middle of my chest
in the middle of the chest

Like high blood pressure or diabetes
It's like right in the middle of the chest.
For the fever, you can drink sweet tachipirina.
Mary, how many days have you been having these symptoms?
You said that you felt pained by the chest
Sometimes I feel sick of chest pain
All right, is there any other symptoms with these symptoms other than the pain
Or someone sitting in your chest?
Almost the same as fever, rock, headache, and muscle pain
Right in the middle of my chest
Show in this picture where you feel pain
'Cause you're fever
So, do you think some of these symptoms might be related to pregnancy?
So, your kids have some same symptoms?
Tell me about your chest pain
fever rises at night

fever started growing last night.
This is a Porter doctor in the middle triase of the emergency room.
Can you tell me more about your chest pain?
I feel pain in front of my body, here, in the chest.
I feel a strong pain in my chest.
When I feel that pain in my chest

You know I suffer from diabetes and other diseases
You said that you felt the pain of this chest
Inside the coronavirus cultivation (COVID-19) that grew rapidly in the European/Economic Union and Raya, January 1 to 15 March 2020
Inside the kumulative case of koronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows the same train in the European/Economi Economic World and the Raya countries that confirms that, even though a different degree depends on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic has grown very quickly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals, and intensive care units, it should increase its precaution for FOID-19 patients who will need health care, especially intensive treatment.
On December 31, 2019, an anonymous pneumonia case with ethics was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Disease Control Center and Prevention Reported agent of this disease's catastrophic agent is a new koronavirus that is now called a coronavirus respiratory synthesis 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence until this time shows that about 80% of the sufferer of COVID-19 suffers from a minor illness, that is, a breathing channel infection with or without pneumonia, with most of this sufferer recovers.
At about 14% of the case, COVID-19 grew into a more serious disease and needed hospital care, while 6% of the other cases had a critical condition that required intensive treatment.
The patient's mortality treated in the hospital due to the COVID-19 about 4%.
In this school, we studied the COVID-19 comulative trains of the European Economic Union (EU/EEA) and the British Raya (UK) and compared it to the incident in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the number of KOVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK with the number of cases in Italy during January 31,–15 March 2020.
Case COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK
After Tiongkok, COVID-19 has been preaching more geographically and the FOID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world while following the pandemic dynasty in Tiongkok.
On March 11, 2020, the General Director of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COID-19 as a pandemi.
In the 20th issue of Eurosurveillance, March 5, Spiteri et al. Reports the first Europeans with the KOVID-19 case confirmed by the definition of WHO case.
In EU/EEA, the first three cases confirmed by France on January 24, 2020 on those who returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, Tiongkok.
On March 15, 2020, the COVID-19 case has been documented throughout 30 EU/EA countries and Ingris Raya (UK), between December 31 December 2019 and 15 March 2020 with that date, there were 39.768 cases and 1.727 deaths reported, with 17.750 cases and 1.441 deaths from Italy alone.
Getting a comulative number and a kumulative instance of KOVID-19 cases
At the European Disabilities Center (ECDC), the number of COVID-19 cases reported to every country around the world is updated every day at 8:00. This amount is obtained only from the official sources such as the country's National Health and regional, and WHO.
This data is used to evaluate the COVID-19 train in EU/EA and UK, and compare it with the Italian train.
As a prevalence proxiement of the COVID-19 case active, we count 14 days of comulative incidents, so counting the natural journey of COVID-19, in every EU/EEA and UK, on January 1,15 of March 2020.
We also offer the number of comulative cases that were reported every country to March 15, 2020 at 8.00 compared with the Italian case during January 31,–15Maret 2020.
Tren COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK
Trens of kumulative incidents have been removed 14 days of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA country and the UK in the Hubei Province (Gambar 1).
For EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the COVID-19 comulative incident has begun to increase about 21 February, and then rises up to 28 February 2020 (extra).
This Tren is particularly moved by the rapid increase in cases reported from Italy, but all the other EU/EEA countries and the UK show the rise of the composive-19 comulative incident.
The 2 picture shows the number of comulative cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA and UK compared to the number of kumulatives in Italy during January 31,–15 March 2020.
The data suggests that, up to 15 March 8.00, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK have reported a total of cases similar to the total number of Italian cases before or less than that.
Our results indicate that the number of cases KOVID-19 that were told increased rapidly in EU/EEA and UK.
Trens that are dying in the comulative comulative incidents of COVID-19 have announced that pandemic increases at similar speeds in all countries.
This is absolved from the national differences, the variance of social health responses, and the possible diversity of the country's case definitions and protocol differences in selecting patients to be tested for confirmation of COVID-19, which includes the tests of the procedure.
Early in March 2020, doctors in the Italian region who were suspected of explaining the situation about 10% of FOID-19 patients need intensive care and media sources report that hospitals and intensive care units in this area have reached its maximum capacity.
Currently, KOVID-19 cases receive data in hospitals and/or intensive treatment units at the EU/EAA level are only available for each 6% and 1% cases.
However, data must be collected in a systematic way to complete current survey data focused on the number of cases reported and death numbers.
The study conducted in 2010-2011 showed a great variety of intensive beds and professional treatments in Europe, from 29,2 in Germany to 4,2 per 100,000 populations in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more resources or less than Italy (12,5 intensive sleeping quarters and nuclear treatments per 100,000 populations in 2010-2011).
The census of the currency of health care, with prevaluation prevaluation precision for each EU/EEA and UK that is related to risk >90% overexperience of the intensive sleep capacity, was provided in the emergency ECDC on CEOID-19.
Because so far the most important case is in certain areas in the EU/EA and UK, and hospitals and intensive care units are usually serving the population of certain regional services, information about the cases and intensive sleeping beds should be provided at the level of the United Unit of Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The experiences from Italy and the current train in other countries show that the FOID-19 pandemi grew very fast in EU/EEA and UK.
For that reason, the country, hospitals, and intensive treatment units should prepare themselves for the SARS-CoV-2 transmission scenario and increase the number of patients COVID-19 that need health care, especially intensive treatment, as is happening in the endangered areas of Italy.
As shown in a recent risk evaluation of ECDC, quick approach, proactive, and comrehensive is important to slow down the preaching of SARS-CoV-2, with a difference from the shortness of conservation to mitigation, because the rise in the number of quick cases, such as the anticipation, may not give enough time to the decisionmakers and hospitals to understand, accept, and take the proper response if it is not expected before.
The immediate risk evaluation also combines social health measures to trigger the impact of the pandemic.
There's a short window of opportunity when the country has the chance to increase its control efforts by slowing down the preaching of SARS-CoV-2 and reducing pressure on health care.
If it fails, another EU/EEA health system is likely to face patients in need of intensive treatment in the next few days or weeks.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by a 2-SARS-CoV-2 synchronization synchronization so far, has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and other places in the world, which cause disaster for mankind.
Similar to his homolog virus, SARS-CoV, which caused the SARS to thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 might also be transmitted from the bat and caused the same symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower level of discrimination and mortality than SARS, but it's more contagious and more important about statistics than young people, and more male than women.
Responsible to the increasing number of publications about this newly developed disease, this article is trying to provide an accurate time and comprehensive analysis of the rapidly growing subject.
We'll discuss the basics of epidemics, ethiologies, virologies, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of disease.
Although many questions were unanswered, we hoped that this question would help as well as help in this threat of disease.
The Semi Festival on January 25, 2020, has become a memorable and unforgettable for all Tionghoa people who are ordered to stay home for vacations and a few weeks after the new virus plague.
This virus was very homology with the coronavirus (CoV) that caused a heavy respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; so, this virus was named after SARS-CoV-2 by World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11 February 2020, and the disease it was called CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
Epidemi in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and almost 50 other countries around the world.
Until March 2, 2020, this virus has resulted in 80,000 cases of COVID-19 confirmed, with more than 40,000 patients reported and 3,000 patients died in the world.
WHO cautions that COVID-19 is "a horrific enemy number 1" and the potential damage is stronger than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months since the first report on 7 January 2020 that set a virus unit independent of some patients, more than 200 have been published about COVID-19, which includes virology, epidemics, etiologis, diagnosis, and treatment.
This study is trying to combine research into the new subject field that is growing rapidly.
As if possible, we'll try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other CoV diseases, which are the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, the plague in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and prognosis of disease and some other unanswered questions but urgently.
According to tradition, CoV is considered non-letal patogen to humans, especially causing about 15% pill 4.
However, in this century, we've found CoV that is very potent for humans twice, that is, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, each caused a wide plague in Tiongkok in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, and quickly spread to many other countries with a morbidity and a terrible mortality.
For that reason, COVID-19 this time is the third CoV plague in human history recorded.
As shown at Gbr. 1.1, the original pneumonia claster was reported from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
Seven days later, CoV acceleration was launched.
On January 15, 2020, the first death case from Wuhan was reported.
In the meantime, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighbors.
On January 20, the health care provider infection was reported, which announced that human-manage transmissions may have occurred.
On January 23, a regional cabin was treated in the city of Wuhan and the entire public transportation was stopped.
On January 24, the first clinic of this disease reported that, from 41 patients with a case confirmed, only 21 patients were directly contacted with Wuhan food markets that were considered to be the first location of infection from an unknown source.
On January 30, WHO described this plague as a global health emergency.
By the time this report was written, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Gbr. 2).2).
Because the situation grows very fast, the end and the side of the plague must still be set.
On February 11, 2020, a multipolitical studi at 8.866 patients, which includes 4.021 COVID-19 patients confirmed, offer the following updated epidemi images (https://mp.weixin.q.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infects people of all ages, but especially at the age of 30-65.
Nearly half (47,7%) of people infected over 50 years of age, only a few under 20 years of age, and only 14 people under the age of 10 are infected.
SARS-CoV-2 infects more men (0,31/100,000) than women (0,27/100,000).
COVID-19 is wide in the classroom, especially inside and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes an average time of 5 (2-9) days from the song to diagnosis.
The average incumbent is 4,8 (3,0-7,2) days.
The average time from the song to death is 9,5 (4,8-13) day.
The primary reproduction number (R0) is 3,77 (95% CI: 3,51-4,05) and R0 adapted 2,23-4,82.
The number of people infected increased exclusively before 23 Jan. 2020, according to the time of mass transport before the Semi Festival in China.
Patient mortality with a case confirmed 1,44% (95% CI: 1,10-1,86%) and mortality for all patients of 3,06% (95% CI: 2,02-4,59%).
Three major risk factors for COVID-19 are types of clamin (pria), age (.60), and heavy pneumonia.
CoV is a large viral subfamily that contains a single RNA sense camel.
CoV can be divided into four species, that is, beta, gamma, and delta, with alfa-and-CoV known to infect humans.
Glikoprotein tonjolan or spike (S) is a serial sample with its cell receptors, the angiotensin's enzyme 2 (ACE 2) and the baptismal baptism 4 (DPP4) each for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, then the membran frustration.
The RNA virus genom is released into sytoplasma; after replicating the virus, RNA genomik is accompanied by glyprotein sampul and nukleolekapsid proteins form a vesicles containing virion, which then suffer from infections with plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genomix SARS-CoV-2 reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new brand-CoV type with a genetic equation of over 99,98% of the 10 samples being executed; the sample is taken from the origin of the plague, that is the Hunger Sea Passage in Wuhan.
Genetically, SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscopy, the SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the epitelium of a very thin human channel.
ACE2 people found is a repository for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 proteins with ACE2 people are weaker than their bond with SARS-CoV proteins, which fit the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes unseparated infections of SARS-CoV patients.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein that is replaced with orf3b and protein that is focused on orf8 passwords.
Protein orf3b SARS-CoV-2 may be involved in the virus's relativeity and inhibit IFN expression; yet, orf8 has no known functiononal or motive domain.
On February 18 2020, Zhou, et al. reported a total human cryo-EM ACE2 structure on the 2,9 Å resolution in a complex with acid transporter B0AT1.
They found that complexs, which have open and closed information, together form a dimer and a compleks of ACE2-B0AT1 can tie two proteins of S, which are evidence for CoV recognition and infections.
B0AT1 can be a special target in the drug filter to press SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original and intermediate inn
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known from the bats and each transmits to humans through saddles and camels.
Through the SARS-CoV-2 filogentic comparison of other CoVs, the bats are considered the original SARS-CoV-2 inflammation because this new virus is 96% identified with two CoV mirip-SARS from the clelawar called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediary that enables the virus to cross the species’s infectious system is still unknown, and transmission routes still need to be explained.
Ji, et al, proposes snakes as vipers from a bat to humans that involve homolog recomplications in S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, Tiongkok, suggest that the energetic mammals have a long diet that is often used in traditional Tionghoa medicines, has the potential as an inter-CoV-2 based in 99% genetic homology on CoV found in the angle and SARS-CoV-2.
Even so, 1% of the difference spread throughout the genom is still a big difference; therefore, the conclusive results as a concrete evidence are not yet available.
SARS-CoV-2 physicist properties are largely unknown.
In vitro, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can last 48 hours in the dry environment and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have the same property.
It is reported that SARS-CoV-2 sensitivity towards the ultraviolet light and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; eter, etanol 75%, synthetic clorine, clamps, kloroform acid, and other fat tubers, but not chlorheksidin, effectively activated the virus.
Generally, the entire human population does not have an imunitacy against SARS-CoV-2 and because it's vulnerable to this new virus.
Right now, there's not a detailed study that reports about the reaction to ARS-CoV-2.
That's why we can only refer to other CoV studies before, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Gbr. 4).4).
Generally, after reincarnating the inn, the virus is known by the immune system through the pola-marking receptor (PR), which includes a C-type lectin-like receptor, Toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-Ilike receptor (RR).
Through different pathways, the virus recommends inflocation factors, dendritic cell maturation, and synthesis interferon type I (IFN) that blocks the spread of the virus and speeds the antigen virus fagositosis by the makrofag.
However, the N protein on SARS-CoV can help the virus avoid the immune response.
Soon, the reaction of the imun adaptives joined in the battle against this virus.
Limfosit T, which includes CD4+ and CD8+ cells, plays an important role in this defense.
T CD4+ cells speculate B cells to produce specific antibodies to the virus, and T CD8+ cells kill viral cells directly infected.
T help cell produces proinfeteria synthesis to help protect the cell.
However, CoV can reduce the function of T cells by mixing the T cell apoptosis.
Imunity is humoral, which includes components, such as C3a and C5a, and antibodies are also important in combating virus infections.
For example, the antibodies that are isolated from the patient who is recovering have contracted MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the excessive immune response of the immune system results in a large amount of locally free radical, which can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and, on the worst scenarios, failure in the organ and even death.
The SARS-CoV-2 infection, marked with the burden claster, is much more about hygiene with an attendee and pregnant woman.
Generally, people who have been exposed to viruses in large numbers or whose immune functions are affected have a higher chance of infection than others.
SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, most 3-7 days based on the study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1.099 cases showed that the average incubating period is 3 days and from 0 to 24 days.
A newer Student, as explained above, shows that the 48 inkubasi period (3,0-7,2) day based on demography 8.866 cases.
It is vital that health authorities adjust effective treatments based on the most accurate period of incumbent incumbent to prevent infected people, but without symptoms, transmit the virus to others.
As a general practice, people who have been exposed to viruses or infections are usually required to be interrogated for 14 days.
Should the coral time be extended to 24 days?
Demam is often the main and early COVID-19 symptoms, with or without other symptoms such as dry rock, breathing, muscular pain, headaches, throat pain, rinorea, chest pain, diare, nausea, and muntah.
Some patients experience dispnea and/or hypoksemia a week after the disease.
In a severe case, patients ’ illness increases rapidly as a respiratory aches, septics, asidosis metabolic, and koagulopati.
Patients who suffer from fever and/or breathing symptoms and aquatic fever, even without a lung detection, have to be filtered to the virus to diagnosis early.
The demographic Studi at the end of December 2019 shows that 98% of the temperature rate for fever, 76% for dry rock, 55% for dispnea, and 3% for diare; 8% patients need ventilator support.
Similar findings are reported in two recent studies, that is, a study on family klaster and classer that is caused by transmission from an asimtomatict.
Contrary to that, the 2012 demographic studi showed that MERS-CoV patients also suffered fever (98%), dry rock (47%), and dispnea (55%) as the main gear.
However, 80% patients need ventilation support, far more than KOVID-19 patients and are consistent with MERS' capabilities higher than COVID-19.
Diare (26%) and throat disease (21%) also die of MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), dry rockk (29%-75%), dispnea (40%-42%), diare (20-25%), and throat disease (13-25%) is shown as the main gear and ventilation support required for about 14%-20% patients.
Up to 14 February, the mortality of COVID-19 is 2% of the case confirmed to 66.576 across the world.
At the same time, the SARS mortality in November 2002 was 10% of 8.096 cases confirmed.
For MERS, according to a demographic study in June 2012, 37% of 2.494 cases were confirmed.
The Studi previously reported that R0 SARS-CoV-2 reached 6,47 with the trust interval (CI) 95% of 5,71-7,23, while R0 SARS-CoV is only 2 to 4.
SARS-CoV-2 comparison with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in gender, mortality, and R0 is given on Tabel 1.
These numbers show that SARS-CoV-2 has higher power to spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but does not kill MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
That's why it's a challenge to control SARS-CoV-2's pandemic greater than the MERS-CoV pandemi and SARS-CoV.
Claster enthusiasts are often found in a family or in a group or in a vehicle like a sailboat.
Patients often have travel history or live in Wuhan or other endangered areas or contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before being sung.
However, it has been reported that people can carry viruses without showing symptoms of more than two weeks and that patients released from the hospital can carry another virus.
In early stages, a patient has a white perifer’s cell count (of particular limfosit) normal or down.
For example, limfopenia with a white blood cell <4×109/L, which includes the number of limfosit < 1×109/L, and the increase rate of allotransferase and viremation were found at 1.099 COID-19 patients.
The enzyme rate of heart and muscles and mioglobins increase in the blood of a number of patients, as well as C-reactive proteins and blood shortages increase in most patients.
In patients with heavy cases, D-dimer rates increase, which is the product of phybrin digestion in the blood, and the amount of limfosit drops progressively.
The difference between photos of tortoise is found in large cases of FOID-19 patients and is marked by a shadow of the momentary shadow or the ground-glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often experience a thin pneumonia, aquatic injuries, and acute aquatic syndrome (ARDS).
When the ARDS occurs, the inflammation of inaccessible, accelerated fluid, and progresive phybrosis greatly reduces gas exchange disorders.
The pneumosit spectacle I and type II dispatched the surface rate and increased the pressure to lower the capacity to develop and increase the risk of deterioration.
As a result, the worst discovery on the tortoise photo is often paralleled with the worst disease rate.
On February 18 2020, the first KOVID-19 specimens analysts showed pneumositation, hybrid sewage, and limfosit infiltration, as well as a high incidence of the patients who died of this disease, appropriate to the virus and ARDS injection of ARS and similar to the psychiatric analysis of SARS patients and MERS.
Detect RNA SARS-CoV-2 via the back transscription polimeration chain (RT-PCR) response to use as the main criteria for diagnosis COVID-19.
However, because it is a false negative level, which can speed up the epidemi, the circumference begins to be used for diagnosis (which no longer depends only on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
The same situation happens to SARS diagnosis.
Hence, the combination of disease, clinch displays, test labs, and radiologic findings is vital and is an effective diagnosis.
On February 14 2020, the Feng Zhang group explained the use of SHERLOCK techniques based-CRISPR to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detected the RNA SARS-CoV-2 synthetics on 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter input) using celup levels in less than an hour without a complicated instrument.
Hopefully, this new technique can greatly increase sensitivity and ease if it is verified on a clean sample.
Because of the lack of experience with the new CoV, doctors especially offer support treatment to the KOVID-19 patients, while trying some treatments that have been used or proposed before for other CoV treatments, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Tabel 2).2).
These therapis include therapies that are present and potential therapy with antivirus drugs, immunosupres, steroids, plasma from a healthy patient, traditional Tionghoa medicine, and psychologist support.
Even the plasma from a healthy patient is recommended for use in therapies.
The farming company is developing antibodies and vaccines against this virus.
In early stages, SARS-CoV-2 especially attacked the lungs and may also attack other organs that emphasize ACE2 in lower levels, such as gastrointestinal and kidney systems.
However, disfunction and respiratory failure are a major threat to the patient and the primary cause of death.
As a result, breathing support is essential to reducing symptoms and saving lives, which include the general oxygen therapy, high flow of oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, and invasive mechanical ventilation, depends on the level of the disease.
Patients with heavy breathing symptoms should be supported by extracorporeum - membrane oxygen (ECMO), which is the technique of the termodation carddioulmoner treatment used for heart failure or the breathing that threatens the soul.
In addition, the maintenance of electrical balances, precautions and high-school infections and synaptics, as well as the protection of organ functions is important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
The overknowledge of the immune system reactions result in a symptom storm on SARS and MERS patients.
Strict storm is a systemic infectional inflocation form marked by a synthetic release degnosis, which includes TNF, IL-1. IL-2, IL-6, IFN
These sytokin-sitokins have promoted the immune cell to release a large number of free radicals that are the main cause of ARDS and fails the viral organs.
Imunosupression is very important in the survival of a symphony storm, especially in the terminally ill patient.
Korticosteroid and Tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 antibodies, have been used to handle the storm.
Other immunosupression for synthesis scanning includes the immune response modulation given to T cells; IFN-an, IL-1, and TNF ; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; syntax signals 4; and HDAC inhibitor.
Steroid, as imunosupres, is used a lot in SARS treatment to reduce infectional damage.
However, steroids on high doses are useless for heavy strokes on SARS patients and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, steroids can cause heavy side effects, especially osteonekrosis, that affects significant prognosis.
However, the brief offer of corticosteroids on low doses until it is encouraged to be cautiously given to a COLID-19 critical patient.
At the time of this investigation, no effective antivirus therapy has been confirmed.
However, the intravena remdesivir provider, a nuclear analogy, is found to be indicted by an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a new antivirus developed by Gilead, recurring disease treatment caused by Ebola and Marlburg virus.
Later, the remdesivir also shows inhibitions toward the single RNA camel virus, which includes the MERS and SARS virus.
Based on this, Gilead has provided this whole generation for Tiongkok to try a series of tests on people who are infected by SARS-CoV-2, and the results are worth the price.
In addition, barcitinb, interferon, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been recommended as potential therapy for patients with accolating symptoms.
Diare, nausea, vomiting, heartbreak, and other side-sided reactions can happen after the combination of the therapy with the lopinavir/ritonavir.
This therapy interaction with other drugs that the patient uses should be monitored accurately.
Plasma of a patient who is healed and antibodies
There is a long history of a patient’s blood collection that has been healed of contagious diseases to treat other patients who suffer from the same disease or to prevent the patient from contracting the disease.
It is true that a healthy patient often has antibodies that are relatively high in his blood.
Antibodi is an imunoglobulin (Ig) that is produced limfosit B to fight patogens and other foreign objects, recognize unique molecules on patogen, and straighten it.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had been healed from COVID-19 and was prescribed to 10 patients who were seriously ill.
They repair in 24 hours, including inflammation and virusbands and increase in saturation of oxygen in the blood.
However, verification and clarification must be done to advance the method for large scale use before specific therapy is developed.
Further, other than the most basic effect, some defects related to plasma should be evaluated entirely.
For example, antibodies can exaggerate the reaction of the immune response and cause synthetic escape syndrome, which is a potential toxin that threatens the soul.
The concentration of antibodies in blood is usually low and plasma is required in large numbers to care for critical patients.
Expansion and production of antibodies are very fast enough to fight global epidemics hard to do.
For that reason, more important and practically resolving B cells from patients who are recovering and identify genetic codes that alter the effective antibodies or make antibodies that are effective to essential proteins for the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the antibodies ’ production scale.
TCM has been used to treat diseases in China for thousands of years.
The effect, however, depends largely on the combination of various components in the formula.
Most effective components are still unknown or not clear because they are difficult to extract or verify the component or its optimal combination.
At this point, because the effective and specific therapy for COVID-19 has not been available, TCM has become one of the main alternative therapy for patients with light - up symptoms or for people who recover from serious illness.
For example, the capsul Shu Feng Jie Du and captain Lian Hua Qing Wen were found to work for the COVID-19 therapy.
The highest recovery rate in the FOID-19 patients is killed in some provinces of China that use TCM in 87% of its patients, which includes Gansu (63,7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while provinces of Hubei, which use TCM only at about 30% COID-19 patients, have a maximum rate of recovery (13%).
However, this comparison is still so harsh that many other factors, such as the number and side effects of the patient, must be included in evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and friends dedicated a study that compared the western therapy (WM) only with the combined WM and TCM therapy.
They found that the time needed to recover the temperatures, the loss of symptoms, and the treatment of the inflammation is much shorter on the WM+TCM group than only the WM group.
More impressive things, the gecko hunt rate (from light to weight) is much lower for the WM+TCM group than only the WM group (7,4% rather than 46,2%) and a lower mortality of the WM+TCM group than only (8,8% than 39%).
However, the efficiency and security of TCM are still waiting for a better test controlling on larger scales and in more research centers.
The other interesting thing is to indicate the working mechanism and to clarify effective components in the TCM therapy or the combination, if possible.
Most patients expected or confirmed by COVID-19 feel very much afraid of this very contagious and even deadly disease, and the person who was hypertensions also felt the loss, loneliness, and anger.
Further, such infections as fever, hypnosis, and rocky and side - sided therapy effects such as insomnia that corticosteroids can cause greater stress and mental stress.
In the early stages of SARS, a series of psychiatrist morbidities, which include depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychiatric trends, psychomotor symptoms, delirium, and even automatics have been reported.
Spreading a matter of contact and complicity, as part of the social health response to the KOVID-19 plague, can make people more worried and guilty of the effects of coercion, hygiene, and stigma about kinship and friends.
As a result, mental health care should be provided for FOID-19 patients, the expected people, and the people who deal with them, and the general community that needs.
Physicist support must include the development of multidiscipline mental health teams, clear communications with routine updates and compatibility on SARS-CoV-2, and therapies and the use of devices and professional electronic applications to avoid contacts close to each other.
Effective vaccines are vital to emitting transmissions from animal and human reservoirs infected with vulnerable and often equipped antivirus therapy in controlling the epidemi caused by the virus.
The effort has been made to develop protein-based vaccine S, which is prolonged and effective make antibodies and/or imunitas protecting against SARS-CoV.
For SARS, living vaccines have been analyzed to experimental animals.
However, this vaccine candium in vivo is in the statistics and models of the lethal challenge and protection against the zoonotic virus infection still must be determined before the class begins.
This is probably because SARS was sneaking 17 years ago and no new case has been reported since then.
Instead, sporadis cases and MERS clasters continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other areas because there is always a zoonotic source in the endemy area.
The vaccination strategy has been developed for MERS by using a disable virus, DNA plasmid, virus vector, nanopartikel, viral migration particles, and protein subtitles and some have been analyzed to experimental animals.
A vaccine development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV for non-immuns is a very urgent and important task to control the current epidemi.
However, this difficulty is not easy to deal with because it's a long time to develop vaccines (over 18 months) and dynamic CoV variations.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just started to show a full clean trip to thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover without a moment.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and high mortality in patients with heavy cases.
For that reason, the development of the model of the disease is important to the health - care body, especially in the area with limited resources.
Based on the class that has been reported so far, the following factors can affect or relate to the prognosis of FOID-19 patients (Tabel 3):
Age: Usia is the most important factor in SARS prognosis, which also occurs for COVID-19.
COVID-19 especially happened at the age of 30-65 with 47,7% of patients aged over 50 in school with 8.866 cases as explained above.
Patients who need intensive care tend to have a compulsive and complications and signify older patients who do not need intensive care (66-year-old age for 51 years), who describe age as a prognostical factor for the end of the MOVID-19 patient.
SARS-CoV-2 is more infecting men than women (0,31/100,000 than 0,27/100,000), as explained above.
Komorbitality and complications: KOVID-19 patients who need intensive treatment have more likely to have a heart pain and aritmia.
Heart incident also explains the primary reason for death on SARS patients.
SARS-CoV-2 reported can also be drawn by colangiosits with ACE2-positive, which can lead to the heart disfunction of FOID-19 patients.
It needs to be noted that age and disease are very closely related and can affect each other.
C-reakive protein rates (CRP) in the blood reflect inflammation or network injury and are developed as potential prognostic factors for disease, responsive to therapies, and final recovery.
Proxy between CRP rates and blindness and COVID-19 prognosis has also been proposed.
In addition, an allotransferase (ALT), and creatin sincerity (CK), aspartat alloferase (LDH), alanin aminotransferase (ALT), and a creatin sincerity (CK) can also help predict the end result.
These enzymes are highly expressed in various organs, especially in heart and heart, and released during network damage.
For that reason, these enzymes are the traditional markings of heart and heart disfunction.
Primarily classroom: Photos of tortoise and temporal classic developments should be considered together with other things to predict the end result and the COVID-19 complications.
Steroid usage: As explained above, steroid is an imunosupression that is widely used as a single therapy for infectional infections to reduce infectional damage.
Because corticosteroid high doses are widely used for severe SARS patients, many people who survive this disease eventually suffer from osteonekrosis avascular disabilities of life and a bad quality of life.
That's why, if necessary, steroids should be used on low doses and a short period of time on KOVID-19 patients.
Mental pressure: As explained above, during the COVID-19 plague, many patients suffer extraordinary stress because they have to undergo an extremely long-term and incomprehensible chain and witness the death of close family members and fellow patients.
Physical content and long-term support must be given to help this patient recover from stress and return to normal life.
Based on the demographic studi so far, COVID-19 seems to have a different epidemic picture of the SARS.
In addition to converging on the lower breathing channel, SARS-CoV-2 can be sensitive to the upper breathing channel and cause lighting or without symptoms at the initial infection face, similar to other CoVs that cause a chill.
For that reason, in the early fase or incultivation period, the infected patients can produce virus in large numbers during everyday activities, causing great difficulty in controlling the epidemi.
However, the SARS-CoV transmission is believed to occur when the patient is seriously ill and most do not happen in the early fase.
Thus, the COVID-19 plague is far worse and hard to control from the SARS plague.
Currently, great effort is being made in China, which includes the Wuhan regional and surrounding cities and the long-term stall of the population with the hope of producing the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
Although this action can be very damaging to the economy and other sectors in the country, the number of new patients drops, representing epidemi transmissions.
The most optimistic spectacle says the plague will end in March and the fate of disbelief takes place for 3-4 months.
However, some other experts were not.
Paul Hunter is al speculating that COVID-19, which seems to be much moreular than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al. makes a model for predicting the end of the epidemi and states that SARS-CoV-2 can infect two thirds of global population.
Canada's research team reported that SARS-CoV-2 detected in the mid-conflict and the recuperation of patients who have recovered and returned from hospital two weeks ago.
However, the signs of promise occur in China, if they are seen on the basis of a new number of cases, which shows that the strategy of the present might be successful.
The reproductive Ebola will cause one million cases with half as well as death.
However, with hypertension and liquor, the disease can be handled in the long run.
Maybe, like the SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has limited his ability to infect and finally disappear or become a virus not too superhuman.
The KOVID-19 epidemi comparison with SARS and MERS epidemi given below (Gbr. 5).
SARS-CoV-2 is very easy to transmit through rock or gas, and it may also be through a direct contact with the material contaminated by the virus.
This virus is also found in the process until it increases the possibility of a new transmission, that is, the feses-to-witch transmission.
The school recently in 138 cases reported that 41% of the case was probably due to nosocomal infections, which included 17 patients with other diseases before and 40 health care providers.
Thus, equal care should be done to protect humans, especially health - care providers, social workers, family members, workmates, and even people who are coordinated with patients or people who are infected.
The first defense lines that can be used to lower the risks of infection are through the use of masks in the face, either brain mask or mask respirator N95 (a 1860 serial number) to help control the virus's spread.
Smokers tend to keep the infected person’s wounds in good condition safe or to implant on the surface of the materials, the scalp’s place can continue to be passed on to others.
However, only the N95 mask (a 1860-an serial number) can protect against virion inhalation by 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% virions can fully recycle; SARS-CoV-2 resembles SARS-CoV in size, both equally 85 nm.
Since the particle can drive even five surgeons that are carried into one, health care providers directly connected with patients must wear N95 (a 1860-an) serial and not a surgeon.
In addition to masks, health - care providers must wear the proper silk coat to reduce contact with the virus.
The virus can also infect someone through the eye.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected by SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing N95 masks; the virus might enter his body through eye contact.
For that reason, health - care providers also have to wear a visibility of eyeglasses or glasses while working with patients.
For the common people in the affected or potential areas, it is very recommended that each person wash his hands with soap in a more common place than usual, try to stay in the house for personal hygiene, and avoid contact with the infected person.
The distance of three feet is believed to be appropriate to keep the distance from the patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human world, its high homology with SARS-CoV, as reported on January 7, 2020, must be a major reminder of Tiongkok who has strong memories of SARS plague in 2003.
However, on January 19th, 2020, the director of the Wuhan Disease Management Center comforted the population by saying that this new virus has a low - quality preaching and the limitless reproduction of humans to humans and precautions and conservation and conservation of this disease is not a problem.
This message was so soothing to the people, especially when the whole country was preparing the Semi Festival, so this critical time was too late to contain a still small disease in Wuhan.
The disease - control body in China should draw a lesson from this and make great repairs in the future.
For example, this body should (1) be more careful when making public announcements because every word is observed by the people and can change their attitude and decisions; (2) more sensitive and effective in information is more sensitive than waiting for an official report from a doctor or a supervision officer; (3) more exploits the incidence of epidemi potentials at early stages, and not attempts to calm the public; and (4) more often exacerbates the public's awareness of the epidemia and testimonial system of publicity.
The CVID-19 scene was caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus that started to spread at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, the plague has spread throughout China and over 50 countries in the world at this time of writing.
Since this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and COID-19 and SARS are also similar, the COVID-19 plague has an effect like the recurring SARS plague.
However, there are some clear differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are very important to contain epidemi and deal with patients.
COVID-19 is more about dysfunction than young people and more about men than women, and the death rate is also higher than young people.
SARS mortality is higher than the mortality of COVID-19 (10,91% than 1,44%).
The COVID-19 passenger transmits the virus even when they have no symptoms, while SARS patients usually transmit the virus when they are seriously ill.
This explains some of the reasons SARS-CoV-2 are spreading faster and larger than SARS-CoV.
RNA's routine job to check SARS-CoV-2 can give negative results to some FOID-19 patients.
On the other hand, a recovering patient can give a positive effect on a virus.
This study has greatly increased the risk of viral witnessing.
As soon as the COVID-19 research progressed, some important problems still need to be resolved, that is:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although it's found a genetic homology of 96% between SARS-CoV-2 and two CoV similar-SARS clears, we still can't conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from the kelelawar.
What animal is being an intermediate species to dismantle the virus from the original inn, say the bat, to humans?
Without knowing the answer to number 1 and 2, we can't send transmission with effectiveness and wabah can relapse every moment.
Although molecular molester and biochemical reactions show that SARS-CoV-2 sets up with ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter into the breathing channel cell and contribute to the next change of patologics?
Is this virus the same as the cell that stresses ACE2 on the other organs?
Without a clear answer to these questions, we can't reach a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemi continue?
How did the virus develop genetically during human transmission?
Will this pandemi be the world's pandemic, ends like SARS, or returns periodically like flu?
The answer to the above and many other statements is important, but it may take time to find them.
Whatever the cost, however, we have no choice but to stop this epidemic as soon as possible to return to normal life.
Human crown virus zoonotic origin
For thousands of years, mutations and adaptations have moved the corona viruses and its inn, including humans.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoV) were known to cause minor illness, such as selesma.
The respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) reverse the situation and reveal how HCoV infection can be very damaging and threatening the soul.
It's SARS-CoV-2 in central China at the end of 2019 has made CoV a recharge and surprise us with a high transmission, but with a lower relative than his brother, SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonosis, so the original sense of HCoV will benefit us.
Most of the HCoV is from the bat. In this animal, the virus is not patogenic.
Some HCoV reservoirs are also known.
Identifying that animal has a direct implication in human disease prevention.
CoV-inang interaction to animals can also give a significant impact on the subject of the CoV's patogenesis to humans.
In this interview, we offer a general picture of the current knowledge of seven HCoVs, focused on the history of his discovery and the origin of his zootics and the transmission of his antarspecies.
More important, we compared the HCoV with the view of evolution and the genom record.
Epidemi CoV 2019 (COVID-19) is currently discussed in this context.
In addition, a successful and viral evolutionary transmission of the disease is also distorted.
The corona virus (CoV) comes from the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of RNA viruses incompatible, positive givendras, and a single reproductive.
This virus has the largest genom of the 20 to 32 kilograms between the RNA virus called "CoV", because its morfology resembles a crown under the electron microscope.
According to its structure, CoV has an uncommunicated genom that has a similar statement.
About two thirds of the genoms consisted of two large open reading lines (ORF1a and ORF1b) that were each overboard. Both are transliterated into polyprotein replication pp1a and pp1abs.
Poliprotein has more processing to form 16 non-struktural proteins, called nsp1~16.
The genom consists of open reading frames (ORF) for structureal proteins, which include tonjolanes or spike (S), a bucket or envelope (E), membran (M), and nukleoprotein (N).
A number of proteins that are specific for certain genealogies are also replaced by various CoV lines.
Based on the difference in protein sector, CoV is classified to be four species (alfa-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV); among the fourth species, the genus beta-CoV has the most HCoV and is divided into four generations (A, B, C, and D).
Phlogenetic evidence indicates that the caterpillar and caterpillar animals are most of the sources of alpha-CoV and beta-CoV, while the unggas are the main gamma-CoV and delta-CoV reservoirs.
For thousands of years, CoV has continued to cross species and several CoVs have become a very important patogen to humans.
Until now, there are seven human CoVs known.
Among the seventh virus, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are an alfa-CoV.
Five other beta-CoVs encompass HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, a heavy respiratory soup virus (SARS-CoV), a Middle East-CoV-CoV synchronic virus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63 are usually causing light symptoms, such as pileks and or diare.
Instead, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are very potent, causing the lower breath channel infection on more patients and have a higher chance of developing a medal disorder syndrome (ARDS) and exposure outside the lungs organ.
Srain HCoV-229E first, B814, was isolated from the inflated patient in the mid- 1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been collected through deep studs against HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, the second cause of healing itself.
In fact, this concept has been widely accepted that the general HCoV infection is not dangerous, until the SARS plague occurs.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 was one of the most destructive epidemics in the history of the day, which infected more than 8,000 people with a violent death rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) spread an epidemic in the Arab Peninsula by preaching sporadic to different parts of the world.
HCoV was just 2019 (9-nCoV), which was next called SARS-CoV-2, is a 2019-19-COV virus epidemic agent, which has killed more than 3.120 people and infected more than 91000 people to 3 March 2020.
Alarm's already ringing and the world has to prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandes.
Seven of those HCoVs all have the origin of zoonotics from the bats, rats, or pets.
Many evidence supports the origin of the evolution of all HCoVs from the bats.
Epidemi COVID-19 has posed a medical, scientific, social, and moral challenge that is great for China and the whole world.
The origin of the HCoV zoontics gives the framework to understand the nature of nature, movement, and limitation factors occur in the migration of antar species.
The Student can also drive or facilitate the search for reservoir animals, between them, and SARS-CoV-2 specimens, which have an important implication in the preaching process at the coming time.
In this interview, we gave us a general picture of the origin of zoonotics, antarspeies transmission, and HCoV patogenessis.
We specially review and discuss the general subject that the HCoV mother virus is usually nonpatogenic in its natural reservation, but become patogenic after transmission antarspecies to the new inn.
We also pointed out the HCoV evolution train that the rise of transmission skills is often accompanied by a patogenism.
The end result of SARS-CoV-2 epidemi is also discussed in this context.
CoV animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E dissipation of the first B814 of the patient inhaled, various CoVs have been isolated from various infected animals, which include cassava, rats, cows, pigs, cats, and dogs.
In the last few stages, seven HCoVs have been identified.
The short record of HCoV discovery history in chronology sequence (Tabel 1) is an informative hint.
The first HCoV-229E is isolated from the patient's breathing channels that suffered a respiratory infection in 1966, which was next approved to be implanted in WI-38's cell.
The patients infected with HCoV-229E show symptoms of selesma, which include headaches, cinema, leaks, and throat pains, along with fever and rocks seen in 10~20% cases.
Next in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ-cultures and serial networks in the still incumbent brain.
HCoV-OC43 infection description seems to be similar to the infection caused by HCoV-229E, which is automatically unable to be linked with other respiratory channel infections infections such as influenza A and rhinovirus virus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 spread around the world and tended to be most transmitted during the winter in the tropical regions.
Typically, the incumbent period of these two viruses is less than a week and followed by disease for about two weeks.
According to a human volunteer school, a healthy HCoV-229E suffers a light moment.
Only a little patient with a weak body immune system that shows a heavy flow of underwater infections.
SARS, also known as "pneumonia attiff", was the first pandemic of HCoV that was well documented in human history and its ethical agent is SARS-CoV, which is the third HCoV found.
The first case of SARS can be traced back to the end of 2002 in Guangdong Province, Tiongkok.
The SARS Epidemi has led to 8.096 cases reported by 774 deaths, which have spread in many countries and continents.
Out of superulars, every case is estimated to cause about two secondary cases, with 4 to 7 days ’ incumbent and the weight of the virus is seen on the 10th day of the disease.
SARS-CoV patients have earlier migrations, headaches, fevers, leaks, and hypertensions, followed by dispnea, rocky, and breathing disorders as further levels.
Limfopenia, an abnormal heart function test, and the rise of the creatin kinase is a common lab in SARS.
The damage of alveolar fertilization, epitel proliferation, and the increase of macarofag are also observed in SARS patients.
Next, about 20-30% patients need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
Besides the subway, some organs that include gastrointestinal, heart, and kidneys can also be infected in serious cases, usually accompanied by a symphony storm, which can be deadly, especially to the disabled patient.
The virus was first isolated from the lung's biops open with the number of patients who were traveling to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, much effort has been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from 7 months old children from the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
These viruses are initially very laziness on young, old, and vulnerable patients who suffer from respiratory illness.
The description of corriza, tourism, fever, and laziness were found in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent Studi explains the same viruses of the 8-month-month specimen who suffer from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although identified in the Netherlands, the virus is actually spreading around the world.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 represents about 4,7% of general respiratory disease and the peak of the event occurred at the beginning of summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 associated with obstructive laringitis, also called crups.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from 71-year-old men who had been treated in the form of pneumonia and bronkiolitics in Hong Kong.
Besides pneumonia and bronkiolitis community, HCoV-HKU1 is reported to be related to acceleration.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found around the world, causing light breathing diseases.
These four HCoV communities are all adapted to humans and generally have small chances of escalating into a very potent disease.
In general, when it gets the ability to move in efficiency and keep yourself in human form, this virulenic and HCoV's relativeity is also declining.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from 60-year-old patients who suffered accelerated pneumonia and failed kidney in Saudi Arabia.
Even though most cases were confirmed from the Middle East, the imperative case with an occasional high - level preaching campaign has been reported in various European and Tunisian countries.
Other secondary levels occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 cases confirmed.
Manifestation MERS's clean condition is similar to the display of the SARS cruise, which is demonstrated by pneumonia affluent accelerated.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients have also failed accolades, which so far just happened to MERS among the diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% patients show gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diare and vomit.
Up to 14 February 2020, more than 2500 cases were confirmed by a high case of death, which is 34,4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most frightening viruses known to humans.
In mid-to the end of December 2019, a retrospective pneumonia claster is linked to SARS-CoV-2 infections found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization (WHO) states that the underwater infection rate is taking place and is due to SARS-CoV-2 as Global Health Depression and named the COID-19 disease.
Up to 3 March 2020, 90.053 cases have been confirmed around the world, with a death rate of 3,4%.
It needs to be recorded, death in Hubei, China, a total of 4,2%, while the death of the case outside Hubei is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes heavy respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with symptoms of fever, rock, and breath.
Diare is also found in a number of patients.
Pneumonia is one of the hardest symptoms and can quickly develop into a nausea disorder.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of high nuclear homology sequences, 82%, both grouped into different phylogenetic branches.
The SARS-CoV-2 patogonisity is clearer, but more contagious than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Subject infected SARS-CoV-2 without symptoms has been reported and may be involved in the spread of SARS-CoV-2 fast around the world.
Comparing and comparing SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoV shows a very interesting equation and difference.
First, HCoV's diarrhea and incumbent duration are very similar.
In this case, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general train six other HCoVs.
Secondly, CVID-19 is between SARS-CoV and four other HCoV communities (as it is HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection shows a more common picture of the HCoV Komunitas infection, which includes the image of nonspecial symptoms or even without symptoms.
On the other hand, some of the worst KOVID-19 cases can be seen like SARS-CoV infection even with a lesser official.
Third, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows an interesting pattern of patterns, having similarity with the HCoV community and SARS-CoV.
On the one side, SARS-CoV-2 transmission skills at least equal to the height of the HCoV community.
On the other hand, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 does not have the ability to change after a few lines on humans still need to be verified, just as the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Last, like another HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected from the feses sample.
"Is the SARS-CoV-2 fecal-oral transmission important, like in the case of SARS-CoV transmission, at least in a certain situation, it still needs to be explained by the next studi."
The most important thing to know is whether SARS-CoV is as seasonal as in HCoV's case.
Anyway, the SARS-CoV-2 image, which includes transmission skills, hypertension, and preaching continue in a few lines of human beings, will have a profound impact on the end of the COVID-19 plague that is going on.
Four HCoV communities that cause the light pace of all have been adapted to humans.
From another point of view, humans can say have adapted to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both HCoV and human might be a species of an ancient HCoV pandemi.
The HCoV that causes serious disease on humans and people who suffer from HCoV's heavy disease has been destroyed.
In order for this to happen, HCoV must be in a person in a number that is sufficient to allow a adaptable mutations to be used against the inn control factor.
Thus, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 plague survives and the more people are infected, the more likely the virus is infected with humans.
If the virus is properly adapted, the transmission to humans will be difficult to stop with the corridor or other infectious measures.
Over the years, four CoV communities have left in human populations and have triggered a selesma to people who are hygienic.
This virus doesn't need animal reservation.
Instead, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are very potents that have not been adapted to human and human transmissions.
Both must defend themselves and make a displacement in the zoonotic reservation and look for opportunities to spread to the vulnerable human targets, possibly through one or a few intermediate and complications.
SARS-CoV-2 has a picture similar to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV communities.
SARS-CoV-2 is so easily transmitted like the HCoV community, at least now.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is more compatible than HCoV community and not SARS-CoV synonymous or MERS-CoV.
It's still to be noted whether SARS-CoV-2 will adapt completely to human beings and circulate in humans without a reservoir or an intermediate animal.
Before discussing the origin of HCoV animals, we need to discuss definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoirs, intermediate, and HCoV complications.
Animals act as an evolutionary HCoV if they have a close - knit ancestors and share high homology at the nucleus level.
The old virus is usually properly adapted and is not synonymous with this inflammation.
Similarly, the reservoir mother carries HCoV on her way and in the long centuries.
In both cases, the natural infection is natural and is a natural inn for HCoV or a parent virus.
Instead, if the HCoV just enters the intermediate inn before or around the time the virus enters the human body, the virus has not yet been adapted to the new inang and is often patogenic.
This intermediary can function as a source of human infection zoonotics and play as an inn to complicate the virus temporarily, and then transmit it to humans to applaud the human infection scale.
HCoV can experience a bunch of infections if it can't maintain its transmission in the middle intestine.
In contrast, HCoV can also adapt to an intermediate inn and even cause long-term endemisity.
In this case, the supernatural becomes a natural reservoir.
Epidemic data retrospectively reveals that the SARS zero case has a contact history with the hunting animals.
The next seroprevalence suggests that the vendor had a higher IgG anti-SARS-CoV prevalence than the general population.
The moonlight (Pauma larvate) and the racist dog at a living animal market were first identified with a similar-SARS-CoV virus that was almost identified with SARS-CoV.
Indirectly, this is supported by the fact that no more SARS cases have been reported since all the riots in the market were killed.
It is reported that the moons from the wild or the livestock that are not exposed to the animal market are mostly giving negative results of test for SARS-CoV. This signals that the moon will probably only act as an international animation injection, but not a environmental revolution of SARS-CoV.
Reportedly, because 80% of various animals at the Guangzhou market have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it is not conservative that many small mammal species may also work as an investigator of the SARS-CoV.
All these drinks seem to be the end of SARS-CoV.
The natural animal search for SARS-CoV next revealed a close-wined coV clerk, which is called the Rhinolopus-SARS HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is in the Tikongkok race.
This cholera gives positive results of anti-SARS-CoV anti-SARS-CoV and the genom SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This CoV and the other coV club shares the nuclear homology 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
This Student became a fondation for the new concept that the bat was a drink for the new human patogen.
Some CoV similar-SARS (SL-CoV) are also identified from the bat, but only one, named WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
Enzym changer angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is known as SARS-CoV reseptor.
WIV1 of the samples of a bat is shown using ACE2 clubs, knobs, and humans as a reciper to enter the cell.
What's interesting, the serum SARS convalesen is able to drive WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most close ancestors with SARS-CoV in the bat, with a nuclear homology of 95%.
Out of its height of homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a direct SARS-CoV virus and clear is not a direct SARS-CoV reservoir.
Phlogenetic analysts group MERS-CoV into the same group as the CoV-HKU4 kelelawar and the CoV-HKU5 club.
CoV-HKU4 clerks and MERS-CoV use the same innovator, which is plugged in the 4-DP4 plumbing, as a viral entry route.
The RNA polimerase of RNA MERS-CoV's phylogenetis is much closer to its match in the celebrity-CoV that is identified from Europe and Africa.
Until now, no MERS-CoV has been found in a wild bat.
MERS-CoV and nearest relatives of the CoV-HKU25 club only share 87% of nuclear homology.
That's why the bat may not be MERS-CoV's live reservoir.
On the other hand, the study in the Middle East shows that Arab camels are producing the seropolyive results for the specific antibodies that have established MERS-CoV, the same as the original Eastern camel in some African countries.
MERS-CoV lives with the virus that is found in humans are isolated from the use of the Arabic camel's nasal, which further indicates that the camel is the real reservoir in which MERS-CoV is a visa.
It's also important to note that the massive virus bullets with symptoms that are usually lighter to the camel that is infected with MERS-CoV.
It needs to be recorded, the camel infected with the virus not only through the breathing route, but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of the virusal bullets from the kelelawar.
However, questions are still unsuccessful because many MERS cases are confirmed do not have a matter of contact with the camel before the compensation, the possibility of human-life transmission or transmission route is unknown that involves the unknown species of animals that brought MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96,2% nuclear homology with the RaTG13 Clelaar CoV that is isolated from Rhinolophus affinis club.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are too big to set up a parent relationship.
In other words, the bat may not be SARS-CoV-2 direct reservoirs, unless the close of the coV bat is found in later days.
Possibly, the animal of the SARS-CoV-2 is among the species of wild animals sold and killed at the Huan Sea Grosir Passar. Many cases of early COVID-19 associated with this market, which suggest the possibility of human-life transmission.
Some of the latest studies based on the metagenomik sector show that a small group of endangered mammals, known as the javanica trengiling (Manis), may also bring the former CoV beta-CoVs with SARS-CoV-2.
The new CoV Genom traingling is 85-92% of nuclear homology with SARS-CoV-2.
The CoV, however, was close to RaTG13 with the equation of 90% on the nucleus level.
Both are grouped into two subscriptions-born viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a repository (RBD) domain more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a total acid aquality 97,4%.
It's a bleak thing, RBD SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are far different, even though the homology level of the entire genom is higher.
The previous Student on the painful train also reported a contig virus detachment of the lungs sample, which was also related to SARS-CoV-2.
This student adopts a different procession method and manual composition to produce a genom of about 86,3% complete virus genoms.
We can't avoid the possibility of being traggling as one of the animals between SARS-CoV-2.
Yet, at this time there is no evidence that supports SARS-CoV-2 is directly from the traingling due to the difference between SARS-CoV-2 and between the X-CoV-crowds-SARS-CoV-2.
Besides, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even closer than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and the numerator-CoV-defense-SARS-CoV-2.
The path of evolutionary SARS-CoV-2 in the bats, trainglings, and other mammals still must be set.
Although the highest specimens of RBD are found between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV cradles-SARS-CoV-2 traingling, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 shares the highest homology at the level of the whole genom.
Too much speculation if it is said that the height of the equality between RBD beta-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 traingling and SARS-CoV-2 is moved by the elegant convergence evolution.
Hypotesis supports the combination between the clause-CoV-SARS-CoV-2 traingling and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As an evolutionary activist factor, a lot of combinations occur between beta-CoV.
The researchers have yet to decide the origin of SARS-CoV-2 zoonotics.
Besides the most potent HCoV, from HCoV-229E zootics, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1 have also been analyzed.
Phynetic evidence indicates that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have been from CoV clelawar, while HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1's mother virus has been found in a trap.
It was reported that the CoV celebra name ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) which was detected in the three-colored American Americans shows closeness with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E genetically interdependent with other CoV clerks, with the name Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which is detected in Ghana, with Camelidae is also expected to be a historical inn.
To make it clear, the current knowledge of the origin of the HCoV animal known in the picture 1 and Tabel 2.
Phlogenetic analysts have provided evidence of antarspecies HCoV transmission in history.
About 1890, when HCoV-OC43 crossed the species of cattle to infected humans, it was recorded that there was a respiratory infection pandemi.
The HCoV-229E transmission history is not very clear.
The colfa-CoV bat with HCoV-229E has been found.
Among the two, there's an alpa-CoV.
Some evidence supports the live virus transmission from a bat to humans.
First, humans, not alchemes, may be connected to the bats in the ecosystem together.
Humans, on the other hand, have strong contact with the alphabet.
Secondly, the hypertensional alfa-CoV with HCoV-229E has a variety of different and non-patogenics in the bats, while the alpa-CoV is causing breathing diseases on infected animals.
Last, the alkain alpa-CoV was not found in a feral animal.
That's why the alpa-CoV's relative-HCoV-229E of human beings can't be avoided.
The fact is, the bat is a direct source of human pathogenic virus, which includes the virus of rabies, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
For that reason, it's not too surprising that a bat may directly transmit the HCoV-229E to humans.
Other possible, while the celebratory alfa-CoV functions as a HCoV-229E gen, the alpathm and the Arab camel may function as an intermediate inn that transmits the virus to humans, exactly as the MERS-CoV case.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of antarspecies transmission from celebrity to Arab camels and from Arab camels to humans.
The origin of evolutionary MERS-CoV from the bat is known for the initial identity of the virus and is also strengthened by the subsequent discovery.
Clearly, the bat is a rich species of viruses for genetic fragmen antarspecies and antarspeies transmission.
Long age, colonies that are closely united, strong social interactions, and powerful flight skills, all are the conditions that support the bats to be the ideal virus.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the Arab camel for decades.
This virus has been adapted to a camel that has changed from the moon of the middle into a stable and natural reservoir.
MERS-CoV causes a very light disease and maintains a low-level mutation rate in this animal.
The transmission that sporadic to humans happens by chance and the human remains the end of MERS-CoV because the transmission is unfortunate.
Not like the role of a camel in MERS-CoV transmission, tragggling role, if any, in a different SARS-CoV transmission.
Especially, beta-CoV traingling is very potent in the trengling.
Engineering may be the end of the SARS-CoV-CoV relative, similar to that of the SARS-CoV case.
In the upcoming studi-studi, some possible SARS-CoV-2 antarspeies from animals to humans must be counted or separated.
First of all, the bats could be a reservoir for the SARS-CoV-2 relative virus that is almost identical with SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can share ecosystems with batteries through extinguishing or coal mines.
Secondly, the traingling could be one of the intermediate specimens for the newly entered SARS-CoV-2.
Humans get viruses through slaughters and the consumption of hunting meat.
Maybe, many mammals, which include pets, are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2.
Antibodies to pets and wild animals need to be done.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may happen in a third species that deals well with the bats or the mills.
The original search for the SARS-CoV-2 animals is still on.
Out of various kinds of animals, three main factors from the virus side are also important to make CoV cross the target of species.
First of all, the mutation rate is relatively high in RNA replica.
Compared with the single RNA virus, the rate of the CoV mutation rate can be considered "stop" to "height" with the average substitutional rate of ~10-4 per year per foundation, depending on the CoV adaptation fase to the new inn.
CoV has a reconstruction extraction, a demolition that produces a very high mutability, an anonymousity, or even inviability.
That's interesting, the nuclear analogy Remdesivir is known to press a CoV replica through the inhibition of this exoribuchulease and RNA-RNA-dependent polimerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV agents that will be tested in a clean test.
Even so, the CoV mutations are about a million times higher than the inflammation rate.
Besides, the faster is often high when CoV hasn't been adapted to the drink.
Compared with SARS-CoV with high mutation rates, SARS-CoV-2 speed is actually lower, setting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is possible, SARS-CoV-2 has adapted to other mammals.
Besides SARS-CoV-2, this also happens to MERS-CoV that has been adapted to the Arab camel.
Theoretically, small possibility that genetic damage will quickly make vaccines and antivirus agents against SARS-CoV-2 become irresponsible.
Second, the giant RNA genes in CoV give extra flexibility in genom modifications, for mutations and recomplications, to increase the probability of the antarspecies evolved, which increases to appear new CoV when the condition is appropriate.
This is supported by many of the open - reading processes and the protein functions replaced at the end of 3
Third, the CoV often altered the template randomly during the RNA replication through the "optional" mechanism.
In the inn which functions as a mixing transmission, the transmission of the camel occurs often during the RNA CoV transscription.
The complete RNA and highly homologic subgenetics can experience a recommification to form a new CoV.
Natural recombination philosophical evidence has been found on HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as on CoV animals such as SL-CoV kelelawar and CoV-HKU9 kelelawar.
Interactions of viruses in connection with transmission
In addition to the three factors mentioned above, intervening the virus with the pulp reciper is another major factor that affects the antarspeies transmission.
Here, the SARS-CoV recombination is considered a special example, which also shows positive selection evidence during the antarspeies transmission.
Based on analysts compared with human sARS-CoV isoV content and inflammation, SARS-CoV was expected to experience quick adaptation in various intestinals, especially with mutations on the RBD protein S.
Generally, the S CoV protein RBD interacts with the cell reciptor and intensively becomes the target of antibodies.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is the 318th symptom to the 510th of the S1 frragmen, which is integrated with the ACE2 people and its receptors as a viral road.
RBD SARS-CoV has the ability to recognize the ACE2 receptors of various animals, which include bats, mussels, mouses, and racist dogs, allowing antarspeies virus transmission.
In fact, only 6 amino acid receipts that are observed different between human viruses and staples at RBD and 4 of them are interrogating in the receptors' motivation to interact with the ACE2 reciper.
SARS-CoV has a K479N mutation and S487T in his RBD, which may increase the accuracy of the protein-independent interactions with the ACE2 reseptor.
In other words, two of these allo acid substitutions may be very important to adapt to the virus to humans.
It needs to be recorded that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cell reciper as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 protein units encompassing the protein union definitions of S with ACE2 humans.
In fact, a cryo-EM studi shows a human compatibility of ACE2 and the protein SSARS-CoV-2-10 to 20 times higher than the phenomena between ACE2 human and SARS-CoV protein.
The important thing to know is whether there's any other coreseptor that might be needed for SARS-CoV transmission.
That's interesting, HCoV-NL63 is also a set of ACE2, but with different parts on S.
There's a lot of other HCoV recipeers, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-teraced acid for HCoV-OC43.
These receipts may also be involved in the success of this CoV adaptation in humans after the antarspeies transmission of his animal inn.
In addition to the cell reciper, the end result of the HCoV antarspesies is also set up by dependency and other innovation factors.
The difference between human and natural reservoirs, such as bats, Arab camels, and rusty animals can be a barrier to the transmission of antarspeies.
HCoV must take over the incubation factor and compensate for salt limiting factors to succeed in the antarspecies transmission.
In this case, molecular engineers in the field of these important viruses are still to be identified and defined.
The layering of the entire genom is unsuitable to see the incest and limitation factor of SARS-CoV-2 using technologies CRISPR may be useful.
It's new HCoV: back to the start of the wabah
The CoV club uniform gave us a great opportunity to show him a new HCoV.
In this case, the coV of the club functions as a HCoV gen.
In addition, rapid mutations and genetic replications also stimulate HCoV evolution and function as two important steps in this process.
For example, a diagnosis or loss of new protein filtering genes are potentially denouncing the virus's intuition.
Among the proteins SARS-CoV, ORF8 is expected to play a vital role in human adaptation because the ORF8 ORF8 displacement virus has been discovered as a displacement of ORF8 protein.
SARS-CoV with a special feature of demolition of 29 nucleus was found in the strain that was isolated at the beginning of human epidemi.
This expulsion separates ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is expected to be a adaptive mutation that supports the inn.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with the genealogies of alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV, with a large number of smaller reconceptions identified in RNA polimerase dependent on RNA.
The replication location is also identified at nsp9, most of them nsp10, and some nsp14.
Similarly, the reconstruction of the genealogies shown took place in the MERS-CoV epidemi, which took place in the Arab camel in Saudi Arabia.
Besides SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the recommunications has also been observed on other HCoV places where HCoV has had a recommunications with other CoV animals in its non-struktural genes.
It must also be noted that the artificial selection can play a role in untrained changes on viral genes, most likely resulting from viral release from the pressure of the electoral, such as the immune system.
The example of this effect is that the ORF4 is complete in the strain of HCoV-229E prototypes due to the demolition of two nucleus.
While ORF4 is able to be observed on the bat virus and a camel that is connected with HCoV-229E, the alpaka-CoV shows the side of the single nucleus that has led to the eruption.
Last, the new HCoV evolution was also moved by the pressure of the electoral in its reservoir.
Easy or undetected gear detected during the CoV infected bat, which shows mutual adaptation between CoV and the wire.
It seems that the bats are properly adapted to the CoVs on an athological and physiology.
For example, a defect in the response of the proinflamation to the bat will lower the confiscated paology of CoV in efficiency.
In addition, natural killer cells activity on the bats are under pressure because of the regulations of the cell regulator of the natural killers of NKG2/CD94 and the level of composition molecules of the basic class I.
In addition, the high rate of reactive oxygen species (ROS) of high - level metabolic bats can press a CoV replication and affect the recurrence of exoribonuklease so that it can put pressure on the production of a very potent virus virus when it enters a new inflammatory.
The more potent CoV statistics may also develop through the recomplications, resulting in a processing of proteins or new protein fitures to adapt to the inn.
For that reason, it's not a coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two stages.
CoV is nonpatogenic or causes light movements in his reservoir, such as bats and camels.
CoV reacts strongly without triggering strong inconvenient reactions.
Here's the secret of the bearer and the cause of a serious case in human infection.
Especially because of overexcessive immune responses and synthetic storms, with more severe lung damage if the response of the shark becomes stronger.
Instead, on the bearer without delay, the reaction of the shark has been removed from the CoV replica.
The same strategy to decide the immunal responsibility may be useful in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
Particularly strong interferon responses on the bats.
For that reason, interferon type I, at least at the beginning of SARS-CoV infections to humans, should be useful.
Besides, the NLRP3 inflammatory inflammation in the broom is defective.
For this reason, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the custody of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 follows the general stream of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While the beta-CoV squad that shares 95% nuclear homology with SARS-CoV has been found, there are also the CoV celebrants that share 96% nucleus homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Even though the young and the other animals on the market were found carrying a viral that was identified with SARS-CoV, the interior for SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been found.
Beta-CoV traingling very homology with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, which indicates that traingling may be involved as one of the middle or betaV trainglings may provide a contribution of gen fragmen in the last version SARS-CoV-2.
Though still questioned, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was made by good people intentionally or unintentionally.
CoV returned to be the focus because of SARS-CoV-2 recent times.
The CoV Studi at the bat and the other animals have been very changing our perceptions about the importance of the origin of zoonotics and the reservation of animals for HCoV on human transmissions.
So much evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are from the bat and transmitted to humans through the middle inang.
Remembering that SARS-CoV infection comes from contacts between humans and stabbing in the wet market, perhaps the closing of the wet market and the murder of all the mushrooms in it that end the SARS epidemic effectively.
For the same reason, the traingling should be transferred from the wet market to prevent the zoonotic transmission, remembering the discovery of some line-CoV of migrants close to SARS-CoV-2.
However, the truth and mechanism SARS-CoV-2 are transmitted to humans through migrants and other mammals still need to be defined in research at the coming time.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been in the Arab camel for a long time.
This element functions as an important transport tool and as a primary source for meat, milk, skin, and wol for local society.
Arab Unta spread across the Middle East and Africa.
That's why, we can't kill all the camels to control MERS, as it was done at the wild animal market in China to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the MERS plague, the comrehensive approach must be done to develop vaccines for an effective camel against MERS-CoV and combined with other infection control measures.
Before we get rid of this virus, the new genotipe can appear and cause the plague.
There's a lot of zootic CoV moving in the wild.
In particular, the coV bats have a very variety of zoonotics.
There's a lot of possibilities for this zootic CoV to revolve and experience a reproduction, which leads to the new CoV that is more easily transmitted and/or more deadly for humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some areas in China has to be abandoned to reduce contacts that are not necessary between humans and animals.
With the hard experiences of SARS, MERS, and COVID-19, a better deal and a better discussion plan should be applied.
Actually, there have been many viruses on this planet since ancient times.
These viruses are in his natural reservation until there's a chance to preach.
Although the bat has many characteristics that support the spread of the virus, the opportunity for humans to interact with flexibility and other wildlife can be minimized if people are entrusted to the protection of wild animals.
Surveys on mammals need to be done more to understand the CoV ecosystem and its natural inn, which will prove useful in preventing the transmission of animals and impending plague.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the virus zoonosis is that humans must keep the distance from the ecosystem reservoir of the natural zoonotic virus.
Some of the original puzzles of the SARS-CoV-2 zoonotics haven't been found yet.
First of all, if the bat transmits the SARS-CoV-2 primitive virus to the mill, the condition of the bats and traingling that shares the ecosystem is important to be known.
Second, if a bat has a more direct role in transmission to humans, the way humans deal with the bats must be determined.
Third, if there is a third mammal that is involved as a real innovation, the way the mammal interacts with other species, which include humans, bats, and trenglings should be refined.
Finally, because many mammals, including pets that may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, are good experimental infections and surveillances must be done.
Some of the flexibility, miggling, or other mammals, is expected that the SARS-CoV-2 or the almost identical virus can be identified in its natural interior at the coming time.
Extensive research in this field will list the evolutionary network SARS-CoV-2 in the animal, with an important implication in the precaution and control of FOID-19 on humans.
Diagnostic diagnostic criteria "surprised" and "confirmed case" COVID-19 need to be done
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guide for diagnosis and new colonial infection 2019 (9-nCoV).
However, chronological disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are increasing on the basis of the discovery of research that is taking place and the classic experience; therefore, diagnosis and sustaination strategy are also being updated.
In this letter, we answered one comment on our guide and prepared the latest diagnostic criteria for "surprising suspects" and "susus confirmed" based on the Diagnosis Guide and Conquest for COID-19 (seventh-version) published by the People's National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
On December 2019, the new colonies 2019 (2019-nCoV) had caused wabah, which is now formally called coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was given the name of a coronavirus's weighty acceleration syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On March 11, 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemi.
To fight SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team develops a quick guide and the guide has been published online at the Medical Research Military on February 6, 2020.
That guidance has been of great interest ever since it was published.
However, it is necessary to note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge increases based on the discovery of research that is taking place and the classic experience; therefore, diagnosis and development strategy are also being updated.
For example, the Diagnostic and Relief Guide for COVID-19 published by the Republican National Health Committee of the People of China (http://www.nc.gn/), between January 16 2020 and 3 March 2020, this commission has brought out the total seven editions with some context has been changed quite much.
Our guide received comments from Zhou et al, and they introduced the simple presentations based on their clean experience.
Their work has added new evidence for our guidance and has become a valuable reference to this pandemic around the world.
We supported their significant results and expressed our gratitude for them.
However, their results also need to be updated on the Diagnosis Guide and Development for the latest COVID-19 (the seventh test) and the latest studi.
Based on the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case requires a combination of one of the epidemic rites of epidemics with two clinical manifestations to make a complex analysis, or a three-definite hygiene exhibition if there is no clear epidemic:
Epidemicics: (1) travel and live in Wuhan city and its surrounding areas, or other communities have been reported in the last 14 days before COID-19 cases; (2) the history of the case of ularing SARS-CoV-2 (with a test of positive nucleus acid); (3) a series of contacts with patients suffering demam or respiratory symptoms from Wultan and its surrounding areas has been reported in the last 14 days before the scenes; (4) by a series of conclusive cases (e.g. 2/g. and in two weeks, in small offices, as in a classrooms].
Manifestation of the clean: (1) fever and/or respiratory processes; (2) CVID-19 infection features; (3) total count of white blood cells indicates normal limfosit counting, dropping, or lower at the initial level.
Dignified cases should be based on a suspected case with one of the proofs of patogenic or serials as follows: (1) test PCR real-time positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a coalition of the entire virus genom shows high homogencies for the new colony known; (3) positive for IgM antibodies and antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in a test; or a change of Iggg specific-SARSCoV-2 from negatively negatively, or an increases the currency of comprection on my fase.
We can see that PCR's real-time nuclear test in a breathing channel or blood sample was added to the second edition (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020).
Patogenic detection of blood samples was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020); then the serial evidence was added to the seventh edition.
This modification is based on a continuous study of researchers to find an optimal nucleus acid detection kit to diagnose quickly, and samples from the pipes including blood transfusions, which increases the supply of various specimens, and supports the use of certain positive antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that reminds us to take care of the patient with thin and unfamiliar symptoms.
For that reason, Zhou's lily bags are al. They have to be updated because they classify people without the conditional cycle as "subordinates".
The score system also needs to be verified in practice and classics in the coming time.
As a closing note, we hoped that more evidence would appear and that the reader would ask us to comment.
For diagnosis of "surpriseds" and "susus confirmed," we suggest to follow and follow the latest guide in each country.
Our team will also update our guidance from time to time as a help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest mass death
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths by COVID-19 that day.
It's the highest death number in the day that the virus ends.
Until yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) Bangladesh reported the number of cases of infection recorded including 114 active cases and 33 health cases that stayed at home.
It's recorded in total 17 deaths.
In a rumor report, director IEDCR, Dr Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that death covers four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases are over 60 years old, two cases between 51 and 60, and one case between 41-50 years.
He also said that two victims were from Dhaka.
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said COID-19 as a pandemi.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news office, that one who died was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Office of the Bengali Anti Korupsion, who was cared for at the Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a video announcement from, the Minister of Transportation and Bridge, Obaidul Quader said the general transport would be halted longer than the recruited, until Saturday comes.
This public transport stop has begun since March 26 and planned to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transportation of tree needs -- medicine, fuel, and food -- is still allowed.
The first COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh was on March 8, on two people who had just returned from Italy as well as one of them.
On March 19, the three men recovered from the fever.
SARS-CoV-2 infection exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of viral infection cases are SARS-CoV-2 over one million worldwide, according to the data Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand deaths associated with COVID-19, a disease caused by the corona virus.
The point came on the same day when Malawi confirmed its first colon virus infection and Zambia had its first death related to the corona virus.
North Korea claims, on Thursday, that the country is one of the few countries that remain free of the colon virus infection.
Until yesterday, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported 1.051.635 cases confirmed, including 79.332 cases in twenty-four hours since 10pm in Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244 thousand cases of colon viruses have been reported, resulting in at least 5.900 deaths.
The CBS news office reported, which quotes the Johns Hopkins University data, there are more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. that are caused by a colon virus infection.
Throughout the world, the countries announce a more severe action to slow down the spread of disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the region until May 1.
Nationally, President Vladimir Putin said that Russian citizens would be paid without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament took a sound to extend the status of national emergency for 15 days; the acquisition of the sound escaped with 215 voices of support, ten votes, and a voice declined.
Saudis have spent the nights in the sanctuary of Mekkah and Madinah until all day; before, that night was only between 3 p.m. and 6 in the morning.
Thailand's planning to apply at night between 10 o'clock and 4 in the morning.
Governor Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the country had extended the order to stay at home until May 1.
The statistics in Australia are dropping the bathing of the toilet for transactions.
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, the Australia Woolworth and Coles shop networks each lowered the limit of toilet tisu transactions to two and one of the transactions in all the stores on the national level.
ALDI also applied the rule of one sir, on Monday.
This border is announced as a message in the sand and on his network's Facebook page.
The buyer reported on the preparation for the fear of COVID-19 if the public should do self-collution.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also blocked the bathing of the toilet for delivery to the house to a pack of orders.
This change followed the boundaries of four paks per transactions that had previously been applied to Woolworths and Coles each on 4 and 5 March.
In his press statement on March 8, Coles reported that with the four-minute bordering, "many stores still run out in an hour since the delivery", and mentioning the request "it has never happened before", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, calls it "unbelievable".
The sale of "reduced" last week, according to one of the Woolworths speakers.
Costco store in Canberra also exceeded the amount allowed until two weeks ago.
To avoid misfortune, Coles ordered amassing greater than the monitors and enhanced delivery frequencies, Wolworths ordered extra preparations, while ALDI made preparations for special Rabu promotions available earlier.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of Australia’s Peritel Assistant Assistant Assistant, said that the intel tried to improve the preparation, but local government's rules for truck delivery time made it difficult.
It replaces production costs, while the monitor is trying to meet the demands, and a little more specific promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that since he had removed the preparations earlier, some stores could not hold a special Wednesday.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a specialist at the Queensland University of Technology, said that the store filled a table every night.
He stresses that the toilet tissue is a large volume thing that makes it low and, if it's sold, makes a lot of empty space in the raccous to the extent that the air is becoming more fragile.
Coles and Woolworths agree [that] if there's a lot of goods on the rack, if products like toilet sauces and a distributor can be [belief] in large numbers, fear may be reduced, Russel Zimmerman rain through the ABC News Office.
Who Gives a Crap's kitchen toilet producer said on Wednesday's past day that they're running out of preparation.
Kimberly-Clark, who made Tisu Toilet Kleenex, and Solaris Paper, who made Sorbent, stressed them working 24/7 to keep the heat, according to the News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real station site, reports that some property sellers offer free toilet tisu to the first midwive in Melbourne, when a little more smuggling is held because the buyer takes a pack for a long weekend.
The NT News Week edition, a day printed in Darwin, includes eight separate pages that are intended to be cut and used as toilet tissue.
ABC Australia reports on March 3, they said that they were not planning to apply the costs.
Russell Zimmerman added that another product is also in high demand, including masks, hygiene, dry food, soap, and flour.
In the same way outside of Australia, on Sunday supermarket from the English Ocado was observed across the Andres toilet purchases to two sirs containing 12 scrolls.
World Health Organization (WHO) states COID-19 as pandemi
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) said the COID-19 plague that was happening—a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus—is a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemi" only triggers how large a disease has spread, not how dangerous the case is, WHO notes the need to motivate the government to act:
All countries can still change this pandemi journey.
If the country detects, tests, handles, evacuates, and monopolizes its people as responses, the rain Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO General Director.
We were very careful because of the high level of preaching and the fearsomeness and the shortness of action.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Control Center and Prevention of U.S. Diseases, this pandemic "has never happened before."
He says, in a record published by CNN in February, "except influenza, there is no breathing virus that has ever been trampled from its fate to the global preaching of the coming world."
Ghebreyesus expresses a similar view, saying "We have never seen a pandemi triggered by koronavirus."
It goes on, "and we've never seen a pandemi that can be handled at the same time."
The new status of the pandemic followed WHO’s decision in January that claimed this plague to be an emergency for the world’s divided state.
Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious American Disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said about this plague, "then, this plague will break down."
Until Thursday, Associated Press reported that there were at least 126000 COVID-19 cases around the world, which resulted in more than 4.600 deaths.
The coronavirus Pandemi 2019-2020 is a coronavirus disease pandemi 2019 (COVID-19) that is on the move and caused by a coronavirus respiratory sync 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Wabah is identified in Wuhan, China, on December 2019, as an Occupation of the World Health on January 30, 2020, and is referred to as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.
Up to 10 April 2020, about 1,61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in some 97.000 deaths.
Some 364000 people have recovered.
The death rate of cases is estimated 4% in China, while the rest of the world starts from 13,04% to 0,08% in the New Tuesday.
Common weather covers fever, rocky, and breathing.
Communication can cover pneumonia and acute syndrome.
Time has been running from the distance to the mass of the waves in general about five days, but it can be from two to four days.
There's no specific vaccine known or antivirus treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and passportive therapy. The preventive action recommended involves washing hands, shutting the mouth of the rock, keeping distances from others, and monitoring and self-decreasing for those expected to be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded to the practice of traveling, corridor, nighttime, devastation, and facility shutdown.
This Pandemi has caused a heavy global global social disorder, delay or abort in cultural, political, religious, national, and cultural, and vastly disparaging of items divided by panic purchases.
Schools and universities have been well closed on national and local levels in 193 countries, affecting some 99,4 percent of the world's education population.
The misinformation of this virus has spread out and there has been xenophobia incidents and discrimination against the Tionghoa people, people of the East and Southeast Asia and its descendants, and people from the area with a significant virus case.
The shortages of travel and heavy industries, air pollution and carbon emissions are down.
Health authorities in Wuhan, Tiongkok (the city of Hubei province), reported a claster pneumonia case with an unknown cause on December 31, 2019 and an investigation was done at the beginning of January 2020.
Those cases were mostly related to the Huan Sea Groir Passar and because it was supposed to have the origin of zoonotic origins.
The virus that causes the plague called SARS-CoV-2, the new virus was found and intercepted with the red coronavirus, the red coronavirus, and the SARS-CoV. The first person with the disease was later known to be sick on December 1 2019, and the man did not have a clear touch with the original market claster mentioned.
Among the first case claster reported on December 2019, two-likes were found to have a connection with the market.
On March 13, 2020, a report that has not yet been verified from the South China Morning Post estimates that a case that can be discussed on November 17, 2019, at a 55-year-old from the province of Hubei, is probably the first. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that, with a new case reported down in China, suddenly increased in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China have exceeded the number of new cases in Tiongkok for the first time.
There may be a number of unreported cases, especially among people with more lighter symptoms.
Up to 26 February, relatively a small number of cases reported among young people, with 19 - year - olds down to form 2,4% of the case around the world, the head of the British intelligence director, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60% English population needs to be infected before the failure of the group is possible.
The case triggers the number of people who have been tested COVID-19 and the results have been confirmed positive by the official protocol.
Until March 23, there has not been a country testing more than 3% of its population, and many countries have made official policy not to test people with lightly, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in Tiongkok, up to 23 January, was estimated 86% of the COVID-19 infections undetected, and that this undeniable infection is a source of infection for 79% of the documented cases.
An statistical analysis published on March 30 estimates that the number of infections in Italy is estimated to be greater than the case reported.
The initial estimate of the reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 is 1,4 to 2,4.
A study published by the U.S. Control Center and Prevention of Diseases concludes that the number is likely to be 5,7.
Most of the sufferers of COVID-19 heal.
For those who don't get well, time from 6 to 41 days, with the most common of 14 days.
Since 10 April 2020, about 97.000 deaths are associated with KOVID-19.
In China, up to 5 February, about 80% of deaths occur in the 60-year-old and 75% have health disorders already existed, which covers cardiovascular and diabetes. The official death due to FODI-19 pandemi is generally driving people who have given a positive test for COVID according to official protocols.
The actual mortality rate of COVID-19 may be much higher, remembering the official number would probably not include a person who died without being tested, for example, at home, in a nursing home, dsb.
Italian parsial data found that the number of death rates during the pandemic exceeded the official count of the death of COVID in four-5 cases.
A woman speaker for the Management Center and Prevention (CDC) U.S. admits, "We know [the number of announced deaths] are lower than the actual number", a statement imposed by non-ilient reports of too low calculations in the U.S..
The first death outside of Tinongkok occurred on February 1, in the Philippines, and the first death outside of Asia was in France on February 14.
Up to 28 February, outside of Tiongkok landing, more than a dozen deaths were recorded individually in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
Up to 13th of March, more than forty countries and territories have reported deaths on every continent, except Antarctica.
This number varies according to the region and within time, and is influenced by the number of tests, health care quality, maintenance options, time since the first plague, and population characters such as age, calculations, and general health.
According to statistics Johns Hopkins University, the average death on global cases is 6,0% (97.039/1.617.204) per 10 April 2020.
This number varies according to the region.
In China, the average death rate of the case dropped from 17,3% (for people by the cause of the 1-10 January 2020) became 0.7% (to people for symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other estimates encompass the mortality rate (CFR), which reflects a percentage of the infected person dying from certain diseases, and the mortality rate of infection (IFR), which allows a patient patient patient (diagnosis and not diagnosed) to die.
This statistic is not bound up in time and follows a certain population from infection to case resolution.
A number of academics have tried to count these numbers for certain populations.
Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine University of Oxford estimates the number of fatalities infections for the pandemic between 0.1% and 0,39%.
The top limit of this estimate is running with the result of the first random test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical statistical statistication that analyzes the effect of testing on CFR estimates.
WHO confirms that this pandemi can be controlled.
The size and end of this plague is not clear and may be different according to the location.
Maciej Boni from Penn State University states: "Not even controlled, the spread of the snake usually rises and then begins to drop when the disease runs out of its available inn.
But it's almost impossible to make a reasonable project right now about when it happens."
A medical adviser to the senior government of Tiongkok Zhong Nanshan believes that "the plague may end June" if the whole country can bemobilized to follow WHO's advice on the steps to stop the virus.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine declared that SRS-CoV-2 "will continue to move, possibly for a year or two."
According to the Imperial College research led by Neil Ferguson, physical limitations and other steps will be needed "until vaccines are available (possibly 18 months or so)."
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University says, "I think it's a small possibility that this koronavirus, because it's so easily transmitted, can disappear the whole" and this disease "can be turned into a seasonal disease, which comes back every year."
Virulensi rehabilitation will depend on the thickness of the group and the level of mutation.
The COVID-19 key could be relatively unspecified and the people infected could be without symptoms.
Two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry rock (68%).
The less common symptoms cover fatigue, the production of respiratory sputum (flegma), the loss of hypertension, breathing, joint pain and muscles, stroke pain, headaches, cripples, breaks, hemothesis, diare, or siansis. WHO says that about one of the six people becomes seriously ill and suffers from respiratory problems.
The U.S. Control Center and Prevention of Disease (CDC) encompassing emergency symptoms of respiratory problems, stress or pain in the chest, shock, discomfort, walkback, and discomfort on the face and lips; medical attention is immediately recommended if these symptoms appear. The increase of disease can be a serious pneumonia, my breath, psychiatric syndrome, and the septic, and death.
Some people infected may be assimomatic, that is, without clinch, but with tests that confirm the infection, that is, researchers recommend that those who have contact with the infected person should be monitored and checked to make sure that they are not infected.
The Tionghoa people estimate that the asymtoma ratio is based from a few to 44%.
The inkubasi Periode (particularly between infection and gecko) is usually based between 1 to 14 days, most often 5 days. For example, the number of COVID-19 sufferers lost 30% injections, then down to 15%.
The details of the method of this disease are still being investigated.
The COVID-19 ministry is believed to be especially in close contact time and through a small droplet produced when rocking, cinema, or speaking; contacts close are contacts between 1 and 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Research found that uncovered rock can cause a droplet of 4,5 meters (15 feet) to 8,2 meters (27 feet).
Some researchers estimate that the virus may also be transmitted by a small droplet that lasts longer in the air and is produced while speaking.
Droplet can fall in the mouth or nose of the person who is near him or may be trapped into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intublation and re-examination of the lungs (RJP), can make the secretary turned into aerosol and spread through the air.
Preaching also occurs when a person touches a contaminated surface, including a skin, and then touches the eye, nose, and mouth.
Although there is some concern that the virus can spread through the feces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government hits the possibility of the SARS-CoV-2 fecal transmission.Virus's most contagious in the first three days after the violence, although the preaching may take place before the symptoms are visible and at a higher level of disease.
A person gives a positive test up to three days before the wave, which sends a transmission may take place before it is marked.
Only a small percentage of assimimate cases are confirmed by  laboratorium, but the assimimaticularization has been identified by some countries during the investigation of contact analysis.
The ECDC (ECDC) Center of Prevention and Prevention (ECDC) says that while it is not fully clear how easy this disease is to spread, one is generally infected by two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be infected up to three days on plastics and that the steel was 304, one day on the cards, and over four hours on the copper.
However, this variance depends on the heat and temperature, the pets and other animals have been tested positive COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although the British authority recommends to wash hands after contact with animals, such as after contact with the surface that may have been touched by people infected.
Coronavirus respiratory synthesis weight 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three pneumonia sufferers associated with a collaboration cases in Wuhan.
It's all a new feature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus associated with the coronavirus in nature.
Virus is estimated to have a zoonotic origin.
Genetics analysts reveal that geneticly eclipsed colonies with the genus Betacoronavirus, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (dear B descendants) along with two of the celebrates.
This virus has the equivalent of 96% in the whole genom level with the other coronavirus batCov RaTG13.
In February 2020, Tionghoa's researcher found that there was only one difference between acid amino in certain parts of the genom between the interior virus and the human virus.
Until now, the comparison of the whole genom finds the most significant is 92% of the genetic equation between the right-hand coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, not enough to prove that the elevator is the entries between SARS-CoV-2.
The virus's infection can be diagnosed while based on the gear, but confirmation is finally done through the back-up polimerase response (rRT-PCR) on the infected creats or the CT circulation process.
A research that compares the PCR with the CT in Wuhan shows that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, but less specific, with many specimens that are duplicated with pneumonia and other disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT can't be used for filtering or as a first line test in FOID-19 diagnosis."
WHO has published some RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, which was first passed on January 17.
Testing uses a polimerization chain response of the real-time transscription (rRT-PCR).
Testing can be done on breathing samples or blood.
The results are generally available in a few hours to a few days.
Generally, this test is done on the nasofaring fashion, but the use of the throat can also be used. A number of labs and companies are developing serial tests detecting antibodies.
By 6 April 2020, none of these serial tests has proved to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for its wide use.
In the U.S., the serial test developed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use, only by the specified lab.
The radiographic and tomography physicist classics are compressed (CT) to people who symtomaticly embrace the asimetri's asymmetri-per glass opacity and no pleura effects.
The Italian Radiological Society is introducing the international data database to find a detection in a confirmed case.
Because of a snout with other infections such as adenovirus, a specimen without confirmation of PCR has limited specificiency in identifying COVID-19.
A major research in China compares the results of CT with the PCR and shows that although there is little specificness for infection, speculation is faster and more sensitive until it is recommended to be considered as a filtering tool in the epidemi area.
The neural network of evolution based on artificial intelligence has been developed to detect viral physics with radiographic and CT.
The strategy for preventing this disease’s infection involves keeping good personal clean, washing hands, avoiding touching the eye, nose, or mouth before washing your hands, and wearing a tisa when casing or cinema and taking the stump directly to the trash.
People who may have been infected are advised to wear a surgeon mask in public places.
The physical limits are also recommended to prevent compulsive collisions.
However, the virus has reached the scope of the public ministry in most parts of the world.
This means that the virus has spread to society, and some members of the community do not know where or how they are infected.
The use of location data from phones by the government for this purpose has triggered a privation problem, by exiting statements from Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations that call for this sort of surveillance limit.
Various cellular applications have been implemented or proposed to be used voluntaryly, and on April 7, 2020, more than a third of the experts working privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record user distances to another cell phone.
Next, the user will receive a message if they're near someone who's tested positive for COVID-19. Tell the misconception of how to prevent infection; for example, dissipate the nose and betched with ineffective pharmaceutical medicine.
There's not yet a COVID-19 vaccine, although many organizations are working to develop it.
Washing your hands helped to prevent the spread of disease.
CDC recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands look dirty; and after washing the nose, rock, or gas.
This is an encouragement because, outside the human body, the virus is killed by the soap of a household that destroys its protective layer.
In addition, CDC recommends the use of alcohol-based hand manipulation with a low amount of 60% alcohol content based on volume when soap and water are not available.
WHO advises people not to touch the eye, nose, or mouth before washing their hands.
The surface can be deactivated using a number of larut displays (in one minute a synthetic display for the flat surface), including etanol 62–71%, isopropanol 50–100%, hypoklorit natrium 0,1%, hydraid hydrogen 0,5%, and povidone-iodine 0,2–7,5%.
Another run, like benzalkonium chlorides and glufficine chlorhection, is less effective.
The CDC recommends that if there is a suspected case of COVID or confirmed in the public facility, such as a child’s office or child management, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, public areas, electronic equipment together with tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote control, and ATM machines used by the sufferer, must be synchronized.
The health organization recommends that people close their mouths and noses with a nail or use typhoon when rocking or cinnamon, and then remove the tissue immediately.
Blood masks are recommended for someone who may have been infected because using masks can block volumes and narrow distances of expiration droplet that spread as it speaks, filters, and rock.
WHO has issued instructions about the time and the use of masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a viologist at the University of Leeds, "The mask could reduce the tendency of people to touch the face with a poorly clean hands, which is a major source of transmission."Masker is also recommended to be used by someone who treats people who may suffer this disease.
WHO recommends the use of masks by healthy people only if they have high risks, such as the person who treats the sufferer COVID-19, although WHO also acknowledges that using masks can help prevent people from touching their faces.
Some countries have already begun to push the use of masks to members of the community.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends the use of non-medis face masks made of fabric. Typing specifically recommends the use of medical masks once used for healthy society, especially when nearing (1 meters) or less) with others.
Hong Kong recommends the use of blood masks when using public transportation or living in a large area.
Thailand’s health officer encouraged people to make teasings at home and wash them every day.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia forbade the public to go out of public places without wearing masks or covering nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam asked all its citizens to wear a mask when they went to a public place to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government required that everyone enter the campus to wear a mask.
Israel asked all his citizens to wear a mask when in public places.
Taiwan, which has produced ten million masks a day since mid- March, has made train passengers and urban buses wearing masks per April 1.
Panama recommends the use of facial masks every time out of the house, and recommends making of their own facial mask masks for those who cannot afford to buy a mask.
Face Masker is also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social boundaries (also called physical limitations) are an act of infection that is meant to slow down the spread of disease by minimal contact between individuals.
Social limitation methods cover coral reefs; travel limits; as well as high school closings, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, or expense centers.
People can apply social boundaries methods by staying at home, traveling, avoiding many areas, using greetings without contact, and keeping the physical distance from others.
Nowadays, many governments are arranging for or questioning social boundaries in the area that has been affected by plague.
The number of people gathered together recommended by the U.S. government bodies and health organizations is rapidly reduced, starting from 250 people (if unknownly the range of COVID-19 in a region) became 50 people, and then became 10 people.
On March 22, 2020, Germany prohibited meeting in a public area involving more than two people. Lansia and people with medical conditions have developed such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and the immune system that has a risk of serious disease and higher complications are recommended by CDC to any one of the homes that suffer from a deterioration on the level of society. At the end of March 2020, WHO and other health bodies began to replace the use of the term "perception" to be "physical limitations", to highlight that it is the purpose of reducing the condition of maintaining social integrity, social virtual or distance.
The use of the term "social boundaries" affects that people should completely isolate themselves and not encourage people to stay in touch with others by alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual guidance to be used during the pandemi period.
This recommendation includes the urge to have sex with only the person who lives with you and does not have the virus or the virus.
Resident isolation at home is recommended for those who are diagnosed suffer from COVID-19 and those who are expected to be infected.
The health body has issued detailed instructions for the proper self-production.
Canal instruction is the most strict release for people who include high-speed groups.
The person who may have been exposed to the COVID-19 sufferer and the people who recently traveled to the country or the region with the wideness of the COVID-19 preaching recommended to do a chain of dated 14 days from the possibility of the last show.
The Strategy in the control of the plague is conservation or supremacy, and mitigation.
Conservation is done at the early stage of the plague and aims to track and isolate the infected people and take other steps to control infection and vaccination intended to stop the spread of disease to the entire population.
When it's no longer possible to spread the disease, the next effort is to move to the level of mitigation: these steps are taken to slow down the preaching work and reduce its impact on the health and society's health systems.
Completion and mitigation actions can be performed at the same time.
Supreciation requires more extreme measures to reverse the pandidemi by reducing the number of basic reproduction to less than 1. Part of the transparency of the transmission of the disease is trying to lower the epidemi peak, which is known as the epidemi curva.
It lowers the risk of poverty in health care and spends more time on vaccine and medical development.
Investigation of nonscrupulous speech to deal with individual acts of self-defense, such as washing hands, wearing masks, and statistics; steps on the level of society that is intended for physical boundaries, such as closing school and cancelling mass meetings; social intervention to push acceptance and participation in such intervening; and steps in the environment, such as the cleansing of the surface. Other policies that are aiming to compensate the body of violence in Tiovancian areas, such as the whole city’s deterioration and the deterioration of the travels.
Other countries also apply various steps aimed at the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced local mass filters and cranes, and it gave reminders of people’s infectious movements.
Singapore gives financial support to the infected person who makes a personal ribbon and wears a large denda for someone who fails to do so.
Taiwan increased the production of facial masks and punishment for medical supplies. Simulation for Britain and the United States shows that mitigation (invocation, but does not stop the preaching of epidemi) and supression (returns epidemi growth) has a major challenge.
The optimal migration policy can reduce the height of the demand for health care to 2/3 and death to half, but it still leads to hundreds of thousands of deaths and poor health systems.
Supreciation can be chosen, but it needs to be protected while the virus is still moving in human populations (or until vaccine is available, if this is the first to achieve), because if not, theularation will run back quickly when the suprection measures are redefined.
The long-term Intervention to press the pandemi to bring on social and economic damage.
There's no specific antivirus treatment approved for COVID-19, but the development effort is being done, which includes a already available drug test.
Considering the drugs that are sold for freedom, drinking enough water, and resting can help to ease the symptoms.
Depending on the level of blindness, oxygen therapy, intravena inflammation, and breathing support may be necessary.
The use of steroids can worsen the patient's condition.
Some of those who were previously approved for the treatment of other virus diseases are being analyzed to be used in treating COVID-19.
WHO also says that some "traditional and home medicine" can reduce the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO says that improving capacity and adhering to health care for the needs of KOVID-19 patients is a basic step in responding to wabah.
ECDC and WHO regional European offices have issued instructions for hospitals and primary health services to transfer resources to various levels, including establishing laboratory services for the COVID-19 test, if possible to cancel elective procedures, separate and save positive patients COVID-19, and increase intensive care skills by training personnel and expanding the amount of ventilation and sleep.
There are various theories about the origin of the first case.
The first known coronavirus case could be traced to December 1, December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, Tiongkok.
In a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei increased dramatically.
These cases are mostly related to the Great Gross of the Huan Sea Food, which also sells animals alive, and one theory says that the virus comes from one of these types of animals; or, in other words, the virus has the origin of zoonotic origins. A pneumonia claster with an unknown cause died in December 26 and was handled by a doctor Zhang Jixian at the Hubei Capital Hospital, who informed the CDC Jianghan Wuhan on 27 December.
On December 30, a group of doctors at the Wuhan Center Hospital told their colleagues about "Coronavirus like SARS."
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were warned by the police for spreading false villages, and others, Ai Fen, were reproved by his authority for his warning.
The Wuhan Health Commission then issued a announcement to the public on December 31, and told WHO.

Testing laboratory for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the SARS-CoV-2 virus include the methods that detect the presence of the virus and that detects antibodies that are produced as responses to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects RNA colonvirus.
This test is specific and designed to detect the RNA virus SARS-CoV-2 alone.
This test is used to confirm new or active infections.
Antibodies detachable (serology) can be used for diagnosis and population surveys.
Testing antibodies show the number of people who are infected, including people who are too slow to report or who have no symptoms.
The mortality rate of disease and the degree of a group's innovation can be determined from this test.
Because of limited tests, until March 2020, there has not been a country with data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
Up to 23 March, no country has tested more than 3% of its population, and there's a big varieties in the number of tests that have been done in the countries.
This valve may also have affected significantly the number of cases reported to be fatality, which is most likely to be calculated too high in some countries.
Using the policy chain response of a real-time transscription (rRT-PCR), this test can be done on a filter of breath obtained with various methods, including filtering or sputum samples.
Generally, the results are available within a few hours to two days.
Tests of RT-PCR performed on a stroke can only be trusted in the first week of the disease.
In the end, the virus can disappear in the throat as long as it keeps changing in the lungs.
As an alternative, for a person who is tested injected in the second week, samples can be taken from a breath channel by using a tape or material released through a rock can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed in Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using a real-time transscription chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and formed at least 250,000 test tools to be distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The British Raya also developed a test on January 23, 2020. South Korea experiment Kogenebiotech develops an SARS-CoV-2 based PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) clipping on January 28, 2020.
This device searches the "E" genes of all colonies, and RdRp gene specific for SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI Group is one of the first firms to accept the authoritarian use of the Chinese National Administration Produk Media for the SARS-CoV-2 PCR. In the United States, the Center and PDC (CC) distribute the RT-P Creaturesctation of the RT-TCTMMMM-U-TTTTTMULLTMULTE-EE-EE-EEEE-19-199-CoV) to the Human Human Humanitarationalationalation.
One of the three genetic tests on the old versions of test gives the unbelievable results because of the error, and the number of tests at the CDC in Atlanta is limited; this results in at least 100 samples per day successfully processed throughout February 2020.
Testing using two components is considered unbelievable until February 28 2020, and just after that the state laboratory and local lab is allowed to perform the test.
The test was approved by the U.S. Office and Food Department based on U.S. U.S. U.S. U. commercial Laboratorium began to test at the beginning of March 2020.
On March 5th 2020, LbCorp announced the censorship of the COVID-19 test based on RT-PCR on national scale.
Similarly, Quest Diagnostics made the COVID-19 tests available nationally on March 9, 2020.
No statistical limit announced; collection and spesy processing must be done according to the CDC rule.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Research Center for Virology and VECTology.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Surveillance Service for Surveillance in Health Treatment. On March 12, March 2020, May Clinic reportedly developed a test to detect the COVID-19 infection. On March 13 2020, Roche Diagnostics received the approval of the FDA to test within 3,5 hours with high volumes so a machine could perform about 4.128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA released the authorization of emergency use (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories to test on the m2000 Abbott system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorization to Hologic, LbCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also accepted the EUA of FDA for a test that took about 45 minutes.
FDA has agreed to test using the nuclear acid technology that is not the PCR.
Since there is no need for a series of temperature cycles, this method can give positive results only in five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Now there are about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott changing to increase production until producing 50,000 tests per day. Tests that use antibodies that specifically bind nuclear protein (protein N) is being developed in Taiwan, with hopes can produce results in 15 to 20 minutes like a quick influenza test.
A documentary published in March 2020 concluded that "foto toxics have a small diagnostic value at the beginning of the stage, including some CT encounters [mothographic complications] may have been available before the carriage.
Special features on CT include a multilovelbar base-glass capacity whenteral with perifer distribution, asymmetri, and posterior.
Domination of subpleura, mad paving, and consolidation forms as a result of disease development.
In Wuhan, a study that compares PCR with CT at the current pandemi point indicates that CT is significantly more sensitive than the PCR, even though not specifically, with a number of speculation features of spectators pointing to pneumonia and other diseases.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended "CT can't be used for filtering or as a first line test in diagnosing COVID-19." In March 2020, CDC recommended PCR for early filtering.
Part of the immune response to infection is antibodies that include IgM and IgG.
This can be used to detect infections in individuals since about 7 days after the accident, to determine the immune to the disease, and in the population surveillance. Examination can be performed at the centre (CLT) or with a point-of-care test (PoCT).
The system of automatics with high results in many clinical labs will be able to perform this checking, but its precautions will depend on the production level for each system.
For CLT, it is common to use a perifer's blood species, although a series of specimens can be used to follow the immune response.
For PoCT, it's common to use a perifer's blood species that is obtained through a skin vault.
Unlike the PCR method, the process of extraction is not required before the test. On March 26, 2020, FDA mentioned 29 sources that provide information to the agency as necessary and that is now able to distribute their antibodies.
At the end of March 2020, the Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnosisstics and Epitope Diagnostics had only one test approved by FDA based on emergency use. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagstics and Epitope Diagnostics have won European consent for their test tool that can detect the IgG and IgA virus in the sample of blood.
The test capacity until a few hundred samples in a few hours, so it's much faster than a conventional PCR check on the RNA virus.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after the infection.
Hong Kong has set up a scheme for the suspected patient to live in the house, "departemen work will give the patient a specimen to," they're passing it, sending it back, and earning the test a few seconds later. NHS English announced that the NHS is working on a suspected case in the house to remove the risks of the patients if they come to the hospital or have to have to disable an ambulance if used. In a test for the case of CVAID-19, a profesional health will take the samples to use the proper pension.
On March 2, German National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said that Germans have a capacity of about 2,000 tests per day in road care and 10.700 tests were done in the previous week.
The costs are suspended by health insurance if the test is asked by the doctor.
According to President Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total of 160,000 tests per week.
On March 19, an architectural test was offered in several big cities.
On March 26, 2020, the number of tests done in Germany was unknown because only positive results were reported.
A first laboratory survey revealed that, totally, 483.295 samples have been tested until and including weeks 12/2020 and 33.491 samples (6,9%) are positive tests for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rambam's Hospital develop and test metode to test the samples of 64 patients together, by combining the samples and only testing further if the sample is found positive. In W, laboratorium labs comprising a thousand meters named "HuoV" (Wan language: Mandarin Commandarin scription, "Expression" in Feb20) opened by 20 million BBI, which could be more than 1.
With his construction being monitored by the BGI Wang Jian founder and spent five days, the calculations indicate that the case in Hubei could be 47% higher and the cost to the farming of the coral can double if this test capacity does not exist.
Laboratorium Wuhan was immediately followed by the Huo-Yan laboratory in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in total 12 cities throughout China.
For 4 March 2020, the total daily capacity is 50,000 tests per day. The script of multipleks open source released by Origami Assays can test as much as 1.222 patient samples for COVID-19 with only using 93 checks. this balanced design can be run in a small lab without needing robotic fluid.
Until March, the shortages and the shortages of reagens have been served as services for mass testing in the European Union, the Raya, and the United States.
Because of this, a number of researchers are trying to speculate the sample prototype protocols that involve the sample washing at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release the RNA genom for further tests. On March 31, the Arab Emirate is reported to do more colonial tests for the population of any country, and are ready to increase the number of tests to reach most of the population.
This is achieved through a combination of gradients and  laboratory fractions of the population rates of 42 and BGI (based on the emergency lab detection of "Huo-Yan" in China).
Built in 14 days, this lab is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests every day and is the first lab that has this scale outside China.
Various forms of testing highlighting various genetic components of koronavirus developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopts German recipes for the production of test tools sent to the countries with low income without the resources to develop itself.
The German Recipe was published on January 17, 2020; the protocol produced by the United States Disease Center was not available until January 28, to delay tests available in the U.S.., at the beginning of the plague, Tiongkok and the United States are in trouble with test tools; these two countries and Australia cannot provide enough tests to meet requests and recommendations for medical tests.
Rather, experts say that the vast testing campaign in South Korea has helped to reduce the preaching of the new colonies.
The testing capacity, most of the private sector, was built in a few years by the South Korean government.
On the 16th of March, the World Health Organization called for the rise of the testing program as the best way to slow down the rise of the KOVID-19 pand pandemic. High requests for testing because of the vast virus evangelization caused hundreds of thousands of tests waiting for expedition in the U.S. laboratory, and the preparation of the use and chemical rehearsal.
In March 2020, Tiongkok reported an accountability on their tests.
In the United States, the test tool developed by the CDC has "cacat"; then the government removes a deficiency that prevents the test of privates. Spain buys a test from the Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd company, but finds that it's not an actual.
The company explains that the wrong results may be the result of failure in collecting samples or using tests correctly.
The Spanish minister said that they would pull the equipment that brought the wrong results, and replace it with other tests provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the tests bought by the Czech Republic of China to give the wrong results.
The Prime Minister of Matovič recommends that this test be removed to the Danube River. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Forces says that Turkey's test tool bought from Tiongkok has a "high level of error" and they don't "use it. Inggris Raya bought 3,5 million tests from China, but in the beginning of April 2020, they announced that this test tool could not be used.
Tests, followed by the positive person's corridor and tracking people who were contacted with positive SARS-CoV-2, have a positive ending.
The researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the first location of deaths due to COVID-19 in Italy, took two finals of the entire population of over 3.400 people, with a distance of about 10 days.
About half of the positive people who are tested have no symptoms, and all the cases that have been discovered have been postponed.
With the limits of the trip to this community, new infections are set off at all.
With aggressive contact trackings, incoming limits, testing, and karantina, the 2020 colonial pandemic in Singapore is slower than other developed countries without extrem boundaries, such as the closing of the restaurant and the ritel company.
A lot of events were canceled, and Singapore suggested the people to stay at home on March 28, but the schools were reopened at the end of the holiday on March 23.
Some other countries also deal with pandemics with aggressive contacts, internal limitations, testing, and coral reefs, but with less aggressive regional corridors, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical studi found that countries that test more, relative to the number of deaths, have a higher rate of death rates, perhaps because these countries are more capable of detecting people who have a cold or without symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries without the capacity of testing, and national laboratory with limited experiences of COVID-19, send the first five positive COVID-19 samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16  laboratorium reference WHO for confirmation tests.
Of 16 reference works, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following bag, the column "%A positive test results" was influenced by the country's test policy.
The country that just testing people in the hospital will have %s positive results higher than the country that tests all its inhabitants, however they show either gender or not, with the same factor.
Cleaning hands, also called clean hands, is the act of cleaning a person’s hands that aims to remove shit, oil, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
To wash hands with soap consistent on certain "critis" all day long prevents many diseases, for example, diare and cholera, which are transmitted through fecal-oral routes.
People may also develop respiratory diseases, such as influenza or selesma, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, noses, or mouths.
Five moments of critical all day to wash your hands with soap are: before and after disposing of large water, after washing the ass of a child or changing a poke, before the child’s digestion, before eating and and after preparing meat, fish, or unggas.
If there is no water and soap, the hands can be cleaned with ashes. The World Health Organization recommends washing hands:
Before, when, and after preparing food.
Before and after treating the sick.
After changing a poke or cleaning the child that just used the toilet.
After cleaning the nose, clasps, or teasing.
After touching animals, animal food, or animal shit.
Medical hygiene triggers the hygiene practice that has to do with medical procedures.
Cleaning hands before giving medicine or medical treatment can prevent or reduce the spread of the disease.
The primary purpose of washing hands is to clean up the hands of patogens, viruses, or other microorganisms that cause disease and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important to those handling food or medical treatments, but it is also important for the public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including minimal preaching influenza, chronological virus, and other contagious diseases; preventing contagious diapers; reducing respiratory infections;
And reduce the mortality of the baby in the house.
The study conducted in 2013 shows that hygiene hygiene can increase the growth of the news.
In developing countries, the mortality rate of children caused by respiratory disease and diarrhea can be reduced by introduceing simple behavior changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate of the disease to nearly 50%.
An interview that encourages the washing of hands can reduce the diabetic case to about the other side; this interview can be done by preparing clean water in low - income areas.
48% of the diagnosis reduction can be linked to the washing of hands with soap. washing hands with soap is the only most effective and cheap way of preventing diare and infecting acceleration channels (ISPA), as a decent behavior performed at home, school, and society all over the world.
Pneumonia, which is the main ISPA, is the cause of the death of a child; this disease causes death to some 1,8 million children every year.
Diare and pneumonia kill almost 3,5 million children every year.
According to the UNICEF, to wash your hands with soap before eating and after using the toilet to be a primitive habit can save more lives than vaccines or any medical action, and to reduce the death of the diare to almost half of it and the death of a coal infections.
Hand washing is usually combined with other sanitation actions as part of a program of water, sanitation, and cleanliness (WASH).
Cleaning hands also protects itself from impetigo that is regulated by physical contact directly.
A small side effect that washes the hands is that hand washing is often done can cause skin damage to the skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that washing hands in excess can cause an obesity and side - sided skin condition, known as an exam or a handcraft, especially among health - care workers.
Touching hands is too often seen as one of the causes of obsessive-compressive disorders (OCD).
There are five moments of criticism all day when washing your hands with soap is important for reducing dysfunctions, that is, before and after using toilets, after washing the child's butts, before eating a child, before eating, and before cooking meat, fish, or ungrateful.
Another important time to apply the correct method of washing your hands is before and after taking care of the wound; after censoring, coughing, or blowing the nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, the level of washing hands with soap is still low.
A study on washing hands in 54 countries in 2015 found that 38,7% of the tanggas practice washing hands with soap. One study of 2014 showed that Saudi Arabia has the highest level with 97 percent; the United States is almost in the middle with 77 percent; and Tiongkok at the lowest level by 23 percent. Now some methodlogy of behavioral changes are available to increase the practice of washing hands with soap at kritis.
A program of Health Care applied to the Philippine Educational Department is an appropriate example of accelerated action to support children’s health and education.
Double-minute medicine supply, added by washing hands every day with soap and bounding teeth every day with fluoride, is the point of this national program.
The program has also been implemented in Indonesia.
Microorganism cleanups from skin are strengthened with soap or detergents into the water.
The main work of soap and deterrent is reducing the restraint for the breaks and increases the power of latitude.
The only water is an inexpensive skin cleaner because of fat and protein, which is an organic dirty component, is not easy to break into water.
Usually, fat cleaning and proteins are aided by sufficient streams of water.
Sabun densely, since it is the quality that can be used again, it may contain the bacteria that were obtained from the previous use.
A small number of studs that analyze bacterial transfers from well - contaminated tone concludes that migration cannot occur because of bacteria that are so heavily affected.
The CDC, however, continues to say "the liquid soap that it gets out of the bed without touching hands is more desirable."
The antibiotic soap is greatly encouraged to a healthy society.
Until now, there is no evidence that the use of antiseptics or synthetics recommended is better for organisms that survive antibiotics in nature.
However, antibiquity soap contains a general antibiotic agent such as the virus, which has a list of highly resistant organisms.
So, even if the antibiotic strain is not detected by anti-bakteria soap, this soap may not be visible.
In addition to surfing and skin protector, technological formulas can contain acids (astoms, acid acids, lactat acids) as managers of pH, the benzoat acid as active antimikroba, and more skin conditioner (aquarters, vitamins, mentols, mining, extracks). A complex analysis of the Oregon University Faculciency indicates that the averagebun is equally effective with the high levels of cancerous antimicromants that contain the disease that prevents from tearing the skin from the hand.
The warm water to wash your hands is not enough hot to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at the body temperature (37 °C).
The warmer water is more effective than well - watered in the elimination of natural oil that holds dirt and bacteria.
However, turning back with the confidence of many people, the scientific study shows that the use of warm water does not have the effect in reducing the number of microbes in the hands.
Handwitness or antiseptic hand is a waterless cleaner agent.
At the end of the 1990s and early 21st century, agent of hygiene is a waterless drinker (also called a sculptor, an antiseptic handbrush, or hand manipulator) became known.
Most of this hypertension agents are based on alcohol or etanols that are formulated along with a plant like Carbomer (mobile asphalt acid) intogels or with humektans like glycerin into fluids or so that they can easily be used and to reduce the effect that strengthens from alcohol.
The number of hydrogens in the encers increases the activity of antimicrobials, which contain at least 60-95% of alcohol is an efficient quantities killer.
Alcohol detection kills bacteria, bacteria that survive many drugs (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis bacteria, a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccininia, influenza, and hepatitis), and jamurs.
Alcohol analysis that contains 70% of alcohol kills 99,97% (local reduction 3,5, corresponds to a reduction of 35 decibels) bacteria in the hands of 30 seconds after cooking and 99% to 99,999% (a reduction of log 4 to 5) bacteria in the hands of 1 minutes after cooking. The most effective hand detection of bacteria and less effective to certain viruses.
The use of alcohol - based hand is almost entirely ineffective to the norovirus virus (or Norwalk), which is the most common cause of gastrogenics.
The front and the back of the two hands and at the intervals and the end of all the fingers are rubbed about 30 seconds to the liquid, the water, or the dry gel.
The fingerprints should also be properly washed by rubbing them on two arms.
To increase the use of abstinence agents because of the availability of the use and activity of quick murder against microorganisms; yet, the apparatus should not be used as a right hand washing changer, unless the soap and water are not available.
The use of alcohol-based handwashing can often cause dry skin, unless emolient and/or skin bombers are added to the formula.
The effect of reinforcing alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glyerin and/or another emolient to the formula.
In a clean test, alcohol - based hypertension that contains emolients causes a much lower irrigation and skin loss than soap and antimicrobial determinations.
Dermatitis of allergic contacts, contact ultimatum syndrome, or hypertensitivitas against alcohol or aditive substance in the alcohol - recruitr rarely occurs.
The lower tendency is to cause contact stimulants to develop into this product’s pulling force rather than washing hands with water and soap.
Although effective, non-air agents don't clean their hands from organic materials, but only affect them.
For this reason, the cleaner does not seefectional soap and water in preventing many patogens from preaching because the patogen is still in hand.
The effectiveness of free hands depends very much on its materials and formulas, and historically, this product is significantly worse than alcohol and alcohol abuser.
Recently, formulas that use benzalconium klorida have proved to have an ongoing antimicrobial activity and kumulative after the clothes, not like alcohol, which has been less effective after repeated use, perhaps because of progresive side effects.
Many people in low - income communities are unable to buy soap and use dust or soil as a replacement.
Abu or soil may be more effective than water, but less effective than soap.
One of the concerns is, if infected with microorganisms, soil or ashes may increase the spread of the disease to reduce it.
Like soap, ash is also a desinfection agent because, if it is contacted with water, the ashes will form an alkalin pipe.
WHO recommends ashes and sand as alternative soap when soap is not available.
Technically washing the right hands based on the U.S. Control Center recommends for diagnosis prevention includes the following steps:
Blow your hands with warm, cold water flowing.
Water flow is recommended because of the contamination of the baskom, while the temperature seems to have no effect.
Make your hands by rubbing it with a lot of soap, including the back of your hands, the fingers, and the bottom of my nails.
The soap lifts up a potato from the skin, and the study shows that people tend to wash their hands more closely when using soap than when using water alone.
Go tomorrow for at least 20 seconds.
Cruelizing the chimney, which helps to remove the guts from the skin, and squeezes more time to disappear more guts.
The floor is equally under the water flowing.
Keeping in the bus can make the hands contaminated back.
Slow with dry laps or let it dry in the air.
The weak hands and valleys are more easily contaminated.
The cotton and cotton cotton can keep microorganisms.
Flowing losions are often recommended to keep the hand from dry; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
Multiple low costs can be made to wash your hands when the water is empty and/or soap is not available, for example, flowing water from the studded jerigen or bottles and/or using ashes, if necessary, in the developing country. In the situation when water is restricted (like school or rural areas in the developing country), there are water solutions, such as "ppy-top" and other low-scurrency options.
The tippy tippy is a simple technology that uses water bottles that hang with ropes, torches operated by the feet to pour a little water into the hands, and a soap.
Effective handwriting is an important part of the process of hygiene, but there is a debate about the most effective form of hygiene in the public toilet.
The more research indicates that the laps of paper are much cleaner than the power of electricity found in many toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by Westminster University, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium paper industry, to compare the level of hypertension of paper, warm air - arm energy, and a more modern jet airpower.
After washing and cutting hands with warm air, total total bacteria found up to 194% in the fingerbooks and 254% on the palm.
Blind with jet power causes a total of 42% bacteriums in the handbooks and 15% on the handheld.
After washing and cutting hands with paper laps, the total amount of bacteria is averaged 76% in the fingerbooks and 77% on the palms. They also do a test to determine the potential of verification to the user of other toilets and the toilet environment of every kind of metode.
The jet airline, which evaporates the air from the unit with the speed claimed 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), can blow microorganisms from the hands and units and potentially poison the users and the toilet environment up to two feet [2 m].
The warm airpower use spreads microorganisms to 0.25 meters of energy.
In 2005, the study conducted by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt showed no sign of microorganismism.
After the thumb, the changes in the following bacteria are observed:
There are many handwrittens, and the strength of the hands has been compared to strength by using a pencil.
To wash your hands by using hand squirrel tissue is an alternative during the journey if there is no soap and water.
The alcohol-based handicap must have at least 60% of it.
The hygiene of the medicinal hands was prescribed long after Hungarian physics Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There is an electronic device that provides bait to remind hospital employees to wash their hands if they forget.
One study found that the rate of infection drops with the use of the device.
Medical hygiene is done for a minimum of 15 seconds, using soap and water in a number or gel to cover and rub every part of the hand.
Hands should be rubbed each other with the fingers of each other.
If there's a dirt under the nail, a hairmatic can be used to remove it.
Since kuman can survive in the water that is in the hand, hands need to be compatible and squeezed with a clean coat.
After the dry, the paper lap is used to shut down the water container (and open the door if necessary).
This action avoids the recording of the hand from the surface.
The purpose of washing hands in the health care department is to eliminate the microorganism of the patogen ("suppose") and avoid itsularity.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the shortage of washing hands is still on a level that cannot be accepted in most medical environments, with a large number of doctors and nurses still forget to wash their hands before touching patients to the point of transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that washing the right hand and the other simple procedures can lower the rate of blood flowing to the cathedral to 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a network that shows the standard of washing hands and scooping hands in health care sector.
WHO's hygiene concept guide can also be seen on its website for public comment.
The investigative investigation of Whitby et al.
Commerce devices can measure and balance the clean hands if it is needed to demonstrate obedience to the rules.
The World Health Organization has a "Secure Time" to wash your hands:
After being exposed to the blood/blood of the body
before the aseptic task, and
After the patient's treatment. The anticipating chemicals to soap (abon "current" or "antimicroba") are working to kill the hygiene.
The function of killing it may be desired before doing a surgeon or in a situation when an antibiotic-bearing organism is very common. To 'spick' hands before the surgery, it is necessary to pass and die without touching, clorheksidin or yodium, lap steril spray to strengthen the hands after washing, and steril to rub and other steril instrums to clean under my wings.
All jewels must be released.
This procedure paid to wash the hands and arms down to the elbow, usually 2–6 minutes.
Long config time (10 minutes) is not required.
When water is sprayed, water at the bottom of the arm must be prevented from flowing back into the hand.
After washing your hands, the hands were thumbed with a shelf cloth and a tongue coat.
To reduce the quantities of the courier, it is better to wash our hands or to use hand - to - hand hygiene before and after handling illnesses.
For the control of stafilokokus infection in the hospital, it was found that the greatest benefit of cleaning hands is from the first 20% washing, and that the additional benefits are very small when the hygiene of the washing of hands is increased above 35%.
Smoothing with the usual soap causes more than three times the increase in infection rates to food than washing the antibakteria. Comparison between tearing hands with alcohol-bloods and washing hands with an antibakteric mass of 30 seconds in the media shows that the use of alcohol-based hands reduces the concentration of bacteria 26% more than the antibontery.
However, soap and water are more effective than the alcohol - based handcracker to reduce the influenza virus A H1N1 and the Clostridium difficile sporas from the hands. Intervension to increase the hygiene in the health - care network can involve education for stafs about washing hands, increases the supply of alcohol - based hand sculptures, and the licence written and licence to the staff.
More research is required to know the most effective intervening in various health care tools.
In developing countries, washing hands with soap is a way of making money to achieve good health and even good nutrients.
However, less of the water that can be relied upon, soap, or clean - hands facilities in the home, school, and workplace make it a target to reach the universal wash behavior as a challenge.
For example, in most parts of the rural area of Africa, handwritten baths near private toilets or public toilets are rarely available, even though there are options to make a cheap washing place.
In any case, low hygiene levels can also occur because of a habit that has grown up and not because of a lack of soap or water.
Moving and washing hands with soap can affect the decisions of policy, increase awareness of the benefits of washing hands, and result in changes in long - term popularity behavior.
To walk effective, monitoring and evaluation is required.
A systematic study of 70 studs found that an effective approach based on community values is to increase hygiene in LMIC, while a social marketing campaign is less effective. One of the examples of handcuffing in school is "Two Stars" by UNICEF that encourages school to take a simple step and be cheap to ensure that the siswa wash the hands with the soap, between other hypertensions.
When the minimum standard is achieved, school can move from one star to the last three stars.
Building a washing place can be part of the handcuffing campaign used to reduce the disease and death of a child.
Denied Sedunia Hands Day is another example of an increased awareness campaign that is trying to achieve the purpose of a change of behavior.
Some studs analyze the effectiveness of the cost of washing the hands over the whole country's growing in connection with the disabilities-adjusted Life Year (DALY) or the loss of the age of disease.
One survey showed that encouraging washing hands with soap is significantly more costs of intervening water and other sanitation.
It is important to wash hands for human health, especially for people in a vulnerable state, such as the mother of a newborn or a soldier who was injured in the hospital, first known in the mid - 19th century by two handwritten colporteurs: Hungaria Ignaz Semmelweis doctor working in Wina, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, a modern nurse in England.
At that time, many people still believe that infection is caused by the smell of the smell called miasma or the bad air.
In the 1980 ’ s, the disease transmitted through food and infection related to health care made the U.S. Disease Control Center more active pushing the cleanup of the hands as an important way to prevent the spread of infection.
The flu flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 increased awareness in many countries will be important to wash your hands with soap to protect yourself from those contagious diseases.
For example, a "technic washing the right hand" poster hung next to the handwheel wash in the public toilet as well as at the building hall and airport in Germany.
The expression "cleaning hands from" means saying that someone is responsible for something or is involved in something.
That statement came from the Bible in the book of Matthew when Pontius Pilate washed his hands in the decision to be crucified Jesus Christ, but it has become an expression widely used in the English community.
In Shakespeare's work, Macbeth, Lady Macbeth began to wash his hands continually to clean the imaginary nodes; actions that showed his guilt over the crime he had committed and that had persuaded his husband to do so.
It has also been known that, after remembering or meditating on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more frequently and tend to be more appreciative of the tools to wash their hands.
Moreover, the person who is left to wash his hands after that meditation has a smaller recession involved in a "moving", such as volunteering action.
The religion ordered the washing of hands for purity and symbolism. The washing of symbolic hands, which used water, but without soap to wash their hands, is a ritual washing hands in many religions, including Bahá'í'í', Hindus, be careful and sophisticated in Jews, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam.
Hindu, Jewish, and Muslim religions pay clean hands after using toilets.
In addition, Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Muslims have washed their hands before and after eating.
Dangerous job operation for COVID-19
The endangerment of work for COVID-19 is a procession of safety methodslogy and the health of the job for risk control of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper risk management in the workplace depends on the job location and job job, based on the risk of the display source, the level of the disease in the society, and the risk factors of each worker that may be vulnerable to the FOID-19.
According to the U.S. Security and Health Administration (OSHA), the job risking a low view has minimal contact with the public and other colleagues; for this work, it is suggested that the basic infectional measures, which include washing hands, pushing the workers to stay in the house when sick, breathing ethics, and doing cleaning and maintaining the environment regularly.
The risks of displays include a job that requires close contact or often with people who are unknown or expected to suffer COVID-19, but may have been infected by the spread of society or international travel.
This group includes workers who have contact with the general community, such as at school, work environment with high population density, and high - volume ritels.
The danger control for this group, besides the measures of the basic infection infection, includes ventilation using high-sighted air networks, protector to filters, and provide a protective tool when meeting the FOVID-19 sufferers.
OSHA considers the health energy and the body room that is exposed to people who are known or expected to suffer from KOVID-19 high-shows, which rises to be very high-shown if workers do the aerosol production procedure on, or take or handle the specimens from, the person who is known or expected to suffer KOVID-19.
Proper hazards for this worker include technical control, such as negative-determined ventilation space, and self - protection tools that fit the task.
The CVID-19 scene can have some effects at work.
Workers may not come to work because of illness, need to take care of others, or because they are afraid of the possibility of display.
Trade patterns can change, well in the kind of things that are requested and how to get these items (as if it's shopping out of the clock, through shipping, or lantern).
In the end, the shipping of items from the most affected geographic regions of COVID-19 can be disrupted. the security and infectional plans can be used to drive a protective action.
Plans consider the risk level associated with various jobs and jobs, including the resources of displays, the risk factors that arise from the house and the community, as well as the risk factors of each worker, such as old age or cronic conditions.
The article also discusses what control is needed to overcome the risk and an emergency plan for situations that might arise as a result of the accident.
Prejudice and neural disorder plans may be subject to national or subsistence recommendations.
The purpose of the problem of the plague includes reducing theularity between staffs, protecting those who risk higher for poor health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing the negative effects on other entities in the consolidation chain.
The rate of disease rates in the business community is affecting the struggles taken.
The hierarchy of danger is a work frame that is widely used in safety and work health to combine dangerous controls based on its effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective control is technical control, followed by administrative control, and the last self-defense tool.
Technical operations are encompassing employees from the risks associated with work without having to rely on work and can be the most expensive solution to apply.
Administration is a change in policy or employment procedures that require work or workers.
Self - protection tool (APD) is considered less effective than technical and administrative control, but can help prevent some displays.
All kinds of APD should be selected based on the danger of the workers, installed correctly as it happens (miss, respirators), used consistently and true, checked, treated, and replaced, as often as necessary, and removed, cleaned, and kept right or dumped to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Security and Health Administration (OSHA), the underlying job of the display has minimal contact with the public and other colleagues.
Skills of basic infection recommended for all jobs include washing hands together, pushing workers to stay in the house with the sick, ethics to cover rockk and filter, to prepare spaces and wailings, to prepare work from distances or shifts in time to reach/reparate, if necessary, to tell the workers not to use tools and other people's equipment, and to clean up and filter the routine environment.
Prompt recognition and inflammation of potential individuals is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others at work.
The U.S. Control Center and CDC (CDC) recommends that employees who have flexibility symptoms have to stay in the house until they are free from fever, fever signs, and other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using other demam treatments or recycling drugs, and so that the office is allowed to stay at home to care for the sick member of the family, and that the employee may know this.
According to OSHA, job risking display involves a job that requires close contact or often in six feet (1.8 meters) with an unknown or expected to suffer COVID-19, but it may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of a gradation in the community around the business location, or because someone just makes an international trip to the location with the widen CVID-19 ular.
The group includes workers who have contact with the general community, such as in school, working environment with high populations, and high-level pitfalls. Administrative for this group and high-shaped groups have been involved in building up high air filters, raising up the ventilation rates, placing the physic control of the filters such as the filtering of the filters, and installing the airline-thru for the apporients. Administrator for this group and group has a high-governmental bonding group that encourages the sick workers to live in the home, recepting the roofing with the roofing of social networks, creating the company's and reclappings, recepting the activity of the activity and networks.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person falls sick on a plane, the proper control to protect the workers and other passengers involves separating the sick from others 6 feet, pointing one of you into the cabin to take care of the sick, and offering a mask of faces to the sick person or asking him to shut the mouth and to the nose with the tissue when he was crawling or cinema.
You have to wear a medical glove at all when you treat a sick passenger or touch a body fluid or surface that has a concentrating potentially concentrating effect and maybe another safety tool if a sick passenger suffers from a fever, a constant spinal cord, or a breathing problem.
The sarungs and other items should be removed in the life-destruction bags, and the contamination of the surface should be cleaned and synchronized after them.
Ideas, further medical action is done in the people's cabin, away from the public preaching, for the school and child care facility, the CDC recommends a short-term closing to clear or infect if the infected person has ever been in the school building.
If there is a gradation in society at a minimal level until now, social boundaries strategy can be applied, which includes: canceling out field visits, meetings, and other large groups, such as physical education, sound order classes, or eating in the cafeteria, increases distance between tables, periods of time and recession, reduces the integration of nonsensial visitors, and use a separate health office for children with flulike symptoms.
If there's a high level in local society, alongside social boundaries, extending the closing of the school can be considered.
The law enforcement officer who must do contact with someone confirmed or suspected by COVID-19 was recommended to follow the same guidance as the emergency medical technology, including using a suitable self-defense tool.
If contacts occur close during the arrest, workers must clean up and disfigure belts and equipment before being used again by using a fireproof or filtering the home and following standard operation procedures to control and remove the container APD and to handle and wash the dirty clothes.
OSHA considers health energy and certain morgues to be at the risk of high or high - altitude displays.
The high - level job includes health care, support, laboratory, and medical transportation that is exposed to known patients or expected by COVID-19.
This work becomes very high risky display if the workers do aerosol's averaging procedure on, or take or handle the spesies from, known or expected by COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol production processes encompassing intublation, spinal procedures, bronkoskopi, some procedures and dental checkups, or invasive specimen catching.
The body room functions full of high displays covering the workers involved in preparing the body of the known or expected of the KOVID-19 cases at the time of death; this job becomes a very high risk of display if the workers perform an autopsy. Additional control for this risk group includes the space for the patient known or suspected by COVID-19, including when the aerosol prosedur is performed.
Special negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health - care and morbid care utensils.
The specimens should be handled with the prevention of Biology Security action 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the patient be separated into different waiting spaces based on their expected COID-19 case. Other APIDs, OSHA recommends respirators for people working 6 feet away from a known patient or suspected of SARS-CoV-2 infections, and people who are doing a procurement of aerosol.
In the United States, the N95 filter filter respirators approved by NIOSH or better should be used in written and comprehensive filtering programs that include comprehensive tests, training, and medical examinations.
The other type of respirators can provide greater protection and increase the security of the workers. WHO does not recommend the entire closed clothes or coverall because COVID-19 is a breathing disease and not transmitted through the body fluid.
WHO only recommends a surgeon mask for a screening officer at the point in.
For those who take breathing, nursing, or transporting KOVID-19 patients without aerosol procurement, WHO recommends a cancer, protector glasses, or shields, sheets, and gloves.
If aerosol producer procedures are performed, the surgeon mask is replaced with N95 or FFP2 respirators.
Remembering that the APD request is not enough around the world, WHO recommends minimizing the need for APD through remote medical services, physical restrictions such as the sight windows, with only people involved in the live care can enter the room with FOID-19 patients, using only the APD necessary for certain tasks, continue using the same respirator without removing it when treating patients with diagnosis, monitoring and manipulating the APD chain, and not pushing the use of mass for people without symptoms.

BARIS SUBJEK: [Covid-19] Reduce the burden and prepare for the future
YEAR BORN: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
SICENCE: CC0: No rights protected
We find ourselves in an unusual situation this month.
Epidemi COVID-19 is something that makes it clear to the universal human bond and the responsibility we have of each other.
We have never experienced the challenge, but we know that our best response depends on the form of empathy, cooperation, and the development of the global community, which is the heart of this organization.
The friendship and concern that we have witnessed among all fellow workers through e-mails, calls, and conversations is an amazing validation of a wonderful human being, which we're lucky enough, to work with them.
Gratitude and pride are not enough to call you fellow workers.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
They remind me how important it is for the present world to be able to access Wikipedia and how powerful this is a symbol of this vital resource to stay available as a barrier for everyone.
Your job allows this to happen, you don't know that this site keeps running, helps pay our partners, or helps keep our community security.
The world needs information provided for Wikipedia, especially now.
This is the moment when not just the work we do, but the way we do it, will make a significant impact on the world.
Since this mission is important and your role is in it, we'll make some adjustments in the way we work together, which will begin next week.
Adapting to our work and schedule
As Robyn mentioned earlier, teams met last night to discuss our approach and schedule for a few days and months to come.
In that conversation, we consider what we think is the right response to the challenges we face and the best way to keep the organization in its place.
We really want to get rid of the pressure and support our mission for a long time.
If you need to reduce the work schedule, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors, and contract workers:
Our day's hope is about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week, until more notices.
We don't set vacation days, if you can work more on normal hours, this mission needs you.
However, the world is unpredictable at this time, and you don’t know that you need to care for a loved one, buy a tree’s need, or go to a doctor, your welfare is our priority.
We don't monitor your work time.
If you're sick, don't work.
It shouldn't have been said, but we said it.
Cuti disease or PTO is not necessary, just tell your manager enough and help your team revise the calendar and schedule to make sure the primary jobs can be solved.
(If you are diagnosed positively suffering KOVID-19, please tell Bryan in T&C Ops so T&C can help with support and make sure your situation gets the proper attention of the management).
The collaborators whose wages based on the clock will be paid in full.
We've said it, and said it again, to respect our commitment to our contractors and staff in full hours.
Everyone pays for their normal work hours when it is normal.
This includes if you're sick and you can't work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use secular work as a means to convey stress to the world around us.
The work we do can be very satisfying, especially at such times.
Again, the most important thing is to take care of yourself.
Our request is that you communicate with your manager until we know what should be postponed and can take the right action.
Some jobs are considered scientific.
There's a couple of jobs to keep going.
SRE, SDM Operation, Confidence & Security, and Dana Delegation team, between others, do important work that may require extra support.
We'll start the process with all the departments to evaluate the purpose of the moment and move our focus to support the important thing for our mission.
There's a lot to do for all of us, we're just going to focus full on the most interesting project.
It's not gonna be all right now for the future.
We're not planning to "earnest work after the pandemi has passed.
You're not going to be expected to work hard to meet the unrealized end of time.
We realize that the situation has changed and will be trying to set a new target and a new time line if necessary.
What about the APP?
To adapt to the new reality and executing the day's work hours, we meant to adjust the timeline to implement the annual Article 2020-2021.
We mean to suggest a 2019-2020-long article that allows more time to make a budget so that employees can impose important jobs, care for themselves, and treatment of loved ones while remodeling their needs or wanting to work on schedule for a few weeks ahead.
The length of this timeline greatly reduces the load of work and the pressures of planning at this time in the entire organization.
We'll deliver our proposal to the next week's hall and will renew the delegation and the team on the next step after we got confirmation.
Thank you for the APP team for your leadership in this.
Status, display, and office cleaning
Last week, we were informed that one of our partners based on SF may have been exposed to the KOVID-19 virus.
However, because of much anxiety, we worked with an antivirus cleaner crew to disfigure all surfaces in San Francisco's office.
They use an antivirus irrational fluid to affect every surface, lobby, and all the lifts that access our floors.
The building is applying its own security protocol by using products that support the security of its renter.
We feel happy that the office will be ready to use when we decide to return.
Our DC office is in WeWork, which has distributed the COVID-19 protocol to us and all members of the staff based on the DC.
Starting last week, our DC office has moved to the remote work site full, a walk with the guidance distributed with San Francisco.
As some of our friends on NYC know, we're also talking about renting a location in Brooklyn.
This discussion is still continuing, but it may be delayed.
Some of our partners worked from a distance for the first time.
Our long-term partners realized that it might be necessary for adjustments and they wanted to give you advice:
It's a very long one or two hours of close duration.
If older sessions are needed, consider how to divide them into days.
Definition together clearly, make an agenda, and send out previous publications.
Make videos the default, using tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to adapt to collaboration and direct connections.
Show the leader to facilitate every meeting, someone to monitor the conversation for questions and to record a list of speakers, and someone to help make a close note (or perform a collaborative note).
Send emails to technical support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your well-being compensation to buy a little food.
Join with the channel #remoties in Slack to talk to fellows about the work shared
The SDM operation team is looking for web-based ergonomic guidance to support the increase in the distribution of work throughout the Yayasan.
Last week we asked all the recipients of the community's diagnosis to cancel a public event that Wikimedia had been introduced, such as Edit-a-thon, until WHO said the pandemi was over.
We let them know that we understand our request for abduction and other boundaries can make them unable to finish the procedure and that no one will be granted because it has to delay or decorate the target.
This next week we'll continue with an additional guide about Wikimania and regional community conferences and other themes.
Generally, the sentiments of the entire global community seem to be the grief of this disorder, but at the same time relieved of the explanation and ability to focus on its own community, Wikimedia and others.
In front, CRT is trying to prepare a page in Meta-Wiki to provide room for the community to monitor the scourge and follow our communication with them.
Stay connected during COVID-19 situation
We'll send the invitation to your calendar for the next Thursday, at 14:00 UTC/07: PT for special staff meeting.
We will use this time to distribute extra updates, answer your questions, and take time to communicate with each other.
We're in this situation together and we want to help as much as we can.
Meanwhile, you can continue to get information from this email and all the other FOID-19-related information in the Office Wiki.
CRT will continue to update this page and make sure all the information is available in one place.
We also try to keep regular communication with those who live in countries that are now markedly affected.
If you have a question about travel, events, primary work routes, or difficulties about liking, or anything else that might need help, do not hesitate to tell and work with CRT.
We're here to help provide support and to be a suitable connector.
If you have a secret or sensitive problem, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Global SDM Internasional Director.
None of these changes are seen as our work and our obligations.
Rather, this change is a confession that, at this time, our work and duty may need to be completed in a way that we have never done before.
These changes are the steps we can be sure of to support each other in this situation so that we can continue to work, provide the support we need to move, and give the world of the services they trust.
The work we planned before will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, this is the time to support each other and create a room for important work that will come in a few weeks and perhaps a few months ahead.
We need you all to make it, for that, we want you to take care of yourself and your family so you can work best when it is necessary.
Finally, please wash your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and other team members (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
b'Enzim changer angiotensin 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that sticks to the outer surface of the cell in the lungs, arteries, hearts, kidneys, and usus.
ACE2 has an activism opposite to the enzyme of the angiotensin (ACE), by reducing the number of angiotensin-I and increasing Angiotensin (1-7), which makes it the target of a drug that promises to treat cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also works as a point of entering into the cell for some koronavirus.
ACE2 human versions are often referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin is a metaloenzim source that lies on the surface of the endotel cells and other cells.
ACE2 Protein has a terminal-N-M2 baptist domain and acid transporter domain amino renal terminal-C collection.
ACE2 is a single type of passenger protein, with an enzymatically active domain displayed on the cell surface in the lungs and other networks.
The ACE2 extractive domain is separated from the transmitter domain of other enzims, known as sheddase, and the fastest protein that is produced is released into the bloodstream and is finally extracted into the urin.
ACE2 is in most organs: ACE2 sticks to the cell membrane especially the type of blood cells II, small usus enterosit, endotel cell artery and venom, and the odor muscle cells of artery in most organs.
The MRNA ACE2 expression is also found in a circular, striatum, hypothalamus, and brain bars.
The primary function of ACE2 is as a ACE expander.
ACE broke the hormone angiotensin I became the angiotensin II vasokonstriction.
Finally, ACE2 cuts the salt allo feniganny terminal carbokil from the Angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hyspised it as vasodilator (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Ile-His-OH).
ACE2 can also break a number of other baptisms including [des-Arg9] -bradikin, applein, neurotensin, dinorfin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also arranges the traffic traffic in the air traffic at allo netral SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembran protein, ACE2 works as the main entry point into the cell for some colonies, which include HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes COID-19).
More specific, the S1 protein binding on spike or SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface resulting endositosis and virus translocation and enzym into the endosom that lies in the cell.
This virus process also requires protein priming S by the protease serin TMPRSS2, whose hypertension is currently being investigated as a potential therapy. This factor makes people hypothesis that the ACE2 rate in cells may help to fight infections.
However, many professional and regulations society recommend continuing the ACE inhibitor and standard ARB therapy.
A systematic and metanalisis, published on July 11, 2012, found that "the use of ACE inhibitors has caused 34% of the pneumonia risks to signify."
Further, "the use of ACE inhibitor inhibitor also lowers the risk of pneumonia on patients with higher risks for pneumonia, especially the patient who suffers stroke and fails the heart.
The use of ACE's inhibitor is also linked to pneumonia-related mortality, although the result is less powerful than the entire pneumonia risk."
ACE2 human recordings are expected to be a new therapy for my lungs injury, and it seems to increase the hemodinamix and oxygen flow on pigs with the mist of aquatic aquatic aquatic.
The time of the rhACE2 on humans is about 10 hours with a 30-minute job in addition to the length of a 24-hour effect.
Some findings indicate that rhACE2 may be a drug that promises for patients with inlerance of the renin-angiotensin system inhibitor (inhibitor RAS) classic or disease with asiotensin II in a higher circulation of blood.
B'Application COVID-19 is an application designed for cellular software to help explore contacts to retrieve the colonial pande of 2019-20, which is a process of identifying people ("taking") that may have been contacted with infected people.
Many applications have been developed or proposed, receiving official government support in certain areas and yurisdictions.
Some frames to build contact tracking applications have been developed.
Privacy problems are questioned, especially related to the system based on the geographic location of the application user geography.
Alternatives that do not overrun privacy include the use of Bluetooth signals to record the user's dedication with another cell phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple together announced that they would integrate functionalities to support the Bluetooth-based application directly into the Android and IOS operating systems.
In China, the Tiongkok government, along with Alipay, has spread applications that allow citizens to check if they have contacted with the COVID-19 sufferers.
This application is used in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an application called TraceTogether is used.
This application is developed by the local community TI, written as an open source and will be delivered to the government. The North Macedonia launched "StopKorona!", a bluetooth-based application to track the display of the infected person and to respond quickly to health care options.
This application is developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and Health Care.
Until April 14th, 2020, the app is still waiting for Google Play Store and Apple App Store's approval.
On 12 April, the government stated that contact tracking applications are currently in advanced development stages and will be available to be distributed in a few weeks. Similar applications are planned in Ireland and in France ("StopCovid").
Australia and the New Society are considering applications based on the TraceTogether application Singaporean and BlueTrace protocols. Russia means to introduce the geofencing application for the diagnosed patients living in Moscow; this application is designed to make sure they don't leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security techniques at Cambridge University, mentions a number of practical problems that may occur in the application-based system, which includes false positive and probably less effective if the data taken from a limited application is limited to some population.
To deal with anxiety about the preaching of "coronavirus" apps that are misleading or dangerous, Apple set limits on the kind of organization that can add a coronavirus link to App Store, which is only for a "restrial" or a good reputation organization.
Google and Amazon apply similar limits.
Private supporters have expressed their concern about the mass surveillance implications using a colonvirus application, especially about the infrastructure made to deal with the colonvirus pandemic will be halted after the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement that appeals to this kind of survey.
This organization states eight requirements on government projects:
Surveys must be "just law, necessary, and professional";
the need for inspection and surveillance must have a sunset clause;
data usage must be limited for COVID-19 purposes;
security and data anonymity must be protected and protected by evidence;
digital surveillance should avoid the worse discrimination and marginalization;
Every piece of data with the third party should be defined in the law;
has to be protected from abuse and national rights to respond to abuse;
The participation means all "relevant interest" is required, which includes community health experts and group-in-lawed. Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) also releases a checklist.
The proposed Google/Apple article means to deal with the ongoing surveillance problem by erasing exploration mechanisms from the device operation system after no longer required.
Some countries use a network-based location tracking, and not an application, so that they remove the use of applications and skills to avoid tracking.
In Israel, net - based explorers were approved.
A networked solution that has access to the raw location data has the potential for a significant privation problem.
However, not all systems with central servers have to access private location data; a number of systems that protect privacy have been created and use the center server only for intercommunication (see parts below).
In South Korea, an applicationless system is used to track contacts.
To replace the use of specific applications, the system collects exploration information from various sources, includes cellular devices and card transaction data, and combines this information to produce information through text messages to the infected person.
In addition to using this information to warn of potential contacts, the government also makes the location information available for the public, things that are allowed with large changes in information privacy law after the MERS cracked on it in the country.
This information is available for the public through a number of applications and web sites. Countries like Germany consider using the system's fully-filled system that protects privacy.
Until April 6, 2020, the details have not been released.
Controversy preventive contact is a high-level concept, with a large number of research scripts beginning at least in 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than a third of the experts working privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), to record the user's status with another cell phone.
However, PEP-PT is a coordination effort that contains a synthesisized and detractive approach, and not a single protocol. Detective protocol includes the Speech Residents Protecting (DPPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Number (TCN, previously called Kontak, CEN), Protokol and Mechanism Sensive Privativesation to Resistance Disabilities (PACT), and others.
In this protocol, the personal data that can be identified never left the device, and all the tourists occur in the device.
Privacy group at MIT Media Lab develops SafePaths, platforms to use techniques that protect privacy when collecting and using locations or intersection data to track COVID-19 preaching.
This is based on a study of the white sheet "Apps Gone Rogue: Keeping Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" written in March 2020. Another similar paya is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technology and early is also established in the Media Lb MIT.
SafeTrace uses a safe device technology to allow users to share locations and sensible health data with other users and officers without sacrificing privacy of the data.
On 5 April 2020, the global TCN Koalisis was established by groups with the same approach on the basis and was a multinational protocol, with the purpose of reducing fragmentation and allowing global interactions for sculptures and warnings applications, which is a key factor in reaching large acceptance.
On April 9, 2020, Singaporean government announced that they had made the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government application as an open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, a company that controls the Android and IOS cellular platforms, announces an initiative to explore contact, which they claim will protect privacy, based on the combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and scripttography that protects privacy.
They also publish the general technological specification used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, this system is meant to be launched in three stages:
launching tool to allow the government to make an official copying application that protects privacy
The integration of this function directly to the IOS and Android Google and Apple plans to deal with the data and surveillance problem continue to redistribute the system through the operational update, then erase it in the same way after the threat has passed.
b'Reposisi drugs (also called a new destination, new profile, or new job on medicine or therapeutic treatment) is the use of a drug that has been approved for new treatment purposes, that is for disease or medical condition that differs from the original purpose of developing medicine.
This route is a scientific research route that is currently being done to develop a safe and effective COVID-19 treatment.
Other research leads include the development of COVID-19 vaccines and the transfluence of convalesen plasma. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 proteins that can be the target of drugs, each protein has several league sites.

virus vectors (Fase developer I and vaccine candidates: Canino Biologics, adenovirus vector 5)
As reported by CEPI scientist in April, the total of 115 vaccine candidates is in the early stage of development, with 78 confirmed as active (79, according to Milken Institute), and another 37 is announced, but with some public information available (he is considered in planning or planning).
Trying Fase I-I to test security and early immunity, usually done randomly, controlled plasebo, and in some locations, while determining a more effective dose.
Fase III test usually involves more participants, including control groups, and tests the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent disease, while monitoring the side effects on optimal doses.

B'Caronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a contagious disease caused by a coronavirus synthesis.
Common weather covers fever, rocky, and breathing.
Other symptoms can include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, throat pain, loss of hypertension, and stomach pain.
Time has been running from the distance to the mass of the waves in general about five days, but it can be from two to four days.
Even though most cases lead to lighter symptoms, some develop into the virus pneumonia and fail in the maze organs.
Up to 17 April 2020, over 2,24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153000 deaths.
These viruses have healed more than 568.000 people, especially when they occur close contacts, often through sprays or tiny droplets produced through rock, glass, or while speaking.
Even when breathing, droplet usually falls to the ground or to the surface and does not grow to a distance.
A person can also be infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touch the eye, nose, or mouth.
On the surface, this virus can last up to 72 hours.
This virus has been viral for the first three days after the wave, although the preaching may take place before the symptoms appear and after the next level of disease. The diagnostic method is with the reaction of the polimerase transscription chain in real-time (rRT-PCR) to the use of the nasofaring.
The use of masks is recommended for the expectant infected virus and the person who cares for it.
Recommendation of the use of masks by the general public differs; some authority recommends not to use masks, some recommend its use, and some others require its use.
Now, there's no vaccine or antivirus treatment for COVID-19.
Local disease transmissions have been recorded in almost every country in six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus can be without symptoms or have symptoms like flu, such as fever, rock, fatigue, and breathing.
Emergency cycles include breathing, pain, or strokes in a constant chest, confusion, hard to wake, and face or lips; medical relapses are readily recommended if these symptoms appear.
The upper breathing cycles, such as teasing, brushing, or diarrhea, can be found, but the results are rare.
The gastrointestinal gear, such as mual, municipal, and diare, dies in a whole percentage.
Some of the cases in early Tiongkok are only in the picture of the chest cruise and the stack.
To some people, disease can develop as a pneumonia, a failure to germ, and death.
It's called the incumbent time.
The time of incumbent for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who rush will experience symptoms in 11,5 days of infection. Reports show that not all people infected experience symptoms.
This innovative role of the bearer in the process is not fully known; however, the early evidence shows that they may be involved in the spread of disease.
Nowadays, the professionals of people who have not shown symptoms that are unknown and are being analyzed, with the Korean Disease Control Center (KCDC) report that 20% of all cases are confirmed without symptoms while being treated in the hospital.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include a case without symptoms in his day's case on April 1; from 166 infections on that day, 130 cases (78%) did not show symptoms at the time of trial.
Sputum and litter can carry viral loads in large scales.
Talk out loudly let go of more spice or droplet than normal talk.
A study in Singapore found that uncovered rock can cause droplets to push up to 1.5 meters (15 feet).
Although this virus is usually not transmitted through the air, the United States National Science Academy suggests that bioaerosol transmissions may occur and air collecters located in the hallway outside people's room produce positive samples for the RNA virus.
Some medical procedures, such as intublation and re-examination of the lungs (RJP), can make the breathing crag turned into aerosol and spread through the air.
Although there's some anxiety that the virus can spread through the feces, it's believed to be low.
The ECDC (ECDC) Prevention and Prevention Center (ECDC) says that while it is not fully clear how easily this disease spreads, one person usually has two to three others.
In particular, it was found that the virus could be detected for a day on a carton/cardus, up to three days on plastic and a heavy steel stick (AISI 304), and up to four hours on the fight 99%.
This varied, however, depending on the flexibility and temperatures.
Sabun and detergen are also effective if used properly; soap products paint the fat layers of virus protector, viral denial, and release them from skin and other surfaces.
Other channels, such as benzalkonium chlorides and clorheksidin g pregnancyat, are less effective in a study in Hong Kong, a flu sample is taken in the media two days after the inflammation begins.
On five of the six patients, the first sample shows the highest virus load, and the sixth patient shows the highest virus load on the second day test.
Coronavirus respiratory synthesis weight 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new respiratory synthesis synthesis, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia related to a claster myth disease in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are in a coronavirus that's in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by the roof of the household, which destroys the protective shell.
The lungs are the most vulnerable organs of COVID-19 because the virus accesses the innovative cells through the enzymes of angiotensin 2 (ACE2), the most widely distributed in the second type of alveolar cell.
This virus uses a special glikoprotein surface called "spike or tonjolan" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the inang cell.
The aquatic heart disease was found in 12% of the infected people in Wuhan, China, and more frequently in serious illness.
The level of cardiovascular structures is high because there is a response to systemal inflammation and inflammation of the immune system during the disorder, but the myt miokard injuries may also be related to the ACE2 reciper in the heart.
ACE2 receipts are very high in the heart and are involved in the function of the heart.
Inside trombosis (31%) and high tromboembolism (25%) are found in the ICU infection patients of COVID-19 and may be associated with bad prognosis. Otopsi is on the person who died by COVID-19 found the damage of alveolar difus (DAD) and inflammation in which contains limfosit in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropis for a breathal transmission cell that stresses ACE2, the heavy FOVID-19 patients have systemic hiperinflammation symptoms.
Specially, the T cell that analyzes GM-CSF patogenics has proved to be connected with the monostic efficiency that analyzes IL-6 infrastructory and a terrible gay patology in MOVID-19 patients.
Infiltrat limfositics have also been reported on autopsy.
WHO has published a number of tests protocols for this disease.
The standard method of testing is a real-time transscription chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
This test is usually performed on respiratory samples available through the filtering method; yet, the samples of the filter or the sputum can also be used.
Generally, the results are available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but it takes two blood samples taken from two weeks until they have a small amount of time.
Scientists of China are able to solve this coronavirus virus and publish its genetic element so that the  laboratorium around the world can develop an independent test of the polimerase chain reactions (PCR) to detect infections by this virus.
On April 4, 2020, antibodies test (who can detect active infections and if someone has previously been infected) are in development, but not yet much is used.
The case of Tiongkok with the test shows only 60 to 70% of his sense of urgency.
FDA in the United States approved the first test of point-of-care on March 21, 2020 to be used at the end of that month.
A multilobar ground-glass capacity with perifer distribution, asymetris, and posteriors were found many at the beginning of infection.
Subpleural domination, insane paving (a lobular plumbing with a varied alveolar fill), and consolidation can appear as far as the progress of disease.
A little data is available about the microscopic license and the FOID-19 priority.
The main path of the option is:
Makroscopi: pleurisy, geikarditis, sand consolidation, and pulmoner edemas
Four types of pneumonia virus blind:
light pneumonia: pulmoner edema, pneumosit hyperplacia, huge thin pneumosit, international inflamation with limfositic infiltration, and multimillion racist cells.
pneumonia heavy: damage to alveolar difus (DAD) with an alveolar expiration difus.
DAD is the cause of aquatic accola (ARDS) and heavy hypocrite.
pneumonia in healing stage: Extracual order in the alveolar cage and phybrosis interstitial pulmoner
Blood: intravaskular institute (DIC); leukoeritroblastic reaction
The precautions to reduce the possibility of keeping the infection in the house, avoid places of many, often washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practice good breathing hygiene, and avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unscrupulous hands.
The CDC recommends to close the mouth and nose with tissue when rocking or filtering and recommending the use of part in the elbow if the tissue is not available.
The right tone of hands after coughing or censoring is encouraged.
The CDC recommends the use of covers from the fabric in public places, partly to block transmission by non-stop people. Social boundaries strategy aims to reduce contact with many people, by closing school and work space, overseas travel, and canceling large public meeting.
Border guidance also includes people who keep a distance of at least 6 feet or 1.8 meters.
There has not been any known effective treatment to prevent COVID-19. Because it's not available until early 2021, the main part in dealing with COVID-19 is trying to reduce the epidemi summit, known as "currva's numbering".
The CDC also recommends that people often wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after the toilet or when the hands look dirty, before eating, and after washing the nose, rocky, or cinnamon.
Additional CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand manipulation that contains at least 60% of alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available. In the area where commercial handwashing is not available, WHO provides two formulas for local production.
In this formula, antimicrobial activity comes from etanol or isopropanol.
Hidrogens are used to help remove bacteria sporas in alcohol; this zat is "not active for antiepsis hands."
Gliserol added as humektan.
People are handled with support treatment, which can include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and support other vital organs that are infected.
CDC recommends people who suspect they bring the virus to wear simple facial masks.
Extracorporeum membrane operation (ECMO) has been used to deal with respiratory failure problems, but the benefits are still considered.
Cleanliness and life - style and a healthy diet pattern are recommended to increase the equation.
Proportive treatment may be useful to people with light symptoms at the early infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations to handle the COVID-19 sufferers treated.
Intensive care professionals and lungsmans in the U.S. have arranged for treatments from various institutions to be a free source of resources, IBCC.
Until April 2020, there's no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, part of medical energy recommends parasetamol (asetaminofen) compared the motherprofen to the first use of the line.
Prevention action must be taken to minimize the risk of viralularization, especially in the health care level when performing a procedure that can produce aerosol, such as intubation or hand ventilation.
For health energy that treats COVID-19 sufferers, CDC recommends putting that person in the Tular-UIR Infectional (IIR) Integration Space instead of using standard control action, contact control action, and blood-source management action. CDC recommends the use of self-safe devices (APD) during pandemi.
The device recommended is: APD coat, respirator or face mask, eye shield, and medical gloves. If available, the respirator (not a mask of faces) is better.
The N95 refrigerator is approved for the industrial reservation, but the FDA has authorized this mask to be used according to the Darurat Usage (EUA) Authorization.
The N95 refrigerator was designed to protect from air - carrying particles like dust, but the effect of certain biological agents is not guaranteed for the unspecified use of the label.
If the mask is not available, the CDC recommends using face shields or, as the last effort, the production mask itself.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so heavy that they need mechanical ventilation or alternative, but some cases are serious.
The type of breathing support for the person who has failed the KOVID-19 linked is active being analyzed for the person who is treated inap, and there is evidence that intuition can be avoided by high flow filters or biblivious airstream pressure.
Whether one of these two methods has not been known to have the same benefit for the critic.
Some doctors prefer to keep using invasive mechanical ventilation, when available, because this technique involves the preaching of an aerosol particles than the high-ranked cavities. A heavy case is more serious to the lansia (one who is over 60 years old, and especially the person who is over 80 years old).
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospital beds, which block the health system's capacity to handle a sudden amount of severe COVID-19 cases so that they need adequate treatment.
A study in China found that 5% entered an intensive treatment unit, 2,3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1,4% died.
In China, about 30% of the sufferer of COVID-19 who was treated inhaled eventually entered the ICU.
The mechanical ventilation becomes more complicated with acceleration synthesis (ARDS) that occurs on COVID-19 and oxygen becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators who are able to control the pressure mode and high PEEEP are required to perform oxygen delivery at times minimize the risk of lung injuries and ventilator-related pneumotoraks.
High PEP may not be available on old ventilators.
A study of the medical potential began in January 2020 and some antivirus drugs were in clinch test.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new medicine development may take time until 2021, some treatments that are being tested have already been approved for other use or are already in further testing.
Antivirus medicine can be tried on people with serious illness.
The volunteers who are recommended WHO are joining in a test of effective treatment and potential treatment security. FDA has given temporary authorization for convalessional plasma as an experimental treatment in one's life case is very or immediately threatened.
The convalcessional Plasma has not been in the course required to prove security and effectiveness to this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a cellular application to handle this disease epidemic.
User requested to enter their name and ID number.
This application can detect 'close contact' using surveillance data so that it can detect the risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If the risk potential is detected, the application is not only recommending a private female, but also informs local health officer. The authoritative analysts on phone data, face technology, cellular tracking, and artificial intelligence used to track infected people and people who are contacted with them in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, Israel’s government allowed the security body to trace the data of the expected coronavirus.
The step was taken to treat the corridor and protect those who might be contacted with infected people.
In addition, in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom distributed a collection of telephone locations to the German federal government, Robert Koch Institute, in a process of research and preventing the spread of the virus.
Russians use face-known technology to detect crantine violations.
The Italian regional health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said he was given to the phone operator that "40% people still move around. "
The German government's doing hackathon weekends 48 hours with more than 22,000 participants.
Moreover, President Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made the global call for a creativity solution to the preaching of the colonivrus.
People may be under pressure because of coral reefs, travel limitations, side effects of treatment, or fear of the infection of their own.
BBC quotes Rory O'Connor, saying, "According social, lonely, health, stress, and economic deterioration is a perfect storm that threatens mental health and welfare of the community."
This disease can be lightened by a little or without symptoms, which resembles the respiratoryal disease of other generals, such as a pile.
The light temperatures usually heal in two weeks, while those who suffer from a serious or critic illness may need three to six weeks to heal.
The pregnant women may have higher risks for COVID-19 infections based on data from similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 is still low. For some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs that causes pneumonia.
To the worst person, COVID-19 can quickly develop into a coma-smoking syndrome that causes respiratory failure, synchronization, or failure.
Communication related to COVID-19 includes a secsis, an abnormal transmission of blood, and damage to heart, kidneys, and heart.
The difference in blood transmissions, especially protrombination, is observed at 6% of the FOID-19 patients treated inap, while the reaction of the kidney function is seen at 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with a KOVID-19 image shows an increase in the enzymment of the heart.
According to the same report, the median time between the waves and the deaths is ten days, with five days spent in the inflammation treatment.
However, the patient who is transferred to ICU has a pressing time of seven days between breast care and death.
In a study that examines the early cases, the media's time from early stages to death is 14 days, with a full 6 to 41 days rent.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) Tiongkok, a man has 2,8% death numbers, while women have 1.7% death rates.
A hytopatologist sample postmortem post-exposmation checking shows the damage of alveolar being suspended with cellular fibromyxsoid expiration on both lungs.
Virus synthetic changes are observed on pneumosits.
Dragon images resemble aquatic accola (ARDS) syndrome.
At 11,8% of deaths reported by the Chinese National Health Commission, loss of the dead heart, with an increase in troponin rate or a halt.
According to the March data from the United States, 89% of people who are treated inap have a survivor of medical resources and social resources in one area can also affect mortality.
The estimate of mortality from the varied condition of the region’s differences, but also because of the difficulty of methodology.
Insufficient calculations may cause death rates to be too high.
However, the fact that death is the result of a case in the past can mean the number of deaths at this time is too low.
Perukok has a chance of 1,4 times greater being under a severe COVID-19 gear and about 2,4 times more likely to need intensive treatment or death than not a smoker.
Hong Kong Hospital Authority has found a 20% - to - 30 - percent deterioration of the lungs in some people who recover from disease, and the evacuation of the lungs shows organ damage.
It can also cause passca care-intensive syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known if the previous infection had given effective and long-term implications to the person who was healed of this disease.
Imunity is considered likely to be acquired, if it sees another coronavirus behavior, but has been reported on the case of COVID-19 recovering followed by a positive chronvirus test a few days later.
This case is believed to be the rest of the infectious, not reinfection.
This virus is expected to be natural and comes from animals, through spreading infections.
The fact is, however, that in December 2019, the preaching work was almost universally motivated by the influx of humans to humans.
A study of 41 cases confirmed by the first COVID-19 case, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed the first time of the accident was December 1.20.
Official publications of WHO reported the earliest of the series on December 8, 2019.
In general, some measurements are used to count mortality.
This number varies according to the region and within time, and is influenced by the number of tests, health care, maintenance options, time since the first plague, and popularity characters such as age, depression, and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO set the ICD-10 emergency code U07.1 for the death of SARS-CoV-2 infections confirmed laboratory and U07.2 for the deaths of CVID-19 that are diagnosed by credentials or epidemics without confirmation of laboratory infections to SARS-CoV-2. The death rate of cases of deaths in which the number of cases are diagnosed at a certain interval.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the average death on global cases is 6,9% (153.822/2.240.191) per 17 April 2020.
The number of variables based on the region. Other measurements encompass the death rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of people who die from certain diseases, and the mortality rate of infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of people infected (diagnosis and not diagnosed) who die of certain diseases.
This statistic is not bound up in time and follows a certain population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all people infected make antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people who have been infected.
In Italy's epicentrum of wabah, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village with 4600 citizens, 80 (1,7%) died.
In the Evangelt, this disease is spread through the Carnaval festival, which spread among young people, causes relative mortality to lower, and possibly not all of the deaths of COVID-19 are classified as the death of COVID-19.
In addition, the German health system has not yet been eliminated.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population may have antibodies, just as the blood donor is paid.
69 people (0,004% of the population) died of COVID-19.
It seems that the pandemi and mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher than a man in the study done in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is at the age of 50, with the risks between a new man and a woman doesn't appear at 90 years of age.
In China, the mortality rate for men is 2,8 percent and for women of 1,7 percent.
The reason for the difference based on this type of phenomenon is unknown, but genetic factors and behavior may be a reason.
The differences of irritation based on the type of clam, the prevalence of smoking lower on women, and the men who have a cordial condition, such as hypertension, at younger age than women can contribute to a higher mortality than men.
In Europe, 57% of the infected were men and 72% of the people who died because of COVID-19 were men.
Until April 2020, the U.S. government hasn't tracked related data to the type of inflammation for COVID-19 infections.
Research shows that virus diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
Practice health officers who are of the highest quality of women, especially nurses, and they have a higher chance of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
Chief WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explains that CO is a short term for corona, VI for viruses, D for disease, and 19 for the first time the plague was identified: December 31 2019.
The name is chosen to avoid references to certain geography locations, species of animals, or a group of people, walking with international recommendations for the purpose of preventing stigmatis. The virus that causes COID-19 is given the name of a coronavirus sufferer coronavirus weight 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "VOID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communication.
Good disease or lazim virus is called "Coronavirus".
At the beginning of the plague in Wuhan, China, the virus and this disease are called "coronavirus" and "Coronavirus Wuhan".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCov's acceleration disease as a temporary name for virus and disease in terms of 2015 control that asked not to use the name of the location in the name of disease and virus.
The official name is COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 is released on February 11, 2020.
Because of the limitations of the standard surveillance chain, some digital products have printed health care materials such as nasal and ventilator consumption.
In one example, when an Italian hospital needed a ventilator's roof, and the monitor could not give it on the necessary time scale, a local company was busy and printed 100 beds needed last night.
After the posts of the COVID-19, the theory of conspiracy, false information, and synchronization is involved in the origins, scales, precautions, treatments, and other aspects of the disease, which spread rapidly.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to some other animals.
Studi failed to find evidence of viral replication on pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There's no cure or vaccine agreed to treat this disease.
International research on vaccines and COVID-19 is being done by government organizations, academic groups, and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization practiced "SOLIDARITY Trial" to study the effect of the four antivirus-based antivirus treatments already present with the most promising achievement.
Vaksin is not available, but various institutions are active developing vaccine candidates.
Previous research on SARS-CoV is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 equally use ACE2 repository to enter human cells.
There are three vaccine strategies that are being investigated.
First of all, research is aimed at creating a full viral vaccine.
The use of the virus, either inactive or dead virus, is intended to quickly trigger the reaction of the human body to the new COVID-19 infection.
Second strategy, subunit vaccines, aimed to create vaccines that make the immune system sensitive to certain subunits in the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the study focuses on the protein S-spike that helps the virus infiltrate the ACE2 enzytor.
The third strategy is nuclear acid vaccine.
Experimental vaccines made with these strategies must be tested to know the security and success. On March 16, 2020, the first test of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
Vaxyn contains non-warming genetic codes that are copied from the virus that causes disease. Suspended increases have been recommended as a potential challenge for SARS-COV-2 vaccine development, but this method is still controversial.
There are more than 300 active cleaning tests that were taking place in April 2020.
Seven attempts to analyze treatments that have been approved for malaria, including four studs against the hydrocyclorokuin or chlorokuin.
The new antivirus drug aimed to form most of the Tiongkok research, with nine attempts to test Fase III on remdesivir in some countries with the end of April reporting time.
In April 2020, a survey of clerical development for vaccine and KOVID-19 drugs is already present. Some antivirus drugs are being evaluated for the COVID-19 treatment, which includes remidevir, chlorokuin and hydrocyclokuin, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir are combined with an interferon.
In March 2020, there was temporary evidence for remdesivir's success.
Clinic increases the patient who is treated with remdesivir in emergency treatment.
Tests of Fase III are being held in the U.S., China, and Italy. Klorokuin, which was used earlier to treat malaria, was analyzed in China in February 2020, with the initial results.
However, there was a call to interrogate the research.
Korean Health Authority and Tiongkok recommend the use of chlorokuin.
However, institute Virologi Wuhan, although recommending daily doses of one gram, notes that double doses are very dangerous and can be deadly.
On March 28, 2020, FDA released an emergency use for hydrocyclorokuin and chlorokuin on the doctor's policy of dealing with CHODI-19 sufferers. The 7th edition also includes interferon, ribavirin, or umifenovir to be used against COVID-19.
The initial data indicates that the high ribavirin dose is required to limit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoksanida has been recommended for more study in vivo after showing the SARS-CoV-2 in low concentration. The research indicates that early priming of the tonjolan protein by the protease transmembran 2 (TMPRSS2) serial is important for entering the SARS-CoV-2 through an interaction with the ACE2 reseptor.
Studi about chlorokuin and hidroksiklorokuin with or without an azitromismic has a huge limitation that has prevented the medical community from using this therapy without further research. Oseltamivir does not limit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not have the role known in the CVID-19 treatment.
Sticky storm complications can take place on COVID-19 weight rates.
There's evidence that the hidroksiklorokuin may have an antisitokin character. Tocilizumab has been placed in the treatment of the Chinese National Health Commission after a small research.
This doctor was undergoing a 2-nobic fase test in the national level in Italy after showing positive results to people with serious illness.
Concombined with the test of feritin serum blood to identify the storm, this drug was meant to fight the storm, which was expected to cause death to some people who were injured.
In 2017, the interleukin-6 reseptor antagonis was approved by FDA based on a retrospective case for transmission synthesis synthesis reflexed by a different cause, that is the CAR T therapy.
Until now, there's no random and controlled evidence that indicates that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for the CRS.
Transfer antibodies that are restored and affected by the system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need it are being analyzed as a passive imunity method.
This strategy is tried for SARS with unconclusive results.
The virus's infection is the working mechanism expected for passive antibody can minimize the defense against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as cellular cytocles that depend on antibodies and/or fagositosis, may also be.
Other passive forms of therapies, for example, use the productive mononal antibodies, while in development.
Production of convalesen serum, which is a part of the fluid from a patient’s blood that is healed and contains antibodies specific to this virus, can be enhanced for quicker use.
Coronavius disease, a group of chronic syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at the Wuhan Center Hospital, who was then infected and died because of KOVID-19 after the awareness of viral spread.
