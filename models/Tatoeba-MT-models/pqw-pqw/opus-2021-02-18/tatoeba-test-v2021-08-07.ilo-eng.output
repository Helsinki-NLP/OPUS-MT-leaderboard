Note Tom.
Water is life.
We were very tired because we had stayed all day.
We managed to get him out of his room.
We celebrated his precision.
We celebrate November 28 as Tatoeba Day because on this day the Turkish, Esperon, and Greek were added.
It is better to take in.
To our surprise, there was a lot of harvesters.
We had three airplanes.
There is acid.
We have work to do.
There are many things we need to consider.
We had a measure of honor.
We need to be careful.
We are well aware.
We knew what to do.
To the Tatoeba!
Let us walk.
Let us talk about it.
We may not need to sell our house.
We may not have to sign a scripture.
We moved the project to a new server.
We need to be careful.
We must do it again.
We need victory.
We need evidence.
We need help.
We need more than ten beer boxes for our lunch.
We need to call the police.
We need to go.
We are born between the bee and the arm.
We were married in October.
We are not cowards.
We were hungry.
We're holding.
Are there witnesses?
We returned to Boston in the 20th of October.
We're sneaking out.
He had to go home.
She had to get married.
We need to move.
We need to get out of here now.
We must start.
At times, we may tell others on the basis of their actions.
We started.
We tried.
They gave us a ride.
We were looking for something.
We did not see each other.
We decided to hold the meeting the following Sunday.
We did nothing wrong.
There is a need for us to do something about it.
We wanted a government that would have little or no place to be sealed in a uki.
What a huge cargo!
What a large town!

When the woman starts to flirt, her hymen is squeezed and bleeding.
Have you found this?

Are you telling the truth now?
Just a little effort, it could have been a success.
Just a little patience, you should have succeeded.
By means of a swift necklace, the door was opened!
Would you like to drink beer?
CAN you just sign our petition?
Yes, but that?
All of you seem to be too busy.
I was almost unable to find a way out.
Keep lying to me.
Always try to get what you want.
You are beautiful.
You were guilty of murder.
You are a new student.
You are just a student.
You are so beautiful.
You can tell me that I am angry.
You can add to the four that you do not know how to translate.
You cannot blame them.
You are afraid again, are you my crocodile?
You could have said no.
You could just write a letter.
It would be better not to go.
You don’t have to tell me your name.
You drive a car.
You have thirty days.
First, you must accept your baby before you are forgiven.
You need to be careful.
You need to be cautious.
It is known that he is.
Lack of self - confidence.
You cannot confirm what Tom did.
You look very beautiful.
You can choose whatever you want.
You can write any language you like, and in Tatoeba, all languages are the same.
You will surely be able to grow up.
You need a new style.
You must be at home before midnight.
You have to be there.
You never told me.
You are a necklace.
Takrotka!
Takrotka!
Fear all of you.
They have only hope for you.
You are a kind person.
Grow up.
Only fear.
You’re not married, aren’t you?
You are a doctor.
You're annoying.
You have a big button.
Your button is small.
You have a good plan, but I have a better plan.
No doubt your plans will succeed.
Your plans require a large sum of money.
The problem is the case.
This son is your father’s best friend.
You have said that before.
You said we could go.
You should not try to trap a person with his or her personality.
You need to go to bed.
You too are happy three.
You and your spouse must be busy.
You are late for your work.
You can’t even notice Tom.
