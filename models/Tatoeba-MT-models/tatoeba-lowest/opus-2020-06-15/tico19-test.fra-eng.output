How long do you feel these symptoms?
and all the thorakic painers must be treated in this way, particularly at your age
and especially if you have the fig tree
and your choleserol and your tension must also be controlled
And do you have the fever now?
Do you feel tumoric pain now?
Do you also have difficulties to respect?
Can you tell me if you have other symptoms?
And how many of you were married?
And I'm all too
And I have a little reum, and I'm all alone.
And I'm very bad to the heroes today.
Does the current period be useful to your rehumes?
And I have these painers in the kidney.
And I think I've got a little fiber.
Can you indicate me where you feel the thoracic pain?
And they have a little fig tree also.
and with your old diabetes.
And you know I'm thinking that my breast's going to go out.
And you know people are all over me
and you have paintings in the cerebrous
and you said to feel pressure in the weight
Cases of heart problems, heart pathology, heart crises, high rate of cholerol or arteral tension in the family?
Do you note other symptoms or problems more than muscular painers?
Is there other simptoms in you with the same symptoms?
Do you have other symptoms?
Did you be ashesed?
Have you still have painers in the brain?
'Cause it's the grippe season
But we should no longer disappear the possibility of a thoracy pain related to a heart problem
But this pain in the cereal is a more important problem now
But I have difficulties to respect.
But I know that many people are on me
but we must treat any pain in the cereal with the largest care
But you're usually smiling at this time, right?
Because I have completely forgotten because of this pain in the weight
is that you have the impression that you are understanding the weight
You're still throwned
Are they likely to be simptoms or have similar symptoms?
Have you another chronic affection like hypertension or something similar?
Do you have other diseases, chronic medical problems like diabetes?
Are you sophisticated (e) more than this pain in the pearl?
Do you have hypertension?
Did you have to do so?
You know what symptoms she had?
See the image?
drink a lot of liquid today
But I do tests for the diabetes
However, she has symptoms rather similar to mines
How many of you have?
What's your tension?
if you've always got a strong fever

I had the fibre yesterday.
I also had a leather fever.
I had the fibre yesterday.
I felt a huge pain here in the kitchen.
I've got some difficult to respect too.
I'll send you an image
I'm worried today.
I have heads and a bit of fibres today.
I think that's the grippe.
I think it's a little grippe.
Is it like a very hard person sitting on your kitchen?
it started with heads with the fiber at least at the same time
It's a bad thing in my kitchen.
it's an oppressive pain in the weight
is in my brain
is in the center of my cell
is in the center of the powder
I have a pain in the brain.
I'm very concerned about this dark pain
I want you to describe this pain in the brain
like hypertension or diabetes
as pile in the center of the cell
Now you can take from paracetamol
Mary, that's how long now you have the symptoms
You say now you have a pain in the brain
I'm sometimes bad in the herit.
OK do you have other symptoms in more or only this pain in the weight
or someone sitting on your kitchen?
less closely similar with the fiber and the towels, head bad and muscular pain
in full middle of the pearl
Show me on this image where you're wrong
Since you have the fig tree
So do you think some of these symptoms could be related to grossness?
So your children have some of these symptoms?
Tell me about your pain in the cereal
the fibre increases the night
The fibre I had in the last two days
the fiber began to increase last night
is Dr. Porter's tricenter centre in emergency room
Well, can you tell me some more about your pain in your kid?
Well, I get a pain before my body, here in my weight.
Well, I've got a strong pain in the brain.
Well, when I have this pain in the brain
What kind of doubt you have in the brain?
When did this pain in the brain began?
Where are you bad in the brain?
Where do you feel this thoracic pain in the cerebrous
you feel like an oppression in the cereal
You know I have diabetes and all that.
You said you have this pain in the brain
Quick increased in the cumulated impact of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) within the European Union/Economic Space and the United Kingdom between 1 January and 15 March 2020
The mixed incidence of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows a similar evolution in the countries of the European Union/Economic Space and the United Kingdom, as well as confirming, while it is in different stages, the COVID-19 pandemy has rapidly progressed in all countries.
According to Italy's experience, the countries, hospitals and intensive care services must be prepared to a pic of patients affected by COVID-19 needing care, and in particular intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a unknown pneumonia pneumatic foyer was reported in Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese centre for prevention and control of diseases described the responsible agent as a new coronavirus now known under the name of coronavirus 2 of the severe aigu respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since the disease resulting from infection in SARS-CoV-2 was baptized in coronavirus (COVID-19).
Today, approximately 80% of COVID-19 people have a blessing affection, e.g. a respiratory infection with or without pneumonia, most of which are healing.
In approximately 14% of cases, COVID-19 leads to a more severe damage that requires hospitalization, while 6% of the remaining cases develop serious forms of intensive care.
The mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is approximately 4 per cent.
In the context of this study, we assess the evolution of the summed impact of COVID-19 in each of the countries of the European Union/EEC Economic Area (EU/EE) and the United Kingdom (R.-U.) and compare the evolution that has been known by the province of Hubei in China.
We also compare the current number of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the dynamic of COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world is now followed by this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) would state that COVID-19 is a pandemic.
In the edition of the 5 March of Eurosubsidence 2020, Spitteri and al. reported the first cases of COVID-19 confirmed in Europe according to the WHO definition.
During the EU/EEA, the first three cases confirmed were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, in the province of Hubei, China.
On 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in each of the 30 EU/EEA countries and in the United Kingdom (R.-U.) between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39 768 cases and 1 727 Decree, 17 750 cases and 1 441 died for Italy only.
Obtention of the summ number and the cumulated COVID-19 cases
In the European Centre for Prevention and Medical Control (ECPCM), the number of cases reported by COVID-19 throughout the world, obtained only from official sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities from different countries as well as the WHO is daily updated at 08:00.
These data were used to assess the COVID-19 evolution within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom and to establish comparison with Italy’s experience.
In order to assess the prevalence of COVID-19 active cases, we have calculated the cumulated impact at 14 days of COVID-19, taking into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 in each EU/EEC countries and the United Kingdom for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also compared the summit number of cases reported in each country at 15 March 2020 to 8:00 with Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Evolution of COVID-19 in the EU/EEC countries and the United Kingdom
The evolution of ECU 14 days of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom has generally followed the province of Hubei (China).
For the EEA/EA and the United Kingdom, the summed COVID-19 impact began to grow in the environs of 21 February before to know a drastic increase in the environment of 28 February 2020 (a further data).
This evolution was mainly due to the rapid number of cases reported in Italy, but all the other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have presented an similar increase in the COVID-19 summit impact (additional data).
Figure 2 provides the summ number of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom than the data of Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It was noted that, at 15 March to 8, 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks before or less.
Our results indicate that the number of COVID-19 reported cases quickly increases within the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom.
The evolution of cumulated COVID-19 implication suggests that pandemic progress is made to a comparable speed in all countries.
This, despite the fact that countries are in different stages and that there are differences in response to national health services, potential changes in case definitions, and differences in the selection protocols of patients before testing for confirming the COVID-19, including rattrapage tests.
In March 2020, the doctors of Italy indicated that approximately 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and the media reported that hospitals and intensive care services in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
COVID-19 data in hospitals and/or intensive care services are currently available at the EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of the cases, respectively (not data submitted).
However, it is necessary to achieve a systematic collection to complement current monitoring data focused on the number of reported cases and deaths.
A study carried out in 2010–11 showed a significant difference in the number of literatures available in intermediary and intensive care services in Europe, from 29.2 beds for 100 000 persons in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal.
This means that countries have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 liters in intensive and intermediate care for 100 000 persons in 2010-11).
Modelling scenarios for the saturation of care capacity, with estimates for each EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom of the prevalence of cases of COVID-19 hospitalized with a risk > 90% of intensive care-related capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the rapid assessment of COVID-19 risks.
Since the cases were joined in certain EU/EEA regions and the United Kingdom and that hospitals and intensive care services generally accept a defined regional population, the data on cases and intensive care leaves should be set at level 2 of the Name of territorial units (NUTS 2).
The experience of Italy and the current evolution in other countries shows that COVID-19 pandemic rapidly progresss within the EEA and the United Kingdom.
The countries, hospitals and intensive care services should therefore be prepared for a Community supporting Community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of patients affected by COVID-19 needing care, particularly intensive care, as well as in the regions affected by Italy.
As emphasized by the recent rapid assessment of the ECPCM risk, a rapid, proactive and exhaustive approach is essential to restore the SARS-COV-2 propagation, through an approach to an approximateization approach, while the rapid and pre-related number of cases could not have enough time to deciders and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly, if nothing has been implemented in amont.
Speed assessment of repercussion risks also provides public health measures to enhance the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brown window during which each country will enhance its control efforts in order to accelerate SARS-CoV-2 propagation and reduce pressure on health services.
However, it is likely that health systems in other EU/EEA countries will have to face a pic of patients needing intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The epidemic of the disease in coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe aigu respiratory syndrome (SRAS) (SARS-CoV-2), has infected more than 3 000 deaths and infected more than 80 000 people in China and otherwise in the world, provocing humanitarian catastrophe.
As his homologge, SARS-CoV, which enters thousands of cases of SRAS in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could be transmitted by souris and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 provides a seriousness and less mortality than RICS, but it is more transmisive, and it affects older people than young and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on this emerging disease, this article seeks to provide an appropriate and exhaustive review of this subject in full expert research.
We are contrary to the fundamental epidemics, ethology, virology, diagnostics, treatment, pronostics and prevention of disease.
Although a number of questions are still waiting for answers, we hope that this review will take part in a better appreciation and enhance this serious disease.
The printing festival on 25 January 2020 marked the Chineses, which have been contractually seen to stay closed for the period of the gold week and for more weeks because of the propagation of a new viral disease.
Virus is highly homologous to the coronavirus (CoV) which causes severe respiratory syndrome (SRAS) in 2003; so he was baptized SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (OMS) on 11 February 2020, and related disease with coronavirus 19 (COVID-19).
Epidémie started in Wuhan and rapidly propained all China before extending around 50 other countries around the world.
At 2 March 2020, the virus had entered more than 80 000 cases of COVID-19, with more than 40 000 patients who had been hospitalized and more than 3 000 deaths.
For the WHO, COVID-19 is “the public enemy number 1”, potentially more dangerous than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nh.gov/pubmed/), more than two months have been published on COVID-19, including in the areas of virology, epidémiology, ethnology, diagnostic and treatment, since the first report on 7 January 2020 with the virus sequence, isolated from several patients.
This review tries to synergic the progress of research on this new subject in full expertise.
As soon as possible, we try to compare COVID-19 with CIS and another cronvirus disease, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, an epidemic had occurred in 2012).
We also take the point that we have learned until now in terms of prevention and pronostic of disease, and we will address some still in suspension, but still urgent questions.
The coronavirus are traditionally considered as non-mortal pathogens for humans, mostly 15% of common reumes 4.
However, in this century, we have known two highly pathogenous crowds for the human, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which have provoked a epidemic which started in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, before being rapidly propained to many other countries with a morbidity and high mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third epidemic of coronavirus in the recent history.
As submitted in Fig. Fig.1.1,1, the unknown pneumonian foyers were first reported to Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the Chinese National Health Commission.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus was divorced.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was reported to Wuhan.
During time, the epidemic was rapidly propained to cities, province and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, it was reported that health professionals were infected by suggesting that interhumana transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was in quarantine with interruption of all its public transports.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on disease indicated that at 41 cases confirmed, only 21 patients had been directly contacted with the Wuhan sea fruit market, considered as the start point of infection with an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO qualified global health emergency epidemic.
At the time of the editing of this report, the disease had already been propained to all China and nearly 50 other countries around the world (Fig.2).
The final port and self-effectiveness of the epidemic remains to be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicentric study carried out on 8 866 patients, 4 021 patients confirmed COVID-19, presented a total updated view of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected persons of all age, but more majority in the tranche of 30-65 years.
Approximately half (47.7%) infected persons were aged over 50 years, very little than 20 years, and only 14 were aged by less than 10 years.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was developed in foyers, mainly in the province of Hubei and the petrol.
The average period between the appearance of symptoms and COVID-19 diagnostics was 5 days (2-9).
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average period between the symptom appearance and the death was 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basis reproduction rate (R0) was 3,77% (IC 95%: 3,51-4.05), and R0 corrected was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected persons had been expensively increased until 23 January 2020, which was coherent with the massive movements which had occurred before the print Festival in China.
The mortality of patients identified as cases confirmed was from 1,44% (IC to 95%: 1,10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3,06% (IC to 95%: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors of COVID-19 were sex (human), age (≥ 60) and severe pneumonia.
The coronavirus represents a sub-familie of large virus envelopped with a simple British ARN.
They may be classified in four gens, namely alpha, beêta, gamma and detta, the coronavirus known to infect the man of the alpha genre and the bêta.
The glucoprotein Spike (S) of the drive is linked to the enzyme of conversion of angiotine 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) of its cell receipters for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, then a membrane fuel is produced.
Viral ARN genome is released in the cytoplasme; after replication of viral genome, the ARN genomic accompanied by glucoproteines of glucoproteins and nucléocapside protéines forms of vessels containing men, which then combine with the plasmic membrane to release virus.
The first genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was presented on 10 January 2020.
The SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of beachacoronavirus, with more than 99,98% of genetic identity between 10 sewn samples presented on the epidemic site, the Huanan Sea fruit market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is generally closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
In support of the transmission of electronic microscopiece, the SARS-CoV-2 particules were detected in the ultra-fines of human epithelium of respiratory paths.
Human ACE2 was identified as a receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the SARS-CoV-2 protein is close to human ACE2 more strong than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes a less important infection than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein coded by orf3b and a secret protein koded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 could play a role in viral pathogenicity and prevent the expression of the IFN, but orf8 does not contain known areas or functional reasons.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, and al., the human cryo-ME structure of the ACE2 was presented in a comprehensive resolution of 2.9 ◆ with the B0AT1-amminated acid transporter.
They discovered that the complex, presenting open and closed conformities, was assembled in the form of dime and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex could read two protein S, which provides indications for recognition and infection of coronavir.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutical target for medicine writing to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Original host and intermediate host
It was determined that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were shocked and were transmitted to the human through civets and camels, respectively.
Following a philosogenic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavires, the shoes-souri were developed as the Native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to the two type crowns of ISS coming from batt-SL-CoVZX45 and batt-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediary host that allowed the virus to translate the bathroom of species to infect human beings remains unknown, and the transmission path is still elected.
Ji, and al., have issued the hypothesis according to which virus could be transferred from shoes to the human by serpents, which would involve homologic rehabilitation within the S protein.
According to a study carried out by researchers of Guangzhou, China, the Pangolin - a long-most museum mammide is noted by fourmis, often used in Chinese traditional doctor - could be the intermediary host of SARS-CoV-2 if genetic homology is judged by 99% between a coronaus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference between two gems is a difference of importance; it should therefore be expected to expected concluding results to establish concrete evidence (Fig.33).
The SARS-CoV-2 physical properties are still very little known.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in sec and up to 5 days in temperature of 20 °C and 40-50% humidity.
The SARS-CoV-2 could very well possess similar properties.
It seems that the SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to ultraviolet radiations and to a temperature of 56 °C for 30 minutes; the ether, etthanol to 75%, the peractic acid oxygen and other fat solvants, but not chlorhexin can effectively active virus.
Human population in its together is generally deployed in immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore vulnerable to the new virus.
No detailed study has been reported on immunological response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to the previous studies on other coronavirus, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig.4).
In general, when a virus affects an host, it is first recognized by the immunity system that is infected by the bike of Molecular Modifying Models (PRR), including type C Lectines, Toll type Recipients (TLR), NOD type receipts (NLR) and RIG-I type receipts (RLR).
In different ways, virus introduced the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of the denrical cells and the synthesis of type I (IFN) interference that limit the propagation of virus and accelerated the viral antigine phagiophase.
However, protein N of SARS-CoV can allow the virus to escape immunity responses.
Subsequently, the adaptive immunity response joins the fight against virus.
The T lymphocytes, including T CD4+ and CD8+, play a important role in defence.
The T CD4+ cells stimulate B that produce specific virus anticorps, and the TCD8+ cells directly eliminate the infected cells.
The T help cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokins to support the defence cells.
However, coronavirus may prevent the functions of the T cells by inducting their apoptose.
humoral immunity, with supplements such as C3a and C5a and anticorps, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, isolated anticorps from a retable patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an extensive reaction of the immunity system causes localized explosion of the number of free radics, which can lead to serious legs to pommons and other organs and, in the worse scenario, a multi-visceral deficiency, even in death.
Infection to SARS-CoV-2, characterised by foyer appearance, is more likely to affect older persons with comprehension and female women.
It is strictly admitted that persons expressed to a large number of virus or whose immunity functions are more risks to be infected than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, but generally from 3 to 7 days after a study under 425 cases reported in Wuhan.
However, a study carried out by 1 099 cases demonstrated that the incubation period was from 3 days average, for a quarter from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described above, has concluded for an incubation period of 4,8 days (3.0-7.2) according to a demografie of 8,866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the effective period of quarantine following the most precise period of incubation, so that they avoid that infected but asymptomic persons transmit the virus.
Usually, persons expressed to, or infected by, virus are in quarantine for 14 days.
Does the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
The fiber is often the first and the main symptom of the COVID-19, and can be accompanied or not other symptoms such as a sweet thumb, a smoking, muscular pain, smoothing, head pain, a huge hurt, a rhinorhee, thorcs, diarrhea, diarrhea, nuts and disappearances.
Some patients have presented dyspine and/or hypoxeemia once a week after the appearance of disease.
Concerning serious cases, patients rapidly developed an acute respiratory syndrome, sevenic chocose, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathie.
Patients from fiber and/ or respiratory symptoms, as well as those with an acute fiber, even in the absence of thoracic radiology, must be tested for virus to allow preagnostic diagnostic diagnosis.
A demographic study carried out at end December 2019 showed that diseases from fiber to 98 per cent, 76 per cent to suit, 55 per cent disappearance and 3 per cent; 8 per cent of patients needed winnerary assistance.
Similar conclusions were reported by two recent studies on a family and a foyer appeared following the transmission of virus from a asymptomatic person.
In the same way, a demographic study carried out in 2012 showed that the main symptoms of MERS-CoV patients had a fever (98%), a sweet thick (47%) and a dyspnoa (55%).
However, 80 per cent needed winner assistance, or more than COVID-19 patients, which is coherent with higher MERS than COVID-19.
A diarrhea (26%) and an orange damage (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
Concerning the SIS, the main symptoms were from the fibre (99% 100%), a sweet thick (29% 75%), a dyspnee (40% to 42%), a diarrhea (20,25%) and a huge fault (13%25%), and a ventilary assistance was required for approximately 14 to 20% of patients.
At 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2 per cent, for 66.576 cases confirmed at the world level.
Comparedly, the mortality of the CRIS in November 2002 was 10 per cent of 8 096 cases confirmed.
For MERS, a demographic study carried out in June 2012, mortality was 37 per cent of 2 494 cases confirmed.
A previous study reported that R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6,47 with a trust interval (IC) 95% of 5,71-7.23, while the SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
A comparison of symptoms, mortality and R0 of SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV is presented in Table 1.
The data previously suggested that SARS-CoV-2 has a more important capacity to promote MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less legal.
Therefore, it is more difficult to control SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that it was not for MERS-CoV epidemics and SARS-CoV.
The appearance of a foyer is often interferred in a family or in a collection or a vehicle, such as in the case of a crowd.
Patients often have seen or resided in Wuhan or in other affected regions or have been contacted with infected persons or patients in two weeks before the appearance of symptoms.
However, it has been demonstrated that individuals can be the virus without so much present symptoms for more than two weeks and that retabilised patients can be again to the virus ports, which emphasizes the need to increase the period of implementation in quarantine.
Patients present a normal number or reduced of white devices (only lymphocytes) in the first stages.
For example, a lymphope with a number of white globes < 4 × 109/L and a number of lymphocytes < 1 × 09/L, as well as a high rate of aminotransferase and a viremie were identified at 1 099 patients affected by COVID-19.
Some patients presented hepatic enzymes, muscular enzyms and high myoglobin in blood, and most of them had a reflexion of the C-reactive protein rate and erythrocytic sediation.
In the most serious cases, the D-dimer rate, a product of degradation of the present fibrin in the blood, was high and the number of lymphocytes gradually reduced.
The majority of patients affected by COVID-19, characterised by bilateral shapes or opacity in the population level is not found.
Patients often develop a a typical pneumonie, an acute pulmonary lesion and an an acute respiratory disorder syndrome (SDRA).
In the case of SDRA, an incontrolled inflation, liquid accumulation and progressive fibrose affect gas exchange seriously.
The dysfonction of type I and type II pneumocytes leads to a decrease of the superfactory rate and an increase in surface tension, thus reduced the capacity of pumps to gonfler and increase the risk of pulmonary colapsus.
Therefore, the most careful thorakic reviews often coynclined with the most serious form of disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed a disannulation of pneumocytes, hyalin membrane training, interstitual lymphocytic infiltration and the presence of multinucted synthetic cells in the pools of a patient died from disease, which is consistent with Viral Infection Pathology and SDRRA and appears to the patients achieved by CES and MERS.
The ARN’s SARS-CoV-2 detection through polymerase-reaction after inverse transscription (RT-PCR) was used as a key criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, because of the high negative rate of fairness, which can accelerate epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnostics (which is then not only on RT-PCR) in China on 13 February 2020.
An similar situation was observed for the diagnostic of SRAS.
The combination of medicines, clinical demonstrations, the laboratory tests and radiological reviews is therefore crucial and imperial to establish effective diagnostics.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a use protocol of SHERLOCK based on CRISPR technology for detection purposes of SARS-CoV-2, which allows the identification of synthetic flags of SARS-CoV-2 between 20 × 10-18 mol/L and 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copys by microlitre) in support of a reactive band at least one hour, without needing sophisticated equipment.
It is hoped that this new technology will lead to significant improved sensitivity and practicalness, if the use of clinical specifications would be concluded.
Since the lack of experience in terms of the new coronavirus, medicines can only provide support care for patients affected by COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have already been used or proposed for the treatment of other cronvirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other viral diseases (Tableau (Tableau2).2).
These therapies include existing and potential treatments with antiviral medicines, immunosuppressors, steroids, retabilised patient plasma, Chinese medical and psychological support.
Even the retailed patient plasma has been proposed for treatment purposes.
Pharmatic companies are all working to develop anticorps and vaccines against virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is mainly affecting poultry in the first time and probably in a less measure, other organs expressing ACE2, such as gastrointestinal system and reins.
However, a dysfonction and respiratory insufficience represent the main threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory assistance is essential to encourage symptoms and save life; this includes general oxygenotherapie, high decline oxygenotherapie, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation, according to the severity of disease.
Patients suffering of severe respiratory symptoms must receive extracorporal membrane oxygenation (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonary discovery technique used for the treatment of heart-sufficience or critical respiratory insufficiences.
Furthermore, the maintenance of electrolytic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septy-covs, and the protection of the functions of living bodies are also essential for patients affected by SARS-CoV-2.
It was determined that an extensive reaction of the immunity system leads to a cytokic chok in patients affected by SES and MERS.
A cytokic chok is a systemic inflammatory response characterised by the release of a whole series of cytokins, including TNF eius, IL-1月, IL-2, IL-6, IFN月, IFN月, IFNgam and MCP-1.
These cytokins induce immunitative cells to liberate a large number of free radics, which are the main cause of SDRA and a multi-visceral deficiency.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokic chocos, particularly for serious cases.
Corticostheroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal anticorps have been used to treat cytokics.
Other immunosoppressor treatments for cytoks include the modulation of immune response by the T, the blocking of IFN-gam cytokins, IL-1 and TNF, the inhibition of JAK, blinatumomab, the cytokin signaling and HDAC inhibitors.
Styroids, such as immunosoppressors, have been widely used in the treatment of SRAS to reduce the gravity of inflammatory lesions.
However, high dose steroids did not have profitable effects on severe pulmonary lesions in patients affected by SES and COVID-19.
Instead of this, they would lead serious secondary effects, including a avascular oceanecrose, which would so significantly affect pronostic.
However, the comprehensive use of short-terroid corticoid cycles with low-terroid dose cycles was recommended for patients with serious COVID-19 forms.
At the time of the editing of this report, no effective antiviral antiviral therapy has yet been confirmed.
However, intraveinal administration of redesivir, nucléosidic analogy, has been revealed in an American patient reaching COVID-19.
Redesivir is a new antiviral medicine developed in the origin by Gilead for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg virus.
The redesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other simple ARN virus, including MERS and SRAS.
In view of these findings, Gilead transmitted the composition to China to allow a number of tests on individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2, and the results are highly expected.
Furthermore, baricitinib, interferon-a, lopinavir/ritonavir association has been developed as potential treatments for patients suffering an aggregate respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nasa, hepatic lesions, and other indésirable effects may result after combinated treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir association.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients must be strictly controlled.
Remote patients and anticorps production Plasma
Collection of blood to patients who are healing from contagious disease in order to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect health persons of this disease is an anticitral practice.
In fact, retabilised patients often present a relatively high rate of anticorps against pathogine.
Anticorps are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by lymphocytes B to combat pathogines and other foreign bodys; they recognize unique molecules in pathogs and neutralize them directly.
The plasma was therefore extraced from a group of patients healing from COVID-19 and injected to 10 seriously occurred diseases.
The symptoms have been improved in 24 hours in association with a reduction of inflammation phenomenon, a reduction of viral load and an increase in oxygen saturation in blood.
However, a verification and clarification are necessary to propose this method for a large-scale use as long as any specific treatment has been developed.
Furthermore, in view of the therapeutical effects, there should be aware of certain plasma inconvenents.
For example, anticorps can lead to extreme stimulation of immunity response and provocate a cytokin release syndrome, potentially fatal.
The concentration of anticorps in blood is generally low, and the demand for plasma to treat patients seriously patients is important.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific anticorps enough fast to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more essential and more effective to isolate restainable B cells and to identify genetic codes that cod relevant anticorps or to search effective anticorps against the main virus protections.
This allows to increase rapidly the production of anticorps.
MTC is used since thousands of people in China to treat a wide variety of diseases.
However, its effects are widely based on the combination of multiple components in a formula that varies in the diagnostics, based on the MTC theories.
Most effective components remain a few or not all known in the measure where it is difficult to extrace them and check them, or to know their optimal associations.
At the present time, due to the lack of specific treatment of COVID-19, MTC is one of the main alternative treatments for patients with light symptoms in moderate or in a serious form of disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen were revealed effectively for COVID-19 treatment.
The best COVID-19 healing rates were observed in China provinces had been used to MTC for 87 per cent of their patients, including the Gansu province (63.7 per cent), Ningxia region (50 per cent) and Hungar (50 per cent), while the Hubei province was only 30 per cent of the COVID-19 patients presented the lowest cure rate (13 per cent).
However, it is rather approximately comparison because many other impact factors, such as the number of patients and gravity of disease, should be taken into account for the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and its collaborators published a study that compared a treatment using Western Medicine (MO) only and a combined treatment with MO and MTC.
It appeared that the return period to normal body temperature, the symptom disappearance period and the hospitalization duration were clearly shorter for the MO+MTC group than only for the MO group.
Further impressioning, the greenhouse rate of symptoms (lease lights) was relatively lower for the MO+MTC group than for only MO group (7.4% against 46.2%) and the mortality was less for the MO+MTC group than only for the MO group (8.8% against 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and unfair MTC's unfairness continues to precise the checking tests carried out at larger screens and in more centres.
It would also be interested to characterize the action mechanism and clarify the effective components of MTC or their associations, if possible.
The individuals identified as likely or confirmed cases of COVID-19 are usually a life-related concern against this highly contagious and mortal disease, and those placed in quarantine also have a sense of naughty, disappearance and anger.
Furthermore, infection symptoms, such as fiber, hypoxie and too, as well as inseparable effects of treatment, such as insomnie inducted by corticstheroids, may lead to increased anxiety and psychological disorder.
In the first time of the epidemic of SRAS, many psychiatric morbidities have been reported, including a persistent depression, anxiety, panic crises, psychomotoral excitation, psychotic symptoms, an aggregate state and even subsequent trends.
The obligatory research of contacts and quarantine health services in the context of response to COVID-19 health services may increase anxiety and lead to certain offence of diseases in respect of the effects of condensation, quarantaine, and the stimulation of their family and friends.
For example, mental health care should be provided to patients affected by COVID-19, individuals identified such as probable cases, persons in contact with these populations, and any other persons in disappearance.
This psychological support should include training of multidisciplinary teams, clear communication with regular and specific updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional applications and equipment to avoid any resolved contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the transmission chain of animal reservations and humans infected to vulnerable hosts, and often additional antiviral treatment in the control of hepidemis caused by emergenous viruss.
The efforts have been made to develop protein-based vaccines, with a view to produce long-term neutralising anticorps and/or to induct protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Live vaccines have been evaluated on animal models for the SRAS.
However, the ineffective effect of these potential vaccines in older persons and models subject to legitimate provocation and their protection against infection by a zoonotic virus remains still determined where no clinical study has not yet been initiated.
This was probably due to the fact that the SIS has been earned 17 years ago and that no new case has been reported since.
Nevertheless, MERS's sporadic cases and foyers continue to state in the Middle East and in other regions because of the conservation of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Various vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS in support of the inactivated virus, DNA plasmide, viral vectors, nanoparticules, appearing parts to the virus and recycling protein units, and some have been evaluated on animal models.
The development of a secure and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immuniated persons is an urgent and essential objective to control the current epidemic.
However, it is a real challenge because of the important period (18 months in average) required to develop vaccine and dynamic variations of coronavir.
As it is an emerging disease, COVID-19 has just been clinical evolution through thousands of patients.
In most cases, sicknesses are progressively retained.
However, in the instability of the CIS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with a morbid and high mortality for the most serious cases.
The establishment of a pronostic model is therefore crucial to enable health agencies to priorize their services, particularly in limited resource areas.
According to the clinical studies to this, the factors that can affect or be associated with COVID-19 pronostics are the following (Tableau (Tableau33):
Áge: age was the main factor for the pronostic of the SES, and it seems also to be the case for COVID-19.
COVID-19 is mainly affected persons aged from 30 to 65 years, with 47.7% of more than 50 years according to a study carried out of 8 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients needing intensive care were more likely to present subjacente compliances and complications, and were relatively aged (Menual age of 66 and 51 years) and suggested age as a pronostic factor for patients affected by COVID-19.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 against 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Complications and complications: COVID-19 patients needing intensive care are more likely to suffer from anxiety heart lesions and arythmy.
The heart events were also the main cause of death in patients at the ECS.
It was determined that SARS-CoV-2 can also be linked to ACE2 positive cholangiocytes, which can lead to hepatic dysfunctions in patients affected by COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and presence of under-jacent health problems are strongly correct and can interfere each other.
Anormal laboratory results: C-reactive protein rate (CRP) in blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissual lesions; it was developed as a factor of potential of disease, treatment and healing potential.
The correlation between the CCR and Sevility rate and the COVID-19 pronostic was also proposed.
Furthermore, a high rate of dihydrogenic lactation (LDH), aminotransferace aspartate (AST), aminotransferase alino (ALT) and kinase creatin (CK) can also participate in the establishment of pronostic.
These enzymes are widely expressed within several organs, including at the level of heart and faith, and are released in cases of tissue lesions.
They therefore are traditionally cardiac or hepatic markers.
Major clinical symptoms: the results of the tangic radiology and the timely progress of clinical symptoms should be considered in association with other elements for the definition of pronostic and complications of COVID-19.
Styroid use: as described above, the steroids are commonly used immunosuppressors for infective diseases to reduce graveness of inflammatory lesions.
Although high dose of corticoids was widely used for serious cases of SRAS, many survivors presented avascular avascular osteonecrose resulting in permanent unability and media life quality.
If necessary, the administration of steroids to patients affected by COVID-19 should be limited to a low dose and a short period.
Mental Stress: As described above, COVID-19 epidemics have introduced a large number of exceptional stresses, patients often knowing long quarantine periods, extremely uncertainty and the death of neighbourings or other patients.
It is necessary to propose psychological accommodation and long-term support to help those individuals to overcome this stress and find normal life.
According to the demographic studies carried out here, COVID-19 seems to be presented in different epidemiological characteristics than those of the SRAS.
In addition to replicate in the lower respiratory paths, SARS-CoV-2 is also effectively reflected in the highest respiratory paths and does not lead to little symptoms in the first phase of infection, in the establishment of coronavirus in the origin of common rehumes.
Therefore, recently infected or incubated persons may produce a large number of virus during their daily activities, which has significantly resulted in the epidemic control.
However, it was considered that SARS-CoV was transmitted by seriously sick patients, with a very low probability of transmission in the first phase.
The COVID-19 epidemic atmosphere is so much more serious and difficult to control that it was not that of the SIS.
Several efforts are currently undertaken in China, including the confidence of Wuhan and neighbouring cities, and the continuation of the population's almost entireness in order to interrupt the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures had a dramatic impact on the economy and on other sectors in the country, the number of new cases declined, indicated the acceleration of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimates suggest that the epidemic will end in March and that the decrease phase will be held from 3 to 4 months.
However, all experts do not share this optimism.
Paul Hunter, and al., mostly that COVID-19, which seems much more infective than SES, will not include in 2020.
Ira Longini, and al., have established a model to predict epidemic isolation and concluded that SARS-CoV-2 could affect two thirds of the world population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the captures of the average naal cornet and the harassment of patients, 2 weeks after their exit from hospital, noting that the newly identified virus could become a cyclic episode at the start of the grippe.
However, encouraging signs were observed in China with progressive reduction of new cases, suggesting that the implemented strategies would be operated.
According to the initial previsions, Ebola virus had to lead to a million of cases and half of death.
However, through a quarantine introduction and a close isolation, disease was finally placed under control.
It is possible, as for SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 is infectial to finally encounter or developed in a less pathogène virus cohesing with the human.
A comparison of COVID-19 epidemic with the WES and MERS is provided below (Fig. (Fig.55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmitted by thick or emerging, and also possible by direct contact with containers contained materials.
The virus has also been identified in seals, giving a new possibility of feco-horn transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients showed that 41% of the cases were likely due to infections with 17 patients with previous health diseases and 40 professionals.
It should therefore be taken precaution measures to protect individuals, including health professionals, social workers, neighbourhoods and colleagues, and even any person who may be contacted with patients or infected persons.
The first defence line possible to reduce the risk of infection in the port of fair mass; use of chirurgic and respiratory machines N95 (1860) is involved in monitoring the propagation of viruses.
chirurgic machines prevent potentially infected goutts or their deposit on surfaces where they could be transmitted to other persons.
However, only N95 masks (1860) provide protection against men's inhalation from 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the males capable of entertaining completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, since both measure about 85 nm.
Since particules have reached five chirurgic masks on each other, it is impreved that health professionals directly contact with patients have N95 (1860s) and not chirurgic machines.
Outside masks, health professionals should bear appropriate isolation blows to reduce contact with viruses.
Virus can also infect a person in the occlesial way.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor revealed to be infected at SARS-CoV-2 while he was using a N95 mask; the virus could have produced his organization through the occ.
Therefore, health professionals should also bear transparent visa or protection lunch to contact patients.
For the populations of the affected or potentially affected regions, it is strongly recommended to lay hands with the desinfecting saving more often than ordinary, to stay confined to the maximum and to limit any contact with potentially infected people.
It is advised to maintain a distance of a meter with diseases.
These measures are effective means to reduce the risk of infection and prevent virus propagation.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus for the human, its high level of homoology with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, had to be set in high state after the epidemic of SRAS in 2003.
However, on 19 January 2020, the Director of the Wuhan Control and Prevention Centre would increase the population by affirming that the new virus was little container, that it was limited interhumana transmission and that it would not be difficult to prevent and contain disease.
This message has introduced a notable loss, particularly when the whole country was prepared for the print festival, and the critical opportunity to contain the disease in Wuhan was missing.
China control agencies must take lessons and take measures to be taken.
For example, these agencies must be advised (1) in their public advertisements, as each word may affect the behaviour and decisions of the population; (2) to show more sensitivity and reactivity to the inhabitants of clinical data rather than to wait for formal doctors or official organizations; (3) to be more restrictive to contain a potential epidemic at its beginning rather than to try to re-assistent the population; and (4) to realize more cible and relevant periods to awareness of the population on the hepidémic diseases, but also to tester and regularly improve the society's response system.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus started end December 2019.
In less than two months, at the time of this report, it spread to all China and nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As this virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the COVID-19 symptoms are also close to those of the ELAS, COVID-19 epidemic makes it nervous as an impression of already.
However, notable differences between COVID-19 and COMS, which should be taken into account in the view of containing epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people than young and more men than women; seality and mortality are also more important among older people.
COVID-19 (10.91% above 1.44%).
The transmission of COVID-19 virus is even possible in the absence of symptoms, while CIS was mostly transmitted by serious patients; it is therefore more difficult to contain COVID-19 propagation.
This explains partly why SARS-CoV-2 has been far faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
Regular ARN detection tests of SARS-CoV-2 may be negative for some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, retabilised patients may be positive to the virus.
This significantly increases the risk of propagation.
Despite the rapid progress of COVID-19 research, a number of critical issues remain still stopped, including:
Where's the SARS-CoV-2?
Although a genetic homology to 96% has been established between SARS-CoV-2 and two type coronaviros of SRAS provening sacks, this is not sufficient to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 comes to circles.
What is the intermediary species that allowed the transmission of the initial host virus, for example, the hair-souris, to the man?
Without response to questions 1 and 2, it is impossible to interrupt the transmission effectively, and epidemics can at any time return.
A molecular modalisation and biochimical analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 links ACE2, but how does the virus precisely fall in the respiratory cells and how does it lead to pathological changes?
Does the virus also read to the cells expressing ACE2 from other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, it is impossible to define rapid and precise diagnosis or effective treatment.
How long will the episode be?
How is the virus evolution on the genetic plan during interhumana transmission?
Will it evolute in global pandemic, disappearing as the SRAS or regularly reflecting the surface like the grippe?
It is essential, even if it can take time, to get reply to all these questions and to many others.
However, less than the costs that this must induce, we have no other choice but to put end to this epidemic as soon as possible in order to resume the normal course of our existence.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of disease.
Only immunodepressed patients have presented a severe infection of lower respiratory paths.
The first case of SRAS to the end of 2002 in Guangdong province in China.
Without accounting of the super-transmittors, it was estimated that each case could approximately generate two secondary cases with an incubation period between 4 and 7 days, the viral load pic of the 10th day of disease.
Patients infected by SARS-CoV are initially present myalgie, head mass, fiber, a disease and fresh, followed by dyspnee, touch and respiratory disorders as a late symptoms.
The lymphopenia, hepatic tests and high kinase creature are current anomalies observed in the laboratory analysis in case of suspicion of SRAS.
Advertised aleol lesions, proliferation of epithelic cells and increased macrophages are also observed in patients affected by SES.
At about 20 to 30% of patients then need intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory paths, several organs including gastrointestinal paths, feed and rein, may also be infected in these serious cases, often accompanied by cytokin choc, which may be fatal in particular in immunodepressed patients.
Since, huge efforts have been made to HCOV research.
The HCV-NL63 was designed in a seven-month child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
It was initially prevalent among young children, older persons and immunodepressed patients suffering of respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctiveness, fiber and bronchite is current in HCoV-NL63 disease.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a 8 months suffering from pneumonia, the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually present in the whole world.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with an obstructive laryngitis, also called croup.
The same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated in a 71-year hospitalized person because of a pneumonie and a bronchite in Hong Kong.
The HCOV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 is present at the world, caused moderate respiratory diseases.
In general, when these HCVs acquire the ability to transmit effectively and continue to manage, they also become less virulent or pathogans.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 cases confirmed.
The clinical events of the MERS are similar to those of the SIS and are characterised by an evolutive pneumonie.
In contrast to the CLAS, many patients suffering from MERS have also developed an analytical renal weakness, which is the characteristic of the MERS relating to HCoV pathology.
More than 30% of patients present gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhee and diarrhea.
In February 14, 2020, more than 2.500 cases confirmed in laboratory have been reported with a high death rate of 34.4 per cent, which makes MERS-CoV one of the most famous men's most dead viruss.
A diarrhea is also observed in some patients.
The SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogine, but more transmisible than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects infected in SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and could contribute to its rapid propagation in the world.
The comparison and opposition of SARS-CoV-2 with the six other HCoV showed similarities and very interesting differences.
First, the incubation period and the HCoV disease period are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the six other HCoV.
Secondly, COVID-19 symptoms are between SARS-CoV and the four Community HCOV (as HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, a small sub-group of COVID-19 severe cases is also observed as in the case of the SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is lightly lower.
Finally, as other HCoV, SARS-CoV-2 can be deleted in sacks.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, its pathogenicity and sustainable distribution after human transmission, will have an impact on the final destiny of the current COVID epidemic.
The four Community HCVs caused moderate symptoms were well adapted to man.
In other words, both of them could be the survivors of the previous HCoV pandemics.
For this purpose, HCVs must replicate in humans in sufficient proportion to allow the accumulation of adaptive changes that compensate host restrict factors.
In this optic, more the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic continues and more the number of infected persons is important, there are more chances that virus is fully adapted to humans.
If it is well adapted, its transmission between men will be difficult to stop through a quarantine or by other infections control measures.
Since many years, four CoV acquired in the community circles in the population, declaring a simple rehumy in immunocompaniant subjects.
These viruses do not require animal reservation.
However, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, highly pathogans, have not been well adapted to man and their transmission between men is not sustainable.
They must maintain and spread in their zoonotic reserves and seek an opportunity to achieve human objectives, probably through one or more intermediate hosts and facilitators.
The SARS-CoV-2 presents similar characteristics to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four HCoV acquired in community.
However, it is more pathogine than HCOV acquired in community and less pathogène than SARS-Cov or MERS-CoV.
It remains to see whether it will fully adjust human beings and circulate among these latest without animal host reserve or intermediary.
Before discussion of HCOV animal origins, we will be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of the evolutive, natural hosts, reserves, intermediary and accelerators of HCOV.
An evolutive housing serving of a HCOV is opened by a close uppervantage that shares high homology at the level of nucléotidic sequence.
Original virus is often well adapted and is not pathogène for his host.
In the same way, a host reserves the HCoV continued and long-term host.
However, HCoV can also adjust the intermediate host and even establish a long-term endemicity.
In that case, the intermediate host becomes a natural host reserve.
In particular, as 80% of the market animals in Guangzhou present anticorps of SARS-CoV, the possibilities that several species of small mammifères could also be excluded from accelerator intermediary hosts.
These souries are positive to anti-SARS-CoV anticorps and the genetical sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These studies set out the basis of a new concept that the soups are the emergency human pathogen guests.
The conversion enzyme of human angiotine 2 (ACE2) is known as the receptor of SARS-CoV.
Despite a high homology between these two viruses, it is usually believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent of SARS-CoV and that the souriose host is not the immediate reservation of SARS-CoV.
That's why the MERS-CoV host cannot be the intermediary booking host.
Furthermore, studies carried out in the Middle East showed that drugs were severe to specific anticorps neutralising MERS-CoV, as well as the Middle East Chambers present in several African countries.
Furthermore, infected chambers exchange virus not only by respiratory ways, but also by fecal way, which is also the main way of extracting heats.
We can't exclude the possibility that the pangolin is one of the SARS-CoV-2 intermediary hosts.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less important than the separator of the saRS-CoV-2 associated with the pangolin.
Recombination is an expanded factor of the cup-coV evolution.
Scientists remain distributed on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to HCoV highly pathogic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 were also studied.
The philosogenic evidence shows that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could both be evacuated from the cow coV, while the parents of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in the royal.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was geneticized with another CV coV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/9/2008, detected in Ghana, while camels were also suspected to be intermediate hosts.
When HCoV-OC43 franchi the bathroom of species to infect humans from home animals around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was reported.
The history of the inter-spect transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Alpha-CoV of the HCoV-souris near the HcoV-229E was found.
First of all, contrary to alpagas, men can have a contact with the shoes in a shared ecological neck.
In fact, humans have close contact with alpagas.
Then the alpha-CoV of the HCoV-229E-souris appeared in HcoV and not pathogènes in the sacks, while alpha-CoV of the alpaga has caused a respiratory disease epidemic in the infected animals.
Finally, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga was not found in the wild animals.
In fact, heat-souris are the direct source of human pathogen virus, including the virum virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra.
It is therefore not wonderful that heavy cows could directly transmit HCoV-229E to man.
Another opportunity, while alpha-CoV of the heat-shaws serves for HCoV-229E genetic booking, alpagas and drugs could serve intermediate hosts transmiting human viruss, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of the inter-spect transmission of drug drugs and drugs.
The evolutive origin of the MERS-CoV found in the sacks is known by its initial identification and has also been strengthened by further discovery.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV is present in drug drugs since decades.
It was well adapted in those rooms that have been intermediate hotels to reserve stability natural reservations.
In contrast to the role of chambers in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission, if they have one, is different.
In particular, the beverage-coV pangolin are highly pathogine in the pangolins.
A number of inter-species of the SARS-CoV-2 of human animals have been included or excluded from future studies.
First, the shoes could be the host reserved from an apparent virus in SARS-CoV-2 almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share a ecological neck with shocks through disappearance or carbon mines.
Secondly, the pangolins could be one of the intermediate accelerators of which a virus has been recently introduced to the SRAS-CoV-2.
Humans contract the virus by exceeding and consumption of meat of like.
Many mammifers, including home animals, may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred within a third species which had been in contact with sacks and pangolins.
The research on animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is currently running.
Compared with other ARN virus at simple Brin, CV change rates could be considered as "modated" to "high" with a average replacement rate of ~10-4 per year, according to the EVA adaptation phase to new hosts.
However, the CV change rates are approximately a million times higher than those of their hosts.
Furthermore, the change rate is often high when the CV was not well adapted to the host.
As regards SARS-CoV, having a high change rate, the changing rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher adaptation rate to man.
We can consider that it has already been adapted to another guest near humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it also applies to the MERS-CoV, which was well adapted to drugs.
In theory, it is little likely that genetic deriive makes vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 short term ineffections.
Third, the CoV changes alennially and frequently model when ARN replication through a unique selection mechanism.
The HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as the CVC observed in the animal, such as SL-CoV and bathCoV-HKU9.
Virus interaction in connection with transmission
In addition to these three viral factors mentioned above, the viral interaction with an host receptor is another key factor that affects the inter-spect transmission.
The revolution of the SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example here; it also shows positive selection evidence during inter-special transmission episodes.
In other words, these two substitutions of amino acid may be key factors of adaptation of virus to men.
It is interesting to note that the SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receipt as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in protein unit S1 means that human liability of the S protein could have been highlighted with ACE2.
In fact, an e-Cryomicroscopy study indicates 10-20 times more than this link with the observated human ACE2 and the S SARS-CoV protein.
It will also be interested to determine whether another receptor may be required for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
The HCOV-NL63 has also been linked to the ACE2 but with a different part of protein S.
There are many other recipients of HCoV, such as HCoV-229E antiopeptidase N for HcoV-229E, and soil acid for HCoV-OC43.
The divergence of housing proteins between humans and natural hosts of HCOV, such as souris, dromadlers and rubbers, could be a bathroom to inter-spect transmission.
New HCoV Exercise: Back to the start box
The variety of cow-souris coV offers many opportunities for new HCoV emergency.
In this sense, the CV cows are genetic reservations of HCoV.
Among the accessible SARS-CoV proteins, ORF8 was considered as important in human adapting, since the SARS-CoV viruss were isolated, but ORF8 divergent proteins were designed.
This oppression knows the ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b and is pressed as an adaptive change that promotes host change.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, most nsp10 and some nsp14.
Also, it was demonstrated that the MERS-CoV epidemic had known rehabilitation episodes between different legends, which were produced in Saudi Arabia.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the HCoV-229E-virus and Chamber with HCV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga presents a simple inventory of nucléotide, generating a delay of the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoV is also stimulated by the elective pressure carried out in their hosts.
Asymptomic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when the cow-shake was infected by the CoV, indicateing mutual adaptation between the CoVs and the sacks.
It seemed that the cows were well adapted to the CoV of the anatomic and physiological view point.
For example, anonyms in the activity of the pro-inflammatory response in the cow-syrises have effectively reduced the pathology deployed by the CoV.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen disorders (DRO) generated by high metabolic activity of coffee-subsids could be removed by the replication of the CV and affecting the "election" by the ex-oribonucléase, which would create a selective pressure and give place to highly pathogs when they are introduced into a new host.
CoV's more pathogen shoes could also be evolved by recombination, generating acquiring new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
So it is not a disaster if three new HCoV are appeared during the last two decades.
The CoV are not pathogènes or cause moderate symptoms in their guests, such as shoes and chambers.
They are solidly reflected without provoking a strong immunity response from the host.
It is here that the secrets of the observation of asymptomic ports and the cause of serious infection cases in the human.
Several symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of immunitative response and cytokin chok; more immunity response is strong, more pulmonary lesions are severe.
In the asymptomic ports, immunity response was discovered from the replication of the CoV.
The same dissociation strategy of immunity response may have benefits in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The administration of type I interferon should therefore be profitable at least in the previous phase of infection in SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, the activity of NLRP3 inflammasm is weak in the sacks.
According to this reason, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasm with MCC950 could be useful in the COVID-19 treatment.
While 95% nucléotide homology was discovered with SARS-CoV, there was also a coV cov-shouris cov shared by 96% nucléotidic homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Boss-CoV of the remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 was discovered, despite that the pangolin can be one of the intermediate hosts or that the pangolin pop can contribute to the genetic flags of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
The CoV are returned under the fires of the rampen because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV exists in drug drugs for a long time.
These chambers are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, cow and milk for the places.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sanctify all chambers to control MERS, as it has been done on the wild animal markets in China to prevent the proliferation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop MERS-recurrent epidemics, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against the MERS-CoV chambers, linked to other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these virus, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several CoV Benotics are circulated in the nature.
In particular, the cow cow cows, which is very high filosotic potential.
Cultural culture of wild animal consumption in some regions of China should be left to reduce unnecessary contacts between human and animals.
In fact, many viruses exist on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until a condensation opportunity is present.
The continued monitoring of mammifères is needed to improve the EC and natural hosts’ ecology, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to human and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective means for human prevention of viral zoonosis is to hold away from the environmental necks of natural zoonose reserves.
First of all, if the skins are transferred to a parent virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it would be interested to observe in what circumstances the skins and the pangolins could share the same ecological neck.
Secondly, if the colds play a direct role in man's transmission, it should be necessary to determine how humans enter into contact with shoes.
Third, if a third mammario plays the role of real intermediary host, it remains to clarify how it interactes with the various species, including men, souris and pangolins.
It is a cold, a pangolin or another mammifter, which should be identified SARS-CoV-2 or the almost-identic parents virus observed in their natural hosts.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as grippe or rhume, for example, in order to wake the hands before touching the eyes, nice or mouth (e.g. muscles).
The main medical objective of the hand milk is to eliminate pathogine agents (bacteries, virus or other microorganisms that can cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be damaged or cause diseases.
The lavage of hands has many benefits for health, including reduction of greep, coronavirus and other infective diseases; prevention of infective causes of diarrhea; reduction of respiratory infection;
as well as reduction of child mortality rates during home acquirements.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhea may be reduced by introducing simple behaviour changes, such as saving hands.
The pneumonian, one of the main IRA, is the first cause of mortality in children under five years, which is about 1,8 million victims per year.
The diarrhea and the pneumonia are each year the deaths of about 3,5 million children.
The hand layer also protects the impetion, which is transmitted directly by physical contact.
The smaller effect, the frequenting lavage of the hands can disappear the hair by provocing a cutaneous disappearance.
A Danish study in 2012 revealed that the extensive lavage of hands could lead to ocema or denmatite at hand level, characterized by a skilled hair and dismangement, and particularly frequent in health workers.
The too frequent hand washing is also considered as one of the symptoms of the compulsional obsessional trouble (TOC).
Two times per year, associated with the daily swimming washing of hands on savon and the daily dent browser of dentry with a flower dentist, is in the heart of this national programme.
He has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The main action of knowledge and detergents is to reduce obstacles to solution and to increase solution.
The only water is not a cleaning cleaning for the skin because lipids and proteins, which are organic materials of the ground, are hardly clean in water.
The solid savon, because of its reutilisable nature, can refer bacteries to previous uses.
There is no evidence to suggest that the use of anti-septics or desinfectors are allowed to target resistant organs to antibiotics in the nature.
Therefore, even though the antibiotic smokes are not the fruit of antibacterian skills, these could not be as effective as announced.
Besides the tensioactive and protector of the hair agent, the most complex forms may contain acidoms (actico actic acid, accorbic acid, lactic acid) served to regulate pH, benzoïc acid, with antimicrobian function, and other protection agents (the real, vitamines, menthol, the extra plants). A rigorous analysis of the Oregon University's public health is stated that the ordinary seats were as effective as anti-bacterian seats for individuals and containing triclosans, to prevent the diseases and eliminate the control of the hands.
Heat water used to lay your hands is not enough warm to kill bacteries.
The bacteries are more faster than the temperature of the body (37 °C).
However, weaken and saving water is more effective than fresh and saving water to eliminate natural oils of sales and bacteries.
However, in contrast to the popular credibility, scientific studies showed that the use of tired water could not contribute to reducing microbian load on hands.
A desinfector or an anti-septic for hands is a non-water hand hygiene product.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropylic alcohol or etthanol associated with an epaising agent such as a carbon (polymera of acrylic acrylic acid) to obtain a wheat, or like glycerin to obtain liquid or mousse for a greater easy of use and reduce the effect of alcohol.
The addendum of diluted hydrogen peroxide increased antimicrobian activity.The desinfectors for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effectively eliminating germen.
Hydroalcool solutions kill bacteries, multiresistent bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some virus (as HIV, herpes, VRS, rehinovirus, vaccine, grippe and hepatite), and campagnes.
The hydroalcool solutions are almost fully ineffective against norrovirus type virus (or Norwalk), the main cause of container gastrotherite. A sufficient amount of desinfector for hands or hydroalcool solution must be used to hide or cover the two hands.
The increased use of these products is due to their easy use and fast elimination of microorganisms; however, they should not replace an adequate hand washing unless you have water and saving hands.
The frequent use of hydrolcohol solutions may lead to a cutaneous disappearance if the formula is not strengthened by emolents and/or hydratant agents of the skin.
The effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other potents to the formula.
In the context of clinical tests, hydroalcool solutions containing emotional emotional solutions have proved clearly less detrimentation and cutaneous seasure than the knowledge or detergent anti-microbics.
The allergic contact denmatite, contact urticary or hypersensibility at alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcool solutions are rare.
Despite their effectiveness, the non-water products do not eliminate organic materials presented on the hands, but desinfect them.
For this reason, the desinfectors for hands are not so effective as saving and water to avoid the propagation of many pathogans, since these remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of disinfectors for non-alcool hands is strongly depending on ingrédients and formulary, and has always been highly lower than the alcohol and the desinfectors based on alcohol.
Recently, the forms used by Benzalconium clorure presented a sustainable and cumulative anti-mixrobian activity after application, with the difference of alcohol, which the effectiveness after repeated use, probably because of progressive warranted reactions.
Circle or earth can be more effective than water only, but less than they know it.
Moreover, if the land or cereal is polluted by microorganisms, it is likely to increase the propagation of diseases instead of freining it.
The cener is also a desinfective agent, because, in contact with the water, it forms an alcaline solution.
WHO recommends the cereal or saving as an alternative to savon when it is not available.
Shut up the hands with the current steel or cold water.
The current water is recommended because of the pollution risk of the washing water points, while water temperature seems not to be different.
To move a generous quantity of savour on the hands by flowing the one against the other, without forgeting the two of the hands, between the fingers and under the knees.
Savon eliminates the hair germs, and studies show that people tend to wake their hands more sensitive when they use saving than only water.
Front for at least 20 seconds.
The action of creating fresh fresh, which helps to eliminate the hair germen, and cold more longer to remove more germes.
Rear abundantly to the current water.
The recovery in an enclosing water basin can lead to the recognition of hands.
Safe with a clean or free service.
Mood and humid hands are more easily reviewed.The most of the most forgotten zones are the powder, weight, spaces between fingers and under the holes.
Artists and snaps can accommodate microorganisms.
Hydratant lection is often recommended to avoid having sweet hands; cutaneous seed favours the appearance of cutaned leons that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to lay the hands when the water of the robinet and/or savon is not available. For example, shopping water from a bidon or a sustained and hazard gourd and/or use of the water as needed in developing countries.In the situations where water supply is limited (such as in the schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to economize water, such as the tippy staps and other economic options.
A tippy tap is a simple technology that uses a breast suspicious for a heart, and a pendel that allows to throw a small amount of water on hands and savon bread.
The effective shock of hands is a essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to cut hands in public tolls is discussed.
In addition, more research suggests that paper servicings are much more hygienic than electric shoes often found in toilettes.
After milk and swimming hands in the hot air, it was revealed that the total number of bacteries increased average of 194% on the finger powder and 254% on the paumes.
The shock in the winter shoes was a average increase in the total number of bacteries on the powder of the fingers of 42% and the pools of 15%.
After the screw of the hands, the following variations of the bacterian birth were observed:
There are many different steel producers, and the mixed sacks have been compared to the sackage with the support of paper service cards.
Hands milk with desinfective lenses is an alternative solution during movements, in the absence of saving and water.
hydroalcool solutions must be contained at least 60 % of alcohol.
There are electronic devices that submit memories when the hospital staff forgot to lay your hands.
The hands' medicinal washing must take at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of savon and water or ice to moving and cut each part of the hands.
The hands must be cut one against the other by passing between the fingers.
After the screw, the paper service should be used to close the robinet (and open the output door as appropriate).
The goal of the hands milk in health structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms („ Germans”) and to avoid their transmission.
A relevant analysis was carried out by Whitby and al.
after exhibition to the blood/ to a biological liquid;
before a aseptic steel; and
All holes must be removed.
In the context of this procedure, it is necessary to wake the hands and fronts to the cut, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
During the receipt, it must be avoided that the water on the front browses go up to the hands.
To reduce germen propagation, it is preferable to wake your hands or use an anti-septic for the hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Concerning the control of infections in the hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of the hand washing was obtained in the first 20% of the milk, and that it was only very little additional benefits to increase hands milk frequency over 35%.
More further research needs to discover the most effective interventions in various health structures.
For example, in the major part of the rural Africa, it is rare to find robinets to lay hands nearly private or public toilettes, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, the weak washing rates of hands may also be imputable to usual tensions, rather than to a lack of savon or water.
Once minimum standards are reached, schools can go from one to three end stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be included in the hand-based hygiene promotion campaigns to reduce child mortality and child mortality.
The World Layer Day is another example of awareness campaign that prevents the development of the behaviour.In addition to the 2019-20 coronaus pandemic of 2020, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji that illustrates the hand lab.
However, a record suggests that the promotion of savon hands milk is much more rentable than other water and sanitation interventions.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused to the fetied earliers called mysmy.
For example, in Germany, the “budgetary hand washing techniques” have been placed next to the rivers in public toilettes and in the toilettes of offices and airports.
The expression "to lay your hands" refers to the refusal of a person to assess the responsibility or to be compliant of something.
Furthermore, those authorised to lay their hands after having this kind of thought are less excited to give themselves to other compensatory measures of “ purification”, such as the well-being.
Likewise, Hindouism, Buddhism, Sixism, Jewish and Islam requires to wake your hands before and after every breakfast.

'Cause it's the grippe season
It should also be emphasized that the artificial selection can contribute to involuntary changes of virus genomen, which are very likely to follow the pressures carried out in the selection, in particular by the host's immunity system.
For example, the loss of the ORF4 may be cited in the prototype HCoV-229E prototype sack, due to a deletion of two nucléotides.
While an ORF4 could be observed in the HCoV-229E-virus and Chamber with HCV-229E, the alpha-CoV of the alpaga presents a simple inventory of nucléotide, generating a delay of the reading framework.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoV is also stimulated by the elective pressure carried out in their hosts.
Asymptomic cases or moderate symptoms were detected when the cow-shake was infected by the CoV, indicateing mutual adaptation between the CoVs and the sacks.
It seemed that the cows were well adapted to the CoV of the anatomic and physiological view point.
For example, anonyms in the activity of the pro-inflammatory response in the cow-syrises have effectively reduced the pathology deployed by the CoV.
Furthermore, the activity of natural tube cells in the heat is removed by the positive regulation of the receptor inhibited natural tube NK2/CD94 and by the low rate of expression of molecules of the main complex of class I.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive oxygen disorders (DRO) generated by high metabolic activity of coffee-subsids could be removed by the replication of the CV and affecting the "election" by the ex-oribonucléase, which would create a selective pressure and give place to highly pathogs when they are introduced into a new host.
CoV's more pathogen shoes could also be evolved by recombination, generating acquiring new proteins or protein characteristics for the adaptation of the host.
So it is not a disaster if three new HCoV are appeared during the last two decades.
The CoV are not pathogènes or cause moderate symptoms in their guests, such as shoes and chambers.
They are solidly reflected without provoking a strong immunity response from the host.
It is here that the secrets of the observation of asymptomic ports and the cause of serious infection cases in the human.
Several symptoms are mainly due to the hyperactivation of immunitative response and cytokin chok; more immunity response is strong, more pulmonary lesions are severe.
In the asymptomic ports, immunity response was discovered from the replication of the CoV.
The same dissociation strategy of immunity response may have benefits in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The response to the interferon is particularly strong in the shoes.
The administration of type I interferon should therefore be profitable at least in the previous phase of infection in SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, the activity of NLRP3 inflammasm is weak in the sacks.
According to this reason, the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasm with MCC950 could be useful in the COVID-19 treatment.
The SARS-CoV-2 is appeared as follows the general scheme that the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV were emerging.
While 95% nucléotide homology was discovered with SARS-CoV, there was also a coV cov-shouris cov shared by 96% nucléotidic homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While markets and other animals have been discovered as an identical virus ports at SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 was identified.
Boss-CoV of the remarkably similar to SARS-CoV-2 was discovered, despite that the pangolin can be one of the intermediate hosts or that the pangolin pop can contribute to the genetic flags of the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions exist, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was designed by man, voluntary or accidentally.
The CoV are returned under the fires of the rampen because of the recent SARS-CoV-2 epidemic.
The coV study in the cows and other animals has strongly changed our perception of the role playing the zoonotic origins and animal reservations in the HCOV transmission to man.
Many of the facts have shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are from the cold and are transmitted to the man by intermediate hosts.
Since the infection of SARS-CoV is from the contact between humans and civettes presented on the markets, the closure of fresh products and the removal of civeds that had been found could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reason, the pangolins should be removed from the cost markets to avoid the transmission of zoonoses, taking into account the discovery of many bubbera-CoV pangolins closely related to SARS-CoV-2
However, the question of whether the SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to the person by pangolins and other mammifers and, if appropriate, how this transmission is done, will remain to be determined in the studies that will be followed.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV exists in drug drugs for a long time.
These chambers are an important means of transport and a major source of meat, milk, cow and milk for the places.
They are very present in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to sanctify all chambers to control MERS, as it has been done on the wild animal markets in China to prevent the proliferation of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop MERS-recurrent epidemics, a global approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against the MERS-CoV chambers, linked to other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to eliminate these virus, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
Several CoV Benotics are circulated in the nature.
In particular, the cow cow cows, which is very high filosotic potential.
The opportunities are not lacking to evolute and recombine these zoonotics, provocing the emergence of new transmisable and/or mortals in man in the future.
Cultural culture of wild animal consumption in some regions of China should be left to reduce unnecessary contacts between human and animals.
In the case of ravens caused by the CIS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and intervention plan should be established.
In fact, many viruses exist on the planet for a long time.
They remain in their own natural reserves until a condensation opportunity is present.
Although heavy-souris present many favourable features for the distribution of virus, the probability for man to be in contact with self-shake and other wild species may be minimised if people are aware of the need to keep disappearing.
The continued monitoring of mammifères is needed to improve the EC and natural hosts’ ecology, which will be useful in preventing the transmission of animals to human and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective means for human prevention of viral zoonosis is to hold away from the environmental necks of natural zoonose reserves.
All the secrets of the zoonotic origin of SRAS-CoV-2 are not yet known.
First of all, if the skins are transferred to a parent virus of SARS-CoV-2 to pangolins, it would be interested to observe in what circumstances the skins and the pangolins could share the same ecological neck.
Secondly, if the colds play a direct role in man's transmission, it should be necessary to determine how humans enter into contact with shoes.
Third, if a third mammario plays the role of real intermediary host, it remains to clarify how it interactes with the various species, including men, souris and pangolins.
Finally, since many mammifders, including domestic animals, are able to contract SARS-CoV-2, it should be necessary to monitor and contaminate expertly.
It is a cold, a pangolin or another mammifter, which should be identified SARS-CoV-2 or the almost-identic parents virus observed in their natural hosts.
Research in this area will allow the evolutive trajector of SARS-CoV-2 in animals to be evolved and will have significant impact on the prevention and control of COVID-19.
A update of the criteria for diagnostics of “subsistent cases” and “confired cases” of COVID-19 is required
On February 6, 2020, our team published a rapid recommendation directive for the diagnostic and the processing of the new infection to coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) and described our experience and provided references to combat this pandemic at the world level.
However, cronvirus disease (COVID-19) is recent, our knowledge and knowledge are gradually progressing on the basis of the results of the current studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, the diagnostic and treatment strategies are continuously updated.
In this mail, we have responded to a comment on our directives and we have provided the most recent criteria of diagnostics for a "subsoluted" and "the case confirmed" in accordance with the latest directives of diagnostic and treatment of COVID-19 (septth version) published by the National Health Commission of China People's Republic.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an epidemic that is now officially caught the name of the disease at coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was called a severe respiratory syndrome to coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO qualified pandemic COVID-19.
In order to fight the SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team has put a rapid recommendation on military medical research on 06 February 2020.
She took much attention since its publication.
However, please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our knowledge and knowledge are slowly progressing on the basis of the results of the current studies and the experience of clinical practice; therefore, the diagnostic and treatment strategies are still updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Training Directives published by the National Commission for the Health of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) have known seven editions between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, some contexts have been substantively amended.
Our directive received a commentary from Zhou and al., these last have presented a simple assessment proposal based on their clinical experience.
Their work have provided new evidence for our directive and are also a precious reference for this global pandemic.
We approve their important work and rewards them.
However, their work should also be updated in accordance with the latest directives of diagnostic and treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), the confirmation of a suspect case must associate one of the elements of the epidémological anti-epidémological anti-epidemiological anti-epidemiological anti-epidemiological elements to constitute a complete analysis, or should correspond to three clinical manifestations in the absence of clear epidemiological epidemiological antidents:
Epidémological anthematics: (1) an anticipant of travel or residence in the city of Wuhan and in the neighbouring areas or in other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported during the last 14 days before the appearance of the respiratory symptoms; (2) an an anticipant of contact with infective cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with a positive test of nucléic acides) (3) (3) a contact anticipation with patients representing the fiber or respiratory symptoms of the city of Wuhan and neighbouring areas or other communities where COID19 cases were reported in the last 14 days before the symptomic events.
Clinical Manifestations : (1) Fiber and/or respiratory symptoms ; (2) images containing the characteristics of an infection in COVID-19; (3) total number of white bullets that indicate a normal, reduced or reduced lymphocytes since the start of the symptoms.
The confirmed case diagnostic should be observed in the case of suspecting any pathological or serological evidence: (1) really positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) Sequence of the entire viral genom with strong homogenity with the new crowns known; (3) Possible Serological test for the IgM and IgG of SARS-CoV-2; or amending the specific IgG anticorps of the SARS-CoV-2 process to positive or increase the title ≥ 4 times in the reception phase compared to the aiguous phase.
We can notice that the PCR test in real time of nucléical acids in respiratory or blood respiratory paths has been added in the second edition (18 January 2020) and the third edition (22 January 2020).
The pathogenic disappearance of blood recruitments was added to the fourth edition (27 January 2020) and to the fifth edition (8 February 2020) and then the sereological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These amendments support the continuing work of researchers to find an optimal kit of identification of nucléc acids for rapid diagnostics, as well as respiratory proofs including blood prevalence, with increased availability of different species, and contributed to the addment of the positive anticorps results in the confirmed criteria.
Furthermore, more evidence reminds us of amptomatic symptomic patients and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the graphical representation of Zhou and al should be updated as they were classified persons that do not have clinical symptoms as “the low risk”.
The evaluation system should also be checked in clinical practice and future studies.
To conclude, we hope the emergency of direct evidence and we ask the readers to transmit their comments.
With regard to the diagnostic of “subsponsible cases” and “constated cases”, we suggest them to follow and respect the most recent guidelines in their countries.
Our team will also update at time our directive to provide its assistance.
Bangladesh announces five new deaths related to COVID-19, a periodic record
Here, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths related to COVID-19 in one day.
The country also registers a mortality record at the virus in one day.
The Institute of Epidémiology, Research and Research and Research (IEDCR) indicated that the number of registered persons included 114 cases of active and 33 healthy persons remaining home.
A total of 17 death was registered.
The closure of public transport started on 26 March and had to end on Saturday, 4 April.
The transport of essential goods ( medicine, fuel and food) was always allowed.
On 19 March, these three people were already retained.
Thursday, the total number of cases of infection by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus exceeded the million in the world, according to the data of the University of Johns Hopkins.
However, the countries have announced closer measures to prevent the propagation of disease.
Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the sea of Moscow, extended the confidence of the city until 1 May.
The Parliament of Portugal voted the extending national emergency of 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes, 10 abstentions and a vote against.
Benotic ortholics of human coronavir
Epidemics of severe respiratory syndrome (SRAS) and respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS) have turned the tendance to reveal what infection HCoV could be devasive and potentially mortal.
Most HCVs come from shoes in which they are not pathogènes.
The intermediate hotels of some HCoV are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct impact in the prevention of human diseases.
The coV-host interactions study in animals could also allow the CV better understanding in humans.
According to the differences of protein sequences, the CoVs are classified in four genres (alpha-CoV, beêta-CoV, gama-CoV and deta-CoV). The genre of the Bêta-CoV contains the majority of HCOV and is divided in four licenses (A, B, C and D).
The philosogenic evidence showed that the cows and rodders play the genetic source role for majority of alpha-CoV and busa-CoV, while the birds are the main booking of gamma-CoV and delta-CoV.
Today, seven human CoV (HCoV) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoV.
The five other cups include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, self-respiratory aigu syndrome (SARS-CoV), the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
The HCoV Benotic origin trace provides a framework for understanding the natural history, motor forces and restrictive factors of the franchise of species bathroom.
It may also lead or facilitate the research of the host(s) reserve, intermediary and accelerator of SARS-CoV-2 with significant implications in the prevention of future condensations.
The CoV animals are known since the 1930s.
During the last decades, seven HCoV were identified.
The first HCoV-229E shift was isolated in the respiratory paths of patients with infection of respiratory paths above 1966 and then adapted to growing in pulmonary cells WI-38.
The patients infected by HCoV-229E presented classic reum symptoms, including headmare, eternal mass, diseases and gorge mass, with fiber and milk observed in 10 to 20% of cases.
HCV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are all presents around the world and seem to be translated to winter, in the tempted climate countries.
The stocks in Australia reduce the limits of assets by acquired paper
Sunday and Saturday, Australian store chains and Coles reduced their carriage purchase restrictions on two and a purchase package in all the stores at the national level, respectively.
Lundi, ALDI also introduced a limit of a package.
These limits were shown in the form of messages to the cases and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
The purchasers appeared to be retained by the fear of COVID-19 and the need for confidence.
Mercredi, Woolworths also limited the toilet paper purchases for home deliverys to a command package.
These measures followed the previous restriction of four purchase packages introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in its press communication on 8 March, said that with the restriction of four existing packages, " many stores are still in stock rupting at the time after delivery," and qualified the request of "no previous", while ALDI, in a publication on Facebook on March, qualified it "unexpected".
The sales have known a "mount increase" last week, following a Woolworths port.
Costco magazine in Canberra also restricted the amount authorized to two packages last week.
In order to reduce the penalty, Coles has commanded larger packages to provide providers and has increased delivery frequency, Woolworths commanded a additional stock, while ALDI has previously provided stocks for the planned mercury promotion.
Russell Zimmerman, executive Director of the Australian Association of Details, said that the detailers tried to increase stocks, but that the restrictions of the local advice on road delivery hours make it difficult.
It provides an increase in production costs, while suppliers are trying to respond to the request and less promotion.
Martday, ALDI announced that after the anticipated deployment of stocks, some stocks are not in a position to honor the promotion of the merced.
In a article published on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, expert of the Queensland University of Technologie, explained that the stores reapprovise stocks all nights.
He noted that the toilette paper is a volume article, which intake stocks of a reduced quantity which, once ejected, leave large empty spaces in rayons, strengthening the impression of a penurie.
"Coles and Woolworths consider that if the rayons are full, if products such as the toilet paper wheel and the desinfectors may be [acquired] and are available in large amounts, this will probably reduce the pants," explained Russell Zimmerman in ABC News.
The paper producer recycling who Gives a Crap declared the last Friday they were in stock rupture.
Kimberly-Clark, which manufactures the toilette Kleenex paper, and Solaris paper that produces the Sorbent paper, have emphasized that they work 24/7 to maintain the approvision, according to articles of News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, indicated that some buyers of real estates would offer free paper toilette to the first carrier during buyer in Melbourne, while less sales were organized because the buyers were granted during the long weekend of the Working Party.
NT News edition, a daily printed in Darwin, included a card of eight pages intended to be deployed and used as a toilette paper.
The stocks were first retained to impose restrictions, in accordance with ABC's 3 March, in which they announced that they were not intended to introduce asset restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also knew a strong demand, including machines, desinfectors, secs, hygiene products for hands and meats.
Also, outside Australia, he was observed tonight evening that the U.S. supermarked on U.S. was limited the toilette paper purchases Andres to two packages of 12 roads.
The World Health Organization qualifies the Pandemic Organization of the COVID-19
Mercredi, the World Health Organization (WHO) has qualified the current COVID-19 epidemic (the disease caused by pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2).
Although the word “pandemic” only refers to the level of propagation of disease and not to the danger of specific cases, the WHO has indicated the need to push Governments in action:
“All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If the countries are departing, testing, treating, isolationing, localising and mobilizing their populations under the response," said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the General Director of the WHO.
“We are very concerned, not only by the alarming levels of propagation and gravity, but also by the alarming levels of inaction.”
According to Dr. Tom Peace, the former manager of the Centres for Control and Prevention of United States's diseases, the pandemic is “not previous”.
He stated, in the proposals published by CNN in February, that "neither respiratory virus has been observed since its appearance to its continued global propagation."
Gherreisus expressed a similar advice, explaining that "We have never been witnesses of a pandemic caused by a coronavir."
What he added: "And we have never been witnesses of a pandemic that can be registered at the same time."
The new pandemic status follows the WHO decision in January to declare epidemics a emergency of international port health emergency.
Dr. Anthony Fauci said to the epidemic: “To make it short, the situation will be taken.”
Thursday, Associated Press announced that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 in the world, which had entered more than 4 600 deaths.
The coronavirus pandemic of 2019-20 is an epidemic of coronavirus disease since 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The epidemic was detected in Wuhan in December 2019 in China, an emergency of international transport health emergency on 30 January 2020 and recognized as Pandemy on 11 March 2020.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 1,6 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, with about 97,000 deaths.
Approximately 364.000 people are healed.
The rate of lightness is estimated to 4 per cent in China, while in the rest of the world it varies from 13.04 per cent in Algeria to 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The current symptoms include fiber, towels and stamps.
Complications can include pneumonie and the syndrome of aguous respiratory disorder.
The term between the exhibition and the appearance of the symptoms is usually about five days, but it can drag between two and fourteen days.
There is no particular vaccine known or antiviral treatment.
The main treatment is a symptomic and support therapy. The recommended prevention measures understand the hands washing, covering the mouth for all people, staying away from others, and monitoring and confidence to people suspected to be infected.
The whole world authorities reacted by putting restrictions on movements, quarantines, kidneys, risk controls on workplaces and institutions closure.
Pandemie has generated serious socio-economic perturbations at the world level, report or cancellation of sports, religious, political and cultural events, as well as generalized penuries increased by Pantic purchases.
Schools and universities were closed at national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99,4 per cent of the world student population.
A false information on virus has been circulated on the Internet, and the xenophobian and discrimination incidents are observed in China, other origin and Asian appearance of East and South-East, as well as in other regions with many cases of virus.
As a result of the reduction of travels and closure in the hard industry, the atmospheric pollution and carbon emissions had been reduced.
The health authorities in Wuhan in China (the capital of the province of Hubei) reported an unknown pneumonian foyer on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was opened beginning January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the market of large sea fruits in Huan and so the virus would be zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the epidémie called SARS-CoV-2, recently discovered and closely related to the crownvirus of shoes, pangolins coronaus, and SARS-CoV. As a result, the first person known with symptoms was in disease on 1 December 2019, and that person had no clear link to the later market.
In the cases of the first foyer reported in December 2019, the two thirds have been bound with the market.
On 13 March 2020, a non-controlled report of South China Morning Post suggested that the first case could return on 17 November 2019, in a person of 55 years of the province of Hubei. On 26 February 2020, the WHO reported that, as the new cases seemed to diminish in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There could be a strong sub-valuation of cases, including those with blessing symptoms.
On 26 February, relatively little cases were reported among youths, those of 19 years and less than 2,4% of the cases in the world. Patrick Vallance, as well as 60 per cent of the British population, had to be infected before reaching an effective collective immunity.
The cases describe the number of people tested at COVID-19 and the test has been positively confirmed in accordance with the Official Protocols.
On March 23, no countries had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had to have official policies to support those who had only blessing symptoms, such as Italy, Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, until 23 January, 86 per cent of COVID-19 infections were not detected and that these infections were the source of infection of 79 per cent of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was much higher than the cases reported.
The first rate of COVID-19 reproduction rate (R0) was from 1,4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States Centres for Control and Prevention of diseases concluded that it could be 5,7.
Most of COVID-19 people are healed.
For those who do not heal, the time between the appearance of symptoms and the death is between 6 and 41 days, the most current time of 14 days.
At 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were imputed to COVID-19.
In China at 5 February, approximately 80 per cent of the deaths were more than 60 years, and 75 per cent of previous health problems such as cardiovascular diseases and diabetes were generally affected by COVID-19.
The number of real victims of COVID-19 could be higher, since it could not include non-tested persons - for example at home, in pension houses, etc.
Part data from Italy shows that surmortality numbers during pandemics are 4-5 times above the official disappearance of COVID dead.
The United States’s United States diseases (CDC) was recognized: "We know that [the number of decreased] is underestimated," a statement confirmed by anecdotic reports of the sub-Evaluation reports to the United States. A such sub-evaluation is often occurred in Pandemies, such as the H1N1 grinding epidemic of the H1N1 of 2009. The first confirmed death has occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death out China was held on 1 February to Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was held in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside China, more than ten deaths by country had been registered in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
On March 13, more than forty countries and territories reported death, on all continents except the Antarctic. Many indicators are closely used to quantify mortality.
These figures vary according to the regions and time, and are affected by the volume of tests, quality of health, therapeutical options, time from the start of the epidémy, and demographical characteristics such as age, sex and especially health. The case-decrees report represents the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given period.
According to Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the global decline report is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204) at 10 April 2020.
The number different by the region.
In China, the rate estimates have reduced from 17,3% (for the symptoms appeared from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (for the symptoms appeared after 1 February 2020). The other indicators are the percentage of legitimateness (the percentage of diagnosed persons who result in disease, and the infection rate (for infection), which represents the percentage of contained (dignised and non-dignised) that result in a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination in terms of disease.
Many scientists tried to calculate these figures for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine of University of Oxford believes that the infection rate for pandemic in its globality is 0.1 per cent to 0.39 per cent.
The highest value of this quarter is coherent with the results of the first COVID-19 tests in Germany, and a statistical study that analyses the impact of tests on the estimates of the level of lightness.
WHO supports the control of pandemics.
The pic and the final duration of the epidemic are incertain and can vary by region.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania said: "Otherwise, the infective epidemics are established and then start back when the disease comes to missing available guests.
But it is almost impossible to make relevant previsions on the time that it will happen."
The Chief of the Chief Government of China Zhong Nanshan stated that it might be completed from June, if all countries are going to mobilize themselves to follow the WHO recommendations on measures aimed at enhance virus propagation.
On March 17, Adam Kucharski of London School of Hygiene & amp; Tropical Medicine would explain that the SARS-CoV-2 will continue to move, potentially for a year or two.
According to a study of the Imperial College carried out by Neil Ferguson, a physical distance and other measures will be required " until a vaccine is available (as possible for 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of the University of Vanderbilt said: "I think it is incredible that this coronavirus -- because it is very easily translated – it is completely disappeared" and that he could "transform to seasonal disease, which could reveal every year."
The virality of this return would depend on collective immunity and the length of change.
COVID-19 symptoms are sometimes not pretty specific and infected persons can be asymptomatics.
The two most current symptoms are the fiber (88%) and the sweet thick (68%).
The current symptoms include fatigue, respiratory secreation production (mocosity), loss of odorat, seed, muscular and articleary pain, worse of orange, cephalees, fresh, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanose. The WHO states that a person has been about six is seriously sick and respiratory difficulties.
The Centres for Control and Prevention of United States diseases (CDC) identified emergency symptoms such as respiratory difficulties, pain or persistent thoratic pressure, sudden confusion, difficult storms, face or blue lies; immediate medical cares are recommended if these symptoms are present. The later development of disease can cause serious pneumonia, severe respiratory syndrome, seventhium, seventh chrome and death.
Some infected persons may be asymptomatics, without any clinical symptom but with results in the test that confirm infection, then researchers have given recommendations that persons had contacted with infected persons should be closely monitored and reviewed to disappear the risk of infection.
The Chinese assessments of the asymptomic ratio varies from some of the 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between pollution and symptoms) waste between one and 14 days; it is often more than five days. For example, uncertainty, the estimation of the proportion of transported persons of COVID-19 who lost the odorat was from 30% before falling to 15%.
Some information on the way the disease is propage remains to be determined.
The disease is required mainly to be transmitted in a relaxed contact and with a fine of goutlets produced in a long-term, abroad or speaking; this relaxed contact corresponding to a ratio of 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have shown that everybody can prepare guitets at a distance of 4,5 meters (15 feet) to 8,2 meters (27 feet).
Some suggested that virus could also be transmitted by gouttelet purposes that would remain in the air on longer periods that could be designed by speaking. Respiratory goutts can also be designed during expiration, particularly by speaking, although the virus is generally not airported.
Foods may ate in the mouth or nest of other persons located on the side or even be inhaled in the pools.
Some medical procedures such as cardiopulmonal inspiration and reanimation (RCP) may cause respiratory secrections that are cleaned and therefore lead to air propagation.
It may also be spread when someone touchs a contaminated surface, including the hair, before touching his eyes, his neck, or his mouth.
If some fear that it may be transmitted by sacks, this risk is considered to be low.
The Government of China excluded the possibility of an oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is more contained during the first three days after the start of symptoms, but the propagation may be possible before symptoms appear and at advanced stages of disease.
Persons have been tested positively to disease until three days before the result of the symptoms suggesting that the transmission is possible before the development of significant symptoms.
Only some asymptomic case signals confirmed in the laboratory exist, but the asymptomatic transmission was detected by some countries during contact investigations.
The European Centre for Prevention and Improvement (ECDC) said that if you are not yet knowing exactly with what easy disease is spread, a person generally contained two to three.
Precisely, virus could be detected at the end of three days on the plastic (polypropilène) and inoxidable axis 304, after one day on the carton, and at the end of four hours on the kitchen.
This, however, depends on humidity and temperature. Home animals and other animals have been positive tested at COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals could transmit the virus to humans, however, the British authorities recommend that the hands should be laid after being touched animals, as it was in contact with other surfaces that infected persons could have been touched.
The severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, initially isolated in three persons of pneumonie related to an eighty respiratory disease of Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus exist in the human body crowds. The virus is destroyed by savon menager, which disappears its protective edge. SARS-CoV-2 is closely linked to the initial SARS-CoV.
We think it would be a zoonotic origin.
A genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus belongs to the genre Betacoronavirus, the Sarbecovirus sub-genre (Linie B) related to two-souri issues.
It is 96% identical to all the genome of another crowd coronavirus sample (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one friendly axis of difference in some parts of the genome sequence between the ice virus of pangolins and human islands.
The comparison of all the genome has discovered a maximum of 92% of common genetic material between the pangolin cronvirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that the pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection may be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, but final confirmation is effected by inverse transscription of polymerase reaction by polymerse (RRT-PCR) infected or scanner sequence.
A study comparing PCR and scanner in Wuhan suggested that the scanner is clearly more sensitive than the PCR, even less precisely, because many of its co-incident image features with other pathological pneumonias and processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that “the scanner is not used to retain the first intention test to diagnose COVID-19”.
The WHO published several ARN test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with a first indent on 17 January.
The test uses the inverse transscription of the polymerace reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test may be performed on breathtaking or blood captures.
The results are usually available within a few hours or days.
Usually this test is performed on a rhinopharynx prey, but you can also use an aggregate. Many laboratory and enterprises are currently developing serumological tests that detect anticorps.
On April 6, 2020, no of them had been sufficiently reliable to be approved for generalized use.
In the United States, a serial test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by only certified laboratorys.
The characteristic image elements on radiographs and tomodensitometria (scanner) persons with symptoms include options to see asymmetric devices and the absence of pearl exposure.
The Italian Radiology Society is currently a international online online database of cases confirmed image results.
As a result of recovery with other infections such as adenovirus, PCR images are limited to detect COVID-19.
An important study in China has compared the results of the CPR and demonstrated that if the image is less precise for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, taking into account the exchange tool in the epidemic zones.
Convolutive nerons networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to detect virus characteristics in the image at time on radiographies and scanners.
The strategies for preventing the transmission of disease include a globally good personal hygiene, washing the hands, avoiding to touch the eyes, nest or mouth with non-shaped hands, and to throw or steal into a mouder, then throw it directly into a poubelle.
It was recommended to those who had already been condemned to carry a public chirurgic mask.
Physical disarmament measures were also recommended to prevent transmission; many Governments have prohibited or decised all non-scale movements to or from countries and sectors affected by epidemie.
However, the virus has reached the phase of the Community transmission in large areas of the planet.
This means that virus is spread in communities, and some of these communities do not know where they have been polluted. It is advised to professional health professionals who are infected to take normal precautions and contact precautions, and to carry protection lunches. Contact research is an important method to determine the source of infection and prevent future transmissions.
The use of translated telephone data by Governments in this regard raised confidentiality problems, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations which published a communiqué that had a limit to such monitoring.
Various mobile applications have been launched or proposed on the basis of the voluntary, and from 7 April 2020, more than ten of expert groups worked on respect for private life solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to save the presence of a user nearby other mobile phones.
The users will then receive a message if they were in contact with someone who has been positively tested at COVID-19. The fair ideas are currently circulated on the way to prevent infection; for example, turn to the nest and guarantee with the mouth bathroom is not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, but many organizations are currently endeavoured to develop it.
It is recommended to lay your hands to prevent the propagation of disease.
The CDC recommends people to lay hands often on saving and water for at least twenty seconds, particularly after having been on the toilettes or when the hands are visiblely saled; before eating; and after being mounted, beated or smoothed.
That's because outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by savon menager, which breaks its protective building.
The CDC also recommended to use an alcool-based desinfector, containing a volume of at least 60% alcohol when savon and water is not easy to access.
WHO advises people to avoid to touch the eyes, the nest, or the mouth with not washed hands.
The surfaces may be detected in several ways (in a minute of exhibition to the desinfectant for an inoxydable axis surface), including the etthanol to 62–71%, of isopropanol to 50–100%, of sodiumhydrochlorid to 0.1%, hydrogen peroxide to 0.5%, and iodal povidone at 0.2–7.5%.
Other solutions, such as Benzalconium clorure and chlorhexidin gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an establishment such as an immune or a crystal, all parts such as offices, toilettes, common rooms, as well as common electronic equipment such as tablets, tactic screens, keys, telecommunications, and automatic distributors used by sicknesses.
Health organizations advise people to cover their mouth and nest with their smoke or smoke when they are all or ever, and to throw everything immediately.
The chirurgic machines are recommended for those infected, as a machine can limit the volume and distance through the projected posts by speaking, emerging and alliance.
WHO issued instructions that explain where and when using the machines.
According to Stephen Griffin, a manner at the University of Leeds, “laid a mask can reduce the propension of people to touch their faces, which is an important source of infection in the absence of good hygiene of hands”. The use of the mass has also been predicted to those who have a potentially affected by disease.
WHO recommended mass to health persons only if they face an important risk, for example, if they care for a disease reached by COVID-19, even though she recognized that the mass port can help people not touch the face.
Many countries have began to encourage their population to use mass.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the port of non- medicine masks in tissue. China has specifically recommended use of health-related medicines to people, especially in cases of closeness (1 metres (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends to bring a chirurgic mask into public transport or well-bearing places.
In Thailand, health authorities encourage population to manufacture fair machines in themselves and to clean them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited public outputs without mask or other means to cover his neck and his mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam imposed the mask port to everybody in public places to protect himself and to protect others.
The Government of Austria has commanded every person to go into a supermarket take a mask.
Israel requested all his residents to bring a mask into public.
Taiwan, which produced ten million masks daily since mid-mars, imposed the port of the sea to train passengers and interurbian bus on April 1st.
The Panama has granted the port of a mask for each exit, while recommending the manufacture of an artisan mask to those who cannot buy it.
Masks were widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (yearly called physical distance) includes infections control measures aimed at accelerating the propagation of disease by reducing contacts between persons.
The methods include quarantine, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stages, theaters and commercial centres.
The methods of social distance can be applied by resting in itself by limiting its journeys, avoiding peoples, greeting and keeping a physical distance with others.
Many Governments are ororned or are now recommended social distance in the regions affected by the epidemic.
The maximum length of meetings recommended by the United States and Health agencies was rapidly reduced by 250 persons (or there is no known presence of COVID-19 in the region) to 50 persons, and later to 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany has aggregated public collections of more than two persons. The most aged adults and those caused under-jacent health problems such as diabetes, heart diseases, respiratory diseases, hypertension or impoveritive immunity systems have a more risk of serious disease and complications. They have thus been invited by the CDC to stay at home as much as possible in the areas affected by the epidemic. At the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health organizations began to replace the terms of " social detention" by " physical detention", to clarify the objectives of reducing physical contacts in preservating social connections, which are virtually or in a distance.
The use of the term “Social disistance” was to believe that it should be a whole social isolation rather than encourage people to keep contact with other means. Some authorities have published guidance on sexual health during the pandemics.
They understand the recommendation of having sexual reports only with a person with which you are alive, who has no virus or is not present the symptoms.
The home building was recommended for positive diagnosed persons at COVID-19 and those who think they are infected.
The health agencies have issued detailed instructions for a correct isolation. Many Governments have put or recommended individual quarantine development for living populations in the affected areas.
The most closest quarantine instructions were given to the people of the most risking groups.
The persons who have been exposed to a disease reached by COVID-19 and who have recently seen to a country or region where the transmission is very important have been invited to place in quarantine for 14 days from the time they could be exposed for the last time.
The control strategies of epidémics are an enclosure or removal, and an abstention.
The enhancement is carried out in the first phases of the epidemic and aimed at monitoring and isolating infected persons, as well as to introduce other infections and vaccination control measures to prevent the propagation of disease in the rest of the population.
When it is no longer possible to prevent the propagation of disease, efforts are turning to the stage of warning: measures are taken to accelerate this propagation and to stress their impact on the health care system and society.
Measures for enhancement and enhancement may be taken at the same time.
The removal requires extreme measures to intensify pandemic by reducing the number of basic reproduction at least 1. A part of the management of an infective disease epidemic is to try to attempt epidémic pic: this is what is called an applacing the epidémic core.
This allows to reduce the risk of uploading health services and gain time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Among the non-pharmatic interventions that can manage epidemics include personal prevention measures, such as hygiene of hands, mass and individual quarters; public detention measures such as the closure of schools and religious offices; public efforts to encourage the acceptation of such interventions and participation to them; as well as environmental actions such as the cleaning of surfaces. More drastic measures to juggle the epidemic have been taken in China since the gravity of this has become evident, such as the development of quarters in whole cities and astrict interdiction of travels.
Other countries also have taken a variety of measures to limit virus propagation.
The South Korea has introduced the expenditure of mass and quarantaine-based expenditures and sent warnings on the movement of infected persons.
Singapour provided financial support to infected persons who have been infected in quarantine, and infringed harm amended to those who had not done it.
Taiwan has increased the production of mass and has sanctified the acquisition of medical provisions. The simulation for the Great Britain and the United States shows that attainment (accélération but not the elimination of epidemic propagation) and the removal (reversing the development of the epidemic) faces significant challenges.
Optional attempt policy may reduce the demand for health care of 2/3 and half deaths, but cannot avoid hundreds of thousands of dead, and health care systems are undermined.
The removal may be privileged, but it should be continued as long as the circle virus in the human population (or the vaccine is available, if it is first), because in the contrary, the transmission is rapidly increased in the leave of measures.
The long-term intervention to remove pandemic has a social and economic cost.
There are no anti-viral treatments approved for COVID-19 but efforts for development, including existing treatment tests.
Adoption of medicines without order against rhume or drink consumption, as well as rest may contribute to the emphasis of symptoms.
According to gravity, oxygenotherapie, intraveinal perfusions and respiratory assistance can be necessary.
The use of steroids can adjust the results.
A number of composeds that have already been approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are currently studied for COVID-19 treatment.
The WHO stated that some “traditional and artistic remedies” can adjudicate the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Increased capacity and adaptation of health care for the needs of COVID-19 patients is described by WHO as a basic response measure.
The ECDC and the WHO Office for Europe have published guidelines for the attention of hospitals and primary health care for redeployment of resources at different levels, in particular by enhancing laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, canceling non-insufficient interventions when possible, separating and isolating positive tested patients at COVID-19, and strengthening intensive care capacity by staff training and increased in the number of available ventilators and libraries.
There are several theories concerning the origin place of all the first cases (named zéro patient).
The first case of the new coronavirus could return to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, in the province of Hubei in China.
In one month, the number of cases of coronavirus in Hubei gradually increased.
They are generally linked to the market of large sea fruits, which also sold live animals. According to a theory, the virus would come from one of these animals; in other words, he would have a zoonotic origin. A unknown pneumonia Foundation was observed on 26 December and was treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian to the hospital of the Hubei province, which informed the Wuhan Jianghan CD on 27 December.
On 30 December, a teacher group of Wouhan’s Central hospital teachers warned their colleagues of a “ coronavirus like ANNS”.
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were represented by the police for propaining roads, and one other, Ai Fen, was represented by its highests to give the warning.
The Municipal Health Commission of Wuhan published a public advice on 31 December and informed the WHO.
There were enough cases of an unknown pneumonia reported to Wuhan's health authorities to deploy the beginning of January. At the first phases of the epidemie, the number of cases doubt about seven days and thirteen days.
At the beginning and half of January 2020, the virus was propained to other Chinese province, assisted by the New Chinese Migration and the fact that Wuhan is a pool of transport and a major railing match.
On 20 January, China reported almost 140 new cases in one day, including two persons in Pékin and one in Shenzhen.
The later official data shows that 6 174 persons have already developed symptoms on 20 January 2020. On 26 March, the United States over China and Italy have shown the greatest number of cases confirmed in the world. On 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported in the world; more than 97,000 were dead and more than 364,000 were healed.
It was about 200 countries and territories at least one case.
As a result of the pandemic in Europe, many Schengen countries have limited movements and controls to borders.
National reactions included measures for enhancement, such as quarantine-based installations (for example called orders to stay home, place opening or confidence) and the coverages. At 2 April, approximately 300 million people, or approximately 90% of the population, more than 50 million people are confidenced to Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa and 1,3 billion in India.
On 26 March, 1,7 billion people in the world knew a form of confidence, a number was higher than 2.6 billion two days later — about a third of the world.
The origin of the first case confirmed by COVID-19 was dated on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; a not confirmed report suggests that the first case would be removed at 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed an unknown pneumonian foyer on 26 December, which she informed the Wuhan Jianghan CD on 27 December.
The initial general tests of patients of 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a coronavirus similar to the SES.
A public advice was issued by the Municipal Health Commission of Wuhan on 31 December.
WHO has been informed the same day.
Doctors in Wuhan have received a warning to have “propained rulers” about the epidemic.

Economist Mohamed El-Erian lodged the emergency measures taken in time by central banks and states.
Central banks react faster than they did it in the 2008 financial fund.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors because of movement prohibitions, the closure of public space, including tourism attractions, and recommendations of Governments against travel throughout the world.
Therefore, many airlines have rejected flights because of a decrease of the request, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British Aviation Society Flybe did fail.
The impact on the crowd sector has never been seen before.
Several gardens and ferry ports were also closed.
Epidémy coincisied with Chunyun, a major tourist season associated with the New An China.
A number of events involved important people have been canceled by national and regional governments, including the annual festivities of the New Year, and private enterprises also closed their stocks and touristic attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many events related to New An Monuary have been canceled and many tourism attacks have been closed to avoid the masse collections, including the Pékin prohibited City and the traditional temple feverors.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the holidays of New Year until 10 February, imposing most of the workplaces to not open before this date.
These regions represented 80 per cent of the PIB from the country and 90 per cent of exports.
Hong Kong has been at its highest level of response to infected diseases and has declared an emergency situation, stoping schools until March and canceling the New Year festivities. The distribution sector has been affected at the world level, with the reductions of the opening of stores or temporary closure.
The visits in trade in Europe and Latin America have resulted in 40 per cent.
In North America and the Middle East, traders found a decline of 50 to 60 per cent.
This also introduced a 33-43% of the pith circulation into the market centres in March compared to February.
The operators of the whole world-wide commercial centres imposed additional measures, such as the increased cleaning frequency, the installation of thermal scanners to control the temperature of customers and the cancellation of events. According to the estimation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, pandemic recession could allow 14-22 million additional persons in the condition of extreme poverty in Latin America compared to an unfair pandemic situation.
In January and February 2020, during the pic of epidemic in Wuhan, approximately 5 million people in China lost their employment.
In China, a large part of some 300 million of Russian migrant workers were blocked in internal or involved in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million of the United States lost their employment and requested assistance to the Government.
The coronavirus epidemics could cost 47 million employees in the United States and the unemployment rate could achieve 32 per cent, according to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Inde confidence left tens of indigenous migrant workers (received a periodic salary) to the unemployment. The investigation of the Angus Reid Institute observed that 44 per cent of Canadian households had had been a certain type of unemployment. For about 900 000 people have lost their employment in Spain since the confidence imposed to mid-mar 2020.
During the second half of March, four million French workers have made a request for temporary unemployment and 1 million of British workers have made an universal credit request. For a half million of German undertakings, their employees were based on a partly subventioned by the Government.
The German work compensation device was adopted by France and Britain.
The sectors of the spectacle and cultural heritage have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting organizations and individuals at the world's employees and independently.
The organizations of the arts and culture sector have tried to maintain their mission (financed by the State) to provide access to the cultural heritage to the community, to ensure the security of their employees and public workers and to support artists as possible.
In March 2020, the museums, libraries, spectacle rooms and other cultural institutions have been closed to the new order and their exhibitions, events and representations can be canceled or reported.
In response, intense efforts have been made to provide alternative services by digital platforms.There recent and accelerated disease, the cancellation of religious services, major sports events and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technological conferences and mode challenges.
The cinem industry also knew an interruption. The Vatican announced that the celebrations of the Holy Septuagin in Rome, which have been held last week of the Caribbean Pentecost period, were canceled.
Many dioces recommended the most old Christians to stay in themselves rather than assist the mixes of the Sunday; some churches distribute their religious services to radio, online, and directly or television while others propose to practice their culture in “ drive-in”.
At the end of the Roman Catholic diocèse of Rome who closed its churches and chapters and place of Saint-Pierre, who disappeared from all his Christian pioneers, other religious instances also rejected their services and limited public meetings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gordwars.
The Minister of Health of Iraq announced the cancellation of the prayers of the Friday in the areas touched by the epidemic and the holy places have been closed, while Saudi Arab prohibited the entry of foreign pioneers and its inhabitants in the sacred sites of the Medina.
Pandemie has caused the most important interruption of the World Sport calendar since the Second World War.
The most important sports events have been canceled, including the EUFA Ligue of Fields 2019-20, the English Championship of football 2019-20, the EUFA Euro 2020, the NBA 2019-20 season and the 2019-20 LNH race.
Epidémy perturbed the organization of the olympic games of the age of 2020, which initially had to start end July; the Olympic International Committee announced that the event would be "reformed over 2020, but later to age 2021." The casinos and other world games institutions closed and live poker tournaments were reported to be canceled.
This has made many players to register online, and many online games sites have found a significant increase in their number of new records. The spectacle world has also been touched, with several music groups who have suspended or canceled their concert tours.
Many of large theaters, such as those in Broadway, also have stopped all their representatives.
Some artists have searched for ways to continue to create and share their work on the Internet by replaceing direct traditional representatives, such as online concerts and directly or online festivals, created in online, to disseminate and promoting their works.
On online, many of themes on the theme of coronavirus have been propained because many privileges the humor and the distraction towards uncertainty.
Since the COVID-19 epidemics, a reduction of prejudices, xenophobia and racism was found to the people of Chinese and is Asian origin and to those who are sensitive in Europe, in the United States and in other countries.
In many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asian and the Pacific region, have been observed incidents related to fear, suspicion and humility.
The reports from February (for the majority of the cases were still limited to China) described racistic feelings expressed in different groups through the world by which the Chineses meant the virus or received a fair punishment.
Some African countries also found an increase in anti-China's feeling.
Many people in Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination on their regional origin.
The support was provided to China, either online or outline, and to the inhabitants of the areas touched by the virus.
Following the progress of epidemic to new sensitive countries, the Italians, inhabitants of the first country of Europe to undertake a serious COVID-19 epidemic, could also face the suspicion and xenophobia. The citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have been signed in a first time to prohibite Chineses to enter into their countries to stop disease.
In Japan, the hamday #ChineseDontComeToJapan was anger on Twitter.
China and other Asians living in the United Kingdom and the United States have reported an increase in racistic insulin levels, as well as aggression.
The American President Donald Trump faced the critic for qualified the coronavir of "Chinois virus", a term considered by his detractors as racist and anti-chinois.
In Ukraine, manifestators attacked Ukrainian transporting bus and foreign evacuants between Wuhan and Novi Sanzhary.
Found students from North-East India, who shared a border with China, and students in large Indian cities would have undertaken in connection with the epidemic of coronavirus.
The President of the Unity of Bengalia-Oknown of Bharatiya Janata Party Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese destroyed the nature and “This is why God took his reproach on them.”
The comments were later condemned by the Chinese advice in Colkata, which qualifies them of "feeds". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-China, foreigners have been described as "related waste" that it should be " eliminated".
Many newspapers paid them for any or part of their covering on the coronavirus.
Many scientific editors have provided their scientific articles in connection with the epidemic in free access.
Some scientists chosen to share their results quickly on bioRxiv prepublication servers such as bioRxiv.
Infective Maledia – Infected Maladie issue of a pathogenic agent emergent, often new about epidémic amplitude or mode of transmission

The laboratory release of respiratory disease at coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated virus SARS-CoV-2 includes virus detection methods and anticorps response to infection.
The presence of virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the coronavir.
This analysis is specifically designed to detect only the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm the very recent or active infections.
Anticorps (seerology) can be used at the time for diagnostic and population monitoring.
The tests of anticorps show how many persons had contracted disease, including persons whose symptoms were too light to be declared or asymptomatics.
A precise mortality rate of the disease and collective immunity level among the population may be determined from the results of this test.
As a result of limited expenditure, no countries had reliable data on the prevalence of virus in March 2020.
On 23 March, no countries had tested more than 3 per cent of its population, and there were important differences in the number of tests carried out in each country.
This variability is likely to be significantly affected by signaled lightness rates, which may be considerably overvalued in some countries.
Inverse transscription followed by a real-time polymerization reaction (RRT-PCR), the test may be carried out on respiratory samples obtained with various methods, including Nasophalyn equipped or the expertise sample.
The results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
The RT-PCR test carried out from farming buildings is only reliable for the first week of disease.
Following, virus can disappear from the hook while it continues to increase in pomeons.
For infected persons tested during the second week, a sample may also be used in deep breathtaking paths by aspiration cattheter, or a crachat (expertation) can be used.
One of the first tests of the PCR was developed by Charity in Berlin in January 2020 with an inverse transscription followed by a real-time polymerization reaction (RRT-PCR), and constituted the basis of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The United Kingdom has also developed a test on 23 January 2020. The South Korean society Kogenebiotech has developed a Clinical Quality Detection kit of SARS-CoV-2 based on PCR (PowerChek Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It describes the "E" generally shared by all the borrows and RdRp specific to the SARS-CoV-2. In China, the BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency authorisation of the national medical management of the SARS-CoV-2 medicines for a kit of detection of SARS-2 based on the PCR.In the United States, the United States ' s control and prevention of diseases (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC) distributed their diagnostic devices by RT-PCR in real time of the new coronavir 2019 (20-19-CoV) to public health laboratorys by the Intermediary of National Resource Resource.
Among the former test versions of Atlanta's test test tests, a genetic test obtained not concluded results because of defective reactive reactions, as well as an outbreaking of tests to the CDC in Atlanta. In fact, a average of more than 100 per day tests were conducted with success throughout the February 2020 month.
The tests used by two components were not considered as reliable until 28 February 2020, and it is only that the federal and local laboratory had been authorized to start the expenditure.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency authorisation of use.The United States Trade Laboratories started the exemption at the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 tests based on RT-PCR.
This Diagnostics also distributed COVID-19 tests at the national level on 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limitation has been declared. The collection and processing of samples must be carried out in accordance with the CCD requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the National Food and Biotechnologie VECTOR National Research Centre.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Monitoring Service. On 12 March 2020, it was announced that Mayo Clinic had developed an infection test at COVID-19.The 13 March 2020 Roche Diagnostics has received the authorisation of the DAF for a test that could be performed in large amounts at 3,5 hours, and an outstanding device of approximately 4 128 tests at 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, FDA granted an emergency authorisation (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for a test on the M2000 system of Abbott. FDA had previously granted similar authorisation to Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepity also received a EUA from the DAF for a test of approximately 45 minutes.
FDA approved a test that uses the isothermic acceleration technology of nucléc acids instead of the PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method may provide positive results in only five minutes and 13 minutes.
It is now about 18,000 of these devices in the United States, and Abbott is intended to intensify the manufacturing to provide 50,000 tests daily. A test using a monoclonal anticorps that is specifically linked to the protein of nucléocapside (Protein N) of the new coronavirus is running in Taiwan in the hope that it can provide results within 15-20 minutes, as a fast test of the grippe.
In March 2020, a bibliographical study concluded that “polymic radiographies present a low diagnostic value in the first stages, while TDM’s results [tomodensometry] can be concluded before the appearance of symptoms”.
Among TDM-type symptoms there are opacities in seeing multi-locale depolis with a device, asymetric and later distribution.
A sub-dominal predominance, a crazy sting and consolidation is developed as a result of evolution disease.
A study compared to TDM in Wuhan, at the origin of the current pandemic, suggested that TDM is much more sensitive than the PCR, even less precisely, many of its co-incident picture results with other pneumonias and diseases.
In March 2020, the American Radio College recommends that “TDM is not used for expenditure or as a first line test to diagnose COVID-19” in March 2020.
The production of anticorps, including IgM and IgG, is part of immunity response to infection.
These may be used to detect infection in about 7 days after the appearance of symptoms, to determine immunity and in the framework of population monitoring.The tests may be performed in central laboratory (TLC) or by testing of the patient (point-off-care testing, PoCT).
High-debit automatised systems are able to achieve these analysis, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For TLC, a single blood sample is usually used, although serious samples can be used to follow immunity response.
For the PoCT, one blood sample is usually preleted by cutaneous position.
In the difference of the PCR methods, no stage of extraction is required before the analysis.FDA has appointed 29 entities to be informed by the agency and, therefore, could now distribute anti-corps tests.
On April 7, 2020, one test was approved by the FDA under an emergency authorisation.Finn March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European authorisations for their test kits, capable of detecting anticorps IgG and IgA against the virus in blood samples.
The exemption capacity is a number of hundreds of samples in a few hours, which is clearly faster than the Viral ARN PCR test.
The anticorps are generally detectable 14 days after the beginning of the infection.The United Kingdom found that no of the anti-corps purchased by the country was sufficiently performing to be used.
Hong Kong has established a plan in which the cases suspicioned may remain at home, “the service of emergency will provide a tube to the patient”, the patients crawn inside, return and receive the result of the test.The British NHS has announced that it leads a pilot project to teaching cases suspected at home, which eliminates the risk that a patient does not be infected by others in a hospital or the need to desinfect a ambulance in the case of use.As the framework of the COVID-19 test testing for suspects, a health professional has made a sample with appropriate precautions.
The ' drive' centres allowed the South Korea to achieve one of the most fast and explosive disasters in the world.In Germany, the National Factors Health Association stated on 2 March that it had the ability to achieve about 12,000 tests on the day and 10 700 patients were tested during the previous week.
The costs are supported by the disease insurance when the test is prescribed by a doctor.
According to the President of the Institute Robert Koch, Germany has a total capacity of 160 000 tests per week.
On March 19, drive tests were available in several large cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests made in Germany was unknown because only positive results were declared.
A first laboratory study showed that a total of at least 483 295 samples had been tested until the week 12/20 and that 33 491 samples (6.9%) had been achieved a positive result for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers of the Technion and hospital Rambam have developed and tested a method of an analysis of 64 patients at the time, in grouping the samples and in re-producing the exhibition that if the combined scene is revealed positif. ANT Wuhan, an unprovised laboratory laboratory of emergency of 2 000 patients of Huemo-Yen (China) may be used by 10 ml.
By its construction in 5 days overseeing Wang Jian, the BGI founder revealed that the cases in the province of Hubei would have been 47% higher and that the corresponding cost of the quarantine implementation would be doubled without this exemption capacity.
Wuhan's laboratory was quickly followed by Huo-Yan in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in 12 Chinese cities in total.
On 4 March 2020, the total periodic capacity was earning to 50 000 tests per day.The free multiple models developed by Origami Assays have been published to test up to 1 122 samples of patients for COVID-19 using only 93 tests. These balanced models may be implemented in small laboratory laboratorys without liquid robots.
In March, inadequate amounts and reactive amounts have become an extent for the excavation of mass in the EU, the United Kingdom and the United States.
This situation has made some authors to consider the preparation protocols of samples involved in heating the samples of 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to liberate ARN genomen to continue the exemption. 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates were now the country testing the most part of its population in the Coronavirus, and were in pass to intensify the expenditure to attend the majority of the population.
These results were achieved by a combination of the capacity of conducting drives and acquiring a high-dependent laboratory at the population level of Group 42 and BGI (based on their emergency detection laboratorys in China).
In 14 days, the laboratory is able to conduct ten thousands of RT-PCR tests daily and is the first laboratory of this capacity to be operated outside China.
Different test forms of various parts of the genetic profile of the coronavirus have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula to manufacture kits sent to low income countries with no resources necessary to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020. The protocol developed by the United States ' s disease control Centres was published only on 28 January, with acknowledging the availability of tests to the United States. China and the United States had problems at the level of the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the epidémic, and those countries, as well as Australia, could not provide sufficient kits to respond to the request and recommendations of health specialists.
However, specialists indicate that the great availability of tests in South Korea has contributed to reducing the propagation of the new coronavirus.
The expensive capacity, mostly in the private sector laboratory, has been strengthened during several years by the South Korean Government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization recommended the reinforcement of expenditure programs as a better means for raising the COVID-19 Pandemy Pandemic.The strong demand for tests resulting in wide spread by virus has caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratorys, and the reservations of ecouplens and chemical reactive reserves.
In March 2020, China reported problems related to the reliability of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC presented "standards".The government then eliminated the bureaucratic bathrooms that caused private tests.The Spain bought test kits at the Chinese society Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but it was not reliable.
The company explained that erroneous results could be linked to the incapacity to collect samples or to correctly use kits.
The Spanish Ministry stated that he would remove the kits given erroneous results and would replace them by another test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.80% of the test kits bought in China by the Czech Republic have provided false results.
The first Minister Matovič suggested to throw them into the Danube. The Kara Ethiopian Kara of the Ministry of the Turc Health said that the test kits had bought to China a high rate of error, and that it had not been used. The United Kingdom has bought 3,5 million kits of testing in China, but said to begin April 2020 that they were unutilisable.
The exhibition, followed by the quarantine of those receiving positive results and trafficking of persons in contact with the SARS-CoV-2 ports, gave positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the first death linked to COVID-19 in Italy, conducted two series of tests at the total of about 3 400 people, about ten days of intervalle.
Approximately half persons obtaining positive results were not present symptoms, and all discovered cases were made in quarantine.
With the restriction of movements into the common, this measure fully eliminated new infections.
With aggressive contact trafficking, the restrictions of entering travels, expenses and quarantine, the pandemic of coronavirus from 2020 to Singapour has progressed at least fast than in other developed countries, but without extreme restrictions such as the closure of restaurants and sales facilities.
Many events have been canceled, and Singapour began to advise residents to stay at 28 March, but schools moved on the date planned at the end of holidays on 23 March.
Many other countries also have managed the pandemic with aggressive trafficking of contacts, restrictions of incoming travels, deployment and implementation of quarantine, but with less aggressive confidence, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study discovered that the most testing countries, compared to the number of deaths, have much lower rates, probably because these countries are more difficult to detect persons who have only light symptoms or no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries without analyzing capacity and national laboratorys only have limited COVID-19 experience of their five first positive samples and ten first negative samples of COVID-19 at one of the 16 reference laboratory laboratorys of the WHO to achieve confirmation tests.
Among the 16 reference laboratory, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the 'Positive in % tests' column depends on national expenditure policy.
A country that tests that persons admitted to hospital will have a higher value in % of higher tests than a country that tests all the citizens, which present or not symptoms, other factors are the same.
The hand washing, also called hygiene of hands, consistes in cleaning hands to remove sales, fats, microorganisms or other indésirable substances.
The fact of seating hands systematically with savon to some "clean models" of the day prevents the propagation of many diseases, such as diarrhee and cholera, which are transmitted through gold-fecale path.
It is possible to contract respiratory diseases such as grippe or rhume, for example, in order to wake the hands before touching the eyes, nice or mouth (e.g. muscles).
It is important to wake your hands in the savon at five key moments of the day: before and after the defectation, after cleaning the feeds of a baby or changed beds, before dining a child, before eating and before and after preparing meat or handmaid meat, fish, or flower.
If you don't have water or saving under your hand, you can lay your hands in the census. The World Health Organization recommends to wake your hands:
front, during and after the preparation of feedings;
before and after being occupied by a person who has been sick;
After changed the beds of a child or cleanered a child who went to the toilettes;
after mounting or shoting up/term;
after touching animal, food for animals or waste of animal origin;
Medical hands hygiene refers to medical practices.
The fact that wear the hands before administration of medicines or prevent medical care may prevent or reduce the propagation of diseases.
The main medical objective of the hand milk is to eliminate pathogine agents (bacteries, virus or other microorganisms that can cause diseases) and chemicals, which may be damaged or cause diseases.
This practice is particularly important for people who manipulate food or work in medical, but also for the great public.
The lavage of hands has many benefits for health, including reduction of greep, coronavirus and other infective diseases; prevention of infective causes of diarrhea; reduction of respiratory infection;
as well as reduction of child mortality rates during home acquirements.
According to a study carried out in 2013, the improvement of hand hygiene practices could lead to easier improvement of children in less than five years.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory diseases and diarrhea may be reduced by introducing simple behaviour changes, such as saving hands.
This simple practice can reduce the mortality rate related to these diseases of approximately 50%.
The establishment of actions aimed at promoting the washing of hands could reduce about a third of the diarrhea episodes, comparable numbers to the receipt of potable water by approving regions with low income.
The savon hands are laid up allowed to reduce 48% diarrhea episodes and represent the most effective and less costful means of preventing diarrhea and respiratory infections (IRA). It is a act that must be automatically done in foyers, schools and world communities.
The pneumonian, one of the main IRA, is the first cause of mortality in children under five years, which is about 1,8 million victims per year.
The diarrhea and the pneumonia are each year the deaths of about 3,5 million children.
According to UNICEF, the fact that the standard to wake the hands with saving before food and after going to the toilettes may save more life than any vaccine or medical intervention, and reduce the deaths in the diarrhoes and a quarter of deaths imputable to high respiratory infection.
The hand washing is generally linked to other health measures within water, sanitation and hygienic programmes (WASH).
The hand layer also protects the impetion, which is transmitted directly by physical contact.
The smaller effect, the frequenting lavage of the hands can disappear the hair by provocing a cutaneous disappearance.
A Danish study in 2012 revealed that the extensive lavage of hands could lead to ocema or denmatite at hand level, characterized by a skilled hair and dismangement, and particularly frequent in health workers.
The too frequent hand washing is also considered as one of the symptoms of the compulsional obsessional trouble (TOC).
It is important to wake your hands on the saving at five key moments of the day to reduce the transmission of gold-fecale diseases: before and after using the toilettes (mix, defectation), after cleaning the fees of a child (or changed beds), before dinner a child, before eating and before and after preparing meat or handling of flesh, fish or crown flow.
The hands should also be laid correctly to prevent transmission of diseases, including before and after submit a cut or wound, after heavy or moving, after touching animals or manipulated disappearances and after touching ordures.
In many countries, savon's hand cleaning rate is low.
According to a study carried out in 2015 by 54 countries, and 38.7% of the middle female hygiene had the hands of savon. A study conducted in 2014 showed that it was Saudi Arabia that the rate was the highest (97 per cent), the United States were in the middle of table (77 per cent) and China showed the lowest rate (23 per cent). There are now several methods to develop the behaviour and democraze the use of savon for the washing of hands at the key moments of the day. In particular, in developing countries, it is expected to propose the workers of the groups at the same time.
For example, the Department of Philipines Education has implemented a primary health care programme in order to promote health and children's education.
Two times per year, associated with the daily swimming washing of hands on savon and the daily dent browser of dentry with a flower dentist, is in the heart of this national programme.
He has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
To improve the elimination of the microorganisms present on the skin must be added snow or detergents to the water.
The main action of knowledge and detergents is to reduce obstacles to solution and to increase solution.
The only water is not a cleaning cleaning for the skin because lipids and proteins, which are organic materials of the ground, are hardly clean in water.
However, a adequate water debit facilitates cleaning.
The solid savon, because of its reutilisable nature, can refer bacteries to previous uses.
A small number of studies on the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid savon concluded that the transfer was little likely because the bacteries were recycling with the mousse.
The CCDC Monitoring and Prevention Centre indicates that the liquid saving automatic distributors are preferable.
Antibacterian knowledge have been strongly recommended to persons concerned with their health status.
There is no evidence to suggest that the use of anti-septics or desinfectors are allowed to target resistant organs to antibiotics in the nature.
However, antibacterians contain current antibacterian agents such as the triclosian, which remains of many dreams of organisms.
Therefore, even though the antibiotic smokes are not the fruit of antibacterian skills, these could not be as effective as announced.
Besides the tensioactive and protector of the hair agent, the most complex forms may contain acidoms (actico actic acid, accorbic acid, lactic acid) served to regulate pH, benzoïc acid, with antimicrobian function, and other protection agents (the real, vitamines, menthol, the extra plants). A rigorous analysis of the Oregon University's public health is stated that the ordinary seats were as effective as anti-bacterian seats for individuals and containing triclosans, to prevent the diseases and eliminate the control of the hands.
Heat water used to lay your hands is not enough warm to kill bacteries.
The bacteries are more faster than the temperature of the body (37 °C).
However, weaken and saving water is more effective than fresh and saving water to eliminate natural oils of sales and bacteries.
However, in contrast to the popular credibility, scientific studies showed that the use of tired water could not contribute to reducing microbian load on hands.
A desinfector or an anti-septic for hands is a non-water hand hygiene product.
At the end of 1990 and at the beginning of the 19th century, the hygiene hygiene products of non-acquisitive hands based on alcohol (only called hydroalcool solutions, antiseptic solutions for hands or desinfective hands) began to popularize.
Most are formulated on the basis of isopropylic alcohol or etthanol associated with an epaising agent such as a carbon (polymera of acrylic acrylic acid) to obtain a wheat, or like glycerin to obtain liquid or mousse for a greater easy of use and reduce the effect of alcohol.
The addendum of diluted hydrogen peroxide increased antimicrobian activity.The desinfectors for hands containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol are effectively eliminating germen.
Hydroalcool solutions kill bacteries, multiresistent bacteria (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some virus (as HIV, herpes, VRS, rehinovirus, vaccine, grippe and hepatite), and campagnes.
The hydroalcool solutions containing 70% alcool solutions containing 99.97% (resolution of 3,5, equivalent to 35-decible loghis) of 30 seconds following the application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 log) of the bacteries presented on the hands 1 minutes after the application.
The hydroalcool solutions are almost fully ineffective against norrovirus type virus (or Norwalk), the main cause of container gastrotherite. A sufficient amount of desinfector for hands or hydroalcool solution must be used to hide or cover the two hands.
The paum and the two hands should be crossed, as well as the interests between the fingers and the ungles for about 30 seconds, until the liquid, the mousse or the swiss yellow.
The American Centre for Control and Prevention of diseases should also be cleaned by the fingerprints, in particular when the hands are visiblely saled.
The increased use of these products is due to their easy use and fast elimination of microorganisms; however, they should not replace an adequate hand washing unless you have water and saving hands.
The frequent use of hydrolcohol solutions may lead to a cutaneous disappearance if the formula is not strengthened by emolents and/or hydratant agents of the skin.
The effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other potents to the formula.
In the context of clinical tests, hydroalcool solutions containing emotional emotional solutions have proved clearly less detrimentation and cutaneous seasure than the knowledge or detergent anti-microbics.
The allergic contact denmatite, contact urticary or hypersensibility at alcohol or additives present in hydro-alcool solutions are rare.
The fact that hydroalcohol solutions have less tend to provoke irritant contact denmates made them more attractive than water milk and saving hands.
Despite their effectiveness, the non-water products do not eliminate organic materials presented on the hands, but desinfect them.
For this reason, the desinfectors for hands are not so effective as saving and water to avoid the propagation of many pathogans, since these remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of disinfectors for non-alcool hands is strongly depending on ingrédients and formulary, and has always been highly lower than the alcohol and the desinfectors based on alcohol.
Recently, the forms used by Benzalconium clorure presented a sustainable and cumulative anti-mixrobian activity after application, with the difference of alcohol, which the effectiveness after repeated use, probably because of progressive warranted reactions.
In populations with low income, many are those who do not have the means to buy saving, rather use the census or the earth.
Circle or earth can be more effective than water only, but less than they know it.
Moreover, if the land or cereal is polluted by microorganisms, it is likely to increase the propagation of diseases instead of freining it.
The cener is also a desinfective agent, because, in contact with the water, it forms an alcaline solution.
WHO recommends the cereal or saving as an alternative to savon when it is not available.
The American Centre for Monitoring and Prevention of disease recommends that the hands of preventing the transmission of diseases, as follows:
Shut up the hands with the current steel or cold water.
The current water is recommended because of the pollution risk of the washing water points, while water temperature seems not to be different.
To move a generous quantity of savour on the hands by flowing the one against the other, without forgeting the two of the hands, between the fingers and under the knees.
Savon eliminates the hair germs, and studies show that people tend to wake their hands more sensitive when they use saving than only water.
Front for at least 20 seconds.
The action of creating fresh fresh, which helps to eliminate the hair germen, and cold more longer to remove more germes.
Rear abundantly to the current water.
The recovery in an enclosing water basin can lead to the recognition of hands.
Safe with a clean or free service.
Mood and humid hands are more easily reviewed.The most of the most forgotten zones are the powder, weight, spaces between fingers and under the holes.
Artists and snaps can accommodate microorganisms.
Hydratant lection is often recommended to avoid having sweet hands; cutaneous seed favours the appearance of cutaned leons that can increase the risk of transmission of infections.
There are many economic alternatives to lay the hands when the water of the robinet and/or savon is not available. For example, shopping water from a bidon or a sustained and hazard gourd and/or use of the water as needed in developing countries.In the situations where water supply is limited (such as in the schools or rural areas of developing countries), there are solutions to economize water, such as the tippy staps and other economic options.
A tippy tap is a simple technology that uses a breast suspicious for a heart, and a pendel that allows to throw a small amount of water on hands and savon bread.
The effective shock of hands is a essential part of the hand hygiene process, but the best way to cut hands in public tolls is discussed.
In addition, more research suggests that paper servicings are much more hygienic than electric shoes often found in toilettes.
In 2008, a study financed by the Swedish paper industry, the European Tisue Symposium, was conducted by the University of Westminster (Londres), to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper servicing services, warm air-mans and more modern shoes.
After milk and swimming hands in the hot air, it was revealed that the total number of bacteries increased average of 194% on the finger powder and 254% on the paumes.
The shock in the winter shoes was a average increase in the total number of bacteries on the powder of the fingers of 42% and the pools of 15%.
Following the milk and shopping of hands with a paper service, the total number of bacteries was reduced by 76% in average on the pool of the fingers and up to 77% on the paumes, scientifics also conducted tests to determine whether there was an increased contamination potential with other toilettes and the environment of toilettes according to each method of seating.
The smoke of the air thick, which is soft from the air outside the device at announced speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h); 400 mph; it is capable of extracting the microorganisms of the hands and of the device and eventually containing other toilettes and the environment of toilettes in a period of up to 2 metres.
The use of a warm air swimming sugar allows microorganisms to diffuse to a maximum distance of 0.25 meters of the mixture.
The paper service services showed that there was no significant proliferation of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study conducted by the TÜV Product and Environment, various hand-screen methods were evaluated.
After the screw of the hands, the following variations of the bacterian birth were observed:
There are many different steel producers, and the mixed sacks have been compared to the sackage with the support of paper service cards.
Hands milk with desinfective lenses is an alternative solution during movements, in the absence of saving and water.
hydroalcool solutions must be contained at least 60 % of alcohol.
The milk of hands in the medical environment has become well after Hungary Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) to prevent hospital diseases.
There are electronic devices that submit memories when the hospital staff forgot to lay your hands.
A study showed that their use was reduced by infection rates.
The hands' medicinal washing must take at least 15 seconds, using a generous amount of savon and water or ice to moving and cut each part of the hands.
The hands must be cut one against the other by passing between the fingers.
In the case of residue under the ungles, it is possible to use a pool browser to remove them.
As the grounds present in the water are likely to stay on the hands, it is important to relax and spend with a proper service.
After the screw, the paper service should be used to close the robinet (and open the output door as appropriate).
This allows you to avoid the re-examining hands to the surface contact.
The goal of the hands milk in health structures is to remove pathogenic microorganisms („ Germans”) and to avoid their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the insufficient rate of hand cleaning remains unacceptable in most medical institutions, a large number of doctors and hospitals who regularly forget to lay their hands before touching their patients, which prefers the transmission of microorganisms.
According to a study, the fact that wearing hands correctly and following other simple procedures may reduce the rate of blood infections related to catheters. The World Health Organization has published a brochure that describes the standard procedure to pursue and cut the hands in the field of health.
The draft directive on the hygiene of hands established by the Organization may also be consulted on the site to collect international comments.
A relevant analysis was carried out by Whitby and al.
Trade devices may measure and certifie hand hygiene if the respect of the regulation is observed.
The World Health Organization defines "Finq indications" relating to hand hygiene:
after exhibition to the blood/ to a biological liquid;
before a aseptic steel; and
After having been contacted with patient. The fact of adding anti-septic chemicals to savon (medely "medly" or "antimicrobians") to the hands lactent an action of destruction of germen.
It is desired to eliminate these germes before performing an chirurgic operation or in the environments where the residents in antibiotics are very widespread. For se "frotter" the hands for a chirurgic operation, it is necessary to have a robinet that can open and close it without touching it with the hands, a product of milk clorhexidine or iode, steel servicing to cover the hands after wearing them, a steel browser to frow and another instrument to clean under the knalls.
All holes must be removed.
In the context of this procedure, it is necessary to wake the hands and fronts to the cut, usually for 2 to 6 minutes.
It's not necessary to cut your hands for 10 minutes.
During the receipt, it must be avoided that the water on the front browses go up to the hands.
Once the hands were laid, it must be sealed with the hands of a steel line and infilter a chirurgic house.
To reduce germen propagation, it is preferable to wake your hands or use an anti-septic for the hands before and after taking care of a sick person.
Concerning the control of infections in the hospitals, it was found that the main benefits of the hand washing was obtained in the first 20% of the milk, and that it was only very little additional benefits to increase hands milk frequency over 35%.
If the hand washing is compared with a regular savon with an anti-bactric savon, the infective bacterian diseases transmitted to food is more than three times higher. In comparing the cleaning of hands with a alcohol solution and the washing of hands with an anti-bactric savon for a average period of 30 seconds each other, it is noted that the first reduction of the bacterian contamination of 26% compared to the second.
But saving and water are more effective than alcohol products to reduce the Cross A (H1N1) virus and Clostridium spores present on the hands. In order to improve the hygiene of hands in health care institutions, it is in particular possible to form staff in hands milk, to put more alcohol products on the basis of the disposal of this and to address written and verbal memories on this subject.
More further research needs to discover the most effective interventions in various health structures.
In developing countries, we consider that saving hands are a little costful and essential tool to maintain health, although it is correctly food.
However, because of the lack of reliable water points, saving or installations to lay hands in the house, in the school and in the workplace, it is difficult to achieve universal hygiene hygiene customs.
For example, in the major part of the rural Africa, it is rare to find robinets to lay hands nearly private or public toilettes, despite the existence of economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, the weak washing rates of hands may also be imputable to usual tensions, rather than to a lack of savon or water.
The fact of promoting the saving washing of hands and of making awareness in this regard can affect political decisions, knowing the benefits related to this practice and bringing a long-term behaviour change in the population.
To ensure that start, it is necessary to carry out monitoring and evaluation activities.
A systematic review of 70 studies showed that local approaches are effective to increase the washing rate of hands in low and medium-sized countries and that social marketing campaigns are less effective, and in relation to the promotion of hands milk in schools, the example of " UNICEF stars " can be cited by three schools, which encourages schools to take simple and less cost-effective steps to ensure that students have been laid hands with savon, in accordance with other hygiene rules.
Once minimum standards are reached, schools can go from one to three end stars.
The construction of hand washing stations can be included in the hand-based hygiene promotion campaigns to reduce child mortality and child mortality.
The World Layer Day is another example of awareness campaign that prevents the development of the behaviour.In addition to the 2019-20 coronaus pandemic of 2020, UNICEF encouraged the adoption of an emoji that illustrates the hand lab.
A number of studies have reviewed the global cost performance report of hand washing in developing countries with regard to the number of years of living in good health (e.g. DALY evitated).
However, a record suggests that the promotion of savon hands milk is much more rentable than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of the human health milk washing was identified for the first time in the middle of the XIXe century by two pioneers of the hygienic hygiene: Hongrois Ignaz Semmellust who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the "based of modern diseases" British.
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused to the fetied earliers called mysmy.
In 1980, food origin epidemics and the infections of ourocommunities have conducted the US Centres for control and prevention of diseases to promote more active hygiene of hands as an essential means for preventing infections propagation.
The appearance of the porc grippe in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 leaded to a greater conscience in many countries concerning the need to lay hands with savon to prevent these infective diseases.
For example, in Germany, the “budgetary hand washing techniques” have been placed next to the rivers in public toilettes and in the toilettes of offices and airports.
The expression "to lay your hands" refers to the refusal of a person to assess the responsibility or to be compliant of something.
It is issued from a Bible verse of Matthieu in which Ponce Pilate was laid the hands of the decision to crucifie Jesus Christ, but this expression was widely spread in some English communities.
In Macbeth, of Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth engaged to lay hands in a compulsory way to try to clean a imaginary taste, a symbol of his bad conscience regarding the crimes that she had committed and urged her husband to commit.
It was also found that some persons, after remembering having committed acts contrary to Ethiopia or have expected to do it, have tried to lay hands more often than others and to give more value to hand washing devices.
Furthermore, those authorised to lay their hands after having this kind of thought are less excited to give themselves to other compensatory measures of “ purification”, such as the well-being.
Some religions prescrive the lavage of hands for purposes at the hygienic and symbolic time. The symbolic lavage of the hands, which consists of use of water and not saving to wake the hands, is part of the rival of hands lag up before in many religions, including the garism and the Hindouism, immersion (WElah) and the ritual absolution of hands (Nétilat Yadayim) in the Jewishme, the lavabo in Christianism and the hymics. The religions also prescrive the lavage of hands for hygiogeneous purposes, particularly after certain actions.
According to the Sindourism, the Jewish and Islam, it is obligation to lay the hands after he went to the toilettes.
Likewise, Hindouism, Buddhism, Sixism, Jewish and Islam requires to wake your hands before and after every breakfast.
COVID-19 risk controls on the workplace
COVID-19 risk risk controls describe the implementation of health and safety methodology for the control of risks in order to prevent cronvirus disease (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk controls on the workplace vary on the basis of an assessment of the risks of exhibition sources, the severity of disease in the community and individual factors of workers that can be vulnerable to infection by COVID-19.
According to the Office of Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, employment at least a minimum vocational contact with the public and other partners. In this case, only basic prevention measures are recommended, including the hand washing, the encouragement of workers to stay in the house if they are sick, the respiratory label and the maintenance of cleaning and desinfection of the work environment.
Employment to middle exhibition include the need for frequent or close contacts with persons without COVID-19 suspected or known, but that they may be infected because of the current Community transmission or an international travel.
This includes employees in contact with the great public, in particular in schools, high-depth work environments and some large detail environments.
The risk controls in this group, además of infection prevention-based measures, include a ventilation in support of high-effective air filters, hygienic vitries and the development of a individual protection equipment in case of meetings with a COVID-19 person affected.
The OSHA considers health and functional workers expressed to persons with a suspected COVID-19 or known as a high risk of exhibition, to a very high risk if they carry out procedures produced by airlines or removals or manipulation of individuals with a suspected or known COVID-19.
The risk controls for those workers include technical controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and individual protection equipment adapted to the task.
COVID-19 epidemics may have several effects on the workplace.
Workers may be disappeared because they are sick, need to take care of other persons or fear a possible exhibition.
Commercial models can change both in terms of required goods and means of acquiring them (not to make their courses outside point hours or use delivery or drive services).
Finally, the expiration of articles resulting from serious geographical regions affected by COVID-19 may be interrupted. A preparation and response plan to infected diseases may be used as guide for protection measures.
The plans take into account the levels of risk related to different jobs and jobs, including exhibition sources, risk factors related to the family and Community context and individual factors of workers such as adult or chronic pathology.
They also appreciate the necessary controls to address these risks and emergency plans for situations that may be present following epidemics.
The preparation and response plans to infected diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of response to epidemic include the reduction of staff transfer, the protection of higher risks of medical complication, the maintenance of commercial operations and the reduction of the effects on other parts of their approval chains.
The graveness of disease in the community where the company affects the responses applied.
Risk controlry is a global health and safety framework to group risk controls on effectively.
When COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are technical controls, monitoring administrative controls and finally individual protection equipment.
Technical controls implies to isolate employees’ risks related to workers without need to retain on the behaviour of workers and can constitute the most economic solution to implement.
Administrative controls designate changes of policies or procedures to work that require a action by the employer or employer.
The individual protection equipment (EPI) is considered less effective than technical and administrative controls, but can contribute to prevent certain exhibitions.
All types of EPI must be selected in line with the risk for the worker, correctly adapted according to the needs (e.g., respiratory machines), correctly and systematic, inspected, regularly contained and replaced according to the needs, and correctly retained, cleaned and stored or rebuilt to avoid any contamination.
According to the Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the United States, employment at least a minimum vocational contact with the public and other partners.
The basis for prevention of infection recommended for all working places include a milk of the hands of frequent and momental hands, encouragement of workers to stay in the house if they are sick, respiratory label, in particular covering the mouth and the snow for all and enclosing, providing furniture and poubels, preparing to the television or hours of work to need, dissuasiveness of workers to use the tools and equipment of others and maintenance of the net and desinfection of the work environment.
The rapid identification and isolation of potentially infective persons is a crucial stage of the protection of workers, customers, visitors and others on a workplace.
The United States’s centres for control and prevention of diseases (CDC) recommend that employees with respiratory disease symptoms remain at home until they have no fever, fiber, or any other symptom since at least 24 hours without use of feedbreakers or other medicines that operate on the symptoms. They also suggest to apply flexible disease policies, to allow employees to stay home to take care of a family member and to inform the employees of these policies.
According to the OSHA, average exhibition employees include those who require frequent or close contact, at least six feet (1.8 m), understood or recognised COVID-19, but may be infected by SARS-CoV-2 because of a Community transmission on the undertaking room or because the person recently performed an international journey in a region with a wide transmission of COVID-19.
Involving workers in contact with the great public, particularly in schools, high-weight-development environments and some high-details of high-details. The technical controls for this group and higher risk include the installation of high-effective air filters, the increase of ventilation rates, the installation of physical barrières such as hygienic vitries in transparent plastic and the installation of a drive window for the customer's service. The administrative controls for this group and the highest risk are involving the support of the workers to remain in the house, the removing of the petroleums of the peer and petrol feed in the peer and growing feed of the petrols of the petroleums, the petroleums of the petrol and the petrol of the growing of the growth of the growth of the growth of the growth and the growth of the growth of the growth of the growth, and the growth value of the petrovered and the growth value of the petrover of the petrovering and the growd growd growing value of the growment of the concentration and the concentration of the growd growd growd and medit of the growd valued and the growd value of the growd value of the growd valued valued value of the growd valued and medit of the growd valued and the growth valued value of the growd and the growd growd and the growth values of duty and medie and medity of the growd and medity of the growd and medity of the growd and feat of the growd value of duty of the growd and feat of the growth value of duncyd and feats of the growth of the growth of the growth of the growd growd growd growd and feat of the growd growth of the growd and feat of the growth of the growd and feat of the growmentment of the growment of the growment of the growmentmentment of the growment of the concentrancyncyncyncyncyncyncyncyncyncyncyncyncyncyncyncyncyncyncyncyncyd and the growd valued and medide and fencyd and feat and the growd and the growd and ingredis of the growd and ingredis of the growd and ingredis of the growd and the growd valued valued valued valued and the growd value of the growd and the growd of the growd and the growd and the growd and the growd and the growds of the growd and the growd and the feat of the growd and the feat
Workers of the risk group are rarely needed to use respiratory masks.
If a person affects a aircraft, controls appropriate to protect the workers and other passengers include the following measures: separating the disease by a distance of 6 feet, designing a member of the equipped person to take care of the disease and provide a safety mask to the disease or to ask him to cover the mouth and the nest to the help of mouchooirs when anybody or ever.
The chain chain must bear medical guests when he is concerned with a sick passor or touchs organic liquids or surfaces that may be embraced and, if possible, additional individual protection equipment if the disease passor presents the fever, a persistent towel or respiratory difficulties.
Giants and other jetable articles must be made in the rebut for dangerous biological disappearances and contained surfaces must be cleaned and desinfected by the following. For commercial navigation, including crow and other passenger vessels, the risk controls include the report of the travel in cases of disease as well as the auto-isolation and the immediate information of the medical center of the boat if it is developed a fiber or other symptoms once to boat.
The CCDs recommend a short-term closure for cleaning and desinfection purposes if an infected person has been made in a school building, independent of Community propagation.
In the case of minimum Community transmission to moderate, social detention strategies may be implemented, such as the cancellation of the pedagogic outputs, meetings and other important meetings such as physical or cohoral education courses, and the returns to cantine, increased space between offices, by raising hours of arrival and exit, reducing non-scale visitors and by using separate disease for children with grippal symptoms.
In the case of important transmission to the local community, además of the social disistance strategies, a extended school vacation can be reviewed. For the forces of the order to perform daily routine activities, immediate health risk is considered low by CDC.
The officers of the order forces to enter into contact with persons with suspected COVID-19 or confirmed must follow the same directives as the ambulance forces, including the port of an appropriate individual protection equipment.
In case of contact during arrest, the workers must clean and desinfect their service equipment and ceintury before reuse using a lending or a detergent spray and follow the standard confidence procedures and rebuilt of the PIP used as well as the confidence and washing of clothes.
The OSHA considers some health and functional workers as well as high or very high exposure risks.
High risk-related employment workers include health care, support, laboratory and medical transport that are exposed to patients with suspected or known COVID-19.
They become workers at very high risk of exhibition if they are performing procedures produced by airlines or packings or manipulation of patients with COVID-19 suspected or known samples.
The procedures produced aircraft include income, towel-induction procedures, bronchoscopes, certain tank reviews and procedures or invasive sample prevalence.
High-risk exhibition jobs include workers in the preparation of persons with COVID-19 suspected or known at the time of their death; they adjust to a very high risk of exhibition if they practice autopsie. Additional technical controls of these groups include isolation rooms for patients with COVID-19 suspected or known, including in the implementation of aerosol procedures.
A specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some health and functional environments.
The samples must be manipulated with the assistance of bio-satisfactory precautions of level 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends to separate patients in separate waiting rooms due to COVID-19 absolution. In addition to other EPI, the OSHA recommends respiratory machines for persons working at least 6 feet patients with suspected or known infection by the SARS-CoV-2 and the procedures carried out by airlines.
In the United States, respiratory N95 filtering machines approved by NOSH or higher should be used in the context of a complete respiratory protection program, including adapting, training and medical reviews.
Other types of respiratory mass may ensure higher protection and better comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend combinations because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease rather than transmitted by organic liquids.
The WHO recommends the port of a chirurgic mask only by the entry expenditure staff.
For those who gather respiratory samples, support or transport COVID-19 patients in the absence of procedures produced aircraft, the WHO recommends a chirurgical mask, protection lunch or a facial screen, blouse and gants.
If proceedings produced aircraft, the chirurgic machine is replaced by a N95 or FFP2 respiratory mask.
In view of the insufficient global provision of EPI, the WHO recommends that the need for EPI by telemedicine, physical bathrooms such as transparent windows, limiting access to a local employed by COVID-19 to persons who are directly involved in their care, use of EPI to the only specific task, continue use of the same respiratory mask without resolved it for supporting a number of patients with the same diagnostic, monitoring and coordination of the EPI-approval chain and dissuasive use of materials for individuals asymptomatics.

We will find this month in an exceptional situation.
COVID-19 epidemic is a clear demonstration of our global human connection and responsibilities that we have each other.
His challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best response is on the kind of impathia, cooperation and strengthening of the Community in the world area that is in the heart of this organization.
The camaradery and the well-being we have observed among all our colleagues in electronic posters, calls and conversations are a remarkable witness of incredible human beings with which we have the opportunity to work.
I couldn't be more grateful and gentle of all of you among my colleagues.
Last week, someone made me part of his gratitude to our work.
This person reminded me how important it is for the world to consult Wikipédia at the present time, and the strong symbol that represents the fact that this essential resource remains online and accessible to all.
This is possible through your work, that you maintain the operational sites, ensure payment of our colleagues or security of our communities.
The world needs information provided by Wikipédia now more than ever.
It's a moment when not only what we do, but also how we do it will have a significant impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and the role you are playing there, we'll be going to make effective adjustments as we're working together since the next week.
Adjustements of our work and the employment of time
As Robyn mentioned above, the team's meeting last night to discuss our approach and our time employment in the days and months coming.
During this conversation, we have considered what would be a response adapted to the situation we are doing and the best way to ensure the viability of the organization during this period.
We were first trying to eliminate the stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to take back, don't worry.
All staff members, substraints and contractuals:
Our daily working time objective will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until the new order.
We will not explain a feeble day: if you are able to ensure more normal work hours, you can be useful to the mission.
However, the world is incredible at the present time, and if you need to take care of your neighbors, to make courses or to consult a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't watch your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
That should go without telling, but we'll say it.
No disease stop or payment required: just prevent your higher and help your team to revise time calendars and jobs to ensure that the main work areas are covered.
(If you are positive diagnosed at COVID-19, please prevent Bryan from the T-amp;C Ops to help T-amp;C help you and ensure your situation will receive the necessary attention of the direction).
The horary staff will be fully reimbursed.
We already have announced it, and we will reiterate our commitment to honor our responsibilities against our sub-straints and our colleagues of the horary staff.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of its usual work hours under normal conditions.
It's like if you're sick and in the ability to work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use the work as a way to evacuate their stress related to the world around us.
What we do can appear incrediblely grateful, particularly in periods such as this.
Once again, the goal is to keep you.
We are just asking you to communicate with your higher, so that we know what to wait and let us take the necessary provisions.
Some tasks are considered as essential.
There are some things we have to continue to do.
The SRE teams, Ops RH, Confidential & amp; Safety and Funds Countries (in addition to others) make a vital work that might need to be strengthened.
We will initiate a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and focus on supporting basic tasks for our mission.
There is enough work for each of us, we will just focus on the most essential projects.
Slide now don't make it worse later.
We don't have the intention to 'em working twice to ratify the loss time' when the pandemic is passed.
We will not ask you to make more hours to keep the time now irrealistics.
We recognize that circumstances have changed, and we are endeavoured to establish new objectives and to achieve the case where appropriate.
What is the APP (Annual Planning)?
In order to adapt us to our new reality and the daily work-time objectives, we are intended to amend the outcome for the delivery of our 2020-2021 annual plan.
Our intention is to propose a extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which provides more time to establish a budget to allow employees to focus on the essential work, to take care of them and their neighbourings as well as those who needed or want to see their work hours in the coming weeks.
This prolongation of gains reduces considerablely the burden of work and pressure of current planning in the whole organization.
We will submit our proposal to the Council next week and will inform the Delegates and teams of the next stages since confirming.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this regard.
The situation, exhibition and cleaning of the office
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, by excellence, we called for an antiviral cleaning team to desinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco Office.
They used an antiviral quality solution for desinfecting all the surfaces, as well as the entrance hall and the ascensor cages at our age.
The building used its own protocol of carefulness that uses products to ensure the safety of its locators.
We're convinced that the office will be well prepared when we decide to come back.
Our Washington DC office is located in a WeWork place, which shared with us and all staff members in Washington DC his COVID-19 Protocol.
Since last week, our Washington Office DC has adopted a complete distance configuration in accordance with San Francisco's boards.
As some of our colleagues established in New York, we also discussed the idea of loving a local in Brooklyn.
Those discussions continue but may be adjourned.
Some of our colleagues are working for the first time.
Our employed colleagues of distant work have aware of that adaptation may be difficult and would wish to offer you some advice:
Reducing the period of meetings at a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer meetings are required, it should consider the distribution of them for a number of days.
Definite clearly the meeting, having a agenda and send the documentation to the previous.
Make videos the standard, through tools such as Google Docs and Zoom to encourage direct cooperation and exchange.
Discover a coordinator to facilitate each meeting, someone to monitor immediate conversation and the list of speakers, and someone who helps to take notes (or carry out collective notes).
Send an email to technical support if you need a comfortable case.
Use your well-being remuneration for the colleagues.
Join the channel #remotions on Slack to speak with your colleagues of the distribution of work
The RH operations team studies the web-based geonomic guidelines to support the increased distribution of work in the Foundation.
Last week, we requested all beneficiaries of Community subvention to cancel public events financed by Wikimédia, such as edit-a-thons, until WHO announced the end of pandemic.
We have explained them that we understand that our requests of cancelation and other restrictions could impose the achievement of their agreed subvention activities and that no one would be punished in the case of lack or amendment of these objectives.
The next week we will publish additional directives on Vietnam and other thematic and regional conferences of the Community.
The general feeling of the international community seems to be at the time of tristeness with respect to the lightness and the possibility of focusing on its own communities, Wikimedia and others.
For the following, the CRT works for the creation of a page on Meta-Wiki to provide space so that the community can monitor the impact and continue our communications with them.
Contact Despite the problems related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation on your calendars for an extraordinary meeting of the next Thursday staff, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
We'll benefit from this time to share other updates, answer your questions and take together time.
This situation concerns us all and we are here to help you in any way.
From here you can always find the information contained in this e-mail, as well as all the other essential information relating to the COVID-19, on the Wiki Office.
The CRT will make updating these pages and gather all the information on the same place.
We also strive to maintain regular communications with staff members in countries who are currently seriously touched.
If you have questions about movements, events, an important working flow or covering difficulties, or if you need help for whatever otherwise, please not prevent and work with the CRT.
We're here to support you and to ensure the link in this case.
For any confidential or sensitive question, please send an email to Bryan Judan, Director of the International RH Global Operations.
No such amendments should be considered as a leave of our work and our obligations.
It is contrary to recognize that our work and our obligations will probably have to be adjusted in an unprecedented way.
These steps are the necessary we judge to support each other and can continue our work, bring the help he needs, and offer the service on which each can account.
Our planned work will be here to wait for the coming time.
To now, it is time to get back and prepare for the important work that will happen in the weeks and perhaps the months coming.
We need each of you to reach it, so why you need to keep you and care of your families so that you can give you the best moment coming.
Finally, if it's place, wake your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S), and the rest of the direction team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
(b' the enzyme of conversion of angiotine 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme related to the external face (cellar cells) of pump cells, arts, heart, rein and intestins.
ACE2 against the activity of the angiotine conversion enzyme (ACE) reduced the amount of angiotensin II and increased Ang (1-7), which makes it a promised medicine target in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 is also the point of entry into the cells of certain coronaus cells.
The human version of the enzyme is often designed under the name of hACE2.
The conversion enzyme of angiotensine 2 is a metalloenzyme containing the zinc situated on the surface of the endothélic cells and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains a M2 area of peptidase to end N and a field of renal friend acid collector for C.
The ACE2 is a unit-transfer protein of type I, with the active area of enzymatic plans on the surface of pump cells and other tissue.
The extracellullar field of the ACE2 is covered from the transmitterary area by another sheddae named enzyme; soluble protein which is released in the blood flux and finally excluded in the urin.
The ACE2 is presented in most organs: the ACE2 is mainly linked to the cell membrane of the pulmonary pulmonary lamps of type II, the enthrocytes of the green ingredient, arteral and veinary cells and the arteral cells of the leather muscles of most organs.
The expression of ACE2 is also presented in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and cerebral tronc.
The primary function of the ACE2 is to compensate the EEC.
The ACE removes the angiogenec hormone I in angiotensine II vasoconflict.
The ACE2 draws the amished phenolamine axis to terminate carboxyle of angiotine II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and the hydrolyse in vasodilatator (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Tal-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also close several other peptides, including [de-Arg9]-bradykinin, aepline, neurotenin, dynorphine A, and gangreline.
The ACE2 also regulates the membrane circulation of the nervous amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and is involved in Hartnup disease.
As transmitterary protein, ACE2 is the main entry point in the cells of certain coronaus cells, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus of the ECS) and SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 original virus).
More precisely, the S1 protein scope of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 in the enzymatic area of ACE2 on the surface of the cells resulting in an encytose and translocation at the time of virus and enzyme in cell endomees.
This income process also requires the abbreviation of the protein S by sereine protection TMPRSS2, the inhibition of this is currently the object of investing as potential treatment. This leads some to think that the reduction of ACE2 rates in cells can contribute to fighting infection.
However, a number of professional and regulatory enterprises recommended continue the standard treatment of the ACE and ARB inhibitor.
A systematic review and meta analysis published on 11 July 2012 showed that “the use of the ECB inhibitors was linked to a significant reduction of 34% of the pneumonia risk relating to the subjects”.
Furthermore, “the risk of pneumonia has also been reduced in patients treated by the ECB inhibitors that had a higher risk of pneumonia, particularly the victims of AVC and heart disappearance.
The use of the ECB inhibitors was also linked to a reduction of mortality related to pneumonia, although the results were less proud than for the global pneumonia risk.”
The human conversion enzyme of angiotensine 2 recommending (rhACE2) is pressure as innovative treatment of severe pulmonary lesions and seems to improve pulmonary hemodynamics and saturation of oxygen in porcelets resulting from respiratory detrimental syndrome in the lipolysaccharide.
The half life of rhACE2 in human rhA2 is about 10 hours and the action time is 30 minutes in less than 24 hours (dured).
Several conclusions suggest that rhACE2 may be a promise medicine for injury persons to classic inhibitors of the renaine-angiotensine system (SRA) or for diseases with high angiotensin II. rhACE2 under perfusion was evaluated in the context of clinical testing for treatment of the aigula respiratory detriment syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are mobile applications designed to facilitate contact trafficking in the context of coronavirus pandemic 2019-20, i.e. identification of people ("contacts") that may be entered into contact with an infected person.
Various applications have been developed or proposed, with official support of the Government in certain territorys and in certain jurisdictions.
Several infrastructures have been developed for the design of contact trading applications.
These systems, in particular those who are on the trailing of the geographical location of applications users, address questions on the respect of private life.
There are other less intrusive options, including the use of Bluetooth signs to save the neighbourhood of a user with other portable phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced the direct integration in their Android operating systems and iOS of a functionality to support these Bluetooth applications.
The Chinese Government, in association with Alipay, developed a application in China which allows citizens to verify whether they were in contact with COVID-19 ports.
It is used in more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapour has an option for a application called TraceTogether.
It has been developed by a local information community, it has been opened and will be sent to the Government. The North Macedonian launched “StopKorona!”, a Bluetooth application which ensures the exposure to potentially infected persons and quickly communicates with health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
Since April 14, 2020, the application was endeavoured by the Google Play Store and App App App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that the use of contact trafficking was at an advanced stage of development and could be deployed during the next weeks.An similar application was planned in Ireland and France („ StopCovid”).
Australia and New Zealand planned to establish applications on the traceTogether model in Singapour and on the basis of the Blue Trace Protocol. Russia wishes to introduce a geopération application for patients with COVID-19 diagnostics and residing in Moscow to ensure that they do not leave their home.
Ross Anderson, Cambridge's security engineering teachers, has discussed several practical problems related to the use of applications systems, including positive faults and the lack of potential efficiency if only a small part of the population uses the application.
In response to the concerns relating to the propagation of “ coronavirus” mental or nocives applications, Apple authorizes only the ‘official’ organizations or generally worthy of trust to add applications related to the coronavirus App Store.
Google and Amazon have applied similar restrictions.
Military for Private Life Protection was part of their concerns regarding the implications of coronaviral applications in the field of mass monitoring, particularly the possibility of monitoring infrastructure created to face coronavirus pandemics once a time away threat.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations published a statement calling for the limitation of this type of monitoring.
These organizations stipulated eight terms to comply with government projects:
monitoring should be “right, necessary and proportional”;
the extensions of the control and monitoring should be contained by extinction clauses;
Data use should be limited to COVID-19 goals;
data security and anonym should be protected in a demonstrable manner;
digital monitoring should ensure that any exacerbacy of discrimination and marginalization should be avoided;
Any share of data with third parties should be defined in the law;
It should provide protection against abuses and use for citizens in case of abus;
“ significant participation” of all relevant stakeholders would be obligation, including the experts in public health and marginalised groups. The Chaos Computer Club (CCCC) and reporters (Reporting without Grenzen) (RSF) in Germany have also published verification lists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple is aimed at addressing the problem of monitoring by removing the driveing mechanism of the operating system as soon as needed.
Some countries have used a network geographicalization system instead of applications, which eliminates at the time the need to download an application and the capacity to avoid trafficking.
The network traffic has been approved in Israel.
Network solutions accessing brutal geolocalization data are important potential problems in respect of private life.
However, all centre server systems have not needed to access personal location data; several systems have been created in order to use central servers only for intercommunication, which allows private life to be respected (see next section).
In South Korea, a system that does not cover a application has been used for contact trafficking.
Instead of using a delayed application, the system has collected trading information to various sources, including mobile device trading and card transactions, which they have then associated to send SMS warnings to potentially infected persons.
In addition to the use of these information to warn potential contacts, the Government also provided accessible localization information to the public, which was authorised according to the deep changes provided to the confidentiality laws after the MERS epidemic which touched the country.
This information is accessible to the public by using a number of applications and websites, such as Germany has specifyed the use of centralized systems for private life.
The details were not yet reported on 6 April 2020.
The trading of private life contacts is a well-defined concept, which has been established since 2013. On April 7, 2020, more than ten of expert groups working on private life solutions, including the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology to save the neighbourhood of a user with other portfolio phones.
However, the PEPP-PT project is a coordination efforts that associates the centralised and decentralized approaches and does not constitute an unique protocol. Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, former named Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT), among others.
These protocols allow to ensure that the identifiable personal data will never leave the device and that all corresponding devices are operated on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Lab currently develops SafePaths, a platform for use of private life preservation techniques during the collection and use of localization or contact data to follow the propagation of COVID-19.
This Technology is based on the results of the white book “Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic” published in March 2020. Safe Trace d'Enigma MPC platform, a company that develops private life protection technologies based on the MIT Media Lab, is another similar efforts.
SafeTrace uses safely material technologies to allow users to share sensitive localization and health data with other users and authorities, without involved confidentiality.
On 5 April 2020, the International Coalition was based on a common approach and significantly equivalent protocols in order to reduce the fragmentation and to ensure the global interoperability of trading and warning applications, an essential factor for their adoption by a wide public.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced the source code of the Blue Trace Protocol used by its official application.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, which controls the mobile platforms Android and iOS, announced a contact trading initiative, explaining that it would allow you to keep private life and secure the Bluetooth Technology Low Energy and a cryptograph that provides confidentiality.
They also published the specifications of the basic technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system should be developed in three phases:
Deployment of tools for Governments to establish official trading applications of coronavirus respecting private life
Direct integration of this function in iOS and Android. Google and Apple are planned to address the problems of adoption of the solution and maintenance of monitoring by initially distributing the system by updates of the operating system and by removing it later in the same way the distant threat.
The recovery of a medicinal medicine (whichly called reorientation, reprofiling, refecting or change of therapy indication of a medicine) indicates the recovery of an authorized medicine for a disease or a different medical affection for which it was initially developed.
It is a current scientific research focus to develop secure and effective treatment against COVID-19.
Other research axes include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and the plasma transfusion of convalent people. SARS-CoV-2 presents approximately 66 therapeutical target proteins, each of them with a number of ligans connection sites.
The analysis of these links sites provides the realistic development project of an effective antiviral medicine against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important proteins of SARS-CoV-2, the protease of papaine, the ARN polymerase depending on the ARN, helicis, the protein S and the phosphatase ADP.

The Governant of New York, Andrew Cuomo, announced that the tests of the New York State on chlorokine and hydroxychloroquine starting on March 24. On 28 March, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquin sulfate and chloroquin phosphate under an emergency authorisation (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the clinical test process of the EUA and is authorised only as experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but may not receive treatment in clinical trials.
The CDC stated that “the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquin for prevention or treatment of SARS-COV-2” is not yet established.
The doctors have shown this medicine “se there is no other option”.
A Turkish research team in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chlorocine in association with the zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Best studies are carried out at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School performs a test on the security and efficiency of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquin.
Chinese clinical tests made in Wuhan and Shenzhen stated that the faviravir was “effective.”
35 patients in Shenzhen were negative tested within a average of 4 days while the Duration of disease was 11 days in 45 patients who had not received it.
In 240 patients suffering of pneumonia, half received faviravir and the other half of umifenovir.

According to South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe opened opportunities to ensure that Trump administration can acquire medicine. The medicine may be less effective in serious cases of disease where virus has already multiplied.
It may not be sure for female female women or she's trying to proceede.
A study on lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a association of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals concluded “no benefit was observed”.
These medicines were designed to prevent HIV replication by the protease.
A Colorado University Research team is trying to amend these medicines to find a compound that would be linked with SARS-CoV-2. There are criticisms in the scientific community regarding the use of resources for medication specifically implemented for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/rionavir in the International Solidarity test.
The redesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment of Ebola virus and Viral Infections Marburg. Gilead Sciences discovered then that the redesivir had an anti-viral activity in vitro against several philosovir, pneumovirus, paramyxovirus and coronavirus.
A problem of antiviral treatment is the development of a resistance by mutation bike that can generate more severe disease and transmission.
Some previous tests suggested that the redesivir may have a high genetic bathroom against resistance. A number of clinical tests are running, including two of the university hospitals in Cleveland; one of the persons suffering of a moderate pathology and the other on the damage of more serious forms.
There are three clinical tests on vitamin C in intraveinary for persons who are hospitalized and seriously sick in COVID-19; two controls against placebo (China and Canada) and one without control (Italy).

Several anti-aggregators are now tested in Italy.
The low molecular weight hepain is widely used to treat patients, which implies the Italian medicine to publish directives on its use.
A multicentric study on 300 patients and studying the use of sodian enoxaparine in preventive and therapeutical doses was announced in Italy on 14 April.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, a large number of researchers focused on the reposition of approved anti-viral medicinal medicines that have been developed for previous epidemics such as the MERS, SRAS and the Western Nil virus.
Ribavirin: Ribavirin was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the seventh edition of Chinese directives
Omifenovir: Omifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the seventh edition of Chinese directives
Some antibiotics have been identified as potentially repositional as COVID-19 treatments:
tocilizumab (anti-recepteur-IL-6): approved by China.
Tests are also carried out in Italy and China. See Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetic vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine had been through clinical tests, many trials of development have been running.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said that no vaccine had been expected against the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the origin of disease, at least 18 months.
In April, five vaccine candidates were during phase I security study.
The COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major epidemic was stated through the world in 2020, generating important investments and research to develop vaccine.
Many organizations use genomens published to develop potential vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Defined in April, the impératives of the ECPI initiative for the development of a vaccine are the speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale deployment and global access.
In April, the CEPI scientists indicated that 10 different technological platforms conducted research and development projects early 2020 with the aim of establishing effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The goals of the main platform in phase I security studies include:
nucléic acid (DN and ARN) (fase I development and vaccine): Moderna, MRNA-1273)
Viral vector (fase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biology, Adenoviral Vector type 5)
As stated in the CEPI scientists in April, 115 vaccine candidates are at the first stages of development, which were 78 (79 after the Milken Institute) confirmed as actives and 37 others announced, but with a few available public information (presumed under planning or design).
A phase I-II test results in preliminary security and immunity tests, usually randomised, controlled against plaque and performed in several centres, determining more specific doses.
Phase III tests usually involve more participants, including a witness group, and test the effectiveness of vaccine in prevention of disease, while monitoring the inevitable effects of the optimal dose.
Among the 79 active development candidates (confirmed early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human assessment phase (preklic research now).

In March 2020, the American Government, the industry and three universities set up their resources to access the IBM super computers, associated with computers of Hewlett Packard on clouds of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have herogen effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can provide benefits beyond the disease they provide.
Another randomised test in Australia provides 4 170 health professionals.
The vaccines in the course of development may not be secure or effective.
The initial research to assess the effectiveness of vaccine using specific animal models for COVID-19, such as transgenous ACE-2 mouses, other laboratory animals, non-human primates, indicate the need for implementation of bio-satisfiction measures of level 3 for live virus manipulation, and an international coordination to ensure standardized security procedures.
Impacts against the RIS and MERS have been tested on non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no health or protection vaccine against the SIS to demonstrate its security and effectiveness in the person.
According to research documents published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines to treat the SIS was a priority for Governments and health agencies of the whole world. There is no vaccine tested against MERS.
When the MERS has been spread, it was thought that the existing research on the SES could serve a model to develop vaccines and medicines against infection to MERS-CoV.
In March 2020, one vaccine against MERS (based on ADN) had completed the clinical tests of phase I in men and three others; all vaccines were in viral vector, two to adeoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and a MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
The COVID-19 virus was known and a vaccine was already available.
The patents involved by various publications of social networks are referring to existing patents on genetic sequences and vaccines for other cronvirus dreams such as the CLAS coronavirus.
The cronvirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infective disease caused by coronavirus 2 related to severe aigue respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The current symptoms include fiber, towels and stamps.
Other symptoms can include fatigue, muscular pain, diarrhee, honey mass, hair loss and abdominal pain.
The term between the exhibition and the appearance of the symptoms is usually about five days, but it can drag between two and fourteen days.
While most of the cases generate moderate symptoms, some are evolving to a viral pneumonia and a weakness of several organs.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2,24 million cases have been reported in the world in 210 countries and territories, which generated more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people were healed. The virus is mainly available in nearness contact, often produced by gouttelets, smoothing or speaking.
These goutlets are produced to expire, they generally fall on the ground or surface rather than representing an infective risk on long distances.
People may also be infected by touching a contaminated surface, then touching the eyes, the nest or the mouth.
Virus can survive on surfaces until 72 hours.
It is the most contagious during the first three days after the appearance of the symptoms, although the condensation is possible before the appearance of symptoms and during the later phases of disease. The standard test method uses the inverse reaction transscription of polymerase in real time (rRT-PCR).
The use of machines is recommended for those who think infected by virus and their dreams.
The recommendations on the mask of the public generally vary, some authorities decide their use, others recommending their use and others still imposing their use.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of disease was registered in most of the UCS countries.
People infected by virus may be asymptomatics or develop greep symptoms such as fever, towels, fatigue, absolution.
The emergency symptoms include difficulties to respect, pain or persistent thoracy pressure, confusion, difficulties to walk and face or blue light; in the presence of these symptoms, it is advised to consult a doctor immediately.
Most often, respiratory symptoms, such as eternal eras, narrow or worse may be observed.
gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausates, waste and diarrhee were observed in different proportions.
Some cases in China have initially presented only a tactic pressure and palpitation.
In some, disease may cause pneumonie, disappearance of several organs and death.
That's what we call the incubation period.
COVID-19 incubation period is usually five-six days, but can go to 14 days.
97.5 per cent of those who develop symptoms will take it in the 11.5 days after infection, and reports indicate that all infected persons will not develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomic ports in the transmission is not yet completely known, but the preliminary elements suggest that they could contribute to the propagation of disease.
The proportion of infected persons who do not present symptom is currently unknown and studyed. Coreine prevention and control centres (CDC) reported that 20% of all cases confirmed remained asymptomatic during their hospitalization.
The Chinese National Health Commission began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on 1 April; 166 infects found that day were 130 (78%) asymptomatics at the test.
Expectation and salary can be transported by both significant viral charges.
The fact of speaking strongly frees more goutts than it makes it normally.
A study in Singapour showed that all of them without protection can develop guutettes at a distance of 4,5 meters (15 feet).
Although virus is generally not transported by the air, national science academy suggested that bioaerosol transmission could be possible and that air collectors were placed outside the patient's rooms produced positive samples to the Virus ARN.
Some medical procedures such as cardiopulmonal inspiration and reanimation (RCP) can spread respiratory secrections and therefore lead to air propagation.
Although there are concerns about proliferation by sacks, this risk is made as low. The virus is the most contagious when people present symptoms; although the propagation may be possible before the appearance of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Prevention and Improvement (ECDC) said that if you are not yet knowing exactly with what easy disease is spread, a person generally contained two to three.
Precisely, virus could be detected at the end of one day on the carton, three days on plastic (polypropilène) and inoxidable iron (AISI 304) and at the end of four hours on cut to 99 %.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Savon and detergents are also effective if they are correctly used; savon-based products degrade the protective lipidial cocket of virus, which deactives and elimination of hair and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium clorure and chlorhexidine (perfective desinfector) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, salive samples were made in average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five patients on six, the first sample revealed the highest viral load, while in the sixth patient the highest viral load was on the second day tested.
The coronavirus 2 linked to severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new coronavirus responsible for severe respiratory syndrome, initially isolated in three persons of pneumonia related to the foster of cases of aag respiratory disease of Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 new virus are presented in the cronvirus appeared in the nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is destroyed by savon menager, which breaks its protective building. SARS-CoV-2 is a near parent of the SARS-CoV origin.
Pommons are the most touched organs of COVID-19 because virus accesss to host cells through the intermediary of the conversion enzyme of angiotine 2 (ACE2) which is the most abundant in the pulmonary cells of type II.
Virus uses a specific surface glycoprotein called 'spicule' (plampera) to link to the ACE 2 and to spend the host cell.
Available heart lesions have been reported in 12% of the persons admitted to the Wuhan hospital in China, and are more frequent when disease is more serious.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to the systhematic inflammatory response and immunity disorders during the process of disease, however, myocard’s isions may also be related to ACE 2 receptors in the heart.
ACE 2 Receptors are strongly expressed in the heart and in the heart functions involved.
A high incidence of trombose (31%) and veinary trombolic disease (25%) was observed in patients in intensive care units caused by COVID-19 infections and may be connected to a divorceable pronostic pronostic. COVID-19 autopses have shown diffused disasters (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the poon.
Although SARS-COV-2 presents a tropism for epithelic cells that explicitly ACE-2, the patients affected COVID-19 are seriously symptoms of symptoms of systematic hyperinflammation.
These are particularly the secretary T T cells of GM-CSF that have been associated with the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes secreted by NIL6 and the severe pulmonary pathology of patients affected by COVID-19.
lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported in the autopsie.
WHO published several test protocols for disease.
The standard test method uses the inverse transscription of the polymerace reaction in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test is generally performed on respiratory samples obtained by rhinopharyned samples; but a narrow or expertise can also be used.
Overall, the results are available in a few hours, even until two days.
Blood tests may also be used, however, they requested two intervallancies of two weeks and the results have little value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a cronvirus scene and published the genetic sequence so that laboratorys all over the world could develop independently polymerization reaction tests (PCR) to detect infection by virus.
On April 4, 2020, anticorps tests (usable to accelerate the active infection and previous infection of one person) were on development, but not yet widely used.
The Chinese test experience showed only 60-70 % precisely.
FDA to the United States has approved the first test next to the patient on 21 March 2020 before being used to the end of this month. Diagnostic directives published by the Zhongnan hospital of the University of Wuhan suggested methods of detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and the epidémiological risk.
Multi-local disorders with device, asymmetric and afterward are typical symptoms visible at the beginning of infection.
Thinking in pearl, ploting crazy (interlovailated sevenal exhibition with variable combination) and consolidation may appear with the progress of disease.
Several data are available on microscopic lections and the COVID-19 pathphysiology.
The main pathological findings in the autopsie are:
Macroscopy: Cleaning, pearreed, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edition
Four types of gravity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Moderate pneumonie: pulmonary hyperplay, pneumocytic pneumatic pseudocytes rigid, interstantive flaming with lymphocytic infiltration and training of multinucted cells
Several pneumonia: diffused alvéolary damage (DAD) with diffused alvéolary exsuades.
DAD is the cause of an acute respiratory detrimentation syndrome (SDRA) and severe hypoximy.
Healing phenomenon: Exsuade organization in the Alvéol Café and Interest pulmonary Fibrose
Sang: dissminal intravascular coagulation (CIVD) ; leuco-ethrythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce infection risks include to stay in itself, to avoid good places, to wake hands in water and saving for at least 20 seconds, to have a good respiratory hygiene and to avoid to touch the eyes, nest or mouth with not washed hands.
The CDC recommends to cover the mouth and smoke with a smoke when you're all or forever and use the inside of the coat in the absence of moving.
A correct hygiene of the hands after being disappeared or emerging is recommended.
The CCD recommended to cover the face of a tissue in public places in order to limit the transmission in cases of asymptomatic individuals. The social detention strategies are to reduce contacts with large groups by stoping schools and workplaces, reducing movements and canceling the important groups of people.
The distance directives also include the respect of a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m) minimum among persons.
There is no medicine known to be effective in the prevention of COVID-19. Since vaccine has not been expected before 2021, a key element of COVID-19 management is to try to reduce the epidémic pic, which is also called “aplay the core”.
The CDC also recommends individuals to lay hands often on saving and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after being tailed or when the hands are visiblely saled; before eating; and after being mounted, beated, or smoothed.
It also recommends to use a desinfective solution for alcohol-based hands containing at least 60% alcohol, but only if water and savon are not available. For the areas where trade desinfectors are not available, the WHO proposes two forms for a local production.
In these forms, antimicrobian activity is from Ettanol or isopropanol.
hydrogen peroxide is used to eliminate bacterian sporees in alcohol, which is not “at an antiseptic active substance for hands”.
The glycérol is added as humectant.
People are treated by support cares that can include hydrical treatment, oxygenotherapie and support of other living bodies affected.
The CDC recommends that persons suspected to be trapped from the virus have a simple facial mask.
The extra-corporal oxygenation per membrane (ECMO) was used to treat respiratory disappearance cases, but its benefits are still analyzed.
Personal hygiene, a mode of life and sane food have been recommended to promote immunity.
Support treatments may be useful in those who present symptoms moderated in the previous stage of the infection. WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for hospitalized persons for COVID-19.
Reanimators and pneumatic doctors in the United States collected therapeutical recommendations of several agents in a free resource, IBCC.
In April 2020 there is no specific treatment of COVID-19.
With regard to symptoms, some health professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) rather than ibupropheen in the first line.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, particularly in terms of care when the implementation of procedures can generate aircraft, such as manual income or ventilation.
For health professionals undertaking people suffering from COVID-19, the CCD recommends that the person should place in a air transport room adapted to air infection (AIIR) as well as use of standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions relating to air transmission. The CCD stresses the directives relating to the use of individual protection equipment (EPI) during the pandemic.
The recommended equipment is: PPE blouse, respiratory or facial mass, ocular protection and medical guests. If available, the respiratory machines are privileged.
The N95 respiratory machines are approved in industrial conditions, but FDA authorized the use of these machines under an emergency use authorisation (EUA).
They are designed to protect air particules such as powder, but their effectiveness against specific biological agents is not guaranteed for non-specific uses.
When the machines are not available, the CDC recommends to use physical protection screens, or last use, artistic machines.
The majority of COVID-19 cases are not sufficiently severe to require mechanical ventilation or other alternatives, but a certain percentage of the eastern.
The type of respiratory assistance for persons suffering of respiratory disappearance related to COVID-19 is actively studied for hospitalized persons. Some evidence shows that insubration can be avoided using a high-debit naal canal or a positive pressure of double-level respiratory paths.
It is ignored if one of the two or two generates the same benefits for people in a critical state.
Some doctors prefer to keep the invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technological limits the distribution of particules with respect to high-debit nasal canal. Several cases are more frequent in adults (e.g. over 60 years, and especially over 80 years).
Many developed countries have not enough hospital beds per person, which limits the capacity of the care system to treat a sudden pic of the number of cases of COVID-19 sufficiently serious cases to need hospitalization.
A study in China showed that 5 per cent of the cases were admitted in intensive care, 2.3 per cent had needed respiratory assistance and 1,4 per cent.
In China, approximately 30% of hospitalized persons with COVID-19 are finally admitted in intensive care.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex with the development of the aiguous respiratory detrimental syndrome (SDRA) during COVID-19 and the oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Wintering devices offering pressure control modes and high PEEP are required to optimize oxygen release and minimize the risk of pulmonary lesion associated with ventilation and pneumothorax.
High PEEP may not be available on older ventilation devices.
The research of potential treatments launched in January 2020 and several antiviral medicines are subject to clinical tests.
Redesivir seems to be the most promised.
Although new medicines could not be developed before 2021, several test medicines are already approved in other indications and tests are already developed.
A antiviral medicinal medicine may be tried in patients suffering serious diseases.
WHO recommended volunteers to participate in the tests on the effectiveness and security of potential treatment, and the FDA granted temporary authorisation to the plasma of convalent persons as experimental treatment in cases where the life of the person is seriously or immediately threatened.
The clinical tests were not presented to demonstrate security and effectiveness for disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to manage epidemic.
The users are requested to enter their name and an identifier.
The application is able to detect close contacts using monitoring data and therefore to detect an potential infection risk.
Each user may also control the status of three other users.
If an potential risk is detected, the application is not only recommended for the quarantine auto, it also advises the local health authorities. The analysis of the mass data of mobile phones, facial recognition technology, the localisation of mobile phones and artificial intelligence are used to place infected persons and people with which they have been contacted in South Korea, Thailand and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government has allowed the security agencies to place mobile telephone data from suspected persons.
The measure was intended to respect quarantine and to protect people who could have been contacted with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Germane Telecom also shared authorized telephone location data with the Federal Government of Germany, the Robert Koch Institute, to analyze and prevent virus propagation.
Russia has developed facial recognition technology to detect persons who do not respect the quarantine.
In Italy, the Regional Health Minister Giulio Gallera stated that the mobile telephone operators had been informed that "40 per cent of people continue to move."
The German Government conducted a weekend of Chacton of 48 hours with more than 42,000 participants.
Kersti Kaljulaid, President of Estonia, has launched an appeal to the world level to find creative solutions to prevent the propagation of coronavir.
People may suffer quarantine, movement restrictions, secondary effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC focused on Rory O'Connor, “augmented social isolation, normal, health anxiety, stress and economic recession are an perfect cocktail for mental health and well-being.”
The disease may have a moderate evolution with a few or not symptoms, similar to other common diseases of respiratory paths such as rhume.
Modified cases are generally retained in two weeks, while severe or critical cases require three to six weeks.
Infant women may present a higher risk of severe infection to COVID-19 according to the data of similar virus, such as RIS and MERS, but there are no data for COVID-19. In some cases, COVID-19 can affect pumps and cause pneumonia.
In the most seriously affected cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to evolute to an acute respiratory disappearance syndrome (SDRA) causes respiratory disappointment, sectual choko or multivisceral deficiency.
COVID-19 complications include septycemie, coagulation troubles and heart lesions, renal and hepatics.
Coagulation problems, particularly an increase in prothrombine times, have been described in 6 per cent of hospitalized cases with COVID-19, a reinsufficience has been observed at 4 per cent of the group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of COVID-19 people have a high rate of hepatic enzymes (transamined).
According to the same report, the average time between the start of symptoms and the death was 10 days, including five pasts in hospitalization.
However, patients transferred in intensive care presented a average of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a previous study of cases, the average period between the start of the symptoms and the death was 14 days, with a total plague included between six and 41 days.
In a study of the Chinese Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 per cent while women had a death rate of 1.7 per cent.
The histopathological examinations of post-mortal pulmonary samples present a diffused alvéolary damage with fibromyxoid cell exsuades in the two poms.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in pneumocytes.
The image of the poumon is like an acute respiratory detrimentation syndrome (SDRA).
At 11.8% of the death reported by the Chinese health commission, heart lesions at high tropony rates or cardiac census were observed.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalised persons were preexist pathology. The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic conditions of a region may also have an impact on mortality.
The estimates of the mortality rate of disease varied from these regional differences, but also because of methodological difficulties.
The sub-number of the cases modified may lead to overseeing the mortality rates.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases previously contracted may indicate that the current rate of mortality is underestimated.
Smokers were 1,4 times more enhanced to develop severe COVID-19 symptoms and present a 2.4 times higher risk of intensive care or decrease compared to non-fumers.
Hong Kong hospital administration observed 20% to 30% of respiratory capacity in some healthy persons from disease, and pulmonary scanners suggested organic lesions.
This may also lead to an intensive post-intensive care syndrome after healing.
In March 2020, it was ignored if previous infection had been an effective long-term immunity in healthy persons.
Immunity is considered likely on the basis of the behaviour of other coronavirus, but cases of healed persons from COVID-19 followed by positive tests at coronavir at a later date have been reported.
These cases are considered as an aggravation of a lacked infection rather than as a reinfection.
The virus is natural and animal origin, by propagation of infection.
The real origin of the virus is unknown, but in December 2019, the proliferation of infection was almost being carried out by a man's transmission.
A study of 41 first cases confirmed by COVID-19 published in January 2020 in The Lancet revealed that the oldest date of the symptoms was on 1 December 2019.
Official WHO publications indicated the first appearance of the symptoms on 8 December 2019.
A number of measures are usually used to assess mortality.
These figures vary according to regions and time, and are affected by the volume of tests, quality of health, therapeutical options, time of epidemics, and demographical characteristics such as age, sex and health status.
Final 2019, the WHO affected the CIM-10 U07.1 pathological codes for the deaths confirmed infection in SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for cases of COVID-19 diagnosed from a clinical or epidémological view without infection to SARS-CoV-2 in laboratory. The dead report reflects the number of deaths divised by the number of cases designed in a given time interval.
According to the Johns-Hopkins University statistics, the World Case Report is 6,9% (153 822/2 240 191) at 17 April 2020.
The number of different in region. Other measures include the level of lightness (CFR) which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals that decrease from disease and infective legitimacy rates (IRF) which reflects the percentage of infected persons (discognised or not) which declines from a disease.
These statistics are not limited in time and follow a specific population of contamination in terms of disease.
Although all infected persons do not develop anticorps, the presence of anticorps may indicate the number of infected persons.
In the episode of the epidémie in Italy, a small village of 4 600 inhabitants has already died (1.7%).
In Gangelt, disease has been explosed by festivals, and youth persons, giving relatively low mortality rates, and all deaths related to COVID-19 may not have been officially classified as such.
In addition, the German health system has not been deployed.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of people may have anticorps, according to an evaluation of blood donors.
69 dead (0.004% of the population) were confirmed as related to COVID-19.
The impact of pandemic and mortality rates are different in the man and in the woman.
Mortality is higher in men in studies carried out in China and Italy.
The risk is the highest in men of 50 years, the difference between men and women only to 90 years.
In China, death rate was 2.8% in man and 1.7% in women.
The specific reasons of this difference between genders are unknown, but genetics and behaviour factors could be part.
The immunological differences according to the sex, the lower prevalence of the tabagisme in women and the development of men of commerbidities, such as hypertension to less advanced age than in women could have contributed to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of infected persons were men and 72% of COVID-19 people.
In April 2020, the American Government does not collect the data related to the type of infections of COVID-19.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SRAS differently affect men and women.
A higher percentage of health personnel, particularly sick personnel, are women and presents an increased risk to be exposed to virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be COVID-19.
The General Director of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO means corona, VI means virus and D means disease, 19 as the first identification of the epidemic: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical place (e.g. China), to an animal species or a group of persons, in accordance with the international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus caused by COVID-19 is called coronavirus 2 related to severe aigue respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses the virus of COVID-19 and the virus responsible for COVID-19 in its public communication.
The disease and virus are both commonly called “ coronavirus”.
During the initial epidemic in Wuhan, China, virus and disease were often called " coronavirus" and " coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended that the names of preliminary diseases 2019-nCov and respiratory disease 2019-nCoV for virus and disease should be used in accordance with the 2015 Directive against the use of places in the names of virus and virus diseases.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
In accordance with the limits of the standard appreciation chain, some digital producers are impressed by the care equipment such as o'clips and respiratory pieces.
For example, when an Italian hospital had needed an emergency respirator valve and that the supplier could not be able to approve it in a timely time, a local startup recovered and printed the 100 required valves in one night.
Following the initial COVID-19 epidemic, complexist theories, false information and disappointment have emerged about origin, extension, prevention, treatment and other aspects of disease and have been rapidly distributed on online.
It seems that the person is able to promote disease to some other animals.
The studies have not been found to find viral replication evidence in porcs, canards and pools.
No medicine or vaccine is approved to treat disease.
International research on vaccines and medicines against COVID-19 is currently carried out by government organizations, university groups and industrial researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched the SOLIDARITY test to assess the therapeutical effects of four existing antiviral components with the most promised effectiveness.
There is no vaccine available, but several agents are currently working to develop vaccine candidates actively.
Previous work on SARS-CoV are used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are used both ACE receptor 2 to go to human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are subject to research.
First, researchers are trying to create a whole vaccine.
The use of such virus, inactive or dead, is intended to provoke an immunity response of the human body in the case of new infection at COVID-19.
An second strategy, sub-unit-based vaccines, is aimed at creating a vaccine that knows the immunity system at some sub-units of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these researches focus on the S protein, which helps the virus to infilt in the ACE enzyme enzyme. 2.
A third strategy is that of the vaccination vaccines based on nucléc acids (vaccination by DNA or ARN, a new vaccination Technology).
Experimental vaccines from all these strategies should be tested in terms of security and efficiency. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine started with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an inoffensive genetic code covered by virus that causes disease. The active activity of anticorps was suggested as a potential challenge in the development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, but it is contrary.
In April 2020, more than 300 active clinical tests are now.
Seven tests have evaluated therapies already approved against paludism, including four hydroxychloroquin or chloroquine.
The recovered antiviral medicines represent the majority of Chinese research, with nine clinical trials of phase III on redecessive in several countries of the reports expected by the end of April.
A dynamic clinical development analysis of vaccine candidates and medicines against COVID-19 was also placed in April 2020. Many existing antiviral medicines are evaluated in the treatment of COVID-19, including redesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir associate interferon.
Provisional data suggested the effectiveness of remedisivir in March 2020.
clinical improvements have been observed in patients treated with compassional redesivir.
The clinical trials of phase III are carried out in the United States, China and Italy. Cloroquin, used before to demonstrate paludism, has been studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, some require an independent analysis of research work.
Chinese and Korean health authorities recommend the use of chlorocine.
However, the Wuhan virology institution, while recommending a daily dose of a gram, indicates that the double of this dose is highly dangerous and could be dead.
On 28 March 2020, FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquin and chlorocine under an emergency authorisation for medicine discretion to the patients of COVID-19. The 7th edition of Chinese directives includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenvir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicates that high ribavirin doses are required to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Natazoxanide was recommended for the continuation of a life-study after demonstrating a low concentration of SARS-CoV-2 inhibition. The studies have shown that the initial spice protein affecting sereine transmune protection 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE receptor 2.
The studies on chlorocine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azitromycine present major limits that have prevented the medical community to adopt these treatments without additional studies. Osselamivir does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and does not present any part known in the COVID-19 treatment.
The cytokic chok can be a complication to the later phases of the fresh COVID-19.
There are evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-choc cytokic properties. Tocilizumab has been included in the treatment guidelines by the Chinese National Health Commission after a small study.
It is not recognized at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in persons who have a serious form of disease.
associated with a sirry ferritin blood test to identify cytokic chocolate, it must resist such developments that are suspected to be originating the death of some affected persons.
Interleukine-6 antagonist was approved by the FDA on the basis of retrospective case studies for the treatment of the syndrome of refreshing cytokins to the steroids in 2017.
There is no randomised and controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment of the SCR.
The transfer of concentrated and cleansed anticorps produced by immunity systems of persons healing from COVID-19 to those who need to be studied as a non- vaccinal method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for the CISS with a few conclusions.
Viral neutralization is the expected action mode with which passive anticorps treatment can generate protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms such as cellular citoxicity depending on anticorps and/or phagocytose may be possible.
Other passive antibiotic treatment forms, for example using manufactured monoclonic anticorps, are being developed.
The production of seeds of convalent persons, which is the liquid part of the blood of healing patients and containing specific anticorps against this virus, could be increased for a faster deployment.
coronaviral diseases, a closely apparent group of syndromes
Li Wenliang, doctor at Wuhan’s central hospital, who then contracted COVID-19 and died after he had focused on virus propagation.
