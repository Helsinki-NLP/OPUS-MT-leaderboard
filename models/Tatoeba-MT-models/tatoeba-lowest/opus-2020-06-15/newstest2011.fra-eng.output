What's going on? CSSD didn't know nor Voldemort or Pasty in Prague.
The new CSSD elected at the capital master, apparently, will have to overcome a real language bathroom to understand at the level of the municipal advice with their elders and new colleagues of the ODS.
Actualne.ct has "test" new members of the CSSD municipal advice, namely whether they know the argoment that was born in the last years in the Maurie, when they were the current coalition partners in Prague.
The vocabulary agreed that the Prague's crysm policy has been conducted during the previous season of the Pavel Bem described some of the personalities, situations and causes of metropole.
It was surprised that the new elections have not understood well the terms known.
At least they say.
"What is Valdemort."
"I don't really know."
"I am a game in Prague's policy reacted Lukas Kauky, the electric to the culture at the test of the "parrain" vocabulary.
And for the political veterran, the elu Karel Brezina reacted in the same way.
For example, the sense of "other golf".
"It's the only expression that you propose me to use."
I don't use the argoto.
The vocabulary, which has published the current daily statements in June this year before the ODS pre-electral congress, elected six examples, in priority those related to the Master of Prague.
The socialists had to explain the sense of "Voldemort", "the largest golf golf" in Prague," to the patience, "boeuf rear," "the capital trahison" and "today".
Three of the elections were agreed for the case, the quarter Antonin Weinert, which must lead education in Prague in the future - promised first an intertainment but then did not detect the phone.
The fifth election Petr Dolinek cutely rejected the test.
"I don't worry about all these things there and how to use representatives of civil democracy: I will not give my opinion."
"I'm currently concerned about how we're going to understand us in our programs," said he.
As we have already heard, the Lukas Kakuy would not apparently recognize in the lection above, that it is Janusek's influence on entrepreneurs and friends of the former Roman Bem.
"Voldemort" doesn't say anything to'Kacky and the only expression he became in the test is "the largest golf troop in Prague".
"It's the white tunnel," said Kauky and immediately added: "But I know the newspapers."
"I'll have to pay me a language course," placing it.
Not only Karel Brezina Master but also Lukas Plachy, the environment eloquent, knowing that the golf bottle is the white tunnel.
Two social democrates know that Voldemort is really and Lukas Plachy knows the place where you find the personality - it thinks about "going to the pastry."
"There is, I think to go into a company," Plachy is ready to prove that it is the Janusek company seat.
On the same part of your Brezina, he remembers that he's getting his knowledge more than the newspapers and not any of his vocabulary he would use.
According to test candidates, there is no law of argoto in social democracy.
"I took advice with colleagues and it appears that we do not have anything like this."
"On the names sometimes are used to use abr√©viations and symbols", said Peter Hlinsky, President of the Society Democratic Party, that members of the Party are called Hulda.
"He was called Briza to school, but I don't know if my colleagues call me like this, says Karel Brezina about surnames.
The Actuel.cz daily tested the name and it works.
The El vinert is Popy for the Party members or the most oldest friend Pett, representative Miroslav Poche, who took attention to him before the elections by the scratchs during the party, is surnamed "the small player".
Overnames are the only one that allows the social and democratic employment within the party.
It seems that Hulinsky doesn't like much to hear Hulda, but the Akutel.cz daily registered another surname for this Prague President.
"Doctor of Master Right" reminds that Petr Hulinsky has obtained his title of doctor to the Brazilian police academy.
The government wants to reduce the tortures of the "sociors", he built a brochure.
In Burkina Faso, the sovereign women said have common trades.
They are part of the old generation, for example, not can't work for health reasons, are free and have no child.
The one who becomes "soir" is isolated to not threat the rest of the village.
"The man has very rarely that destiny."
"No longer judge young women in health because they are involved in the work and accompanied children," a sister who is concerned in the capital of the West African country, Burkina Faso, in a special institution of more than 100 women who have been rejected by society.
The local government decided to intervene against this inhabitual social measure.
He built a brochure that should help to limit the shopping of neighbourings.
The case contains a "hic".
"Plus of 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso does not read", warned the newspaper The Standard about the unconvention of written education.
In other African countries, the prosecution of the investigation is current.
In Ghana, neighbour of Burkina Faso, Ammy Hemma, a woman of 72 years was died after he was tortured by three women and a man burned with the pillar that they had sprinkled him.
This is the BBC server who transmited this information.
The crimes claim that it was the wrong eye.
According to their version, the oil that serves the ritual onctions has been evolved to the contact of the woman.
The oil burned, paradise, when the team wanted to "sat the bad spirit" of the woman.
The "sociation" is approved by persons of all levels of education.
The newspaper The Standard quoted a 42-year-old undertaking from Burkina Faso: "The managers of human spirits have always represented a danger," he said.
While Burkina Faso trys to reduce the flight to neighbors, Gambie has not later seen the President himself to participate in the past year.
"The President gambien Dzammi, after the death of his grandmother, launched a large slaughter to the neighbors who would likely have participated in his death and would be disappointed by the black magie to kill the President."
"The Chamans of the Guinea's neighborhood brought to the close president in Kanilai, under the protection of policemen and personal career of the President, men and women elected in the villages of Gambie," said in a message, "Amnesty International.
At the end, imprised persons had to drink a base of plants for the hollucinogen effects that caused other effects on reins and intestins.
Two prisoners weren't survey.
On international pressure, approximately a thousand of people who were released.
Bakal Locator: The pools are hot, he signed a higher lower.
A taxing old man is out of the door of the customer centre of the RPG Byty company of the "carbonbaron" Zdenek Bakal, the largest private owner of apartments to locate in Czech Republic.
He brought a folder under the arm with three new location contracts for three apartments: the sien, the one of his daughter and his son who was in the way to purify a penalty.
Deregulation has increased loving to these three persons.
Instead of paying 3 500, the son must regulate from the next year for a second category 4100 krones.
"And there is no hot water and heat operates in the solid fuel," shows the finger on the new contract of his son the man who has the signing power.
"But I signed it even," he explains it in wrath and half resigned.
The civil association of apartments BytyOKD.cz which has described the new location conditions as "immoral and Independent", advises the locals not to sign and wait until 7 December, a notice will be published to explain the method to follow a complaint.
But the man responds to this by a handsman.
"The one says that, the other says something else" by frauding the souries.
The region of Austria is the laboratory of the regulation.
After the New Year, most of the apartments in the Czech Republic are not corresponding to the market price.
Currentne.cz has decided to personally visit the "laboratory".
RPG's waiting room in the Havirovska street is one of the four of the region of Ostrava and is already filled on Tuesday at 09:00 a.m.
Just next to the door, a security company's guard with a device to call customers.
A special button, "lud 2011", is all-to-scale screen.
One pressure and a paper with a sort of the device number.
You don't have time to read your "157" number that your number already starts lighting on the big screen under the top of the waiting room.
In a second fraction, it's your tour.
After a short moment, a old couple comes to learn about lounge, but new lovers seem not to concern people in the waiting room.
Most people have come to address current problems as everywhere - requests for repairs, events relating to insurance and others.
In the region of Ostrava, people with more than 44,000 apartments of the RPG portfolio receive posters with new bath contracts in their boats for letters since mid-November.
RPG Byty proposes their wages increases from 15 to 38 per cent.
The Special Guide for New Lowers is open to the public since 18 November.
" it works for near one week, so it is still at the test" answers, after an exhibition moment, the employee back the guiket when the customer is present as a journalist.
The deregulation and the old ministry apartments of Bakal are a very sensitive local subject.
The Vice-President of the Parliament and originary of the Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek region has stated sufficiently supported before the elections, and this is now full of the local journals.
"20 years after them, I want a new plane."
"They haven't even changed a pocket... and a ball in the wcs, and they're inspired by introducing the man mentioned.
However, it is mostly, according to the employees, pensions to be sure that they will receive a return on the new lower price if they are now signed as RPG promised in a special offer.
It is a half of the lower amount that will receive the other locations which will have signed their new contract before 15 December.
But the "reregulation" of the Havirovaska street is really not acquired by questions.
"Parmi the 360 customers who came yesterday, only 40-50 have come to lodge," the employee states.
And yet RPG offers both on its website as well as in the vitrines of individual interviews on lowers when necessary.
If both parties do not hear about lodging, it is an independent court to take the decision.
'It is not threats but only to inform the unique and legal way of acting legally," RPG indicates on its website.
"This person will not be at the court" thinks one of the employees of RPG Byty and man in the street before the customer centre gives him reason.
"I have 13,000 curons of retirement and it's still 5,000 krones to eat, I'm not enough to go to the court," he said.
Employee feels prejudicedly bad.
"We'll be driving."
"Mr. Zaoralek in the media requests no one sign and then people are waiting", says it.
The regulation of lowers ends in Tschych Republic with the beginning of 2011 and increases, according to RPG Byty, are an economic need.
"And, the current lowers do not always appreciate the level necessary for the simple maintenance of the housing fund," records Pavel Kllimes, the re-idental Portfolio Director of the RPG Byty society, which is just the neglect of the fund for housings that makes the homehold in furniture is the main reason for the increase of the loan.
However, in 5 years between 2005 and 2010, RPG could invest in 4 billion apartments, in four years of 2011 to 2014, that should be 5.2 billion.
The large screen increased in the plastic face of the waiting room of the Havirosvka Street, however, reflects some red information.
"Increased lower in 2011 is 15 percent, and less than 3 1200 apartments are more than 90 percent of RPG apartments."
"Et will always be at over 7,50 chess corners on m2 per month," the screen indicates.
The increase of 38 per cent is only 400 RPG portfolio apartments.
"In these cases, it is a very low amount of 19.66 cheques at m2", added RPG.
The next year the lower will remain the same for 2600 apartments.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation will not cause radial, but progressive increase of 4 to 8 years.
It adds other commitments: all the money of lower increase (e. g. the graph) is provided to apartments in the form of heating economy - new windows and heating.
Those who sign the lower increase agreement have priority.
The mother school is also part of the offices, including architects.
The Adriopoint of Brno is the new seat of the Arch. Design company.
Nobody could have been expected that he also opened a maternal school with all that needs - color walls, imaginative meals, games and finally a field of miniature games on the earth.
Since October of the last year, children of employees can be made there from Arch. design.
The Architectric Project Society Architectural Architectur, whose workshops produced a large number of constructions in Brno, imagined its mini maternal school for business since the first buildings of the Avriopoint building.
It worked approximately 90 people, especially in the age of children, and it was interested that architect women and heads of projects could quickly return to work.
At the same time as decreased work contracts, the maternal school is a bonus for his employees by the Arch. Design society. in the framework of its social program.
Constructors and architects have so the possibility of carrying out a work with children's care.
These are the employees of Arh.Design themselves who imagined this maternal school and with the support of the direction they have been able to obtain a dotation of the European Union and the Ministry of Work and Social Affairs.
The maternal school is funded by means of the European Social Fund through the operational programme of human resources and the state budget of the Czech Republic.
They could buy equipment and devices and after two years to ensure a qualified staff as well as road-based staff.
After the use of the funding donation (two years) the Arch. Design society. has the obligation after 3 years to operate the maternal school on its own funds.
The preparation of the project has been a year, and it is the economic rating society who helped the request for the donation.
Children's care is provided by a qualified staff, every day a nurse and maternal Institute take care of children. Children can go to maternal school without age limitation, but more than three years of age.
As it is a "mare school" it may have only five children present at the same time, but in the day there are more than one replacement.
The functioning of school is flexibility according to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use this school without regard to the chirurgic position.
Although it is a care and individual education, the maternal mini school programme is comparable to the prescolary education.
Children are not only playing, but a quality teaching is also secured - from the beginning until the preparation of school banks is teaching English.
The class is equipped not only with imaginative games and games but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of children in society creates an amical and positive environment.
Parents can at any time control their child and do not have the stress of a late to go looking for children in a distant school from the work of parents.
The parents therefore use their work time in the most productive way.
It is not wonderful that a natural relation to loyalty between employees and employees is created.
Arch.Design.s is so included among companies that offer a choice bonus for the recruitment of new employees and who are friendly towards the family and through this programme to strengthen RH marketing.
The house in the house is still excited after 100 years. Get an eye in the Gaudi's inners.
The topic appears to the two of a pre-historial saurie, the scatter to a vertubral column of dinosaur and balcony with open fishing bottles.
This is how the Casa Batlo house is in Barcelona of the Antoni Gaudi architect.
Because of its organic forms, the house received from the places the surname of Maison in the bones.
Organic shapes, wild colours, inhabitable use of stones, chariots and museums, fa√ßad memory of balls and everywhere presents the corbs, here's all that's like to the New Art d'Antoni Gaudi.
The front fa√ßade of the house deploys its dream lines, its pleasant colours and textures that remember the nature and the animals.
During more detailed observation, geometria, rythme and order thought with specificity.
In the night the fa√ßade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is allumed so that the impression of lightness of the colours is strengthened.
The roughness and the torsion of forms also appears in the insides with the same measure.
The tree is in vacuum, the window frames, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyeletton and the lames.
The house Battlo, located in the Eixample street, is born from the construction of a 1877 architect Emilio Sala Courts.
The reconstruction was two years old and the house ended in 1906.
The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, first emphasized the removal of the old construction and the construction of another new but quickly accepted the idea of Gaudi's inhabitable reconstruction and better market.
But the idea of Casa Battlo was not thought by Gaudi alone.
The Josep Mary Jujol architect worked with him.
It is just on its project that decorations are born for an apartment of the owner of the immeuble and the use of the museum for fa√ßade.
For fa√ßade also worked other artists and creators.
The common work for the household Casa Battlo started with successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol participated in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and the Guell park in which there are other works in Gaudi.
The places renamed the hot house just after his end because of its organic forms "la Maison in bone".
Others, with regard to the specific opening mechanism of windows, called the "the house that bails".
It is said that above the construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the Master of Catalogue.
Other elements of building sculpture contains hidden religious reasons.
Gaudi thought for the house a unique system in its central heating time, with the events of action and typical routes.
Their 45 degrees seems to be awesome.
During the creation of Gaudi did not absolutely respect the high construction directives and have not been led to enter them.
At the beginning of the construction he received from the city the permit to build, knowing, of course, that the data provided on reconstruction plans was so vague than two years after the end of the municipal council was warranted and requested changes.
For example, he did not like members of the municipal council to fill the building pilars on the public trottoir.
There was never a change, but otherwise, only 15 days after the call of Josep Battlo (and receives pleasure) the authorisation to loving the two highest stars.
The owner shall move to the lower visions.
In the gallery at the second floor, there was a common room and third room and a private part of the apartment.
The re-de-chausse was lowered with an adjudication.
The whole house of six stars is shared by a escape by which you get reached to an independent towel terrace.
All the right corners and the right lines were canceled by the basic elements of the reconstruction and replaced by core walls.
Gaudi also works the modern concept of space linking.
The common part can be fully linked by opening the room doors and high society can communicate comfortably or, if the private space is limited for more intimidable interviews.
The house with the reconstruction of Gaudi also received new fa√ßades a non-traditional beach and two more stars.
Gaudi's game with light is also impressing, blue and white knees with which the internal core is decorated and with light pumps.
The game with two colours gives a maximum light in all the stars of the house.
It was just enough to count on the principle than white reflects more than the shadow that opposed the sun races.
The Casa Battlo house, which was included in 2005 to the United Kingdom Patrimoine Fund, may be visited by each one.
At the first vision of the house is the cheapest apartment and the greatest accessible to the public.
The owners decided to translate this step in 2002 at the 150th anniversary of the birth of the Creator.
They continued to visit because they found that it was a lucrative company and have extended the field of visits to common spaces and borders, including tobacco terraces.
The income bill in the monument is not really sweet and costs 16.50 euros; students, pensions, groups and tourism card holders have 20 percent of rabais.
The sum is even above the entrance price in the other buildings of Gaudi in the city.
If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic tours, you must quickly find a camarade among the inhabitants of the inhabitants and visit the house completely.
How to choose a mass and a summ: Women have other criteria than men.
None of attention, but rather of the quality of the surface reserved on the bed, so the material and the sommer gives a real basis for a good bed.
They must, of course, complement harmonised to plague a particular user.
During the choice, several things are decisive: weight, size, age, health status and sex of the owner.
The type of inner in which you're going to place the matelas and the summer is also important.
A typical example?
For example, in the campaign house where the latex materials are not appropriate, because they are softly "wearing".
They have, from surrounding, a weight higher than the standards of polyur√©tane.
It is necessary to return frequently.
If they also don't have enough ventilation channels in the heart and, in addition, they remain on a solid planet, they are humidity. Of the meat may also be formed.
The usual is also decisive in the choice.
The one who passes the light of time to the foreigner where we are often used very slow mates with a ramolling sleeve, will be difficult to feel well on a low and hard surface.
"It's so all hokeyists who return from NHL make it possible they can't sleep there."
"On their feet, feet and coasts, they needed meats with a massive swimming sleeve of smoothing mousse."
"As such materials are also recommended for those who suffer diabetes who have a trouble of the nervous system that therefore take the bad "information" of the articles and skin," Sylva Adamczikova explains that specializes in the rewarded meals.
That's why there's a few years ago the matela with the perseuse mousse acquired hokeyists and other customers.
"Today all walks good, Tempur, Magnifex's statute but also the Tropico cup has appropriate mates.
You don't need to be a NHL guy to appreciate a peasant mousse.
This "miracle" is just working.
It optimizes its rigidity and its form according to the absorbed heat or well adapted to the warming of your body.
No pressure on you and you won't return the night as after a hard game.
You just sleep better.
The parish mousse is also functioning as a protection against square.
For the selection of the material according to your size, add the length of your feet, or approximately 21/34 cm.
A man and a woman with an size of 180cm therefore needs a bed of 210/220 cm.
The minimum width for each for two places should be 90 cm or 180 cm.
For beds at one place, the singles, for example, are recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm.
It's in case of visit.
'Cepend it is a simple line for the width of the bed: When you are laid on the dose, you should have hands of comfortable way with the lightly enlarged coudes. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of Matelassiers and Decorators, which has been devoted for many years to the problem of a healthy sleep and the angony of mobilizing and teaching it in specialized schools.
For a bed at two places each needs its own summit and matelas, therefore attention during the purchase to select the height of the matelas.
Unless it remains you only to mount the summ to different heights and it is not realisable on all bed frames.
The mousse mass should have a minimum height of 14 cm, the materials at least 15 cm, and this should be calculated for the shape and action cut at least three centimeters.
"To touch or in position sit on the mate you don't have to feel the resorts," says Helena Prokopova.
Each mate requests a well-determined type of summing.
The bed-sumer, when the matelas and the smoke are unique as nice sisters, has nothing to do in the bedrooms.
The mateles were very bad; we must not wake it, what is so cutely doing today.
And as it is usually transferred from 0.2 to 0.75 the sugar is clear that after 5/7 years, the matele starts to remember a large (and bottle) thiny.
For this reason, specialists refuse to make the claim on a lifetime of 25 years for a material or guarantee for life.
But it's all about her but.
And this is why a experience advice of the sales: for an 120/140cm mate, renew, for the clothes, hygiene or milk, but rather add a protection material that you can easily remove and laver.
And even though from our day it is frequent to manufacture clothings with slippers for all the whole, it is that after opening there are two parties (for the washing and the size of the lake machine is very important!) but the manipulation for the large models (and for one person) becomes when the fight is removed between a light weight and a lower weight on a ring.
Did you have a rigid plane in your bed instead of a summer?
Never!
Maximum for a bed for visitors for one night only.
However, tear the planet (se there is no) of assets and use the materials of sorts with a minimum height of 15cm with sachets ( Germany Taschenfederken) and a swimming pocket.
A polyur√©tane material must not be part of a bed of this type.
For lame thumbs at unique position with 14/18 lambs, sandwich materials or sandwichs (because the combination of latex and coco nix), are the ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mate with more lame, 28 and above, where the lames are doubled in the lower part of the nix and that it is so possible to regulate the rigidity.
For the mass to several positions, it should not be taken from resort materials because it does not respond to the changes of position.
On the basis of the rigidity of the lame can also be installed what is called a shoe beach.
It is a special connection of the lames that allows you to see pressure to touch the lame so that the shoe of the dorm "s'integ" is well.
For men who have "groups so large as both the two," it's really an important thing.
This thing is already considered by matelas manufacturers which began to use a ramolling zone at the level of skins.
But they also think women - they offer again a more moleculous surface at the hawk level.
For the hardest client there are summs for flowers or plastics with what the calls a multiforce suspension.
pressure dissisms in more points and continues to tension.
But of course, attention, since you use a bad earlier (which and hair) on good and sommer materials, the "plus" would be shot.
The basic rules is a simple earning: the earring must support the head and its points must reach only the balls, so that the muscles of skins may be relaxed.
The recommended size is 50X60 cm that Scandinaves prevailed by example.
When the thickness is reached on the side, the orange must put a level (including the thumbnail beach or the ramill area in the matelas) the height of the balls.
Modern materials still have something common with the first-based pole and herbs.
Manufacturers still use natural materials or mixtures.
The tendance is also on the bio materials.
The primary materials based on petrol, from which the polyur√©tane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oil, for example of soja oil.
Before all known manufacturers use the soja.
"The Bio qualification for materials means that the heart is manufactured based on natural products", explains Petr vasicek of the Tropico Plus society.
Natural materials are also used for the clothes of the materials; one of the first was the true ale.
But you can add micro-capsules that develop forest parfums or lavande.
There are differences between man and woman.
While the extract of boiling plants so that the clothing of the mate packs heat and refreshes the body, "refroidit" the man, the "shapt" clothings of women.
Red weight extract accelerates blood movement and is therefore warm for low sex.
Current favorites?
The materials produced from cold mousse (those has more portions with a perturbated cell structure, therefore more respiratory than standard polyur√©thane and has more elasticity.
The combination of different rigidities of fresh mousts gives polyzones that are precisely known where the head is, the bottom of the two and the feet.
You pay a quality material from 7000 krones and more.
Those who are characterised by their health parameters have less than TVA and are taken as health instruments.
In the Czech Republic, Gumotex has reached the first place.
Economism for the material and the dream is not simple.
It may be timefully in the framework of special actions from the part of manufacturers or producers two materials for the price of one.
As for example, the Magniflex Society, which offers Duofreeze Matelas with memory mousse in bed for 11990 krones.
We can obviously take the second free.
The era of parish or viscoelastic mouses with an open cell structure and a large slower was launched with the temperature material to a "cosmic reythm".
This started as a matter for NASA because astronautes were subject to the starting of huge load factors.
The temperature relaxed in warming and, in the contrary, cold.
So it is perfectly adapted to the hot human body and distributes an optimal pressure.
For this reason it is ideal against the bad sleep and for an increase in comfort during the sleep.
Viscoelastic mouses are used not only for materials, but also for health products, such as special cousins for feet that thresholds and vessels.
Czech manufacturers, for example, use the EucathermC museum or Twinsaver or the same type.
The devices to follow people are more requested by parents who want to monitor their children.
The fear for their child leads more people to think about monitoring them through a GPS.
The system, set up at the beginning to search cars, can also be well-madely used to move people and help for some cases as an example of the small Anicka Janatkova.
The instrument is currently so large as a bottle of alumen but will soon be the size of a show.
The case of the small Anicka has evaluated a lot of people and they have started seeking ways to protect their children better.
Even if the price is to worry about their private life.
"We're trying to say to everyone that it's not spioning but only another way to reduce the probability that there is another tragedy," Peter Pilin of the Macro Society, who is one of the providers of trading devices on the Czech market.
"I appreciate that there may be cases of bad employment of such devices, such as put it into the bag of a person who is not present, but I have not yet met such cases."
"The majority of people are customers who actually buy the product for security reasons, add Pilin.
The children should always know what purposes it is used and how to use it in emergency.
The psychologist for children, Dana Bockova, takes attention that if the child is not willing to put on him something like that, it will be disappeared.
"And the smallest can show a great creativity when it is to disappear from something explicitly when they don't want to be under control."
"The portable phones, which can be closed like these drive devices, have already brought parents a long waiting", said Bockova.
According to her, the fact that this type of apparence can help in case of aggression is very delayable.
"If this is a preparated rape, the author will do everything so that the child does not have an electronic device that can place it."
"Actually, it's the phone."
"They will develop trading devices, they (Criminal) will be looking for them as well as the sale will be supported by a publicity campaign."
"In such cases, criminals will always be progressed on the police," said the psychologist.
It advises all the same that such devices can help during an aggression not prepared by a pedophil.
According to Robert Cech of the RC Monitoring Society, which offers trail services both for cars and persons, states that this type of device can help, even if it is destroyed in the case of aggression.
"The device may be parametered so that it is regularly emission after a determined period."
"In the case where the device is destroyed, it remains even the last position of the person concerned."
'Larger devices also have an inkliometer, which immediately indicates the position of the person who has scattered and found in long-term position,' says Cech.
According to him, smart phones say that are equipped with a navigation system can offer a comparable service after formatting it with a special protocol.
The problem of current trailing systems is that it is a similar device to those that are depending on the size of an alumbrate boat or the smallest telephone devices.
We can always lose them.
According to the Macro Weil society Pilina, this is why tests are currently carried out to make devices similar to common digital shows.
"This will have the benefit that the eventual aggression can not recognize the trace device."
"Well, he will take account of it after some time, what will be given to the police a little more time," he adds.
The trailing device will be developed in the shape of bracelet or independent, it will always use the same technology as to traffic cars.
This is a combination of acquisition systems of a position through the GPS (which is usually used in autonavigation) and a function of a portal phone that warns the current position of a vehicle.
The army has so declined as she could make the tour of the Czech Republic with him, but it can only hold two years.
The army bought for 445 km of fingers used for explosives.
Last year, the Ministry of Defence had bought 224 km.
The army has therefore reservations for 225 years.
The problem is that the duration of rows is of two to four years of maximum.
The army has bought detonants to the anonymous STV Group society for 40 million kitchens.
The General State has given a reason for the acquisition of a huge amount of detonants in MF DNES that soldiers use 60 km per year.
According to the reservation calculations made by the military pyrotechnicians that MF DNES has contacted, it is that even generals, officials having a command, secretary or employees should have an annual year to the explosives.
Alexandere Vandra, Minister of Defence and Vlastimil Picek, commander of the army, do not exclude.
Only to argument the annual consumption of the army of 60 km detoning fingers.
This distance corresponds to 25,000 explosions.
And even if it was true, the military books could be found for 10 years.
On the contrary, it would be true that for the base of each of the new professionals it is enough to more than 2 meters of detoning sheep, as the experts say, that means that the army with its new purchase has assured ‚Äì with the consumption of special units and genetics - the reservations mentioned for the 225 years.
However, fast-term intervention soldiers were recently complained to the Minister Vandra that they have almost no munitions for their poing weapons and that road meetings are limited due to the needs of money.
On the lack of body linge isn't talking about it.
"And I don't take my head if they buy at us so much of detoning sheep."
"And is their decision and they really know what they are doing."
"For us, the army is a good client that we work as a trade in content", said the STV Group Trade Director Jan Decky.
Jan Pejsek, a port-lave of the Ministry of Defence, arguments the acquisition of hundreds of kilometres detonants because the army will have these "munitions" reserved for 10 years.
Jan Decky of STV Group, however, states only four years of life of detonants and police pirotechnicians for only two years.
"If they are perfectly undertaken in the deposits, it can even go to four years," said one who didn't want his name to be published in respect of the army's crisis.
The past period of life, each munition must be tested to see whether it remains intact and does not threat the lives of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not free and are still costing money.
The other argument of the Ministry is a rabais to the amount of 445 km of detonants.
"They have costed us 60 per cent less than the delivery of the past 245 km", says Pejsek port port that is interpretation of the opinion of buyers of the Ministry of Defence.
Only to compare: the annual consumption of the police-based pyrotechnics that neutralize the munitions of the Second World War or that after the Soviet Army, is not exceeding 1500 meters.
And the police always commands only the necessary amount of munitions to be used before the end of their life.
This has been established for the safety of pyrotechnics and for more flexible ways to obtain more modern and more reliable cracks.
The Ministry of Defence has today great problems for the neutralization of ten tonnes of munitions coming from the Varsovian Covenant time when the Czechoslovak Army was prepared to move, captain on Rhin.
What is waiting for some years this Czech army that MF DNES has contacted: neutralize hundreds of old kilometres of detoning cows that it has bought today "a good market".
Today, I'll benefit from contacts that I've obtained through the concours.
The sale under French of his hotel has well assisted Lukas Pytloun for the rental place of the help of the best individual enterprise.
The buyer of the concours of the best individual entrepreneur for the past year was Lukas Pytloun, undertaking of 28 years.
His adventure to the success is like in a film.
Lukas Pytloun likes to travel.
And in the foreign, he considered that in Lib√®reec there was a quality hotel site at a reasonable price.
His economics on what he had gained when he worked to the foreign and with the help of a banking loan, he bought a small amount of 5 apartments to half disaster.
Aware that he was still a study in the threeth year of higher studies, it was a comfortable action.
"The relationship between the quality and the price of a accommodation in our region has given me desire to do something", said Lucas Pytloun.
It began to enjoy the first apartment reconstructed foreign workers.
He re-invested the benefit in the immune that he converted in pension with 54 beds.
Since this moment, his company's action allowed him to open in Lib√®reec 4 pensions, two style restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of approximately 300 beds of all types of accommodation.
The most comfortable of them was the four stars Pytloun design.
This year, it came to him another of the same quality.
"We've just signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrova U Tise where we sold our concept of French and other candidates to the Pytloun hotel's franchise," number 1 of the enterprises in the past year.
"Et for the sale of licensing for the operation of a large-scale hotel, the victory in the support of the undertaking of the year has well served, add Pitloun with a appreciation.
The victory brought him more popularity and to be known to Lib√®reec and its surroundings.
"The people recognized me in the streets, often welcomed me, and I must say that it was very nice," he remembers.
He recommends the participation of this concours to all those who strive to do something.
It is not necessary to win but any opportunity to be visible is good.
He said he was using his contacts and knowledge that he couldn't be able to get another way.
"Applause of those I've met by support, I started to maintain commercial relations regularly.
According to him, the successful recognition had also affected employees.
And it's about 70.
"I'm observed in their homes the faithfulness and privilege of being undertaken in something that has been generally recognized."
"It is not, and far away, the only result of my personal work, but the result of a good work of all of us together.
"It's just my name is stolen in front," said Lucas Pytloun with modestity.
I want my successor a better year than the one we had in Farmet.
The euphory of the victory has been replaced by the effects of the crisis.
Thanks to the sense of the Farmet winner goals the worst moments behind myself.
The one who came looking for the price in Slovansky during the first place of the concours for the company of the year organised by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of Farmet society.
The jury rewarded the efforts with which he transformed an extension workshop to Ceska Skalice in a firm to the number of cases of 100 million krones.
"I can say that the reward has not only encouraged my fellow workers and has increased our confidence in fighting competition," says today the winning of the concours of the last year.
At the beginning of the Farmet society's history, there was a desire to do something useful.
And as the state proposed to the father of Karel Zdrasky to lodge the small workshop as compensation after the confidence of the goods by the communists, he did not have long, he rejected a carrier in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with some camarades in the area of his father for the manufacture of plastics.
Not far after they began to specialize in the presses for vegetable oil.
It has become after eighteen years the largest car press producer in Central Europe.
The company was even known in the non-specialised public after successfully obtained support through media.
"Do not only our customers have started to know the Farmet mark but also the foreign partners who began to take account of they were working with a company who had the largest success in its country of origin," said Karel Zdarsky.
But the end of the year wasn't past in Farmet only leaving the euphorie of the victory.
The assessment of the company was made from the 2008 economic results and part of 2009.
And just in 2009, it was the most difficult year for the sale of engineering machines.
At the top of the crisis, which did not really touch citizens, societys were obliged to stop their investment projects and to start limiting their acquises of new materials and technologies.
"We haven't seen escaped from this situation."
"The numbers of business fell from 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and even license", explains Karel Zardsky.
A viable society must know that time-time needs to take impulsive measures.
But they have managed the situation correctly and have kept benefiting results even if they were lower than those they had before the crisis.
However, they continued without compromise to invest in research and development.
"We built a training and research centre with donations, strengthened the presentation of society in international exhibitions and gained the main rewards in national exhibitions," said Zdarsky.
Let us all think that the crisis is behind them.
The figures of discrepancies are also the number of employees.
"A new winner I want this kind of victory but in a quiet atmosphere," said Karel Zdarsky.
The survey removed by unwiss regulations.
The survey on the Absolution of the year is a fourth part of the business clan.
Some absurd regulations could be removed.
The lack of the glorious winner of this year of the Absurance Research for the year was the obligation to add to document offices that officials can get on-line.
More than the third of the 4000 voters voted for this.
For example, social business administration requested an extra paper from the trade register while the officer can get it in two mouse buttons.
it changes through investigation.
"The Czech Administration of Social insurance will no longer request the extract of the trade register for payment controls," said Jana Buranova, Czech Administration of Social insurance (CSSS).
All Regulations and Decree that companies and entrepreneurs must comply in the Czech Republic and remove those absurds is the sense of this concours of the Absurdity of the year.
This investigation is still in this fourth year a part of the business clan organized by Hospodarske newny and has a greater popularity.
If the last 3000 voters were revealed, at least 4000 have given their votes at least this year.
And this is not astonished, there are the most different legal obligations in our country that makes it only to leave the company, and, above all, more.
"We may have a number of documents to complement for fiscal statements to the first places in the world," Karel Havlicek said the Association of Small and Mediterranean enterprises and the Czech Republic.
The simplification of the undertaking activity becomes a goal of all governments in the last few years.
In comparison with the whole world, the situation in Tsych Republic does not improve everything.
According to the World Bank, the Czech Republic is situated at 74th place for the conditions for the company, or 8 places more than the last year.
The Concours of the Absolution of the year has been established for the first time in 2006 and continued each year according to the same scenario.
Any one can make a state every year of the administrative and officer absurdities of April to end September, last time before the closure of the concours.
To take account of the site www.firmaroku.cz. then the concours organizer chooses seven candidates for the "antiprix" and let the public vote on the site www.firmaroku.cz/absurated and on www.ihned.cz.
The absurd that has received the largest number of voices is made vain.
Until the last year's investigation is a hundred or more exactly 105 regulations and decisions that have lost their sense of existing.
Notes are sent by entrepreneurs but also by professional unions and teachers.
Among the "financies" of the concours, for example, the obligation that the vehicles for maintenance of authors and rapid paths are paid, or even if the undertakings with twenty employees have reached two offices and two toilettes every two years.
the list of the seven proposals is published on the website of the concours.
The proclamation of the concours, which always begins at the beginning of November on the Place Venceslas in Prague, is a part of a event to which regularly participates in political and public life personalities.
This year, for example, Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association for the Small and Mediterranean Business of Czech Republic or Peter Kuzel, Chairman of the Czech Trade Chamber, assisted at the time of the culminant concours.
"Economy prosperity can not work when the State puts asstones in the buses of entrepreneurs and therefore my goal is to remove, at least three ten paragraphs that today do only comply with the company," said Martin Kocourek, the Minister of Industry and Trade.
The effort to remove absurd declines is not a sword in the water.
In 2007, what was not pleasing to people was the obligation of enterprises to declare three days before the Office for the individual company where the company is located, the intention of go to an exhibition or penalty with a state.
This obligation was deleted with the adoption of the Law on the individual company.
The second compliance in 2007, which was to declare to the Working Office a service travel for a foreign employee for 30 days, was removed with the Law text on the name of the green card.
And it's okay to the third session of the concours.
The 2009 Absurdency was the decrease for Physotherapeutes to have a large middle in their cabinet, a fryer and two automatic balances.
This was changed by order by the Ministry of Health in the past year, the obligation to have a refrigerator was deleted.
A new category recognizes the socially responsible firms.
ecological, humanitarian, training, or other sports are evaluated.
The newness of this year of the Hospodarske Noviny Concours, which has already been for five years, is the category called the Responsible Society of 2010.
The unjective of this concours is the support of the reasonable and fair business.
"We want to support companies who monitor the impact of their environmental business and lead socially responsible activity," says Patrick Bartholdy, regional manager of the Portable Telephone Operator, the firm Vodaphone, which is the garant and promotion of this concours, such as in the case of the rebellion of the year.
For this first year of this subcategory of the 2010 firm for the 2010, organized by the Vodaphone firm, the company who did not succeed with a long-term goal for the company.
The adventure of each of them is rich of inspirations and an independent article would be edited.
Although the object of their undertakings is different than one of the other, they can consider their support and prevision activities as the denominator of their efforts.
For one of the cases, this concerns persons with disabilities and personal problems or health of their employees.
Among the final quarters of the Czech Republic, the company of Prague Prologics and Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams of their employees who then participate in many tournois in different sports disciplines.
Another example of a firm responsible in the Pardubice region is the Isolit-Bravo company, which has been the main contribution to the donation fund that sponsorise children with disabilities.
As a result of employees with health problems, the old use of Podebrad paper manufacturing can be cited more than 70 percent, which has thus obtained the title of the accountable firm for the Central Boh√™me region, which was thirdly placed in the region in the context of the Society of the year organised by Vodaphone.
In Olomouc, it is MiRyz Soft, a financial society, who has gained to have introduced absolute work hours and even reduced until 35 hours a medium week and, without, proportionally, declined.
The jury also gave it the title because it is in priority to the Czech producers, supports a ditogian activity in the nearest environment and worried about the environment.
"We strive to recycling the most possible so that our business and administration have at least the impact on the environment," says Milus Ryznarova, the Executive Directorate of the Society.
IT Responsible Society is also thinking about the health of its employees and has established them for each portable computer a chais and ergonomic key, encourages their home work and uses local protected use for its actions.
"We also support the foundation The man in the shadow that helps the local Rome community," said Ondrej Searchy representative of society.
In the last row, also for its activities, a Lavage and cleaning society in the Carlovy Vary region, who is involved in the restraint insurance of its employees in the form of bonus above standards.
"In our society we contribute to food, transport, qualifications and loans", said Joseph Strapac of the bruntal Czasch company, winner for Moravie-Silesia region.
It was automatically included in the Responsible Society, all regional finalists for the Concours of the Society of the year of Vodaphone, who had responded to the questionnaire in the attachment of the document for the registration and sent it to the organization before August 15.
Bad replys in the questionnaire were removed by the organization.
"If representatives of licensed firms had not responded to questions, they couldn't be able to participate in the support of the Responsible firm but would not be unqualished by the "principal" competition of the Society of Vodaphone's year".
"Independent registrations are not possible because it is a subcategory of the main concours of the company of the year", explains Karel Goldman of the Bison‚ÄìRose Organising Agency.
At the Territory Fund in Plzen, the police was arrested during a public concours
In the building of the Territory Fund in Plzen, the police anti-corruption has been arrested in these last days.
Detections have passed less to the local undertaking and operating in real estate Lubos. G.
This was tried to just manage a call for public offers for the regulation of a refund application so that a proposed candidate was obtained by a determined candidate.
This should be paid to Lubos G. a half million courones.
"Otherwise I can only confirm that the police continues a person for a offence in the framework of an invitation of offers and public concours" said for the Pravo newspaper the Chief of the Plzen Antonie Eugene, knowing that it is prohibited to provide more exhibitions because the investigation is currently undertaken.
After 24 hours, the police officers sent this undertaking of 46 years in freedom.
In order to know how he could inflate on a public concours, it may only be explicit to such a few official information.
On a question of Pravo, the Lubomira Cerna Foundation Foundation of the Lubomira Cerna indicated that police officers had actually been arrested in Plzen on a separate workplace and that, during the public support.
"It is a customer and in any case of employees, is it specificed.
The public concours according to Cerna was a true name "Apple to propose rights for the transfer of fields according to the Earth Law" and is placed when several beneficiary candidates are demonstrated.
"These persons propose, in the context of the call, a higher value of their rights to resorts which must be regulated before the value of the field is announced."
"In accordance with the proposed rights, a classification of purchasers is set up, and the Earth Fund then transflows the ground to the person who proposed the highest rights," explained the Foundation Port.
Lubos G. had clearly the information on those who were registered in the call and as it is itself, also a person to benefit because he bought a large number of refund rights, it had proposed candidates to not participate in the support.
And he was uncertainly drowned by the fact that he was departing.
What would explain why he had so much money in his possession at its interpellation.
Lubos G. had broadly contacts above standards in the FdT (Standards).
It was identified in the case of the former Chapter of the FdT Vaclav Sankot who was pursuant to the penal to expand fields for which the decision was already encountered by establishing a construction.
Only Lubos G., for example, had been obtained fields for the construction of public communications, concretely in place and place where the art of access to the industrial zone of Borske Pole should be built.
Further, he exchanged it with the mass for a building in the historic centre of the city whose value is very far.
The mass was obliged to accept because it would, unless, make the construction lost by a blocking of the fields.
Genes will pay an additional of a hundred krones per month for the housing.
Meanwhile must pay a supplement not only for all types of energy, but also for water and sanitation, heating supplies and some places, lowers will also be increased.
Thus, from January, the families will go away from their door-monnaie to a hundred of curons a monthly more than now.
The electricity increases 4.6 percent, the gas of almost 2 per cent more, in some places you will pay up to one decade of more water supply and in many places, the central heating providers will also be more harder.
The growth of electricity should be advised for the 100 knights in the apartment of the apartment.
However, all suppliers have reduced electricity prices as given significant development to encourage the manufacturing of renewable energy, including photovoltacco piles.
The gas grows moderately but, of course, when people need it the most heat and therefore have the largest consumption.
So a hundred of curons can also be counted in more.
Although electricity and gas grow in all the Czech Republic, the change of the central heating price varies from town.
These are mainly the largest common planning price increase.
For example, female houses in Pardubice or Hradec Queenoce paid from January for central warming nearly 50 krones over a month, Lib√©rec families paid more than 1000 krones annually.
For the inhabitants of Prague, 9 per cent is prepared to increase water and sanitation in the case where the city increases infrastructure lowers.
If lowers do not change pragues, an additional 6.8 percent pay.
The price in Prague will still be part of the lowerest in comparison with the whole country.
In North Boh√™me, where prices are already part of the highest, water and sanitation increased from 7.4 per cent.
Lower prices will, for example, increase significantly in 450 thousand apartments from January, to say at the end of regulation.
For example, the CPI Byty company that is located in Usti nad Lamb nearly 2500 apartments, has decided to increase up to 100%.
Those who will not agree with the new increase of loans will be transferred to the courts by society.
Regular lowers people in about 300,000 apartments could increase the next 10 percent year.
Czech children are sauvating the rum and fernet. Beer is no more mode and acts quite slowly.
Hernet, rhum, vodka and exceptionally the best whisky mark is also flowed to parents.
These are drunks that are most often drunk those who have not yet 15 years, among the hands of the doctor.
Children who are subjected to hospital for reciprocity do not be excepted.
This results from the experience of doctors who meet cases similar to the admissions of hospital children.
"The birds or wines are not more mode, because it is necessary for time to be saouply."
"The tendance is really strong alcools," says Pravo Ludek Pelikan, Chief of Children of the Horovice hospital in Central Boh√™me.
"When they succeeded to close a dad's bottle in the army, it's sometimes whisky but it's the fernet and the vodka that prevalent.
"The vodka has this benefit that they can miss it with the fruit juice and so don't feel it", explains the Departement Chapter.
Eva Jurinova, Port of the Motol hospital, also gives him reason.
"In general, it's rhum or fernet."
"This is today alcohol at the mode, especially in elementary schools."
"In some cases, it was the slivishness they returned from the house," added Jurinova.
According to the Pirate Bay Chapter, see children aged for thirteen to fourteen years to hospital admissions is a normal phenomenon.
Before working in Horovice since the past year, he was in Motol where he performed ten years in pediatria, where ambulance led to the entirely ivory students.
"A young girl has been hospitalized four times.
"There started her card to twelve years when she was brought with 3.5 per thousand alcohol into blood with more than a mega with extasy," the doctor described this particularly important case.
"These was at the Park of the Oleovice Exhibitions to a party."
"What's interested is that he was not wearing the mother that his daughter is absent of 48 hours," said the Department Director.
It is just the divergence of parents or their tolerance outside the common face that their refusals are the main cause of the development of children's alcoholism.
The specialists, however, are not talking about the independence, in its severe sense, for children.
"Sub vocable alcool is heard a chronic dependence in the alcohol of several years with all the fenomen that disappear, but it is not found in children."
"From those who use acool to repair, it's rather a socio-familial back-ground significantly unfamily," explained the Chief of the Department of Pelikan.
According to the Jurinova door, approximately forty Irish children have been hospitalized this year until mid-November in the pediatric clinic in Motol.
In statistics only are integrated in cases with severe intoxication required for hospitalization.
Irish children who are after emergency care returned to them by parents or by police are not accounted.
Besides the cases of children sitting and drinking a bottle of alcohol after school, he exits according to P√©likan three seasonal vapours with which we can account: the day of sorceries, the Holy Sylvestre and the end of the school year.
"If they drink after bad results or otherwise, they celebrate the start of holidays."
"I'm sure I lived on the day of the neighbors a receipt of seven children of one occasion," said Pilikan.
Children who had passed the night in the hospital in desintoxization under medical control is paradoxally in best position than the one who came home to him and suffers the next day of the wood tree.
Morning head mass caused by dihydratation and a lack of glucose are eliminated by a glucose infusion and nutritional elements that the body needs.
"They are better loyal for that because they walk a great evening then a doubt wake up and nothing does wrong to them."
"They are just surrounded from the place where they are", add Pilikan, knowing that for time, this is a good humor of patients at least with the note to pay for their cares.
Follow-up and hospitalization on intensive care bed can go to ten thousands of kitchens.
"On time, I applied this as a means of education, with a view to those children as their ivory costed and that they could pass through the whole season of work to reimburse one evening," add Pilikan.
However, health insurance companys in their in-regression management, which should receive from the parents charges related to care, should not be treated by ivory children.
Two L-159 airports are for the first time in foreign hands in Spain.
Two airports L-159 of the five, against which the Ministry of Defence has changed transport flights Casa C-295M, have collected Friday for Seville in Spain where the Casa-EADS aircraft was settled.
It's the first time that devices of this type become the property of someone else than the Czech army.
They were still in the foreign framework of periods or flights of demonstration.
This is the L-159T1 moved versions, which were still in the Czech Army and were in the air condition.
The remaining devices are monoplace versions of L-159.
These stand for the moment at the Vodochody Air at the Vodochody A√©ro and the commercial intermediary - the Omnipol firm - took into account them last week.
According to Jan Pejsek of the Press department of the Ministry of Defence, the physical departure of Vodochody airports is now unknown.
'L-159 monoplace flights planned for exchange have been taken on stocked aircrafts for long time without this causes additional charges or investments for the Ministry of Defence's Ministry.'
"L-159 T1 switches have been changed in the state," said Pravo Pejsek.
He played that the army will not remain without move because the Ministry signed in May 2009 with A√©ro Vodochody an agreement of 200 million quarters for the transformation of four monoplaces L-159 in use in two movements.
The army took the delivery of the first device in July, the second to the delivery at the end of this year.
Pejsek EADS has been engaged in introducing airports in the equipment of certain countries of Alliance.
"In the contract, it is clear that he who takes account of L-159 aircraft is EADS and will serve the pilots of NATO Member States."
"There is therefore the case of the one who takes into account how to realize this," said Pejsek.
Hospodarske newny announced, there's some time that the Spanish army is not interested by the L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 for Casa aircraft and the purchase of three other carriers for 3.5 billions of kitchens was retained last year by the Government of Mirek Topomanek.
The Ministry of Defence has not launched a call for offers and directly contacted EADS.
The direction of defence argued that the exchange for future exports from L-159 to the foreign.
Czech army bought in Vodochody 72 devices and uses only 24, wanting to sell the rest.
Casa airport is likely to have judicial implications.
The European Commission, however, was complained with the Tsks Ministry of Defence at the European Court of Justice because the aircraft had to be elected in the framework of an appeal of offers at the European level and in any case by contacting a manufacturer directly.
The army has already taken delivery of three Casa airports, the last should come on Prague Kbely airport within two weeks.
A longer index than cancel is a low risk sign
Men who have the longer index than the cancer are exposed to a less risk of having a prostate cancer.
This is the conclusion of a merchant study published by the British magazine Cancer.
This may depend on the level of the mass hormone.
"Our conclusions show that the relative length of the fingerprint of simple risk testing cancer from the prostate, especially for men before 60 years," explained the co-autor of the Ros Eeles study, teacher of the Warwick University.
The finger could so help to determine what men should be reported to the test of the prostate cancer, including by combining genetic risk or other aggregate factors such as family health anti-electenants, added Elees.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed with her colleagues in Britain over 1500 patients at a prostate cancer and at the same time approximately three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the students in the study had the shortest right hand index than the Canceller.
For them as for the 19 percent of those who had the finger of the same length, we have found the same probability of a prostate cancer.
However, in the case of those who had the longer index than the cancelation, 33 per cent of the risk fell, for men before 60 years the decrease of the risk has reached 87 per cent.
The long report of the two towns ‚Äì formed during the prenatal period - indicates, inter alia, different levels of sexual hormones that the child is expressed in the uberus.
At least, a longer index corresponds.
Earlier research showed that it was just the text that helped the development of a prostate cancer.
The Vacla Paces professor, the Czech Genetian and the former President of the Science Academy, said to CTK that it is in the course of this study but it seems not to be, paraly, that the relationship between the length of the fingers and the cancer is "completely demonstrated".
The Czech Republic is under the snow, the authors of D1 and D5 are closed.
Tschechy as most of Europe is this Thursday covered by the snow.
On the roads and throats, most of the time of the snow compact, the deployers worked all night in many places.
The D5 autoroute is closed in the morning between 89 and 93 km in direction of Rozvadov because of several car rental accidents and the D1 airport in Prague's direction.
The disagreement of the Central Motor Club (UAMK) said to the information
In the 91th kilometer, a train was accidented, at 93th weight two hard weights, the accident made hurts.
Several cars were also found in the feed.
The problems are also on the D1 seat to 185 km in direction of Prague.
Two camions were infected there.
Managers should go just after Brno to 190 km or go to Brno and then go to 182 km to Kyvalka.
A car file of several kilometres has been formed at this place.
Against the D11 autoroute, there's an accident and, just when it comes to Prague.
In Prague there is a snow sleeve of several centimeters of thermometers - 7 degrees of Celsius.
For example, car files are created in Prose, the Sterboholska street is also bounced.
The most safe transport means is the metro.
The tramways take for example the line between Place Charles (Krlove Namesti) and the Place of Peace (Namesti Miru).
At eight hours in the morning, the state-major of Prague's crisis must still be gathered.
The railways and the airport also meet problems.
Czech neck Chemins had already been removed because of the snow of 7 fast connections.
For example, the lines of Prague to Kingupy or Prague in Beroun have problems
The travellers should control the current situation.
Ruzyne's airport has been closed since Friday 11:00 in the night until 5:00 a.m.
Most roads in South Moravie are already red, but by relucing monitoring.
On the Vyskov road, three bilateral roads are imputable, on the road of Brno it begins to be placed by the snow races and on the Blansko road, the chains are obligation to pass some communication paths in the highest places.
The Vyskov region has been part of the most touched places.
The axes are closed until now: Rousinov-Slavkov, Bohdalice-Kucerov and Saratice-Milesovice
For cleaning them, it may need to be sent nuts and feeds to snow.
We can't look at the moment when they're rolling.
On the Hodonian road is a skill in the white Carpathes region.
On the roads in respect of the protection of the nature, only undertaken by the expertise of insured products, there are also a 5 centimeter snow warning CTK.
In Tschechya, he fell between two to 10 centimeters of snow; he fell theest in the north Boh√™me, with often, up to 18 centimeters of the snow.
In Moravie-Silesia, he fell up to 15 centimeters of snow.
The absence would be progressively disappeared in Czech Republic.
The Americans have a new "intelligent weapons"
The American army sent to Afghan a new "intelligent army", known only under the XM-25 code.
The generals think that the new automatic fusil will have an impact on the conflict below with the Talibans and "has change the game" to their benefit.
The new arms is as a super precise canon
His projects are guided by lazer with a specification of a few metres.
The special calibre 25 mm munitions developed for this fusil and containing a highly brown explosive, is actually functioning as small grenades.
The munitions can be programmed so that they will explain to the target contact but also to any point of their Baltic trajector.
It is therefore possible to use it against an enemy who hides a barrier, a wall or a fossed.
It is no longer protected from above, and when it falls on a murder rain of steel clothes, it can also put it out of battle.
According to Richard Audette, who participated in the development of XM-25, the new fusil is the first childarm that uses "intelligent".
"The soldier is essentially used as it finds the target, sends him a milk race that determines the distance, as well as a specific visa point, which corrects its visa site and supports the detention.
"Show you lived at 543 meters."
"When you press the detention, the weapon is charged and moved to the distance of 543 meters more or less than 1, 2, 3 metres, Audette said.
400 Delocalized jobs
The Fujitsu group delocalizes its daughter of Bad Homburg to Francfort.
The next year in July, 400 co-operators will transfer to Astro Park their workplace that is currently at the place Marinbader's offices in the Bad Homburg region.
The Japanese Fujitsu group delocalizes its success of Bad Homburg in Francfort.
As he stated in mercred the specialized gender in the manufacture and maintenance of computers, the next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, situated until now on the place of Marienbader of the city of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, greatly complex offices located on the street Leyoner Street of the Quartier Niederrad de Francfort.
A Fujitsu port explained that, in mid-termly term, the group should grow up 100 other jobs that were still explosed until now in the region.
The location offer was extremely attractive. Furthermore, the open air offices of Astro Park are better in the working mode of partners.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was just local.
The Director-General Bernd Wagner said: "Franfurt-Neederrad is a primary location that has a remarkable infrastructure."
It states that the airport connection is just a great importance for a global company like Fujitsu.
The new movement of an important enterprise within the region has resulted in the joy of gains and caused the deception of losers.
The responsibility of the economic affairs of the municipality of Francfort, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), said that once again, a "planeary" actor had been acquired.
It is a "extraordinary professor of faith regarding the place of implantation".
Fujitsu agrees to the city and its implant is an important election for Niedrod.
The Maire of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (Grees), regrets Fujitsu's decision.
The direction has very early informed the municipality of this intention.
"It's going to say that we proposed aid to this company," said Mr. Corwisi.
However, friendly relations couldn't have changed the difficulties of the computer manufacturer with respect to the owner of the Place Marienbader's immune.
Finally, economic reasons would have been decisive.
It is now to avoid that such an exceptional place remains unemployed for a long time.
"I have hope that the owner and the owner of the building will be co-operative."
10 years ago, the immeure of the Place of the Hotel of Ville, used until here by the Fujitsu company and the " vertical" inhabitants, as well as the rest of the place Marienbad, was part of the contrary construction project of the thermale station.
With a joint project of the municipality and a private project development, a new entry of the city was created between the garden and the city Hotel. It is a major critic, not only because of the impressioning surfaces that served in parking, but also because of the height of the immobilities.
In 2001, the investment notation and advice company, Feri, computer manufacturer for travel distribution systems, Amadeus Start, and Fujitsu, producers of computers at the time still associated with Siemens, were amended in the immutables.
In 2006, the German Francfort Specialised Immobilien-Chancen group collected the buildings occupied by Fujitsu at the same time as Morgan Stanley's real estate fund. A later year, these buildings were returned to the Spanish company Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu group whose seat is located in Tokyo is considered as the third largest provider of information products in the world.
For example, it provides computers and servers for the disposal of enterprises and also provides the essential service.
His successoral established in the Rhin-Main region is one of the most important in Germany: Fujitsu is certainly more employees in Munich.
The successual, Fujitsu Technology Solutions, leaves Bad Homburg to install in Frankfurt-Neederrad. The other filials present on this site are Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this reason, 7,000 square meters have taken place in Astro Park.
The old old age of 20, whose name recalls its star plan, opens the seat of the Confederation of the electronic and electrotechnic industry, among others.
Server exhibition by Amazon - Measures against Mr. Assange
Wikileaks proves more difficulties.
The Internet Service provider has issued the website specialized in the revealing of confidential documents.
This attitude may be hidden by political pressure after the publication of the hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic notes.
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr Assange, appears to stay in England.
In the United States, the Wikileaks site is always more forced.
The Wikileaks cyber-activist group has no longer access to its host to America and is now looking for a host in Europe.
During that time, the American Senator, Joe Lieberman, called the other countries and companies to boycotter Wikileaks.
And the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange, which is searched by Interpol, probably stays in Great Britain, according to the information published by newspapers.
"Wkileaks excluded from the Amazon server."
‚ÄúExpression Library to the country of freedom‚Äù said mercredi (local time) cyber-activists in the origin of revealings through the social network Twitter.
Before, the cyber company, Amazon, had removed the Wifileaks' documents from its servers.
After the publication of secret diplomatic notes, cyber-activists had been used to Amazon Web Service (AWS) in order to reach the largest number of access to documents.
Via Twitter, Wikileaks continues its revealings: "Formable, our dollars are now paid to take care of people in Europe."
When the freedom of expression has a problem in Amazon, "they should stop sell books."
The CNN television chain, quoting Mr. Liebermann's office, reported that Amazon prohibited the use of its servers after the investigation carried out by Senator Joe Lieberman.
The Chairman of the Committee on the Protection of the Territory had deceived the Amazon site of encouraging a boycott at its presence, reported the British magazine "The Guardian".
"I would like Amazon to take this measure early in respect of previous publications by Wikileaks of classified information," said the Senator.
Parallelly, Mr. Liebermann called the other countries to refuse the use of servers by platform.
"Wikileaks is illegal, monstery and without groups. This makes our national security in danger and loss life everywhere through the world," according to an independent Senator's communiqu√©.
"No company conscious of its responsibilities, that it is American or foreign, should not help Wikileaks to disseminate the content of the documented documents."
The founder of Wikileaks, Mr. Assange, which is searched by the Swedish authorities because he is suspected by violence, is contained on the list of persons searched by Interpol.
According to the information issued by the London magazine "The Independent", Australia of 39 years lives in Great Britain and Scotland Yard knows exactly where he is.
The cyber-activist continued qualified by his detractors the pursuits committed against Sweden.
The Wikileaks Port Port, Kristinn Hrafnsson, declared in London that threats were made against the site.
"The calls were even launched for the murder of Julian Assange."
That is why Assange is particularly afraid for her security, said Hrafnsson.
That is why the Wikileaks founder continues to hide.
Hrafnsson expressed clearly the statements made in North America.
In America, the former Republical Governor of Armenia, Mike Huckabee, concluded that the responsibility of revealings made by Wikileaks should be pursued and implemented for trace.
In Canada, Mr. Stephen Harper adviser said to the television, in ironic way, that Mr. Assange should "was killed" and that Obama might "use a Drone".
During that time, a polemic deployed between the White House and Mr Assange.
Robert Gibbs, American President, Mr. Barack Obama, qualified by "related and absurd" the fact that Mr. Samange had expired the release of the secretariat of State Hilary Clinton if that was responsible for the order given to diplomates, and has recently published, to deliver himself to explosion activities.
"I don't know exactly why we need to take care of a person owner of a web site," says Mr. Gibbs.
"Our foreign policy and the interests of this country are more important than the claims of a website."
The American Government is now fully moved to the test bank for the protection of its databases.
According to a member of the White House, Mr. Russell Travers, adjourned Director of the Centre of Anti-Terrorist fight, was appointed responsible for combating refugees.
Mr. Travers is charged to establish the necessary structural reforms after the dissemination of diplomatic chambers by Wikileaks.
The White House also wishes to verify the means by which all exchange administration is available and protect the information.
Furthermore, the American Government announced that he wanted to take care of the security of dissidents and military dissidents if they were never threatened by the revealations of Wikileaks.
"We have made everything to enter into contact with them," said the State Party Port, Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if it is necessary."
The Glace University
At the "University Gelato" of Bologna, we will prepare glass confissors to the best seasons of the year.
The starting course of three days organised for future glaciers has been very successful and has taken visitors from all overall.
In fact, from where's the whole glass?
Glacier and glass machine.
The glacier, that is, in Germany, the glass confiscator is some little democrated, produces the crym according to all the rules of the Italian art of the glass manufacturing.
The glass turbine removes the glass crystal of the fresh vitrine with the help of a spatule, it is available in the winter and then begins to sell it.
To know, we don't need to go to Anzola de Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about the glass, cannot avoid the Gelato-University of the Italian firm Carpigiani.
The superbishop founded the glass university in 2003, so that glass crysms out of its machines should respond everywhere to the high Italian ideals.
The starting course of three days organized for future glaciers has been very successful and has taken visitors from all over the world.
It's also offering special courses on the chocolate glass and waiting for several days. In addition, practical meetings are organized in the private glass.
In full crises of the quarantine, some people dreaming with a new card, others are just likely to realize their wills burning on the leather glass.
This time, 40 participants from 19 countries from Brazil to Saudi Arabia have passed through Hungary.
Jacky, artistic education teacher from California is felt for Slow Food movement. He wants to propose a European quality product in the industrial Glace country.
Anke de Berlin is a business management advice, and she wants, after a few years, to take some things to each of this testing meal for the nerfs.
Two Egyptian young dreams dreaming to open a glacerian in Caire.
An original man of Malte and another Brazil coming would like to improve the quality of glass crystal in their bars, and Canada's female female female came because his children worship the Italian glass croms.
The Luiano Ferrari master explains first the ideal characteristics of the perfect glass.
It is decisive not only good saver, but also the lovely and good consistance.
However, Luciano doesn't forget the cereas on the fate of national superstructuring and, in general, southern: "Italic glass is just the best: and then it remains a sacred dose of romanism."
The first stage in the manufacture appears very simple.
Luciano gives base ingredients, such as milk, crym, milk powder, sucre, and stabilisators in a large mixture, which has a 85 degrees through an electronic program, and then immediately reflects four degrees.
He then opens a rocket installed on the machine: it sets out a pastorized white base cell, based on all kinds of milk glass.
The formattor is soon assembled: Is it possible to manufacture glass using only natural substances without stabilising?
How can you give free course to the personal pleasure of expertise?
Mr. Luciano is enduring the fact that it would be a mistake by the spirit of time.
The one who speaks only of the glass "fabriced from natural ingredients," may have used stabilisators: most often a natural product, for example the grain meat of cure obtained from the heat of currency.
It is obviously possible to manufacture glass without using stabilising, only to sell it within a period of 24 hours, unless it falls down, and the client will crown nothing else than glass grapes.
Some changes of the basic mass are allowed.
This becomes more passional with the trees.
The Master Luciano establishs the difference between the ingredients which are acquired in the fruit race or confidence of the supermarche.
Furthermore, there are powder and powders.
"The providers will all try to refile you thirsty of aromatized ingredients."
"All the time you should just try."
Similarly in the receipts of sorbites to fruits with sugar and feed fruit.
In the glass crystals manufactured from the white base mass that, adding oxes, becomes a crym and constitutes, when adds from cacao powder, the base of all possible diserts to the chocolate.
Now, all stakeholders must take the use of glass machines.
Luciano invites them to produce four types of glass: to the vanilla, chocolate, moka and noise with or without eggs in the base mass, with more or less than a bottle of vanilla or other natural ingredients.
The different kinds of glass for fruit are also subject to the same experience.
More aromatic substances, more cleansing fruits: from the view of the hot, this is not absolutely better.
The glass to noisettes does not contain the weight of the nose, when it consists in a large part of noisettes.
The ice in kiwi, very popular, is manufactured from the group using more fruits, less water and less stabilising.
"Other than a balanced meal, the goat of a glass correctly turns out," says Luciano.
The manufacture of glass is an calculation period: if the fishery cleaning is used with a lot of sugar, the quantity of sugar must be reduced in the base receipt.
An supplement of sugar is required for cytron glass.
Luciano presents a device with which it defines the sugar content of the various types of fruit (the vinneyards serve it to measure Oechsle density in the rain mount).
Happy, tables facilitate calculations.
The manufacture of the glass does not need, as well as otherwise, as physical intervention.
This is not only the automatic manufacturing machine of the base mass that helps.
There is also a device in which the glass mixture is simultaneously available to make it increasive and negative temperatures.
Despite all automaticizations, light panons are not excluded.
Brazil Gustavo is a barbecue of pure fruits of heads and, as well, spread his study camarades when the control of the colossal bottle escapes him.
Mr Luciano is a view that an "incentive risk of happening during each course: this is only a question of time."
Controllers in an ambiguous position
According to certain sources, the industry who expired the culture of geneticly modified plants has noticed the European Food Safety Authority.
This appeal is now formulated by the testbiotech expert group, which is considered as an independent Institute for the evaluation of biotech consequences.
"This sounds like a conspiration theory, but we are well resigned," said M. Christoph then, Director of Testbiotech.
Some information states that the President of the expert Group of Efsa for genetically modified plants, Mr. Harry Kuiper, and other Ephesa experts are under contract with the Eli pressure group.
This is funded by groups such as Monsanto, Nestl√© or Bayer.
Mr. Kuiper has cooperated in a decisive way in the preparation of the EFSA test requirements for genetically modified plants and has, in fact, clearly in a situation of interest conflict, according to the criticisms formulated by Mr. then.
The prescriptions are textually corresponding to the position of the ongoing pressure group and thus provide the mark of the industry which would, on the basis, control by the authorities installed in Parme in Italy.
It's already the second time that Testbiotech provides an interest conflict.
A high-range response of the EFsa has recently joined the Swiss agricultural group Syngenta, which has changed from camp.
There is a little time, even the Central Germany Radio (MDR) had revealed the existence of personal relations between the European Union‚Äôs authority for control and industrial lobby, which has discovered the suspicions of the German Federal Agency for the Environment and European Deputy.
However, the Efsa does not accept any interest conflict.
A view shows that all the reliable data are operated, including those of the industry as well as they are a good professional quality.
The experts working for the EFSA account are not prohibited to shoot contacts with this activity sector.
But they should make them public.
Mr. Kuiper admits that he worked for the international institution for life sciences (International Life Sciences Institute, Theyi) based on the United States.
This body is considered to be a new forum that groups experts, among others, in the field of science, industry and policy, to assess biotechnology risks without the wage of lobby.
In this case, independent experts such as Mr. then disappear the fact that genetically modified plants are accepted without any food testing in animals and that these plants have not been tested.
"We want to know what are, for example, the effects of the ma√Øs genetically modified causes to the field," said Mr.
Current practice consists of testing only isolated proteins and not all the geneticly modified plant, which does not allow you to obtain reliable results.
"If we are not looking for risks, how can we then discover them?" asked Mr.
This is also the point of view by Mrs Angelika Hilbeck.
This scientific research has been carried out since 1994 in genetics and currently worked at Zurich's polytechnical school.
In this area, such as the United States, and now also in Europe, the industry's industry is trying to be more influenced or discredited by critical sciences.
Therefore, there are still researchers that are not related to companies.
In the opinion of the enterprises, critical studies would not be published.
Mrs Hilbeck claims that "the industry's monitoring security research".
The stone tray
The Gsell is about 400 kilometres of the Gsell.
Monday afternoon, she was located in front of Stuttgart's garden with her tube at the back.
There was a man.
He was nerved.
History is known: In September, the excavators came and began to destroy a large part of the north island.
The world of Stuttgart was no longer the same: A number of thousands of people have demonstrated against the S21 project, the transformation of the central garden of Stuttgart in a subterranean garden that will cost several billions.
A large part of the island was disappeared when the demonstration was deployed on the ceiling of construction work.
Bristained in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Muschelkalk (the coquillier) of Crailsheim, a dark and huge storm built between 1914 and 1920.
Mr. Gsell is a 43-year-old sculptor in Ostfildern.
There's a few pieces.
"These stones are relax."
"They don't have to disappear."
He says with enthousiasm: "A modest rock and good market, simple and earth."
He stated that, when he was disappearing the knowledge, he felt the beauty of the cygarette smoke.
He doesn't know what he's going to do.
The rocks have time.
The Gsell's also.
Stuttgart's stone rocks lead to an old deposite of French army munitions in a forest located near Tubinga, where Manuel Rongen has built its implant of stones.
This 44-year-old man makes old stone trade.
He bought all the stones of the demoliation occurred in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame if they were conceived or if they were disappeared in the download," said he in his office located in a hair, which was sometimes a watch office.
He explains that he had made an insuline and threats when the newspapers reported that he had bought the remaining northern acute to the democracy company in September.
But he negotiated all days with the adversaries of the S21 project.
And he explained them that he couldn't do anything to be opposed to demoliation.
And if it's done, then the most reasonable thing would continue to use the stones.
Approximately 200 adversaries of the S21 project have resulted on one of the piece parallelpipepede of average 80 kilometres of the value between 6.50 and 14 euros.
Some keep it as memory in all hopes also can make it in a reconstruction.
Rongen had 500 tonnes, 25 full charges from a truck.
Alongside the half is still embraced in the forest, the remainder has been sold for a long time.
Propertys of garden, countryage gardens, Parts.
They came out of everywhere and pushed everything they could enter into the coffee and shots.
These stones of stuff of Stuttgart have been transformed for a long time to "Mumerle" or in limites of herb plates.
"In fact, this stone is nothing particular," said Mr. Rongen.
"It was this political component."
He enters into his car all the landscape, makes the tour of its large empire of 20 hectares.
He made the right studies he left. In addition, he has undertaken to study the biology before he was interested in the information and finally become a carrier.
And an amator of stones.
The stock's 40000 tonnes.
He loves himself everywhere in Germany.
IL claims that he is the largest good of old stones.
He's thinking about it.
Sable stones painted with art are put on the snow.
"Autrefois, they were part of the Marienbr√ºcke pont in Dresde."
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, argue him with enthusiasm.
"My favorite stone."
He takes the way going through the forest.
He shows a tickets of the finger: Peter of red sable, before, part of the Carlsruhe race.
And so immediately.
"Joy Travern."
The Parallelpipede was jadies of the Neckarstadion of Stuttgart.
As far as in the snow of stones and stories, the Cannstatt travernor coming from the police prefector, the red grain that comes from the Holy Cathedral, the tuff coming from Heilbronn hospital.
That work, what efforts, such sugars!
When Mr. Rongen believes that jadis the stones were shoted in the hand and moved through the help of simple pallans and cards caught by the bulls, it becomes respectful.
"It would be a scandal if such a ownership was put into place."
He's not become rich, even less rich.
But this carrier today works 14 people. Furthermore, there are stones, a sculptor, a forgeron, a green suck and a garden is installed in the forest.
"We hard workers, but it's grateful," said the recycling of waste.
Afterwards, he's got to go to Colonia.
There too, there are stones to save.
Along with talents to acquire high potential
The computator knows a living affliction.
16 Students bush to buy small pains for saumon, tomate sauce and white managers.
The Braunschweig Technical University and the Volkswagen engine engineer invited students in design and mechanical genius to a workshop.
In the context of a kind of ideas, they must talk about the future car with the VW conceptors, and, afterward, to know the firm Volkswagen.
From our days, many enterprises are not able to go to the body into the competition to deteriore better brain and to engage, like Volkswagen, in multiforming cooperation with universities.
Their mission: Record the most duplicated diplomas as possible in the amphitheaters before they arrive on the employment market and are not cut off by others.
And as universities do not publish statements on the performance of their students, it is tried to repair the exceptional talents in the framework of practical projects and fide them.
On the second day of Braushweig Technical University, the Braushweig car group loves talents.
A young lady of the staff service shares the steals, goods and cards containing the logo of Volkswagen.
It speaks of the calendar of professional stages and students to young talents; she shows them the ways to access the group's starting.
It is Nico Sel of the Braunschweig technical university who is responsible for the project undertaken with Volkswagen.
For him there are mutual benefits for both parties: "The students enter into contact with this industrial sector and gains experience."
"When the Volkswagen Group, he can know students, look forward near the serious candidates and appreciate those who are online accounting as a cooperator."
According to Mr Sella, such cooperation is inhabitable.
Whatever there is, is the officer with which we are trying to take students.
"Autrefois, the accent was rather put on the vocational project," said Mr. Sel.
The fight for the consequence of the new diplomates will become more heavy.
In sector goods, enterprises can no longer recruit their employees by carrying out a three on a candidate cycle.
But they must benefit from their reliability and, above all, to cut highly qualified work hands.
These are especially the diplomas of the engineering campaigns that are in an excellent position to negotiate.
According to the association of German engineers, more than 40,000 places of engineers have remained unemployed in October.
And according to the VDI's previsions, the empty of the engineer posts will still be aggressive.
Roman Dytta goes to driveing talents for the KPMG account, audit cabinet, accountal expertise and advice.
It organises cost-effective events for the recruitment of talents, such as the crowd course KPMG-Race, a species of rally paper where concurrents should find their way in support of GPS coordinates.
The company will therefore send eight promising students in the next year to help the United States in this way.
Participants can access the filials of KPMG and know the company.
The person who must participate in it shall be decided after two selection procedures.
Only the crym of the crysm of many candidates will be deleted for the United States.
Mr. Dytta, the means used for high-powered research in universities are more important.
"We want to emerge a lot through the crowd course."
"For us, a simple crowd was too little."
For Mr. Dytta, the account seems to be there.
"Today, we stayed in contact with all people who took part in the last year to a similar action."
"Certain of them are at the point to end their studies and they want to submit their requests to our business."
Outside the direct amateur carried out in the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are very classic by participating in professional feeds where they are delivered to the brain.
"We try to achieve diplomas by participating in professional salary."
"For example, in the solar technology salon," Mrs. Sitha Sstebe says, Human Resource Directorate in Solarworld, manufacturing photovoltaic panels.
This company is installed in Bonn approximately 1500 people in Germany.
Mrs Sstobe has known the issue related to the resume.
Currently, 35 posts are put on the company's website.
"In that time, it's very difficult to spend vacant posts."
"It's the lovely cost and take a lot of time," assuredly?
Another way to establish the contact is to pass through university teachers.
Solarworld has established cooperation with various higher education institutions, for example, the Fribourg University.
"The professors indicate that the student has an opportunity to carry out professional stages or to write its project to a end of study at us."
Unrealised public campaigns are announced in the solarian specialists.
This is why the company is trying to make its publicity by ensuring other qualitys: personal ambition, plate herarch and easy communication.
"A large group can't do this," supports Mrs. Sstobe, head of staff.
As long as money is not the main role in employment research.
The flexible work hours, the maintenance of children or good promotion opportunities are the other decisive factors.
According to a study carried out by the Great Place to Work Institute, Solarworld is the 55th place of the 100 best workers in Germany.
The Institute is an annual honor table of German employees.
To that end, he asks cooperatives on their levels of satisfaction relating to their employees and its context with regard to the conditions of employees.
Mrs. Sstebe hopes that this place will allow the image of society to be re-employed with employees.
"I think the candidates are particularly referring to external assessments in respect of a potential employer," said she.
Wolf Reiner Academy Academy Warler DEBA (Deutscher Employer Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises companies who wish to build a good reputation as a employer by applying a long-term strategy.
He advises his customers to show more authenticity.
And, according to Mr. Warler, this means before all, to take internal measures.
"The best means for a employer to be attractive is to pass through his own partners," said he.
This is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal image strategy, i.e. the creation of the mark of the employer in its own effectiveness.
"The partners are satisfied with the best messages."
When their employees are well treated and identified with the company, they only make their employer's publicity with their friends and knowledge.
"It's like if we played in an orchester," says Mr. Warler.
Obama with free to new petrol forages
There will be no new petroleum forgets in the Mexican Golf on the width of the coast of Floride, the South-East State, in the coming years.
The Washington Government has an interdiction A equivalent prohibition and thus finally canceled its initial plans.
Even width of the Atlantic coast, new forages remain for the immediate prohibition.
The Secretariat to the Interior Ken Salazar made this Friday announcement.
This is the explosion, in April, of the Deepwater Horizon platform which is on the origin of this severe prohibition. This must remain in force at least for the next five years.
As a result of this accident that was costful to each employer's life and leads to the largest environmental catastrophe of the United States, President Barack Obama, subject to the pressure of the opposition and the activity sector, had indicated that it was intended to authorize the achievement of new forces in the eastern part of the Mexico Golf.
The parties of this solution want to reduce the independence of the United States in regard to foreign countries in the field of petroleum approving.
The question of knowing who is responsible for the devastating black sea in the golf is not to be finally solved until this day.
The British petrol group, which is compared to requests for entitlement of several billions, is located in the centre of accused.
An investigation committee created by Obama must present its current conclusions on December.
In October, the secretariat at the Interior Ken Salazar had led the weight of the decised forage after the expansion of the platform.
Following this decision, several pillar groups had immediately submitted requests for new projects.
With closer control measures and more serious security designs, Obama and Salazar want to prevent a new catastrophe.
The competent control authority, which has been discredited after many accusations of corruption, is currently subject to deep reforms.
Parallelly, Mr. Obama announced that they would remove tax galeries and petrol groups.
Actors of this activity sector are now publicly observed against the fact that food debt in the golf would be much lower than that is so far.
"The goal of the Government is to make a free free to the fast growth of the gas and petrol sector in accordance with the result of an current sondage carried out in the sector by the BDO audit cabinet prior to the banning of mercredi ban.
In addition, the American Energy Alliance deploys the incerteness that characterizes this sector: "Perhaps he knows what will change exactly with regulation."
Investment granted in new support projects has been reported to the expenditure of growth.
Ogoni country is seen
The water that cut in the rivers is breastped oil; it decreases an oil like that exists in the season station: As a result of a escape, thousands of gross litres of petroleum litres destroyed the Ogoni country in Nigeria.
Men live from flight, corruption and raffinage of petrol.
Celestina Akpobari has a good intention.
"Don't throw out," launch the ecologist to the journalists to calm them, "You're still enough of petrol bottle before the water lenses."
Nigeria, 37 years old, tried to photograph a young bunkered water to the weight, as well as the green grass that around it: This scene seems almost beautiful in the water scene to the color of the arch-en-ciel.
It can't appear that the subsol regorge of gross petrol naps.
On the river of the Bodo-Jetty River, Esther Badom tells that, jadis, she gathered crowds through all seas here.
But between time, the water is fully tariffed.
Fifteen years ago, a huge amount of petrole has been jail of a olioduc explosed in the marecause.
Fishers who live the small nearby city of Bodo must now return for six hours to reach fishing water: the Ogoni country located in the heart of the Delta of Niger is considered as one of the most polluted regions in the world.
All the extension of ravages saved in the sight of the mangrove seas passed through water courses.
Instead of a clear water, the motor ship flows a breathing water. Everybody puts his hand off all covers of petrol.
The small branches of the mangrove are emerging from the ground, such as pillars. The island palms are tristely lay down their palms.
We are searching in vain bird clouds, such as usually in humidity areas: Since the motor stops out-bard, a fantastic silence skills on this Paradise of another time that appears to a service station by the odour that he disappears.
"What happens here is a war against the environment", says Mr. Celestine Acpobari of a triste air: "Our life is characterized by a permanent danger in the field of health."
The comparison of wars is made.
The region where Ogoni lives is an assembled battle camp for ten years: more than 60 years ago, the first European explorators came here; the first resistance was organized in 1980 by the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa. This was implemented later. In 1993, the Shell Group had to stop its production activities in this region because they had become very dangerous for its employees.
Today, the return to the Ogoni country is prohibited: Three times more than 2 million black gold barriers are daily pumped by more than 5000 pounds and 7000 kilometres of oil in the entire Delta region, three large as Switzerland, the petrolifer fields of the Ogoni country are in explosive, because the situation is too insufficient for this petrol group.
All the hundred metres are located in the water of the aircraft as an images: We are very affective "The trees of Christ" heads of forage.
They have up to 50 years, most are thrown by corrosion to the rear.
Accpobari believes that this nature's head falls time-time in piece, because a constant flow of green petrol in the water.
According to the estimates of experts, more than two milliards of litres have divorced the ecosism in 50 years: every year, the amount of petrol equivalent to the one who has occurred in the sea during the accident of the super-petroler "Exxon Valdez" over 21 years ago in the width of Alaska, one of the greatest environmental catastrophes in the history of humanity.
Who should be responsible for sustainable environmental pollution? The response to this question divides actors.
For the Shell Group, sabotage and oil synthesis are responsible for more than 90 percent of pollution. Environmentalists for their part consequent the explosions of the forage heads and the perfored olive oil as the main causes.
In 2008, the American researcher Richard Steiner responded to the Shell Group to apply to the Nigeria security standards mainly less strict than all over the world: Only the rate of deficiencies of conduct is "and more higher than those."

A slight fire under one of the many tunnels that are soon related to the tuyal, soon spread without motion on the site must be revealed: a small clandest raffinerie.
We're going to fuck the gross penal in the tonneau for a few hours, explain Michael, the team head.
In the first time, the penalty in a receipt by tube, then, at the extremity of the behaviour of kyrosen goutts fall and the finally gets the dial.
This is how Michael and its four collaborators daily produce four fees from Thisl from 300 litres: "This reports us 34,000 Naira", about 22 dollars.
Delta inhabitants are part of the chronic fuel penurie in the largest country producer of petrol in black Africa.
Nigeria has only one raffinerie.
The illegal raffiners can sell at a less slight price than the ridiculously lower than 40 cents of Euro per litera from Cesl: because they have acquired their first material freely.
This is offered by the "protectors" who put the oil network in perceant through the Ogoni country. According to experts, the country lost at least 16 million litres of gross petroleum in the entire Delta of Niger.
Only a small insignificant part of the first provisional material is illegally cleansed: the networks of organized crime that also accounts among its members of high-rang politicians and high-rang military forces, loading the lion in tankers and the bradent on the world market.
The Military Akpobari considers that the debate on the question is to know whether the environmental catastrophe or rather the underversive activities to the population or the laxist production is purely academic.
"If the petrol society had not been perceived as intrusions and if the foundations of the life of fishermen would not be so deeply destroyed, there would be no sabotage, nor illegal flights and raffineries."
But inter-times, Ogoni relations especially in the form of Shell have been so deteriorated that it was no longer question than the resolve of the group. "If the operators who have other nationalities, such as the Chinese, will be better."
So, Michael becomes nervous.
"It's a long time you disagrese" announces the royal work of the petrole.
"The soldiers can appear at any time."
If the illegal reflectors are surprised by the special units of armed forces, they will certainly not be arrested, but at least they will offer them pots.
Even those of the north of the country's militarys have benefited as all the Nigerians of the first matter.
"Over the point of view, this fishing thing has caught our country well down," regret Akpori.
Researchers discover construction standards in A380 Reaktors
A380 demonstratedly suffers a large security problem.
In examining an emergency aerorising device, investigators discovered the possibility of building that can lead to "Catholic disappearance of the reactor".
The Qantas airline now wants to make complaint against the reactor manufacturer.
At the beginning of November, the Airbus passengers in Quanta's company had apparently been more chances: During its investigation, the Australian Air Safety Authority found that the A380 Reactors of certain devices presented a serious security problem, and it understood it against a possible building standard.
This potential difficulty could lead to serious consequences: It can cause feeding crises and escapes at the level of the rhetorial conduct of oil, indicates in a position taken by the ATSB‚Äôs administration.
She could lead to a "Catholic disastership of Reactors".
It is concerned that the produced Rolls-Royce reactors are equipped with 20 A380 aircrafts of the A380 series.
The Quanta Society Airbus, which had to air emergency on 4 November in Singapour, is among them.
Australian airline has now committed judicial persecution against the English manufacturer of reactors.
She presented a judicial complaint at an Australian Federal Court whose seat is in Sydney, which allows him to take other legal measures against society.
The director of Quantas, Mr. Alan Joyce, said that his company would refer to damages relating to the incident at the beginning of November.
Rooms have been detained and the surface of the motor has been destroyed during the fuel.
According to Rolls-Royce, it is the inflammation of olive oil which is on the origin of disasters.
After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world.
Australian investigators announced that other security tests will be carried out on superjumbos that are also equipped by reactors in questions.
Security recommendations are the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, the ASTB port of the ASTB, Mr. Martin Dolan.
The security problem is considered as a sufficiently important to report all parties concerned.
After the emergency aircraft, Quanta Airline was immovable to the ground all its A380 flows for a week.
Singapore Airlines has temporarily realized three of its 11 A380.
The Airhansa company has replaced a A380 reactor.

The snow crack around the whole territory causes a chaos in transport
Germany all white covers: In one night the snow fell almost all the country.
The chaos is dominated on all roads, trains and airports.
At least three persons are dead in accidents of movement.
The Hiver greys Germany: By glacial temperatures, almost all the Republic is covered by snow in Thursday night, which leads to chaos in many localities.
At the north and east, the black cover reaches 15 centimeters by places.
The movement is strongly limited on several authors and on many roads.
In the A7 national in Flensburg, the Hiver Service staff worked permanently, but they couldn't come to the snow that could not be acquired.
Furthermore, racial violence have blown the Baltic Sea coast.
The Federal Office for Sea navigation and Hydrographie (DSH) was expected to be awaiting the Baltic Coast of Schleswig-Holstein with water levels that could reach 1.2 m above the normal.
Neck ambassadors on authors and federal roads have introduced serious problems in Saxe.
This is why the meteomedian warning center has been announced in Saxon Sweden: In fact, it is the highest level.
There were 30 centimeters of fresh snow that the strong and cost winds spread.
Several roads and cars there are left in the night.
Even in the Saxe-Anhoud country, police authorities announced serious perturbations on roads.
On the A2 autoroute, the snow and wind have entered an interruption of the movement and have caused bouchons.
In Thoringe, snow shoes touched the A4 and A9 authors.
According to the Germaner Bahn, serious perturbation of rail traffic has occurred in Saxe, Saxe-Antent, Thoringe and north of the Bavi√®re.
The main problems are: the snow on iron paths, the trees falling on iron paths, the catenes or the destroyed holes.
In Saxe, we had to stop interregional Leipzig-GIemberg transport.
In Sallfeld, in Thoringe, a ICE train from Munich had to stop his trip.
The pompors and param√©dicals had to approve the 165 train passengers in covering, food and drink.
Snow winds blowed the roads.
The Snow Chutes have entered many flight cancellations into the main airports of Germany.
According to the standard and information on flights, some cancellations are already announced in Munich.
A Fraport port indicates that 40 flights have already been canceled in Francfort on the Main.
The hiver service and provides a permanent service.
It is true that the passengers involved in the airport are no longer many, despite that at least 400 beds there are available.
Several accidents have occurred on many roads.
Last night in Ostholstein, a train driver lost life during a collection with a train at a level transition.
The train driver has been slightly wounded.
Because of the snow beds present on the roads, a similar accident has occurred not far away from Soloemberg: even here, a train was caught to a level transition because the vehicle was on it.
The driver lost life.
Four passengers were wounded in the train, therefore the road from Bayreuth to Soloemberg was closed until the morning hours.
Moreover, a 30-year-old woman died when his car made a tonnage on a sliding chausing in A Fundburg.
However, the meteorologists announce a good news: the snow will certainly be always mould and poud, but it will be turning to a slightly radar.
But the wind's going to shoot.
Only Baltic Sea will be deployed by violent and fast winds.
However, it is very cold, until at least 15 degrees by places.
The German Bank is looking for an acquirer for its jumales tours.
The German Bank seeks to separate himself from its emblem: According to the information reported by newspapers, this financial institution is looking for acquirers for its two offices situated at his office of Francfort.
This could report up to EUR 500 million.
The German Bank is just injured to the group seat: the jumal tours located in the Business Quartier have been modernized; while waiting, the bankers had to return to their old service place.
Forwards, the financial group clearly seeks to recover the renewing costs and seeks an acquirer for its two immunes, as written in the "Finanancial Times Germany" newspaper.
This port port has not indicated the reasons for the planned sale.
He said, "We're checking if it's more interesting for self-employment or to sell them, and put them again later."
This is how the largest financial institution in Germany has already been set up his seat, a little time after.
It is only in the middle of 2007 that the bank had acquired jumeal tours for a amount of 272 million euros with own fund detainees and then had their responsibilities.
The transformation on energy optimization has developed, according to some indications, approximately 200 million euros.
A sale would apparently report a lot of money to the bank.
According to the information provided by the newspaper, experts of this activity sector are higher the value of tours, rebatted between the "Greens" times, at about 500 million euros.
According to the Party, it is not known at the moment whether the immunities will be sold again to a bank or an independent investor.
thousands of people weep the young people who died.
In New Zealand, more than 100,000 people had a thought for the ensuring youth who had been declared dead after a number of explosions resulted in a mine.
It was not yet possible to remonte the body because the security situation of uncertain powder continued to be precaire.
Just two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth.
29 minors of age age between 17 and 62 were built under the ground.
A song was introduced in the synthetic powder, but no survivors were discovered.
Following strong toxic gas concentration and other explosives followed, no assistance team could fall into the mine for security reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and the administration considered that minors had no chance to survive.
Until the body couldn't be remonted.
Today, parents and friends organized a party to the memory of the dead.
A thousands of people were meetings under a sunlight in Greymouth south of the Neo-Zeland Island.
They watched two minutes of silence.
In memory of 29 young men, 29 tables have been installed on which names, cases and lights could be seen.
Personal photos and effects, including clothes and superf plans, also had their place.
The drapeaux were drained in front of all the public buildings of the country.
The Neo-Zelandian Prime Minister John Key declared participants at the Commonwealth festival that New Zealand had disappointed the hope that minors would return to the surface.
"But they're never coming home."
Mr. Lawrie Drew whose son Zen had been instructed in the arms said that he could not resign to accept the death of his son until he had not seen his rest.
Besides the Prime Minister and the parents of the victim, several foreign diplomates participated in the memoratory party.
Minutes of South African and British origin have also developed during the 19 November first explosion.
The helpers began to evaporate a fire in the middle of the southern island of New Zealand.
The prefect of police Gary Knowles explained to the journalists that when explosive gas masses are moved, the temperatures burning within the mine start to low down.
Go on, war!
Is Splar movie a artificial movie?
The realm Nicolas Winding Refn screens the limits of the former kind thanks to its film, Walhalla Rising, epouse of the fighter.
To what public did the Danish realistor Nikolas Winding Refn think "Walhalla Rising"?
A Viking Warrier (Mads Mikkelsen) who has only an eye makes a prisoner; it is free from his bourgeois and, with almost supernatural force, eliminates its adversaries one after another. It seems ideal for young men who are looking for a bloody action, just because our herous uses brutal murder methods. If he is an evil humor, he will raise the intestines of his enemy without waiting for those who are dead.
On the other side, until the end of the movie, the borrow doesn't speak any word on his true name. Even the other persons are starting to escape, however, at the distance of one or two sentences, some amazing arguments.
On the other hand, there is nothing to say and celebrate in the mountain landscape incrediblely beautiful of Escosse, which is the decoration of the Viking University, about thousand years ago.
This would be ideally the slaughter tanks with an interest for existence and excellent travellings.
When a movie is seeing several civil groups, it's damage that those are excluded mutually.
The realm Winding Refn is considered, since the view of "Pusher", its trilogy concerning drug trafficking and full style, as a kind of Quentin Tarantinon danois, but it refuses to bring some more humor to the dominant current or to bring a little less damage to art and test cinem.
Most of the artistic sympathistics should prove the horror face to the brain which is spread around and intestins.
The movies of action lovers die in summer, when the burden is embarked, for reasons that it can freely interpret, with a group of violent Christian missionaries in a ship in Jerusalem; they are disappeared during a warmth by warm and flowing before the equipage comes to America and continue to thirst.
It is not so wondering that "Walhalla Rising" had not found any film distributor in Germany and there is only under the DVD format.
This is especially because of the magnical images of the miserable, which missed a certain attention, but also because the image of a palpitant movie, in time otherwise, is hidden behind a pretty and bloody appearance.
It is not dialogues in this film, nor coherent action, everything is ambitious, a gentle dream transformed in film.
The spectator can't escape there.
Reply gives him a moment of detention and slowly cut him the wheat with ice images and a luggre sound band, but especially with an unseassible hate that smells the heart of persons.
Only a young blond boy who stands faithfully on the side of the garden, reserves a certain unnocence, all others are animated by anger.
Moreover all, the burden hero whose mobiles are never known, but which comes from the weapon at any time to fight the enemies and to prevent the alien in turning war, may be sent from the devil himself.
It represents the progress, but may also, as well as those who are, in any way, may be.
"Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that we can detect or admir, which eventually has an action, enthusiasm and wonder.
A traumatic experience.
Mystery landscape work
The International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA) provides new indications on a nuclear program developed by Syria.
But this country refuses to take position on this matter, still less to be subject to the controls of the Agency.
At the night from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four F-15 flights of Israeli have attacked a mystery turtle building on the Syrian territory.
It is located on the river of the euphrate; the largest city located nearby is 30 km: it is Dair as-Sur.
His name is contained in the IAEA documents, as it is the question of the reactor that Syria has built with the assistance of the North Korean in a stone parall√®pe, dissumed in a valley marked by the absence of electric current.
According to a briefing of the information services of the United States, the CIA, since April 2008, the current reactor, known under the name of the neighbourhood, El-Kibar, would be good to produce plutonium, which would allow the manufacture of atomic weapons.
However, this technology is valid since the 1950s.
The CIA showed a presentation video containing flash satellite images.
With the animation assisted by the computer, it indicated the possibility of each component of the reactor before the destruction of the central, which represented a copy of the north-Corea model of Yongbyon nuclear central.
Moreover, she presented the photos showing the building located nearly, even inside that.
It seems that the reactor was found on the point of being in service, but he was not yet equipped with fuel bars.
Today, more than three years after Israel's bombarding is hardly available more information than at the time, and even with the time the mystery is still far more.
The former President of the United States George W. Bush recently revealed in his memories before this attack, the CIA was sure that Syria had built a reactor at the Kibar, but had little indigenous indicators showing that the country had developed " an active nuclear weapons programme".
Some educational agents in Europe prefer to be more prudent about this and only speak of a "reactor" even if they consider the CIA presentation as "plausible".
They are missing tangible evidence as well as AIEA.
It was concerned about how he was ensuring that he had undertaken a nuclear reactor, a high-range diplomat of the United Nations has given only a Latin response by claiming that the IAAA had " sufficient documents to pose questions".
The Syrians have certainly removed the declines of the "inutilized military boundary" and proceeded to a methodical planning of the field.
However, in June 2008, an AIEA's expert team conducted by the former inspector in Oli Heinoen, discovered the warning traces produced by men.
In addition, the AIEA has received by a Member State of satellites images of trade providers that shows the time directly followed the attack. It seems that these are more elective than those presented by the CIA.
However, these photos are not available on the market because anonymous commander may have acquired them exclusively.
This is impossible for the IAEA to establish their objective authenticity.
Syria always assured that it had never been a secret atomic program and that she hadn't built a reactor.
Damascus supports that the uranium found on the site comes from weapons used by Israel.
But the EIEA has recognized this argument after the analysis of the particules in the qualifiing of inevitable.
Since that time, ladies refused any discussion on this, as well as on satellite images.
Nevertheless, Syria does not allow controllers to perform a second inspection on the El-Kibar website and refused access to the designs of the building destroyed by the bomb.
But even Israel keeps an obsolete silence.
Confirming the official position, Ehud Olmert, then Premier Minister in execution at the time of the attack, recently said, "We will never make comments on this matter."
This is how the investigation regarding this case is a long time since June 2008 without a result and that it is "transformed more to a serious problem of credibility of the Agency," as it recognises a high-rang diplomat at the AIEA seat in Vienna, finally a serious violation of the Nuclear Weather Treaty.
AIEA believes that progress should be clarified to the existence of three other installations that must have "functional" report with the re-actor.
Today, the inspectors have not indicated what installations it is here, nor what their function or what they are suspected to contain.
According to information published by the "Suddeutsche Zeitung" journal, they are known in the AIEA respectively under the names of Marj a-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskanariah also on the name of the neighbouring cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security (International Science and Security Institute) in Washington identified these localities and discovered satellite images a complex near Masyaf, which would probably be one of the subjects.
It is possible to be found in a military or directly side of that; this is the reason why Syria refuses access of three sites to AIEA's inspectors.
In Vienna, the Syrians claim that the inspection group is actually the expertise that would be sent to the United States by the IAEA to spy military installations.
Indeed, it is a recreation provided by the United States secret agents who focused on the attention of nuclear inspectors.
AIEA provides information, including satellite photos, indicated that vehicles have made ships between the three sites and the stone parallin to transport substances.
A western high-rang diplomat said to Vienna that at least one of the installations could "service for fuel production."
There would be no indication for sensitive activities, such as enriching and rehabilitation of uranium; processes that are necessary for the production of atomic weapons.
This type of reactor is certainly working through non-richer urnium.
Nevertheless, there is a rigour of plastic hypoth√®ses concerning the following basic issues: from where the uranium should be come and where the plutonium was later separated to the manufacture of the bomb.
It is ignored if the importants, which could hide high value traces, were stored in the three sites.
When the centuries of land-based camions are disappeared, no one will have information on the saving place.
For the AIEA, it is little likely that Syria has examined the mine of al-Tibni sel in 1998, located only a few kilometers of El-Kibar, on the other side of the Ephrate, to see whether it can agree to the storage of radioactive waste.
In recently analyzing satellite photos for the famous magazine Jane's Intelligence Review, the former inspector of the AIEA, Mr. Robert Kelley established a link between those and the relevant reactor.
However, satellite photos show that Syria has undertaken landscape work on the three suspected sites and has been moved from extreme containers when the AIEA began to require access to these places.
It is possible that it is a coincidence, but it has not contributed to disappearing suspicions.
In the diplomatic environments that AIEA has been developing a plan on inspections, which had to allow Syria to keep military secrets. On the time of investing, it shows the great interest of the inspectors to this case.
During that time, Damascus has also made this proposal.
A year ago, if the Western diplomats in Vienna had not met the destruction of the reactor, the emergency would not be reported for this case, for example, Glyn Davies, the friend of the United States that has been known for a few months under the Special Inspections, one of the most powerful means of which the Atomic Agency is disposed to implement its controls.
The director of the AIEA, Mr Yukiya Amano, who had to propose these inspections, has already spoken of "the option to which I am open to the future," but he is still heated.
This means includes a huge risk: on the one hand, it requires majority to the AIEA Governing Council and a good number of 35 countries representing the situation to see a scale.
On the other hand, as this diplomat that gives to say: "What would he need, if at the end they don't find anything"
Love in war time
It's wrong since Angelina Jolie made his beginning as a realisant.
She wrote the scenario itself: it's a story of love between a woman original of Bosnia and a Serbian origin.
We don't know anything more about this story, but it's enough to provoke the disease.
A continuing rumor indicates that the woman, a musulman, was loved of his Serbian breast during the war of Yugoslavia.
Bosnia women's federalities were immediately protested. In response, some tournament sequences in Sarajevo have been transferred last minute in Hungary.
During time, the film is turned to Hungary, but in the post-production phase, protests continue to continue in Bosnia.
According to the information published in a Bosnia Journal, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of war victims addressed a correspondance to Angelina Jolie by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (HCR) and outcome to meet the actor. Jolie is the same ambassade of good will of HCR.
She isn't diplomat, there's a few weeks ago, she proposed that women should hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined this offer.
"The meeting must be held in Bosnia," said Hasecic.
There were no stories of love in the concentration camps, and Jolie's scenario says enough long about his attitude to the victims.
The Guardian reports that Hasecic Organization later recommended the High Commissioner of the United Nations to remove the quality of good will to Angelina Jolie.
But in fact, what kind of scenario Jolie wrote she?
The Bosnia Minister, who received copies of his scenario, has granted a permission of tourning to Sarajevo, but it is not known why it has not come then, notwithstanding this authorisation.
The young author ensures that it does not continue political objectives with its film, that it is a lot of effort that it has been made on the Yugoslav conflict, and it supports that it wants to undertake the terrible consequences of the war and gives the possibility to all parties concerned to express themselves.
However, it remains governed about the content.
It is so that a second synopsis of the cercle film on the Net. It's enough different: the loved were well known before the beginning of the war. He revealed when the woman, a boss musulman, is deported in the Serbe concentration camp where the man worked as a garden.
What even represents a great difference with the version " a victim of violence to love his bourgeo."
That Jolie's movie has started well before the war, of course.
The pressure on it, thus expressed Jolie, is "unjust and based on false information".
Only, only the Hollywood fanatics can procure him the peace: by illegally putting this scenario into the Net, and others before.
Let's get us!

The experts of the Institute of Economic and Social Research show that 100,000 Irelands will soon leave their country.
They also provide a number of $200,000 migrants from this year to 2015.
This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4,5 million inhabitants.
If these provisions are achieved, this will be a similar migration course to which Ireland has suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of economic boom in which Ireland played a great skill, heavy now takes the whole place.
However, economic crisis affects young Irish, well formed, who have not known until now only with happiness moments.
Employment loss and social decline were absurd in the years of economic boom.

Since six months, Sean O'Donovan, knows what it means to be found otherwise.
As there was no more to do in Ireland for this 29-year engineer, it is now working with 15 Irish colleagues in the construction and Germany sector.
A mode house just goes out of land in Gelsenkirchen.
In January, it will continue to work on other Hannovre or Berlin projects.
Inter-times, O'Donovan is only rarely visiting its birth country, because it is involved in an additional job position, in order to finalize the contracted credit to build its home to the birth country.

Four years ago, O'Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of EUR 380,000, funded by credit 100 percent.
"There were a fool moment, without any doubt, the money was easy," said he.
Does he fear to see what's going on because of the credit?

Democracy
The support for democracy in Latin America continues to increase as well as the private company.
The crime has become a greater concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influent than the United States in a large part of the region.
These are some of the conclusions of the last Latinobarometer sondage taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
Since the sounding has been regularly implemented since 1995, it follows the region's attitude changes.
Two related elements represent the results of the sondage of this year, carried out in September and early October.
The first is the very comfortable humor of Latin America.
The second is the growing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its main institutions.
Democracy support has significantly increased in several countries on the South America (see table 1).
For example, in Peru, where economic growth has reached average 6 per cent a year since 2002, democracy support was at least 40 per cent in 2005 to 61 per cent of this year.
It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy was renewed after a strong decline of production in the past year.
But only approximately half of those respondents to Mexico and Brazil, the two smallest countries in the region, are convaincuous democrates, which makes the lower of regional average (see table 2).
Some 44% of the region's respondents were satisfied in the way the democracy of their country worked in practice; it is the same number as the last year, but with a strong increase in 25% in 2001 (graphic 3)
Some 34 per cent said they had trusted in the Parliament of their countries and 45 per cent in their Government, the same as the last year in the two cases; but the highest increase in comparison with 2003 (respectively 17 per cent and 24 per cent).
10 years ago, the economic problems in Latin America have extended support to democracy.
If this has been a good time during the global financial crisis, it was certainly necessary that many countries of America have only been a breast recession and have benefited of a strong recovery.
In addition, a social security network has contributed to the protection of the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the percentage of Latin America in poverty has increased only slightly in 2009 and re-enclosed this year to 32 per cent.)
But the humor is considerably different from a country to the other (cf. graph 4).
The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of his exit President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, translated by a broadly shared feelings of progress
What is more rare in Mexico and Central America where the recession has been more severe and where violent crimes have been aggravated.
It is only the second time since the sondage started than more respondents through Latin America in its whole faced the crime rather than unemployment as the most important problem for their countries (see Table 5).
Over 31 per cent said they themselves or one of their neighbour have been victimed of a criminal act during the overall year; however, this figure is lower than 38 per cent of the last year and is lower since 1995.
A stronger economic performance reflects the aid rate of private enterprises and market economy: approximately 71% of the region's respondents say that the private company is essential for development, against 56% in 2007 (see graph 6).
Some 58% most likely that market economy is the only system that will make their developing countries, with 47% the last year.
It's interesting, 62% of the respondents in Venezuela are this opinion (and 80% support the private company); even though their left president, Hugo Chavez, expresses many private enterprises.
Brazil is the largest minor in the region mentioned by 19% of the persons concerned (with 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, inchanged by the last year) and Venezuela (9%, declined from 11% since last year)
But the United States are considered as the most influence by those respondents to Mexico and the largest part of Central America, while Venezuela plays this distinction in Ecuador, Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
A mould vote
Nobody was expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on 28 November.
But it was very worse than foreigners who wanted to help the sympathetic and flood in fear.
Crutin scrutin boxs and a new monitor, bulletins of vote dispersed in the goats, saccated vote offices and intimidations
The vote offices will open afternoon.
Many of Haitians, including many who were moved after the seminary of January, would be in the neighbourhood to find where to vote.
Some of them ended to leave.
One thirteen candidates to the Chairperson, with several favourites, have described fraude and revoked the cancellation of the election.
Protestations, sometimes violent, spread through the country.
Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the high official in Haiti of the United Nations, considers the event as "a good election in goodness."
The observers of the United States and the Caribbean Community declared that they were "not believed that these irregularities, such as seriously, had been invalid the process".
In other words, the spectacle continues.
The electoral authority, whose opposers are returned to Rene Preval, President of the impopular, and his candidate Jude C√©lestin, must announce the preliminary results on 7 December.
The second Turn is planned for January.
Every hope in the selection is not lost.
The two candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a rat music, and Mirlande Manigat, a former former lady, have been removed from their initial call to be declared by no one.
However, there may be problems if Mr. C√©lestin, who has little or not a perceived support in the elections, is stated by the electoral authority as a result of the second damage reached the second tour.
With an epidemic of cholera that makes huge, and more than 1 million survivors in the seminarism that remained in tents were feared that participation would be.
At the same time, many Haitians wished to vote but were prevented to do so because of the disorganization.
Approximately 250,000 identity cards required to vote, there were not yet a little time distributed before the election.
The eye is important.
Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important stage in the reconstruction of Haiti.
And so, it's clear, the Haitians do it themselves.
The point of feet to the center
The weeks after being suddenly old, Cristina Fern√°ndez, President of Argentina, had benefited of a public sympathy sympathy sympathy that improved its approval rate of 20 points, more than 50 per cent; it was its highest level since 2007 had been elected.
However, transforming it into a second campaign successful for a second mandate in the next year could depend on the choice of Mrs. Fern√°ndez, apparently in the way she would leave or not transference of its marriage disappearance, predecessor and former political partnership, Nestor Kirchner.
And, in this regard, the signs remain ashamed.
Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage economic policy, even after his wife had succeeded him as a President, had the usual development of budgets that were under fiscal receipts, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the first couple to expenditure additional income to voluntary.
Mrs Fern√°ndez has lost his majority at the Congress last year on paper.
But the opposition is divided, and the situation was settled in the disarmament following the death of Mr. Kirchner of a heart crisis on 27 October.
Some of the dissidents of the petrol movement to the power have been joined to Mrs Fern√°ndez.
But after chaotic meetings (as a parliamentary attacked one of its neighbours and others were accused of corruption), the Congress did not approve the 2011 budget.
"I'm not going to dispute me," said the President.
Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented in the next year, laiding the President a greater maintainment margin for expenditure to the will.
The overwhelming economy is widely: it is likely to grow around 9% this year.
The official inflation rate is now 11.1% but many private estimates and the wage refunds of unions are about 30%.
Mr. Kirchner, who took its functions in 2003, when Argentina was afraid of economic improvement, made a priority for growth and poverty reduction, rather than for inflation control.
He refused to be treated with the FMI, he haired the private sector and cleansed the UINDEC, the Statistical Office, which has proceeded to false statistics on official inflation.
Mrs. Fern√°ndez may now modify these policies?
She called for talking between private enterprises and unions.
And his officials say they want to limit the wage increases in the next year to 18%.
The economy was stimulated by high global prices of the agricultural exports of Argentina.
However, inflation has evacuated the dust of growth pursuant to a strong evaluation in 2002.
This may be the reason why Mrs Fern√°ndez shows the signs to want to restore the financial relations of Argentina to the rest of the world.
This year, the Government concluded an agreement with the complaints who rejected the previous forced restructuring of the debt for which Argentina had not regulated its events in 2001.
Now, Mrs. Fern√°ndez seems to be engaged in a agreement with credit governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it gives some $6,7 billion.
The Kirchners always stressed that it could not impose a monitoring by the FMI, as it is of cooking.
But in the past month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economic, announced that the Fund would provide a "technical assistance" to grant a new national consumption index, and that is like a pre-suppliement of the DNAC sanitation.
It is not clear if Mrs Fern√°ndez wants to stay in politics beyond the end of its mandate now that his husband is no longer on its sides.
If it makes it, she needs to gain support for the average class, including kirchnerism is very ready.
When the Argentines will be returned from their birth holidays in Mars, the sympathy vague for it will be refluened.
If she wants to win another choice, she must decide to repeat or not, without a voice, of many policies of her husband.
Half hour for China
The Taiwan elections are directed to a kind of closer unit with the continent.
What's Taiwan thinking of his grand brother located on the other side of the departure?
More than 7,5 million elections were presented on 27 November, whether 70% of the admissible persons, to select municipal men and advisers in five urban districts, in the framework of what is considered as a general assessment of the President, Maing-jeu.
Mr. Ma itself became a substitute for feelings relating to the continent, with new business links, including a partial free exchange pact, in the largest reorganisation of relations with China since 1949.
Mr. My successful test, but it's just right.
Although its Kuomintang Party (KMT) has not paid three of the five masters, it has failed to report the majority of the voices.
Instead of this, the Democratic-Progress Party (DPP), which had thought to the full independence of Taiwan, was approximately 50 per cent of all votes for KMT by 45 per cent.
If this was a presidential scrutin, Mr. Ma would be in difficult.
Since two years ago, the part of the vote of its party was about 8 per cent of the vote.
For the first time, DPP took elections, even with the KMT in the municipal advice.
The event has sponsored most of the main subjects of Taiwan elections, including tapageus shipments and mass collection drapeaux with girls who were minimised.
A obligatory secretly murderer was also continued.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, honorary President of the KMT, made a electoral tour for a KMT candidate to the election.
A man of the people threw on Mr. Lien, cleanly through his face, blue and killing a past.
Indeed, it has not been determined if the threshold wanted to hurt Mr. Lien or regulate a dispute with the candidate.
In any way, Tsai Ing-wen said, the PDP leader, the murder had consequences on the election by directing the DPP suspicion and turning the elections to the KMT.
Maybe the greatest winner of elections was China.
He was frauding to figure out how the question of the continental party itself was absent.
Instead, candidates played plans for public housing and job creation.
Taiwan usually plays its independence of fact and defends the military threat of China.
Thus, KMT has been tended to avoid preparing connections with the P√©kin Government.
But this time, the DPP has also resolved the anti-China‚Äôs feelings.
This is the response to a new awareness under which Chinese enterprises are essential to the economic survival of Thaiwan.
Mr. Ma, for its part, has reiterated a confirmation to know whether his Chinese policy was acceptable for Taiwan's majority.
It may be expected that the P√©kin Government continues to provide trade facility in accordance with its Taiwan strategy to return to the bercail.
China has not lost time to send a businesser to Taipei to organize a summit on investment protection and medical cooperation.
Of course, she would like to see a political integration, but we start at the beginning.
It is best to wait for this after the President's election in 2012.
The DPP is in any way reinvented.
Two years ago, he was bad: his old chief, Chen Shui-bian, was sent into prison following corruption accused.
The Chairman from 2000 to 2008 was an provocator for explicit independence.
But a new moderate generation has been seen on the day under the direction of Mrs Tsai and UNDP to take care of professionals and youth.
Mrs Tsai was welcomed as a candidate of the DPP to the Presidency, such as Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr Chen.
Their partition is now to make it better to show that he can also join P√©kin.
Ms. Tsai announced plans for a expert panel to act as a point of contact between DPP and China, provided that their intertainings could be done without pre-alive conditions.
Mrs Tsai tells the Taiwan public that his party presents a "alternative confidence" as regards Mr. Ma concerning China.
Mr. Chen seems exposed by this change.
In a statement published from its cell, he stated that the candidates of the PDP would have obtained better results if they had been stressed that Taiwan was a different country.
He has even commanded Mr. Su, a practical, not to spread the Presidency.
Even without Mr. Chen's intervention, the DPP will be difficult to choose between its potential candidates.
The KMT needs to make a self-inspection.
Mr. Ma's evaluations were weak; although the KMT candidates had not wanted to campaign with him.
His impopularity seems to be largely part of the unemployment and enlargement of the growth between rich and poor.
A KMT port says that his KMT cabinet and its local sponsors will be restored.
The good results of the PDP suggest that the support of Taiwan for its approach is limited.
At the same time, most of the Thailands see economic integration with China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, an eminent addictive, "the point of return is already past."
Nominations to Grammy Awards: Jazz Esperanza Spalding is a surprise selected in the category "More new artist"
To do on the request of a president, and people are obliged to know it.
Esperanza Spalding, the jazz and singing ground of 26 years in the hand by President Obama to produce during his ceremonie of the Nobel Price of the Paix in 2009, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a great appointment in the category of the "More new artist".
Considering that Spralding is a very well-known figure on the jazz scene since its 2008 album, "Esperanza", the appointment remains a little mystery but it is compatible with the Grammy Awards Rules that a artist must not go out more than three albums before registration; that "the public identity of this artist" is aware.
His ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society", certainly marked a step before and, given its vocal style lightly engaged, his pop and funk hand and its Latin influences, it is possible to disappear at least a pointed line in Spralding regarding the success of Norah Jones in 2003, the closest equivalent for the elections of the Grammy Awards, taking into account jazz productions in this category in the last years.
At the same time, the elections of the Grammy Awards have just earned "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trio in the "Toolal album", a vired on a frisson revealing a record that was one of the primary favorites last year.
Part of these Years, "Mody 4B" of Veterian Saxophonist James Moody and "Positootly" of the keyist John Beasley will be in competition.
Trombone Shorty, favouring the race voice of the New Orleans and invited frequently to "Treme" of HBO, was honored in the contemporary jazz category; which also turned strongly to a certain fusion with Stanley Clarke's albums, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The secret Society of the Wild Darcy James Argue, familyized with the Steampunk, gained some well-mentioned gratitudes in the large category together; in compliance with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Common and the eternal aventurary Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of his living eight was a beautiful example of the democratic manager of that ground as a group head.
Nomination of Grammy Awards: Michael Daugherty and Steve Mackey managed in classic categories
The classic nominations for the 53e Grammy Awards have a mix of musicians and composers in the whole world.
In head of the appointments, "Deus Ex Machina" by Michael Daugherty, for the plan and the orchester, with five "oui"; and "Dreamhouse" of Steve Mackey, an electrical orchestral work, with three "oui".
Among the names with links with South California, there is the Estonian Composer Arvo P√§rt for his Symphony No.4, "Los Angeles", a work commanded by the Los Angeles philharmonic Orchester and opened the Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
The Madolin Concerto of the composer based in Los Angeles, Avner Dorman, is also in bed for a reward.
The classic nominations are divided on 13 categories covering orchester records, operating, choral and alone.
A category for the classic producer of the year provides five candidates: Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Tim Handley, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The names for the classic album are the Bruckner of the Royal Orchester of Concertgebau; "Deus Ex Machina" and "Metropolis Symphony" of Daugherty of Nashville Symphony Orchestra; "Dreamhouse" of Steven Mackey of Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; "Sacrificium - art des Castrati" and the "Requiem" of Verdi del Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the category of the Op√©ra, the nameds are "Lulu" of the Mount of the Royal Opera House, "Marc Antonio and Cleopatra" of Adolf Hasse de Ars Lyrica Houston; "The Enchanted Wander" by Rodion Shchedrin and the Th√©√¢tre Mariinsky, and "Ivanho√©" of Art Surilivan de la BBC National Orchester of Wales.
Composers who are placed for the Grammy Awards for Contemporary Composition P√§rt for Symphony No.4, Daugherty for "Deus Ex Machina", Hans Werner Henze for "Appassionally Plus", Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Wander Enchanted".
The Symphony No. 4 of P√§rt had first been at Disney Hall in January 2009 in an execution registered by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchester, directed by EL-Pekka Salonen.
The work of approximately 30 minutes is named "Los Angeles" and is devoted to the former Mikha√Øl Khodorkovski petrol, imprisoned in Russia.
The "Mandolin Concerto" of Dorman was named for its sole instrumental performance with an orchester.
The composer of Los Angeles said he wrote the work of 15 minutes specially for the interpretation of Avi Avital Mandoline, who played the concert with the Metropolis Common, in New York.
"I wrote it using the sounds of the Middle East and a large number of gammas and rhythms of North Africa," said Dorman in a telephone interview.
The Chief of the Orchester Peter Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestrial performances, to be guided by the Chicago Symphonic Orchester in a registration of the works of Stravinsky.
Among the only instruments who have received a nomination, near the Palestinians Nelson Freere and Marc-Andr√© Hamelin; the organism Paul Jacobs, the violonist Julia Fischer and the harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
This year there are only vocalists-solists; here are: Anne Sofie Van Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucie Duchonov√°, Vivica Genaux and Measha Brueggergosman.
In the classic mechanic category, the superno Jessye Norman received an appointment for his record "Racines: my life, my song"
The project of the Temecula Moscow provides the approval of the Planning Committee.
A project of movement in Temecula has received a unique support of the local planning Committee after more than five hours of public witness, often suffered.
The criticisms have been taken to the project, considering that it had promoted both terrorism and trafficking embarrassements.
But the Commissioners stated on Wednesday night that the new religious centre had respected local laws and that it would be extremely impressing.
"What well people have come to support him: Christians, Jewishs, Bahais, you mention it," said Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley, taking the word Thursday.
"I'm proud, as American citizens."
"This shows that justice takes it."
"The opposition is really minimum," added.
"They have just very strong voices."
"We have good people in this valley."
The meeting started at 18 hours and continued to almost delay with the most of the times, for or against the center, in the words time nearly widely separated, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the web site of the journal.
"There is no more of America," a intervention wrote.
"It's another planet of singes with Miss Liberty died in the sable."
"A America has falled."
The planned islamic centres also followed protests in other parts of the country, including in the Great Zero, place of the attacks of 11 September 2001 in New York City.
Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has described violence in the Valley Team.
Its congregation of the order of 135 co-responses exists without incident in Riverside's comite for years, but she wanted a larger and better space than the interply which she had lodged on a shared property with a producer of water filtering systems.
The new massed 24.943 feet square in the Mediterranean style architecture would be composed of two mines and up to 43 feet.
It would take a 4,32 hectares on the Nicolas road around two thousands on the east of the Chaparral lyc√©e.
The opposers can still call on this project to the municipal Council.
An arsenic microbee that tolerates the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or otherwise.
The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutritional elements, extends the field to find new forms of life on Earth and may outside.
Although researchers have discovered the inhabitable bacteria here on Earth, they say that this shows that life has opportunities beyond the major elements that have been considered as essential.
"This body has a double capacity."
"They can be developed either with phosphore or with arsenic."
"There is why she is very special, even though she is far from being a real "ethrang√®re" form of life, commented Paul Davies C. W. of the University of State d'Arizona, the co-auteur of the report contained in the online game editor of the Science Journal.
Six major elements have long been considered as essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, azote, oxygen, phosphore and sulphure.
But researchers found that the bacteria, discovered in the Mono Lake in California, is in a position to continue to develop after being replaced the phosphare by arsenic.
"We're asking what still possible", said Ariel Anbar D. of the University of Arizona, co-autor of the report.
The discovery is important in the field of research of life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, to know what life is like, says Anbar.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not distribute the details of the discovery, generated specifications extended on the Internet according to which the report could disseminate the discovery of an extraternal life.
That wasn't the case.
It shows that, in other planetary environments, organisms could be able to use other elements to operate biochimy and that the entire "standard" of the elements that we are absolutely necessary for life, could not be set," commented Charles Cockell, professor to the Institute of Planetary and Space Science Research, Open University, Millton Keynes, United Kingdom.
Cockell wasn't part of the search team.
"This new work is because it shows the substitution of a element to another basic biochimy and biochimical structure," added Cockell.
It wasn't a forced discovery.
Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Institute of Astrology of NASA, which directed the study, chose the Mono Lac because it is made of high levels of arsenic.
Arsenic and phosphore are chemically similar, and thus she indicated that a microbe expressed to the two substances could be able to replace one to another.
"The arsenic is mainly toxic because his chemical behaviour is really similar to the fosphore."
"The organizations are therefore unfortunate to distinguish these elements separately."
"But the arsenic is sufficiently different so that it doesn't work exactly like the phosphore; he's walking inside and, in some way, gets the work of our biochimical machine," explained Anbar.
Researchers collected the known bacteria named GFAJ-1 and exposed it to growing concentrations of arsenic with which she could adapt and grow.
The microbee better grows with the phosphere, but the fact that he can live with arsenic in place highlights the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can happen naturally, otherwise on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more frequent.
Jamie S. Foster, Adjunta professor of microbiology to the University of Floride, said that the idea that the arsenic could be replaced by the phosphore was not new, but he never showed that it could walk.
The arsenic was more frequently at the beginning of the earth's existence, said, and so the researchers issued the hypothesis that the first forms of life would have been able to use it.
This suggests that there could be other ways to form life, not only how the life on Earth has been formed at the beginning," said Foster, who had not been part of the Wolfe-Simon Research team.
The research was funded by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Institute.
The latest two flowed exposure dogs were found in Compton
The two other dogs of exhibition on four flows out of a motel in Bellflower were found, the serifs of the Los Angeles comite scenes announced it Thursday.
The four dogs of exhibition - two acites and two stages of gallois - disappeared on Friday when someone flowed the Chevrolet Express trenette in which they had passed out of a motel 6 of Bellflower, the authorities.
Two dogs were recovered after midnight, and the two others were found in the end of mercredi evening, said Steve Whitmore, the Port of the Department of Law Angeles.
"The good news is that the dogs will be good," said Whitmore.
"They are in good forms."
"They have been refunded to their legal owners."
Whitmore refused to say exactly where dogs were found, in which village and what circumstances they were discovered.
"A investigation is running."
"We don't want to say it," said Whitmore.
"We follow the orders."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, couldn't be joined to provide a comment on Thursday.
They were meetings after midnight with their two Akitas in a refuge for animals of the comite situated in Downey.
The serif addendums found the camionnette and the two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a three-year-old husband, and Didi, a 10-month woman - were healthy and sweet, announced the authorities.
But Bunny and Peter, Rickard and Peek were planned to show regional concours this week, for the owner of the Japanese dogs owners, they were departed until they discovered on Friday.
Peek and Rickard, who lives in Redding, are in the city this weekend in the "AKC/Eukanuba" national campaign, where they were presenting Trace.
Other dogs were expected to participate in the competitions of other tests provided in the days before the ‚ÄúAKC/Eukanuba‚Äù exhibition of the ‚ÄúAkC/Eukanuba‚Äù said Peek to the day of mercredi.
South California is one of the arrests of the canine exhibition tour of almost a couple month.
Monday, Peek and Rickard were checked in the motor.
They are often staying in the motals and keeping their truck outdoor, just next to the window of their room.
They took three other dogs - a Boxer Boxer, a territory Parson Russell and a breton shot - which remained with them in the motel room.
But they left the Akitas and the corgs, at the lower smoke, in the truck where it would be costly.
They have a little open the windows so that dogs may have fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported the truck flight at 6:00 Tuesday.
Peek said they would offer a reward to any person who could lead them to the corgs, for a micropuce imposed to identify them.
It is not clear if a reward has been granted Thursday.
The lion is ready to run again, the restructuring of MGM is waiting for only the final green fire in the core
After 18 months of turbulence and uncertainty, MGM finally obtained the green fire to recombine.
A Federal Court of Faillits in New York, formally lodged the "pre-balled" plan by creditors, according to which approximately $5 billion would be performed; opening the way to the divorce company, having 86 years of existence, focused on the production and dissemination of films and television emissions.
With the Thursday decision, as the plan meets the requirements of the United States fail code, no legal barriers are subject to MGM to flowing under the peer funders of Spryglass, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, which will be the general directors of the study.
The staff will be returned to approximately 320 by 400 at the start.
MGM will not actually enhance the Chapter 11 as JPMorgan Chase will not conclude a credit facility of $500 million, planned for the financing of new MGM operations and productions.
It is currently distributed under licence by the investment bank, which has to be paid at $75 million, and should be funded to mid-Ocember.
The study restructuring process started in May 2009 when the Moelis & Co Investment Bank was engaged in advising the direction on the way to place its funds because it did not have the means of paying interests to $300 million per year.
In August, the Director-General, Harry Sloan, was replaced by Stephen Cooper, an old PDG d'Enron and an expert in recognition known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Moelis and Cooper attempts to solve the financial difficulties of MGM and to satisfy the more than 140 creditors of the study have taken much more time.
After a few months of discussion, the parties agreed to put the company into sale at the end of 2009.
However, the sale of acquirers had not been paid for submissioners between which no one of them was ready to pay the sum of 2 billion more than which the creditors were in the research.
At the summer of this year, it was necessary to reflect while the MGM team began to work on a restructuring plan which, after months of disagreement and internal debates, was finally approved by creditors at the end of October.
When the MGM is officially issued from the fatality in the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper companies will receive premiums of several million dollars for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already got $1,2 million, will receive $9,5 million.
Cooper's firms, which collected $375,000 per month for their business management services, will receive a " success premium" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnbaum considers the production of MGM, which went out only one movie this year, and puts a seven-oight-year-old movie list on foot since 2012.
They also intend to cooperate with two films based on the Hobbit, with Warner Bros
The study must conclude a different loan between $265,000 and $275 million to finance its part in these two films, which must be made by Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, who is about 18% of MGM debt, tried to realize a fusion of the study with Lions Gate Entertainment, where he is the principal actor.
However, recent discussions between the two companies have not occurred to an agreement.
Games Tech to maintain your cadal budget in balance
Although the main candidate for the most wonderful playing of this year is the IPAD, followed, may, by the Microsoft video game system, Kinect, both can make an important bucket in your cadal budget.
Consider that, for a iPad price, you can buy five BMX BMX to $99 and that a Kinect game costs the same price as 10 pieces to store classic perles, or approximately 48 kits of Play-Doh.
But there are ways to keep your cadal budget in balance.
Received, I visited three national players - Wal-Mart, Toys "R" You and Wholesale Club of BJ - to see the electronic games I could buy for at least 80 dollars.
It is clear that the Moore Law has evolved, the technological play this year is likely to have more strength; while costing the same price but less, compared to the last year.
Furthermore, while there are generally less new players related to websites, two of the most famous of this type, Webkinz and Club Pengun, have more offers.
And the pile buttons are increased, as well as reloadable piles games.
These are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys "R" Us, except if any indication is contrary.)
The Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, 13 dollars for 3 years and more) are players in the swimming pool of a Indian cook that canch a note when you press them on the womb.
A pressure is equal to a note, and a second allows to compose a song.
If you buy it a few, they'll knock in harmonised.
Attention: Once you start supporting, you can't stop.
To combine the dance, Dance Mickey Star (Fisher-Price, $60 for 2 years and more) is the best choice.
In inspiring Elmo Live technology in the past year, the animatronic poppe of 14 pools plays role playing as Simon Says and can make the lunary bathroom through its innovated feet with wheels blocking.
Children who have earned player uses Mickey as dancing instructor while their parents have a lack of volume control.
If you're a child in the 1980s, you'll remember Alphie, one of the first educational players.
It's back (Hasbro / Playskool, $40 for 3 years and more), with a two-year-old game bag designed to transform a card balade in a session with a self-correction and a vane class.
If you're nice when your child holds your smartphone, here's three autonome alternatives.
The VTech Mobigo (60 $, for 3 to 8 years) is the most slight and easier to use, with a qvaluy key, although games do not educate so effectively as Explore Leapster (70 dollars, for 3 to 12 years), is the first large revision of the Leapster gamme, with a recent and lighter screen.
No version is compatible with the old cards.
The iXL de Fisher-Prece (90 dollars, for 3 to 7 years) uses a type of iTunes to offer games and e-books and is equipped with a entry for SD card that allows to show family photos.
Finally, Scrabble Flash (30 dollars, Hasbro, for the eight years and more) is a lot of five blocks more than an alumen box, each who has its own LED screen.
The goal is to form words by putting online blocks before the time goal is ideal for an imprompto orthography concours.
Moreover, games have a kind of online connection.
Only on their presence in the playing stores, the two largers are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
To buy your child a online animal of the Club Penguin Club, for example, you can get a Penguin Disney Club 2" Mix'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for the 6-12 years) which includes a marked room of a hidden code.
When you buy the online code, your child receives sufficient credits to Club Penguin for two items to the choice.

Approve a more duplicable side for the maintenance of the order in China
Tang Shenbin arpented a city place as a urban team, inspecting seriously his nervous charges, emitting a lower voice of orders with a military authority.
He wished the female members of Chengoun - imposing tax responsibilities of the public order in China, fears and dismissed for their arbitrary repression and pending for violence, transmit a certain impression to a set of spectators.
"Do you have right!"
"Sin't wearing!"
Show them, he said, "What like the beautiful girls!"
Four girls who hardly passed adolescents in white gloves, clothes of clothes and identical oil screens, were fitting to the watch.
Four pillars of black clothings, adjusted to the rules.
Four chapels are perfectly subscribed because at the hair summit added by a blue and white nut.
"Personally, I think they have a average appearance," said Mr. Tang, with defence.
"The models are nice."
More than one government has tried to refresh the image of the urban inspectors in China.
A city concluded that all new records were a higher study diploma.
Guangdong's province has changed the green verse uniforms against a more incoming self-dependent.
Wuhan, in Central China, replaced them by strong way: in 2009, a report report reported that 50 officers had a non-controlle snack card by launching black views, closely for a half hour, until the coacher was retaining its business and part.
Xindu, a urban district of 680,000 in Chengdu, has chosen to make a large image operation.
Since 2003, the district composed its urban road police in the middle of 13 women, specially elected for their appearance, their galbe and their young age.
The idea is to give the police a more dure, more female side.
Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulties to look at this underlying urban breeding of China
And for this reason, the criticians will say.
In contrast to the police, these officers shall only be authorised to comply with municipal orders by imposing amendments or other administrative sanctions.
But Chinese media overcome the news of a different reality.
In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubi killed a observer after he used his port phone to film them in the train of dispersing a protest against a download of waste.
Last year, a training manual for P√©kin's inspectors, discovered and online, describes how effectively win the delinders without emitting blood.
This year in Shanghai, a passenger of passengers was left with a cerebral lesion after a bagarer with five officials.
A printed video of violence, available on online download, shows Chinese inspectors formed on the road sales.
"Chengguan marked the government," deployed the last year of China Daily, a national publication, after an eighth polematic on tactics.
The newspaper calls for a "comprehensive cleaning".
The sceptics say that the approach is very far.
After the district had been an announced in October to find eight new female recruits, an editional, pared in The Beijing Evening News, asked whether women had real tasks or if they were only a tourist divorce.
The answer seems to be a little of two.
The district announcement was required for female candidates, aged between 18 and 22, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five face traffics in the good order."
They must have a larger size of 1,6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1Êúà2 powders.
The pension of 26 years is obligation.
Officiers stated that the work was physically too crucial for women over 25 years.
"It's their image which is important", said a certain district officer at Rednet.com, a almost governmental site.
"Otherwise, the external qualitys of the candidates shall determine whether they agree; this is the size, weight, face traffics, etc."
Then the temperature and the "inneral qualitys".
Chengguan women are like flower vessels, said, adding: "In addition to be vessels, they will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, adjoint Director of the town management office, not attempt to this description.
But he noted that the requirements relating to the height were the standard standard in many Chinese employment offers for both genders.
This is the case of the requirement relating to the order of face trafficking.
This means a good question of discussion between the Chineses.
Of course, persons with disabilities or disabilities must not post.
"We can't let someone who drinks or a boss come to serve here," said Mr. Zheng.
"He wouldn't give a good image."
Liu Yi, who is paid on the Baoguang place near a monast√®re, is old of 22 and has pommeled games with an endless mouth.
She does not consider the valuation of its appearance as sweet, as she said.
"Do you think I've got sexy in this uniform?" she asked a disappeared air.
Xu Yang, his college at the age of 21 years, said, "Our work is to present the image of the city."
They do not appreciate their terms to be limited, said they, because they feed a greater carrier ambitions than just cast out vendors into the streets where they are worth to limit their activities.
Each morning, the team faces a tenth of walking goods that are fastly displaced to foot or glass, attempting to sell the most possible of small bread or towels before taking the escape.
"Monstor Wang, you must go."
"We've already told you a few times!" said Mrs. Xu while a vendor fled to feet, with a timely leaveing his ticket-carreat.
The agents describe their functions rather than monotones than arts.
"It's almost the same thing every day," said Huang Jing, aged 20, who studies the marketing after work.
"Grand Robin."
One of the reasons is that female agents do not have the power of their male homologs to confid the goods of sales.
They can only threaten the countermeasures to their highest males.
This aims at protecting soon public exposures of soullessness against the bureaucracy common in all China.
This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunan, revolutioned after the propagation of false rushes, as they killed a vendor.
In one night, more than ten police officers and chianguan agents have been wounded, 14 government vehicles were returned or burned.
Xindu fled to such violence.
But quiet is not safe.
Similarly two households from the Baoguang place, where women's sex officers were stolen this morning, more than 50 people were meetings at the coast of the street.
The officers confided a moto that was currently being recruited on the throat rather than in a magazine, as they imposed regulation.
The owner of the motor cried to the scandal.
A 15-minute rail arm followed before the policeers, on the left face, have been thrown a road cut way to their vehicle and have gone to any speed with the motor and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40 years old, a co-ordinator attached to the male team, left behind, his white badge returned to hide his name.
As women's sex officers, male coordinators - aged 40 or more - are purely playing a role of support.
In contrast to them, they are not formed to maintain a cereal image.
"After, we're fighting verbal."
"After, we are physically fighting," said Mr.
"The most time, it's the public that begins."
Prosecutors will not cover Senator Ensign
The Ministry of Justice has raised criminal complaints against Senator John Ensigno, dealing with an case related to an old campaign and his efforts to obtain a lobbying work for the marriage, announced the lawyers of the Senator.
The decision ends with the most serious legal threat by Mr. Ensigno, the Republic of Nevada, which was considered as a possible Republical candidate to the President of 2012 until the scandale around its case did the major national titles last year and retain its carrier.
Mr. Undersign Office stated that he was very happy by the decision, resulting in an year's investigation.
The Senator could still be addressed to disciplinary measures taken by the Senatoral Committee of Ethiopia.
Mr. Ensign lawyers said that the Ministry of Justice had "informed that the Senator Ensign had no object to the investigation and that he had no intention to maintain any accused against him in this case."
The Ministry of Justice has been detained of comments on this matter.
The advertisement was a kind of surprise for many Ethiopic Advocates to the Ministry of Justice, which would have significant evidence indicated that Mr. Ensigno would contribute to overcome a Federal Criminal Prohibition on Lobbing.
Interviews, e-mails and other documents, first reported in New York Times in October 2009, indicated that Mr. Ensigno had helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his assistants, to get a lucrative lobbying work to win Mr. Hampton's silence and his wife, Cynthia, on the case of the Senator with her.
Ms. Hampton served once as a treasury at an Ensigno campaign.
Mr. Undersign contacted a number of political funds to find work for Mr. Hampton and then defended their rights after they undertaken Mr. Hampton to make lobbying for them; in accordance with documents and interviews.
Since Mr. Hampton was recently a collaborator of Mr. Ensigno, he was prohibited by the law to make lobbying with his former employer or Senate together.
The ethical experts supported that the inhabitable agreement between Mr. Undersign and Mr. Hampton, who were friends before the case, appeared in contradiction with the prohibition of the touring door of the lobbing.
According to the public evidence, "There seems to be a primary evidence of a complaint with regard to violer and substantive violation of the Law of the touring door", said Stanley Brand, a lawyer of Washington, specialized in the defence of customers from a investigation by the Government.
Although the Minister's judge refused to explain the reason for the decision under the appointment, Mr. Brand and other and Ethic lawyers said that the Ministry seemed to miss political pursuant to a number of high-level reverses by its section of public integrity, including the decisions taken for the last year to abandon the persecution against the former Senator Ted Stevens injury.
Federal Prosecutors clearly feared the arms, said Melania Sloan, the Directorate-General for the Responsible and Ethiods in Washington, a Defence Group who received several complaints against Mr. Underline in the case.
"There is basicly said high-paying government officials can now accept the laws do not apply to them," added.
Paul Coggins, principal lawyer of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview that Monday he had received a telephone call from the part of a prosecutor of the Ministry of Justice and a follow-up on the next morning, said that the Ministry was not seeking complaints against his client.
Mr. Ensigno's Advocates team had cooperated with the prosecutors to try to convince them that the Senator, such as his office reaffirmed it in a communiqu√©, " had acted in accordance with the law."
Mr. Coggins refused to clarify the legal arguments he had made in the park.
"I am not at the same time to enter into the details of my discussion with the Ministry of Justice, except to say that we think they have taken the right decision," said he.
In the last month, the Federal Commission of the Elections decided to leave an investigation following an independent complaint by the Ethioking Group, supporting that the payment of $96,000 by Mr. Underton's parents violated federal electoral law.
The Electoral Committee said that she did not have sufficient evidence to prove that money was only a gift.
NV Energy, a Nevada's important society that has longly supported Senator, is a company for which Mr. Energy helped Mr. Hampton to find lobbying work.
A email sent in December 2008 showed that after the company welcomed Mr. Hampton as a lobbyist, Mr. Undersign, John Lopez, he informed Mr. Hampton and said that he was "marked" the Interior Minister on a litter question.
Mr. Ensigno also participated in a dinner with Mr. Hampton and another client of Nevada, Allgiant Air, and requested the secretariat of the transport to fix a meeting on behalf of the air company after the dealing with Mr. Hampton to lobbing.
When the news of the case were overwhelmed last year, Mr. Ensigno was excused to his election and released his leader post to the fourth republic rang to Senate.
After maintaining a profile down for a few months, Mr. Ensigno said two weeks ago that he was intended to print a third mandate to the Senate.
While announced that Mr. Institute was no more the objective of a criminal investigation, his port-law, Jennifer Cooper said that the Senator hoped that the Ethiopia Committee would rapidly follow the example of the Ministry of Justice and put an end to its investigation.
Senator Ensign is glad to continue its work in the name of the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire's call shows to Twitter
A half thirteen of them were going to tapper away in the roads of the audience room.
They sent all the moments of the terrible witness reports via Twitter.
At the end, the defence said that there were more than 140 000 messages on the process of violence and children attached to their bed in a house which was burned.
Thursday, the broadly followed process by Steven J. Hayes, who was recognized by the murder of three members of the Cheshire family, in the Connecticut, should deploy on an official end where the judge would impose death penalty, voted by the jury.
But Mr. Hayes' lawyers have already put out items to the court that are listed to arguments of appeal, which may take care of the courts for years.
What is caused is that intense reporting on the process, as well as the generalised and extended by the Twitter journalists - created a "atmosphere of circle", a saturation as spread and immediately spread with fireing details that the jury has been badly affected by the passions of the public.
The request could be put to the judges of calling to discuss whether new technologies require new rules in the hearing rooms.
"I have made the experience in this process, and I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the hearing rooms of the person's right to a fair proceedings," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr. Hayes, head of lawyer.
The judge of the proceedings, Jon C. Bleue of the Supreme Court, has lacily rejected the refunds in the last week, stated that the media were "really controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would be animated by the passion.
But it seems not to be the last word on the question.
Call courses recognize for decades that the mediatic covering of notory cases may address questions on the equity of a proceeding.
In a judge dated 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States has rejected the condemnation of an ostheopath of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, supported in its decision that there was a " carnaval atmosphere " because of media.
The crime is considered by some of the inspiration for the emission of television and the "The Refugee" film.
Some lawyers said that the courts of calling to reveal a half - century later the condemnation of Mr. Hayes may be concerned by the argument that new rules might be necessary to manage the media of hearing rooms in the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
"There is a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media" in the processes of great survey, said John J. Donohue III, a professor at the Driving School of Stanford who studied the death penalty to the Connecticut and wrote a report that she was arbitrarily implemented.
Professor Donohue claims that some call judges could be included by the idea that immediate communication limitation from hearing rooms could allow proceedings to be more accurate.
The case of Twitter is only one of the many others described by Mr. Hayes' lawyers, who may be discussed for years, and that will be delayed.
Advocates of the Defence also claim that Mr. Hayes would have a prejudice when the Blue Judge refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jury by showing them mask photos of criminal scenes in the selection of the jury.
Some of the jury have been horrorized by the photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and his daughters, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years old.
The lawyers of the Defence claim that they will also condemn the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they would support that the judge has unfairly issued one of the jury, which had been critical before the prosecutors, and that he has abusely put the pressure for a defence by taking the imposable decision to take the jury to deliver in a weekend.
The jury did not have been sequested.
But their arguments on the effect of the mediatic coverage of the process could be the greatest source of interest.
They noted in a complaint against the deputy, on the last month, that the case dominated the median scene in the Connecticut and that it was discussed during the electoral campaign by candidates at the governance post and the United States Senate.
They have maintained that the media have not stopped attacking the emotion of the case.
"The daily buscolade of the seconds of the media, cameras and journalists before the palace of justice," the lawyers wrote, "not seemed to what they had been seen before here, in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level."
They focus on the covering of the Twitter system is contrary.
In the interviews, some journalists stated that the claim that the news were more burning than the communiqu√©s had been lendingly, was a player view that would cover the Court's policy which regulate the Mediterranean covering the future processes.
But some lawyers said that the call courses were often addressed by arguments in which social and technological changes needed an adaptation by the courts.
Mr. Hayes' lawyers insist on this recovery.
In their case, they made a reference to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966, which had rejected the condemnation of Dr. Sheppard because of the median coverage of the proceedings and expressed that they would require new rules for new media.
"The seven cases," written they," represented the Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21th century. "
Can civilization be closed?
After a campaign marked by invective and negative, a minimum of civility was carried out in Washington this week.
Is this a pre-carrier sign of a real bilateral cooperation towards the previous or an illustrational moment before the return to the participation fight in the capital?
The Tuesday meeting between President Obama and the Governings of the Congress did not cause any harm on the major issues that should be treated during the session of the "Bived Canard".
But in all circumstances there was at least a police debate on the differences of both parties and on the recognition of their shared responsibilities to go over, rather than another episode where each camp wanted to mark points.
The public meeting of the Commission on Deficit of the President has also been civilized, despite the political divergence between members.
It seems clear that the close interaction of several months has created a mutual respect transcended the ideological foss; but that is still divided by members.
It's hardly enough to state that a new stage of cooperation has occurred.
The two parties are now at a trial period of testing and testing mutual in order to obtain cooperation and compromise signs, while attempt to assess the limits of the public opinion and the patient of elections for a renewed party war.
Therefore, the Tuesday meeting and the subsequent comments of the participants have devoted minimum requirements or accused.
The philosophic differences between Obama and the Republics are too large and too deep to suggest a rapid change of climate that has been present in the past two years.
As regards fiscality, expenditure, health care or rights, the two parties remain at thousands of distances.
However, the election of November had made Washington, at least in the short term.
"It makes no doubt that things changed on the tone," said Pete Wehner, a Bush Officer, now on the side of the Ethic and Public Politics Centre.
"It's inevitable after the elections.
The elections are subject to particreen passions and then they are tolerate.
It's fine."
On certain issues, including those on the agenda of the agenda of the ‚Äúsawful canard‚Äù, republics and democracies are only choices to find a solution.
Bush's tax reductions will expire at the end of the year, and no one is in favour of this.
The two parties want to find a way to keep a part or the whole, permanent or timely.
In the same way, a compromise is intended on the extension of unemployment allocations would be only because the Republics cannot be allowed to give the impression that they are in favour of the reduction of tax for rich, while rejecting unemployment amounts to unemployed workers.
After the Saturday meeting at the White House, more optimism planned on an possible agreement on issues addressed during the session on the "soit canal", with the ratification of the "New START Pact".
But William Galston, from the Brookings Institute, notices that a fruitful cooperation on the most pressing problems of the "lame duck" session will not be forced to a better understanding between the two parties when the 112th Congress will meet in Janvier.
Instead of this, he said, a disagreement period is likely, even inevitable.
"After things that are to be done will, psychology in the short term will come to one of the confrontations," said he.
Wehner also expressed its widely shared scepticism that civility would lead to real cooperation.
"I think most of what happens between today and 2012, as a prespectacle or shadow-boxing compared to the main event of 2012, said he.
The reasons of this are closely related to the composition of the new Republician majority in the Chamber and the elections present to the theme that have contributed to its creation.
However, republic leaders are aware of the dangers if they are too far, they know that they must try to be at the height of their promises to reduce public expenditure and to repeal the new Law on Health care.
These stakeholders are ancient and already clear in the first reactions of the Deficit Commission recommendations that include reform of the Imposition Code and increased certain taxes, decline the age of pension and reduction of expenditure.
Co-Presidents Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have chosen one of the most difficult tasks in Washington and have, according to themselves, imposed the issue of public deficit in a way that can not be ignored.
But they need 14 votes to the Commission, composed of 18 members, to submit their plan as an official recommendation, and they have been bad to reach that number.
The largest resistance remains among the elections of the group, and it suggests that there are tax issues, at least today, few reasons or compromise will.
Galston provides two phases in the fight between the White House and the Congress Republics.
The first will come in the next year in the form of participation, since the Republics respond to Obama budget, taxes and health care, then followed by a more bipartite cooperation period.
What would be the cause of change?
Public opinion.
It is widely proved that a majority of Americans always wants to see both parties to work together.
If the confrontation leads to an impasse, such as in 1995, the two parties will take attention to the reaction of the public.
The one who will be judged with loss must change cap and find compromises.
But it would be a optimistic point of view.
The partisan spirit and the polarization today are larger than they were in the middle of 1990, and it seems to have a greater ideal difference between Obama and the Republics of the Congress that it was then between President Bill Clinton and the Republics.
At the same time, the soldiers of the two parties see 2010 as a simple prelude to a more appropriate election in 2012.
In view of this reality, the expressed civility could be appreciated by many Americans.
But there will be much more effort from both parties to find an agreement area on the issues that are still divided to them.
American documents describe Moscow as a fountain of corruption
The control of the city is among the hands of a "Cleptcracy" and has passed to Kremlin a part of the cow-win and protection money that she gathered, reported the Ambassade of the United States in Russia in a note in February.
The police and the Federal Safety Service have made huge rackets that contribute to clarify the high cost of life in Moscow.
They gather money not only from legal enterprises but also of organized criminal groups.
Each sleep of the bureaucracy - what the first Minister Vladimir Poutine called the "vertical power" - takes its part when the money is going to the top of the scale.
The service notice, sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyler, was posted on its website by Wikileaks.
The note is based on sources whose names were expired.
It was revealed when Jouri Loujkov was still mad of Moscow, and he is in great part responsible for corruption.
He was assembled in October by President Dmitri Medvedev but there was a few cleaning traces since the time.
Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who has a first planning construction company, have always dismissed corruption accusations during the years, and has gained several procedures in diffamation on these accuses.
In September, he declared what follows to a Russian television chain, when he was asked about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupted: "It's crazy, it's to throw, it's anything."
The Russians believe a huge majority that their society is corrupted; according to the dreams.
But it is inadequate to find information contained in an ambassade account, and it is unfair to consider that this would be to diplomats of a foreign country to do so.
The direct link established between the Government of the city of Moscow and the crime brought some persons to the name of "dysfonctional" and stated that the Government worked more as a compulsory than a government", according to the appeal notice.
" Criminal elements play a " krysha " (term used in the Criminal world/Mafia, which literally means " toit " or protection) through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Interior Minister (MVD) and the Office of the Prosecutor, as well as through all the offices of the Government of the city of Moscow.
"The analysis of identifying a three-level structure in Moscow criminal world."
"Luzhkov's on the summit."
"FSB, MVD and military are at the second level."
"Otherwise, ordinary crimes and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level."
"It is an ineffective system in which criminal groups combine a vacuum in certain areas where the city does not provide some services."
The report indicates that the FSB is handling the money of the larger enterprises and that the police targets the smaller.
A source said, "reflexed that the owners of Moscow understood that it was preferable to obtain the protection of MVD and FSB (as not only organized crime groups) because they had more weapons, more and more power than criminal groups but are also protected by the law " .
"There is why the demand for protection by criminal gangs is no longer higher."
The note notes that, although the collection of money is extended, its own protection may be inequitable, even those who paid are sometimes subject to arrest.
Those who can't quickly see their business closed under a pretext or another.
Medvedev has evaluated several times the fight against corruption but he has admitted the little progress.
The note of the Ambassade transmits accounts on men who bring valies, probably filled with money until Kremlin.
"Af his fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on offices," said in a recent interview Gueorgui Satarov, director of the "think tank Indem" of Moscow.
"But he is part of this office."
"It is not part of a political class because there is no Russian."
Without policy, without opposition, without separation of powers, it said that corruption is inevitable.
According to India, Corporation costs would be increased at the Russian level all over $300 billion per year.
The country was classified in a 154e recent song on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental Transparency International Organization (the countries are classified at least in the least corrupt).
The spread of the notice of the American Ambassade, which has been realized that yesterday after evening, Moscow's hour will recall with certain assurance of the meconances within the Russian government; although Loujkov could be blown in a certain measure, for Moscow's chains, that could be the opportunity for Kremlin to show that it is in the process to solve the problem.
Interviewed by the CNN by Larry King, Poutine issued the hypoth√®se that the WhikiLeaks documents could be a manufacture and reacted with anger in the fact that diplomats of the United States had spread in the Batman's calling and removing Medvedev of Robin.
"The problem is on the fact that this is our interaction, the important factor of internal policy in this country, says.
"But to be honored with you, we wouldn't suspect that this would be done with such arrogance, such pressure and, you know, in opposition to Ethiopia."
The elders of the Red Khmers obliged to face the past
In a malicious class room with bad beton walls, the director of Anlong Veng's secondary school announced the man who built it, the last chief of the Red Khmers, Ta Mok.
"All the world here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader, and he was worried about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42 years old.
Connue as the "hot" for his brutality, when he was at the head of the Red Khmers, the commander remains popular in this island of red Khmers in the north-west Cambodge where he built hospitals, ponts and other infrastructures; and where thousands of old soldiers of the organization still live today.
But this year, 12 years after the red Khmers were sent to the government, the long date loyalty is finally sent to Anlong Veng.
In April, a local Truth and Reconciliation Forum allowed victims to publicly face those who participated in the regime.
In Juin, the government distributed a high school manual that first teaches the history of the Red Khmers to the children of his elders soldiers.
And, in July, a Cambodgian court, jointly directed with the United Nations, made his first sentence concerning an old member of the red Khmers, condemning, in 35 years of prison, the former chief of the famous famous Torture centre of Tuol Sleng, King Khek Iev, better known in the name of "Duch".
Before this evolution of the situation, anxiety increased with the elders of the Red Khmers of Anlong Veng; compliance with the efforts of reconciliation and their intentions to reintegrate the Cambodia society.
"There are resurrections and fears among the elders of red Khmers but they are imposed to do whatever it is", said Chhang Youk, Chief of the Cambodian Documentation Centre, an independent body who leads research on the regime.
"For them, life under the red Khmers was glorious but the regime became a symbol of evil."
"The situation generates divisions within the family."
Under the kingdom of the Red Khmers in Cambodia, 1975 to 1979, approximately 1,7 million were executed or died of hunger, disease or surmise.
When Vietnam's envahi and returned the United States Poland Government in 1979, the rest of the regime and his army fled to the Cambodia border with Thailand.
There, they launched an insurrection that durationed until the last movement was held in December 1998.
While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary guided the healing of their base situated on the west mountains of Cambodia and the jungle, Ta Mok prepared a suite to Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of 1990, after a peace agreement held by the United Nations had conducted the first democratic elections in 1993, large red Khmers battle groups began to defeat the government, culminating the capitals of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died from natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had been headed, was taken by government forces in 1999 to the mountains near Dangrek.
He died in Phnom Penh prison in 2006, waiting for his process.
Without their well-beings, most of the old red khmers have sown in the black mixture common in the Cambodia rural regions; and many are those who remain in the nostalgical movement.
Although some red khmers elector officers have kept their positions of local leading to exchange arms, it is non-qualific agricultural farmers on the low grade and folder.
"These persons have been very little followed after the capitalation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout the Cambodia, including Anlong Veng.
"They are embedded from the agrarable implant of the regime."
"They have been high in a framework where to do business is a foreign concept."
Lim, an age of 55 years, who joined the Red Khmers as a adolescent in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before being installed in 1998 as a poor riz culture.
"The life under the red Khmers was good," said he.
"Ta Mok sweats everybody."
But now, life is difficult because we need to support our own needs."
The Court of Red Khmers has also caused issues here.
The court should, at the beginning of the next year, submit the judgment of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Iing Thirith, another old Khmer Minister.
The Court's mandate is to judge the high leaders and the chief responsible for crimes, but he did not say if he continued beyond these four cases.
It would need more to calm Anlong Veng's fears.
The latest media shows turned to Im Chaem, aged 64, old district head in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the Khmers Khmers‚Äô kingdom in the 1970s.
In 2007, she told the Cambodia documentation Centre that she had overseeed the construction of the Trapeang Thma barrier, a project where thousands of forced workers would have found death.
Received, at a evening town, Im Chaem returned from work to the field located near his wood house on pilots, on a landway outside Anlong Veng.
While the sun was throwing long shadows on the disappeared herb, In Chaem refused to discuss his past within the red Khmers.
If the court had conveyed her, she said, she would refuse to go there.
"The Cambodge is in peace and stability," she said.
"If there are more persecutors, there will be war."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defeated the Red Khmers in 1978, also warned several times that an instability would happen if the court continued a number of suspects, although experts and historicates comply with this.
"The Cambodge must create a bottle and bury the past, says he.
But face the past is all that the Cambodia has to do to go before, said Youk Chhang, of the documentation centre.
"The reconciliation in terms khmer is to reconnect the cased tracks," said he.
"We have to put these pieces together so we can understand."
The center produced the first manual approved by the Government on the Red Khmers, "A Democratic History of Kampuchea, which consists of 75 pages."
He distributed it to Anlong Veng in June as added to the history books of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Red Khmers.
As in most of the Cambodia, young people of Anlong Veng know only some details about the red Khmers, despite the links of the city to the regime.
Touch Valeak, a 19-year-old student at Anlong Veng's high school, said that the new manual helped students to understand an important part of their history.
But his parents reacted with scepticism when he returned with the book to the house to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the manual and the court," he said.
"They are sorry because they don't know exactly how many people will continue the court."
An such resistance made the comprehensive and difficult reconciliation process, Suk Leang said.
But public forums, the manual and the court begin with an impact, said he.
However, the Red Khmers keep a powerful aircraft here.
In the heights of the mountains of Dangrek, a road, envahied by the bad herbs and swallowed with plastic bags, leading to a black sugar rectangle, covered by a rocked towel.
The Pol Pot body was burned here on a pneus hair after his death in 1998.
Sothea, old- 31-year-old, portable phone sale in road boundary, said she didn't know much about the man who was engaged in this place.
"But he has a great spirit, and many inhabitants will go there to pray," she said.
It was the Year of Nuum Sothea and, later that day, she was planned to walk to the last place of Pol Pot, where she would leave a bottle of fresh bananas in the hope of bringing a chance.
Bielorussia agreed to refuse its military warranty stock
The Government of Belarusia announced on Wednesday that he would leave his stock of uranium highly rich, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this decision is included in the framework of a surprise of the campaign of President Obama to secure nuclear materials in the whole world.
The agreement was published in a joint communication published after the secretariat of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met here the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Martynov, in marge of a Security Summit.
The American Government had tried to convince the Bielorussia to refuse highly rich uranium and seemed to have denied the horizon to the last summer.
But the American officials said that some classified operations were carried out with Bielorussia in the last two months to eliminate the military warranty from a Bielorussia Research Centre.
This opened the way to a married agreement to eliminate the remaining area of about 500 books, according to a official who reported the condition of anonymic because of the sensitivity of the question.
The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of the Nuclear Safety Summit of 47 nations, organized at Obama initiative, where Belarusia was excluded.
Apparently, it was profitable to provide an invitation to the former Soviet Republic following the summit in 2012.
"I am really excited by the fact they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Safety Summit."
"There is proof that this process functions," said Ken Luongo, President of the World Security Partnership, a nuclear security promotion group.
Clinton qualified the "the very significant, important stage" agreement carried out by Belarusia.
Obama engaged in Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials over the world in the coming four years.
Since then, the American Government helped six countries to escape all their highly rich uranium.
Belarusia would be the seventh.
A tenth of countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush.
At the Society on Nuclear Security of Obama, the Belarus Chairman Alexandre Loukachenko said that the nation would never revitalize her uranium.
"We have kept highly rigour, hundreds of kilograms of what is mainly the military quality urinium and the lowly enrichi," said Mr. Loukachenko.
"It's our product... We're not going to produce sale bombs, and we're not gonna sell it to anyone."
"We'll use it for search purposes, that's all."
Belarusia has been resolved by the United States for a few months ago; however, the interest to achieve an agreement.
The first implementation to eliminate the uranium of Bielorussia in October was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, indicated officials.
It has been charged on a special train that has spent more than 1 300 miles to a Russian installation to be retained and eliminated.
The second operation has been completed Monday and was carried out by aircraft according to those responsible.
The Government of the United States has paid $13 million in its efforts, largely to replace Bielorussia research installations with low rich uranium; unadapted for weapons.
"A short-term coordination and organization have been implemented in order to strengthen confidence"; and thus conducted the agreement signed by Clinton, Andrew Beniawski, a responsible for the Department of Energy Reduction of the World Manace.
According to the estimates of the Neproliferation Centre James Martin, Bielorussia had at least 88 military ornament books, and hundreds of highly rich ornaments.
Belarusia seeks to eliminate its stocks from this year to 2012, according to a joint declaration.
Relations between Bielorussia and the United States have been held for years, mainly because of the hard repression by Loukachenko of Human Rights.
But the declaration of merchants would suggest a potential renew.
‚ÄúAll of the progress on these global security issues, the United States and Bielorusia recognized that increased respect for democracy and human rights in Belarusia remained essential to improve bilateral relations; and necessary for the progress of the country and its citizens‚Äù, she said.
The Government has not issued any objection to the CIA flights
The Government has not issued any objection to the flights of the CIA with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda in Guantanamo through the Spanish territory, according to a telegram of the United States' Ambassador in Madrid.
This is demonstrated by the filtrate documents by Wikileaks at the daily time El country, which add that the first Vice-President of the Government of this √©poque, Mary Teresa Fern√°ndez de la Vega, asked that the Spanish Executive should be informed to "pouvoir that they had made an appropriate monitoring on foreign airports transiting Spain".
In June 2006, after a European Council ' s report which accused complicity in human rights practices against a thirteen countries, including Spain, held a meeting between the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fern√°ndez of Vega.
The Vice-President recognized that the Council 'retroused the Government of Zapather' and stressed that Spain had nothing to hide.
"De Vega emphasized that Spain has no objection on the flights of understanding over the Spanish territory."
"They want to be informed only" to avoid that they are "about to the disappearance," says Aguirre in a chamber.
The Title of the Ministry of External of this time, Miguel √Ångel Moratinos, reported the Ambassador that the Spanish Executive "hosted to give this case the lower profile, even if it was at the judges' hands, the Government had a limited influence capacity. "
At its tour, in January 2007, the prosecutor Vicente Gonz√°lez transmit to Ambassade the initiative of the judge to request the declassification of the documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on Flights of the CIA.
"Thes reports contain no incriminating elements, no sensitive information," explained the Ambassade after he had spoken with the prosecutor.
The United States have shown their concern for "the appearance of coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for the classified information of CNI or the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complement our efforts to manage the case between Governments," said Aguirre.
In March 2007, during a dinner between the United States Ambassador and the Minister of Interns, Alfredo P√©rez Rubalcaba, he commented that "because the Spanish judges are ill of his independence and will make what they considered appropriate," he gave instructions to his partners "for avoiding comments of a flamed revolutionary, trying to rebase the temperature".
The Ambassador also expressed concern for PP action in this case.
"In spite of its pro-American general guidance, our experience suggests that PP will certainly be part of any indication that the Government of Zapater has removed or deleted the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even though these revealings have negative consequences for the United States Government," reports.

The young girl talked about the child when he was already dead and she had a blog: "Terre to the Gallician"
Monica Juanatey Fern√°ndez is "Muki" in the network.
With this surname she used since she was small, communicated with a cousin and at least a friend; the two origins of Noia, the village of Korea whose origin is.

To hear them, you need to know his feeling life, that ABC has built with the help of his parents‚Äô witnesses.

"When I told him, it was a good thing, but of course, he's aware now of what he's saying to be with the child all the day and has no freedom to do what he wants."
And then she spoke of a mobile message she just received: "I want you to return this month, or you give me a address to send you the child."
She said, "If it don't please him, let him go with my mother, and I'll take it when I come back," adds.
In May, she talks about her back to her village: "Then week I'm going out, but I'll stay there until 19, for the 20th I have to present me to a job position to not lose it."
She explains that if everything was good, she would have taken her older with her.
"There will remain with the right person, that's what I mean, and I will never leave it from my life with another person if this person is not my mother," doubtless, taking into account their bad relationships.
In July, there is another post.
When she was kidnapped, the child, who had come to the island on the 1st month, was supposed to be killed on 10, was dead.

"Terre of Galician (epigraphy). "
The last man who lived with her, vil, explains her regret for feeling guilty.
He doesn't want to think that everything happened because she didn't tell her the fact that she was a clibatary mother.
Monica went to the provincial penitory of Palma, coming from Minorque's court detention centre.
The office lawyer Carlos Maceda explained that she didn't remember how the facts happened, "and she didn't have the desire to do evil to the minor."
Before she had shot Ceser in the bathroom and put her body into a valley.
Defence and prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
Members of the People ' s Party would gain four seats in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9
With the outcomes of the 18-N, the PP could be decided in the municipalities of Laerida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the important increase of votes and deputy-deputys registered in the last autonomy elections, the Catalan PP has already considered the generals, because, even if progress is or not, the perspectives are more positive, as the number of votes that this training has received in these normally double commissions that it receives in the Catalans.
The Catholic populations therefore obtained 610 473 votes to the generals of 2008, while the autonomians of 2006 had received 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC has received 384.091 votes.
If this above tend to be maintained, wishing to disturb the GPC votes and the fixation of the PPP electoral, the analysis of this training calculated that, if it had been general elections, the PPC could past from 8 to 12 members in the Congress, while CiU would also gain four (he was 10) and the PSC would lose nor less than 9 deputates (a 25).
These calculations would find that the catalane place is essential for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the population, ERC would lose a deputy, now it had three - while I could keep a deputy or win a deputy.
But if the electoral agenda remains, the next render would be placed in May 2011 for municipal commissions, where populations can also be decisive at the end of social heremonie in the four provinces capitals and in their relations to the head of the Barcelone Council, one of the administrations that manipulates the highest budget - 661 million euros for 2011.
While nationals such as populations agree with the fact that PSC could lose masters in Barcelona, Tarragona, L√©rida and Gerona, where socialists would not have the majority of their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
In view of the Republican debtor, it would not be amazing that this training lost its representation in the Master of Barcelona, which is necessary to get to 5% of the votes.
The PP has increased its number of votes in the four capitals and could be a decision-making force in Barcelona, L√©rida and Tarragona.
Nationals are convinced that they can be the protagonists of the crime in the capital of Tarragona, where they governed with the PP before the socialist act, Josep F√©lix Ballesteros.
In Brussels, the PP has only registered a difference of 500 votes compared to PSC, including the master, Anngel Ros, maintains very good relations with Mariano Rajoy during the last campaign, they found several times.
People also recorded progress in other important municipalities such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
Today, the PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalogna and seeks to form lists in a maximum local number.
Catalan cell has facilitated thousands of passengers in Al Qaida
Apart from the seven detainees in Barcelona, three were in Thailand.
The seven Pakistani and the Nigerian officers of the Commissioner of the Information Police of Barcelona formed a jihadist cell that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to various groups Al Qaida, including "The Tigres for the Liberation of the Terre Tamil" (LTTE) and "Lascar e Taiba" (Let), the last author of the attacks of Bombay who died 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Interior has given great importance to these investigations in order to ensure that the Kampai operation was "deficiency" the falsification device of Al Qaida at international level and "for example, its operational capacity".
The investigators calculate that the cell, in the two years in which it has been active in Catalogna, could have sent thousands of passengers to Thailand or were falsely faulted and then distributed to the groups who integrate criminal galaxie Al Qaida for its "combaters" to pass through the European borders and other Western countries with an overall impunity.
The demaned cell is the only one that the jihadist network had operative in Europe. This is why, in the investigations, they participated in other European police units, that is why in the European Union could have the following days of similar events to that night in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Palestinian Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Siticahar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Neigerian Fathertude Agunbiad), Tailand has been launched another, with the capture of the Pakistanian Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt and the Tha√Øan Sirikanlaya Kijbung.
They were those directing from Bangkok the cell planted in Spain and in other European countries.
The Catalan Network - whose part was killed in 2009 - mainly flood tourists passports that satisfy the conditions marked by the name "Islamic Mondial Front".
The documents should be on behalf of young men aged between 25 and 45 years, with a validity of several years and without stamped visa.
Researchers stress that until now there were no details found that connected the detainees in Catalogna with the Bombay attent, although the author of this attack, "Laskar e Taiba", was one of the passenger groups flighted in Spain and then falsely in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to recall that a few days before this attack was done from Catalogna, it has been sent through a transfer agency a few thousands of dollars that were "invested" to buy mobile cards used after the integrators of the "commando" who killed 106 people.
Police was engaged in a abundant documentation.
PP requests Mass to suspend tax compliance
The leader of PPC, Alice S√°nchez-Camacho, has had the opportunity to personally express its conditions to support its investment as President of the Generality, identical to those expressed during the campaign, and which is soon to give priority to the recovery of the economy and the lack of philoso-substraintsists as the economic complexity that the national leader wished to the half of its mandate.
The Chairman of the Catholic Populations has been made with Artur Mas with the security that gives 18 members to the elections of the last Sunday, a number more than enough to be loved, because the CU candidate requires at least one of the trainings that will take place in the investment vote.
A possible understanding with the PP depends on the future commitments that nationals want to keep in the Congress during the general elections, but for the time, the conversations which Mas has these days with the rest of political leaders are made in the catalantic key.
And with regard to the President of the PP, to support an investment "he should eliminate all the sovereign and independent talks," and economic complexity - similar to that of the Netherlands - which leader convergence wishes to submit even the referendum.
The two leaders have commonly paid their respect to enlarge the political equipment of a very exaggerated autonomy administration and the elimination of the tax for success and donations.
Details on Mas investment negotiations will take care of PC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
It has already been meeting with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a sustainable opposition - , Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will make it with Joan Puigcercos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laport (Solidaritat Catalana).
The geography claims that the dead have not been doubt with the "many of measures"
The owners of the Olot Centre do not eliminate the possibility that their sickness has killed more than 11 old persons
The leaders of the Geriatric La Caritat d'Olot (Gerona) offered a press conference to highlight the prejudices caused to the institution by the criminal behaviour of Joan Vila Dilm√© who killed at least 11 older persons who were responsible for the worker.
The director of the residence, Joan Sala, submitted by the lawyer of the centre, Joan Ca√±ada and announced that "the desire of La Caritat would be able to execute the accused against the license" for the dead, but "the law and liability are responsible for us to accept the processal situation of civil liabilities".
Apart from the social discretion that the entity can suffer in order to have not detected the criminal activities of the night of the hospital, the great threat for La Caritat now takes the form of an important compensation that legal representatives of the victims are already calculated.
Joan Vila Dilm√© declared that the first crime dated August 2009 and that since that day he had not stopped killing.
The judge mentioned in the sentence that he commanded the exhumation of eight body - the elderly patients in the genital - he was surprising that in many cases no doctor would personally expire the deaths but, given the age and pathology of patients, the formality had been made by telephone.
The Caritat, through his director, refused this situation at home and mentioned that "the lack of measures could not be at any time the cause of what happened."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in this case there is only an indice of imprisonment from any other person who is not accused".
The person who was already baptized as "The Ange of the Death" has announced 11 murderers before, and has detailed that he had committed the first crime on August 29, 2009 and a half month and later killed a second grand-master.
In that case, he caused him death by injecting a overdose of insulin, except for the first crime he had committed with a mix of seditional pastures.
The Director of La Caritat referred to the fact that it was complex to monitor access to medical personnel.
Insulin injections and seed-made cocktail had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes who had an hospital, in his desire to emphasize the suffering of internal persons, used to kill them.
But the laboratory analysis will clarify whether Vila did not say that he was seeking for his first victims a less cruel death or otherwise burned them inside, as he already denied that he did with the three women he killed in Intervalle 12 - 17 October.
The Caritat does not believe the statements of the person of the night, not the number of abused murderers, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number to be greater and justify their attitude by the various versions provided by Vila in its visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logical in the change of way to kill after successfully with eight murderers.
That is why they say that they will remain available to clarify the port of facts.
ECB threat
Industrial investors reacted brushly at the herk of Trichet threat, which prevented that "the markets must not underestimate our reaction capacity".
The differences of the devices closed the force and the actions of the European Banks have exceeded 5%.
However, we do not have to underestimate the ECB's ability to deceive and the euro often recorded an uncertainty, which is a relevant signal.
What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market that is the same way as it goes out, it is recovered but motivated by short and very special closure.
The institutional investor will later lose fear.
A month ago, the ECB has habited us today to take liquidity measures and should be addressed tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those remaining there.
Federal Bank required the finalization of the public purchase plan because of its ineffectiveness and elimination of all extraordinary liquidity measures and only laying unlimited access to the week.
After the Irish crisis, we hope that the current liquidity measures are extended at least until March and kept the sale of quarterly acquirers to illegal access at the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June.
We hope that it will continue with the acquisition programme and that the signs of intensifying it are even given.
If they do not achieve the generated expectations, they will reverse the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue blind to take the liquidity measures, that God help us!
As at their meeting of the month of May, in which they stated that they didn't even consider the purchase of obligations and have collected the markets, the story could be repeated tomorrow.
BCE must be faithful and constant.
In May, he announced the Monday and Monday, he said he had already buyed much, provoing a new efficiency on the market.
It was very poor to buy trafficking for one year in Portugal.
The Treasury has emitted only 500 million to 5,28% compared to 750 million to 4,81% of the previous purchase.
Even so, the types in Portugal have declined 30 basic points in the whole core and clearly reflecting a change of market feelings after Trichet' words.
In Ireland, the figures of Allied and the Bank of Ireland were published.
The estimated figures represent 10 million at short term and 15,000 potential and have a period until February to obtain private capital or will be nationalized.
Even though Ireland has no credibility after not detecting the problem in July with stress testing, the figures are assumed in the Assistant Plan for Assistant.
However, on Tuesday next, the Government should receive the parliamentary approval of its new budget and still have no sufficient support, so Ireland remains in an uncertainty foyer.
Angela Merkel modeled the tone of his talks to leave the tension before the next Summit of State Heads and Government on 14 December in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that demonstrates that we are a unit and that we all interpretate the same partition.
The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the remaining symne of Beethoven's joy.
In Spain, the President had the opportunity to present this plan of action that the Ministers Council will approve on Friday.
Reform of pensions, transparency in autonomous communities and financial entities, deficit reduction, liberalization, privatization, measures to reactivate employment are to investors as Vivaldi's four seasons.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains the fact that Spanish Bourse has risen to 4.5%, the double that remains from the European Bourses.
The reaction of the Government and the Spain Bank has been rapidly and radical and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is a compulsory of a three-year obligation that will be benefited by the Trichet Effect, so we hope that this will be resolved with a strong request and help to disappear the doubts of our refinance capacity.
In order to request a Assistant Plan would be a car-immolation.
They would give us a liquidity line, which we don't need, the Treasury has more than 40 million in liquidity, the triple on March, very sweet types and they're pushing access to free markets.
However, the strategy must continue to be the marriage of Caesar's wife, "of the part of being, to observe it."
Guests, we can get out of it!
The President of Eulen will respond to the Vega Sicilia Council requested by his sons
The temperature does not stop in the open conflict in the √Ålvarez family, owners of Eulen and El Enebro.
David √Ålvarez, founder of the group, will condemn, because he considers the "union of law", the Judicial Council of El Enebro on the next 16th, asked by five of his seven sons in which they will try to deal with their majority and to put off the signing organs of the Society of Bodegas Vega Sicilia.
David Alvarez and his sons, Jesus David and Mary Joseph, gave their legal battery for the new chapter of their bed for the control of a group.
The larger holder of business services for companies seems not to be prepared to be clothed in his bed to be present in the El Enebro directional organs.
It was excluded by five of its seven sons who were appointed administrators at the 18th meeting of the Actionners of the 18 January this year, the complaint was registered in the Trade and Society Registre.
The Judicial Board of El Enebro for the next 16, invited by the Commercial Minister Num√©ro 2 of Madrid, again opened the toner box within the √Ålvarez family.
The provision of the judge to fix the meeting is, until the conflict is solved, the only mechanism that guarantees the convocation of the congregation.
The last movement of John Carlos, Paul, Emilio, Marta and Elvira √Ålvarez Meezquiriz is qualified by David √Ålvarez as a "recoursed from his five sons to try, through a processing argument, clearly frauding the Law and abuse of the law, to validate and correct the radically unlike meeting on 18 January," according to his official ports.
This argument will be the basis that, once the meeting is done, it will be contested in view of the fact that it is "neither of full law".
The same protagonists, who hold a silence discipline, have already tried without successfully that the magistrate conveys a meeting in June.
In El Enebro, a patrimonial and titled society of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, among other activities, the sons of David √Ålvarez, controling 100 per cent of the capital.
However, the funder of the Service Group requires the use of 51% of the capital, according to the family protocols.
This is the question of the basis that the judge must decide after the hearing of the complaint for which no date is not yet reported.
Red Boom triumph in F1 with a secret arm of Siemens
A software creates real time-time improvements.
Since Red Bull entered into the world of Formula 1 in 2004, his story in this electional universe of the speed was marked by the surprise and success.
In the first time, no one had taken into account the options of a new series that had to arrive, despite the overall trajector of the last periods, last November, at the last phase of the campaign they were all born in Ferrari's Ferrari triomphe of Fernando Alonso.
Without wearing the weakness as a campaign pilot, the Alejand Sebastien Vette, no longer the capacity of the Renault motor who propulses his car, in the world of Formula 1 is spoken of the leader of the "sird weapons" which the Multinational Siemens company has put into Red Bull's hands to transform it into a winning team.
In fact, it is a powerful process simulation software that the German company launched on the market in 2007 with very far-related objectives from high motoristic competition.
Named PLM, this powerful computer instrument was used to create mounting chains of the world producers, energy stations, high specification instruments.
The goal is to play, simulate the product or process before the building in a real manner, avoiding the damage and costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of canon photos, Sukhoi airports or most famous useful vehicles in Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, responsible for the industrial division of Siemens, explains that the use of this information instrument in its form 1 use has allowed Red Bull to create and execute "in few hours, almost in real time," changes, changes and improvements detected during courses and tests.
Russwurm explains that the rates of 1992 had a average of 10 technicians in their teams that were capable of introducing a maximum of three or four improvements on vehicles each season.
In the Red Bull team today, 180 young high qualification professionals are working who are equipped with powerful informatic equipment analysing and designing any kind of changes on boundaries.
The Siemens leader explained that the PLM software is capable of analyzing and improved all the elements of the Red Bull boundaries except the engine, which is exclusively responsible for Renault.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamic and security elements are amended.
Changes may have the virtual reality of the simulator to the reality in less than 24 hours through advanced production systems by high-technic and autoclaves.
As an unique limitation of this trail of technology perfection is the amount of $40 million that each team of Formula 1 may exempt as a limit for each season to facilitate competition.
Red Bull has planned the use of high technology to create and produce its boundaries in a locality at 50 kilometers of London.
These are two buildings where visits, especially for journalists, are limited.
Everything that happens there is considered "top secret".
The staff for this debtor account 580 people, including two pilots, Vettel and Mark Webber campaign.
The hero of the Formula 1 of Red Bull, uncertainly, is the recent Sebastian Vetell campsite.
Between the major technical resources that the brand of energy drinks has made the service of participating in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, including the activity is invaluable and notorial.
The Usiness technological director Steve Nevey said that five years ago, it could be stated that R+D progress in course cars were 50% of victories and pilots were responsible for the rest.
Today, these percentages have changed and the technology represents 85 per cent of the success, while pilots provide 15 per cent of the added value.
The Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by the information, because "they are unprevisible gladiators".
HP will install in two years of 20 own stores with local distributors
Hewlett-Packard (HP) entered his first exclusive store in cooperation with Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of the 20 trade network between 80 and 100 square metres that the multinational plans to install in Spain for the next two years.
The company will contain this initiative with the 16 areas already present in multimarque centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Court of English.
The Vice-President of HP  Spain, Helena Herrero, has given, for example, the refunded store situated on the Great V√≠a of Barcelona, Pont Reyes, with which it worked for 30 years.
The North American Group has prepared a plan to impose 200 mark sales points in Europe in 2013, which includes the 20 Spanish institutions.
The first opens were those in Bucarest (Roumanie) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week, the third of Barcelona.
Herrero didn't want to reveal the following possible stores, even though she warned that Madrid could be the following destination.
The HM personal system director has ensured that the philosophy for the implantation of stores will always be the same, with the support of a local distributor with the experience and knowledge of the sector.
The North American group is concerned with the design of the exclusive store engineer (with the products that can be touched in an interactive way), which will be a similar image in Europe.
Furthermore, HP covers the training of the institutions staff.
Helena Herrero refused that it is a franchise system and emphasized that the exclusive trade network provides "to improve the service offers customers and PMS in the purchase, assistance, post-vention and even packing".
Barcelona's magazine includes a space with a global pioneer pioneer pilot program that arise the possible problems of HP information equipment.
A online service connected to a technical centre located in Maastricht (Hollande).
"In addition, in 10 minutes we can solve problems that can often take two days."
"This system is specially designed for MPEs and users, because large companies have already paid technical assistance services," he noted Helena Herrero.
Sabadell shares on the flight of a million clients to its rivers in three years
More optimistic than other leaders, the Delegated Administrator of Banco Sabadell, Jaime Guardiola, thinks that 2011 will be a hard year for the bank sector, but initially rejects a new liquidity crisis and prevents the end of the passive war.
Despite this, it provides an increase in the margins of interests, that it will be tried to compensate partly with the increases of the committees and the credit price.
Sabadell is waiting for capture in three years a million individual customers, his task to carry out.
Sabadell found a way to operate for the three future years and can survive in a very complex economic environment.
In 2011, the Bank will take a new director plan that will hold a three-year-old vacuum.
The objective, rather than to survive without need to restore the public subsidies in FROB, is to gain a market cotton by the caption of a million of new customers - 700,000 if those who could go out of the bank, its great task to carry out, because this bank had been gained more than PMES and private customer companies.
This year he captured 250,000 private customers and 50,000 companies.
The market rate for individuals is 3,5 per cent, while the company exceeds 10 per cent.
Another basis for the 2011-2013 plan is the value of productivity, or the same thing, of extinction, with the reduction of costs as a objective, whose provocations will be reflected by the bank when it presents the results of the biennium.
Many banks are now intended to fix and public objectives, as the financial crisis has degraded all plans of the global bank sector.
Saadell will actually end this year with its Optima Optim plan, has established four years ago, even though the plan was for three years, but the market situation has determined its prolongation for a further period.
The customers who leave to escape the chains will be its main objective.
During a small summer organized by APIE, Guardiola insisted on the fact that 2011 will be "fair and transcendental year".
In fact, the executive believes that the outcome of the crisis in Spain will be slow.
Furthermore, in two or three years, this will be "the very difficult to create job posts", which is essential for the survival of the bank case.
And even if he thinks that the passive war - which penalizes marges - reduces, the price of the risk prices that banks and cash pay for its emissions to get liquidity already delayed at the credit price to compensate marges.
"The aspect of liquidity and financing is structural and will be a credit pressure factor."
"We haven't shot the robinet, but the differences are higher", Acknowledged Guardiola.
Banesto has already given orders to its network to limit long-term credit and to increase the price of the different - see Cincodaries from 22 and 27 November -.
He also stated that the trend of the bank sector now "he is to increase Commissions", but "a competitive framework."
The Saadell director plan is based on organic growth even if, as always, the group does not eliminate the possibility of achievement of corporate operations.
It is not vain that it ensures that in Spain "we will ask greater sizes."
"All will move the next year," he assured.
It states that the needs of capital "augmentable" and some Spanish financial entity could enter into red numbers.
And it mentions that the FROB can replace the market in the capital of funds in the case of new recapitalizations.
After assuring that Saadell can survive the timely closure of the market, he reduced the importance of the fact that some bankers already predict as a new liquidity crisis.
It notes that it can't be issued, but in contrast to what happened in June, short-term financing can be obtained through the rest of the crisis.
ECSC rejects the possibility of a second vague of fusions between the chains
The Director-General of CECA, Jos√© Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected the possibility of a new vague of disappearance fusions and reiterated the speed with the restructuring of the sector.
When the Spanish concentration process started, there were several entities who assured that they would not be involved in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase.
Nevertheless, the Director-General of the Spanish Confederation of Epargnes (CECA), Jos√© Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected the possibility of production of this new vague of operations.
"I think that the largest part of the fusion has been done, it cannot be said that Cajasol's integration in the Banca C√≠vica group is a second phase, which is amendments."
"The most have been completely done; it is possible that, instead of 17 to 13 or 14, but all the major processes have already been made under the scope of the Spanish Bank, which has also cooperated many in this operation," said the leader.
In statements during a small meeting of the Arag√≥n Diputants Association (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the concentration process was achieved " to the highest possible, and we must be very satisfied in how it was achieved within the past periods set, not now, in business plans with the Spanish Bank," he understood.
"The transition of 45 falls with a average of 28.500 million assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a fair procedure in the history, reducing the number of entities by 62% in order to be much larger to be complied with B√¢le," said he.
Olavarrieta recognized that "a series of thoughts are quite happy on the reader of the process" which demonstrate "sound of severity and sense," because "the bank of Spain has been recalled to respect the time before the end of the year."
The Director-General of CECA, Jos√© Antonio Olavarrieta, assured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system of all Europe and "probably" of the world and assigned people who doubtly put them a "mean of knowledge".
The manager mentioned that as given the current economic conjoncture, "we can stay very quiet" with the situation of financial entities and disappearances, a system which started a "really important" concentration process and "a greater speed."
He also recalled that the Spanish banking sector has been well-bearing stress tests made by the ECB in July.
German Zapater and the German red line
Berlin was opting to stay in the euro, but has established the conditions for all the Union.
The market tensions caused a double government response.
On the one hand, Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatter announced new methods of correction, which vary of fiscal reductions for the SMEs, regulation of the private place or removal of 426 euros for unemployed workers without aid to privatization of 49% of AENA, Barajas airport management and El Prat and 30% of the State Localis.
On the other hand, Vice-President Elena Salgado, with the support of the former President Felipe Gonz√°lez, along with the criticians of Angela Merkel in terms of its responsibility to detain the current crisis.
How should these movements interpretation?
Merkel's position is not an error in its communication policy.
In contrast, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefinition of the euro.
And here Germany has a radically new vision of what must be its future, which has to maintain the former traditions of most of its partners.
In response to European resistance, Germany is starting to split on the three possible outcomes of the crisis.
The first, a strong euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among other countries, and south would leave the monetary zone.
The second, the recovery of the Mark, even if now it seems to be a fiction science, with a very favourable way of view, approximately 50% of the population.
Third, a new concept of the euro, online with the German proposals for a greater macro-economic control, budgetary rich, amendments to the countries that offend them, possible suspension of payments from one of them and extension to the private sector of potential adjustment costs.
The German position is clear and it's a long time that it's defined, so now there is no place for excuses.
First, in 2009, when both FMI and the European Commission promoted deficits, the German Government had introduced a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first sign of divergence between Germany thought that we had to do (budgetary and stability of public finance plans) and what his European partners, including France, were practicing.
The second case of the Central European country was when Merkel has difficultly extended the decision to save Greece.
From that time, it has made a fair crisis, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the publication were contrary to Greece.
Finally, at the end of October, Merkel again expresses a clear position, requesting the reform of the Union's treaties to make possible the resolve of a country and to support private suppliers at the same time.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, because it has disappeared the Irish crisis and the rest.
But his proposal, although a little enhanced, was approved and the next months we should assist the Union reform process which makes these measures from 2013.
Germany took a red line that she doesn't think to believe.
And she said to us all that, even if we now have to take measures with which the euro can not be too much agreed, since that date, the ancient function of the euro would have ended.
2013 will mean the birth of a new currency area where the countries in which the rules will be seriously sanctified, they may be obliged to assigne payment census and, in this case, the private sector will also support a part of costs.
Germany reports us that we need to follow a severe growth path with high rates of petrol and investment, consumption moderation, improvement in productivity and competitiveness and outdoor wages.
An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge gaps in the payments balance, such as the Spanish growth in the years of wood, will not only be tolerated.
It's clear.
And it would be bad to not hear him.
It is not only to reduce public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What we ask is much harder.
And what he doesn't absolutely do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves.
I hope that the current turbulences will come to us a greater calm.
And that we know to get the opportunity we have given until the spring of 2013.
It seems that the President Zapatter also heard it of this form and its double statement (the promised reforms after the Saturday meeting with the large enterprises and the advertisement of new measures) suggests that, despite Merkel's criticians, the path to the th√®ses needed to be ordered to the house.
But the red line that Germany has moved is there, and they don't seem to move it.
And among the possibilities that we are considered, it cannot be excluded to leave a too much currency currency of little serious countries.
And in that case, Germany can always tell us that she had warned us.
Sports and fraud of law
The Russians similar to Alonso and Ramos against Ajax demonstrated ingenousity but not the will of escape a sanction.
The exhibition in principle by two players of Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) during the match of 23 November against Ajax in the Champions Legue has made a lot of decline on the anti-portal character of such behaviour and if the two players should be sanctified by the EUFA.
As you know, a few minutes before the end of the game (as their team already wins clearly), the two players have lost time when they have done crimes to determine the arbitre to show them the second jaune card.
Thus, and seeing Real Madrid will end by being leader of his group, the two players will complete the regulatory sanction during the next match of the Bargage match against Asuerre and will be able to pass without cartons to the next phase.
Finally, the EUFA discipline Committee has sanctified with two matches the team training team, Jos√© Mourinho and different economic wages to players.
The provocation of a yellow carton in circumstances such as that or similar is not a new practice, but rather frequently in the football world.
It is so spread that it is part of the etos, not written rules, but followed by this sport.
A part of the discussion appeared in the reported case must be made in fact that it had a team of Real Madrid's entity (which in his hymne shows the nobleness and honor, and that in past occasions he condemned a amendment to his players for similar acts) and orchestrated dramatization, seems to be, by Mourinho, who adds an episode more to his history of historical and provocatory technicians.
In any case, the discussion asks whether this type of behaviour does not expressly prohibite the principles of the sport, i.e. if with such actions is committed a law-fraud, because they are indeed respected to the sport regulation but seem to be elected.
The question is to consider the type of prejudice they cause a sports spirit.
One of the goods that understand the spirit of sports is the physical integrity of opposite players, a aspect that with these actions has not been undermined, i.e. there has been no violent game.
Another of these goods to which we are bound with the correct game is to avoid that the team of infractor players benefits in an injust way of the team, which is not the case anymore.
However, the paradoxal fact of the action of the Real Madrid players is that it is not acknowledged that normally characterised as trigger or fraude of the law because its violation of the rules had not been made in hidden to try to avoid sanction, but their action was precisely tried to be the most clear possible to receipt the criminalization of the arbitration.
They waited and accepted the sanction.
Another question is the type of advantage that the infractors have obtained the intented offences.
There it seems to be necessary to find that the disagreement situation is not in a rival gap and there is no benefit in the same game, because the result of the action is obviously supposed to leave their own team with less players.
And this is not an useful strategy for the next game, because the club could not count on these players.
Of course, the benefit is that the players will begin the next phase of the Champion Ligue without cartons that could threaten their participation to a future match.
But this is a long-term benefit, with a certain level of indefinition, because the team could be eliminated at the moment and, on the basis of this action, players perform a sanction match and adapt to the second carton cycle, in which the suspension is due to the accumulation of cartons has occurred with one less than the first cycle.
So, seriously, it's not so clear that it's a benefit.
Finally, these actions are not contrary to the sports spirit, which even part of the taking strategic decisions that promote the maximum benefit of the rules.
In our case, the players have not acted to avoid the application of the sanction (these would be in fact a clear case of fraude of law), but have chosen rather the time they were submitted to it.
They took a strategic decision without disappearing penalty or to escape this.
Even though the border between Geneva and the offence of the law is diffused, I think in this occasion there was a clear case of gentleman.
The polemic seems to me to appear because of two factors: for there were two self-exhibitions and in the way to transmit the directive to prove them.
The evil caused to the principles of the sport by these actions is not so ethical as ethical.
Offers of offers to catch Christmas dinners for groups in BCN
The calendar dictator concentrates this year a reservations record for the 16 and 17 days.
There is a proliferation of employees who want to expenditure between 20 and 30 euros.
Like the tour and the lottery, when December comes to dinners from groups before the Christmas who continue to be the oxygen ballon for restaurants and divertement of Barcelona, but because of the crisis, they have delayed your prices in a offensive offensive in order to capture the majority client: almost everyone wants to spend between 20 and 30 euros to dinner or feeding, co-fined the men of business and associations of the interviewed sector.
To complete the accountability, the calendar of this year (as the night of Saint Sylvestre tombe to vendredi) focused on the requests in the week of 13 December, with a result of a dinner reserves for pic days (17 and 17) and almost nothing in the previous week.
Since 2008, which is the origin of difficult time, there are many companies who eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
To maintain the tradition, many employees organize them by paying their own pockets.
Whatever the conjonction is, they ask all battle prices, confirms the President of Gremi de Restaurated Barcelona, Gazze Farr√°s.
The representative of the patron is now not intended to predict how the feasts will be in this month.
"The people think a lot before booking."
"They want to go out but they pay a lot of attention to prices," mentions he.
The case will be well "for those who give good price quality and with a good service," adds, and recalls that customers have the tend to go down a skill with the crisis, so that the tranche around 25 euros has become majority in the request.
In a sondage in various institutions of the centre, the 17th meeting of requests is found for the night.
The Soteras Group indicates that there is an authentic boom of requests for this Friday, with the precaution of paying less than 30 euros, which they have responded by adapting their menus to the conjonction, with comprehensive formulas from 25 to 35 euros.
In the case of another group of the most powerful, Andilana, with 16 buildings in the city (Hostal de Rita, Market, La Funda and others), the calendar speciality had made more pre-reservations, even since the beginning of the month of November.
"We have done the impossible to maintain the same prices in the past year, with menus for all the goals from 19.95 to 30 euros," detailed.
AN Group, which includes El Mussol, Attic, Qu and a total of 23 places, will be optimistic after deterioration of the factory since the second semestre and good, although income, business perspectives for Christmas.
The group's sources mention that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day at the level of friend groups that celebrate feasts.
In their six group menus, they added one for the Christmas, with 30 euros or more as a famous budget, as well as a predisposition to pay 10% more than the past year in place of exhibition more details, such as the catalan wine produced according to the campaign method - Cava.
They also see the first signs of improvement in certain companies call for their employees again and the sensation that the volume of groups has increased a little bit.
From the patronate Fecasarm (including entities such as the Bars Association, Restaurants and Divertisement of Barcelona), its Vice-President, Enric Goma, trusts the possibility of starting to see the end of the tunnel and supports that the reservations are "animated", even though the customers "need to the maximum".
This is true, hope of festivals has not lowered, unfortunately of which it pays.
The Pakistanic Nuclear Programme generates a great concern to the United States
Islambad produces atomic arms to "a faster ritm than any other country".
Wikileaks' Filters confirm the connection between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The content of the correspondance between the American Ambassade of Pakistan and the Department of the United States filtered by the Wikileaks portfolio confirms the huge concerns caused by Washington by the Pakistan nuclear programme.
Apart from the clear and savourable details of the content of conversations and thoughts of the North American diplomatic representatives in Islambad, the documents reveal that cooperation between the two countries in the field of atomic security, in place of increase, "decreased" and that the instability of Asian country produces nuclear weapons " to a faster ritm than any other country of the world."
The particularity of the Pakistanic Nuclear Programme - the fact that weapons are not meetings, but they are emagasined by components to make their destruction difficult in an attractive case - is one of the main reasons for issues in Washington.
This is how the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, reported in a report before visiting the former National Security Advisory Council, James Jones: "The nearness of certain nuclear installations in the territory under attacking Taliban, the dispersion of nuclear materials, the short voice and the vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials".
The large number of people involved in nuclear arsenals and missiles programs is considered not only by the United States but also by Russia, such as proliferating and a reason to maintain maintenance.
"Pakistan has a deployment of staff with religious croyans to protect nuclear installations; given the decrease of educational and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people working in nuclear or missiles programmes" said the expert Yuri Corolev, the Russian Ministry of Externals during a meeting with its American homologgues.
The new documentation filtered by the portal of Julian Assange is the more reduced cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the elimination of the Pakistan ' s production of nuclear weapons.
A surrounding of the Ambassade in May, which qualifies as "fructing" communication with Pakistan, supports what follows: "Transparence is often unutilised; help offerings remain without response or are eliminated."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, National Intelligence Officer for South Asia, notes that "in spite of the economic disaster, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons to a faster reflume than any other countries in the world."
Ambassador Patterson also requests Washington, during a visit by the Chief of Armies, General Ashfaq Kayani, that he must understand "really clear" to the responsibility that "la Army of Pakistan must end with support to terrorist groups."
At the drive of the Chief Wikileaks
Obama will number a high response for anti-terrorist fight to avoid new infiltrations.
Interpol issues a red warning to follow movements and place in Assange.
All aspects related to Wikileaks and his founder, Julian Assange, form a complex labyrinthe where it is difficult to have a security of the facts.
This Interpol has issued a "rood warning" to "localize and follow the movements" of Asang.
However, it is not a traditional warning order.
Furthermore, this is not new, but on date of 20 November.
And this has nothing to see with the last filtering of more than four million diplomatic documents in the United States but with the accused of sexual abuse than Australia in Sweden.
Furthermore, the lawyer of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, ensure that "the police knows where and how to contact Mr Assange."
The 20 of the international police body with the sediment of Lyon (France) stated the order to request Sweden, but did not open it until yesterday, after receiving the authorisation of the authorities of that country.
Therefore, the 188 countries of Interpol have received the indication of identifiing or placed Assange 'for obtaining its provisional arrest and extradition'.
Even though Interpol is not able to give the order of arrestation of a person affected by a red warning, many of the Member States, according to the explications of the organization, consider red calls a free way for arrestation -- that the national police body must realize - especially if they have a bilateral extradition agreement, as is the case of Sweden and England, where it is thinking that Assange is found.
The movement has been identified to the lawyers of Asange, who have published a letter hereby demonstrating the fact that the founder of Wikileaks, 39 years old, was provided to answer by video conference to the matters of the Swedish authorities.
They also recall that Assange asked and obtained the permission to exit from Sweden from his case, which was compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria Chief of Stalin Security.
"This seems to be a escape, not a legal persecution," denotes the missive.
During the world seeks him - and in Australia his mother defends his son's immorality -- Asange continues to be found in a unknown place, but it doesn't stand.
On Monday, he granted an interview to the Director of the Time Review through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the secretariat of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it is possible to demonstrate that it was responsible for paying orders to the American diplomates that they are victimed to the United Nations by violating the international treaties signed by the United States, it should deliver," said.
His opinion was reproached yesterday by the secretariat of the Cason-Blanche, Robert Gibbs, who qualified as "related and absurd" the request for delimitation.
"I'm not sure why the opinion of a type with a web page should interest us," said he for the CNN.
Obham himself charged a high response for anti-terrorist fight, Rusell Travers, to prevent new document flights.
The test of President Barack Obama to reduce the importance of Assange is contrary to the views that the conservators and comments have proclaimed these days.
Peter King, the Congress that from January the National Security Committee in the Basse Chamber requested the Department of State to study the possibility of integration of Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations " to confid its funds and to continue any person who would provide their contributions or assistance."
Again, Tom Flanagan, a consultant of the Canadian President Stephen Harper, who had to return to his statements after he said that Asange should be killed.
"Obama should transform it in goal and use a no-equipage airport or something similar."
A person who didn't ask for excuses was Mike Huckabee, Minister of Baptists, former Governor of Armenia and possible candidate to the Presidency.
"Whoever is present in the Government who has filtered information is guilty of trafficking, and whatever is not executive would be a too nice punishment," said he for Fox.
Pugcercos seeks peace in ERC with eye clips to Carod added
The Republical leader will allow the party a secret vote on its continuity.
Huguet proposes a more special executive and the end of the meeting system.
Joan Puigcerc√≥s seems to have found the receipt to solve the last internal revolution in the ERC, without northern because of the loss of 11 deputy members and half of the votes.
The Chairman of the Party is aware of the fact that his demission threat is not sufficient for the adoptions of the former leader Josep Llu√≠s Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now also diluted as his liar and that it cannot absolutely give him heads that he had with other ethnic currents.
That's why the leader of Escherra will try to win its new critics with eye clips that allows him to blind up to the municipal elections.
In order to start, Puigcerc√≥s announced that more than 200 national advisers of ERC may be able to speak on his continuity secretly.
By vote bulletins, not by the hand.
If the carodists want to make a certain vote of criminalization to the President, they will be able to do it without fear to republics.
In fact, the chief of lines wants to avoid the image of division and submission to his person.
In several interviews, he stated that he would not be ratified with the half one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result would not be good.
People close to Carod require the President a little more than put its position on war, a man who does not mean when Puigcercos control the most organ between the congress.
But because they don't have sufficient majority for demissions, they will try to accept a road sheet with the executive until May.
For this reason, they hope to participate in the preparation of the strategic reorientation document that the direction will submit to the vote of the National Council on 18.
His intention is to assist Puigcercos in exchange of the promise of that to programme the congress for the autumn 2011, which the leaders consider as a safe fact.
The leader of the ERC acknowledged that ‚Äúpolyphonia‚Äù affects stability and that its objective is to make that all the organization can be washing his family line.
In this line, the article that the active adviser Josep Huguet signed in his symptomic blog.
In view of the idea of Pugcercos, the titleman of Innovated thought that the fact that the leader will be ratified "in exchange of various objectives" is as if it was done.
And he numbered it five, and he pointed two.
The first, "recompose" the executive to represent at least 90% of the war, i.e., include new figures from the adoption of the Carod sector.
The second may be the big new character.
Huguet suggests that the ERC is once liquid for all the meeting as a functional mechanism.
It therefore defends a reform of the status that allows congress to achieve through delegates elected by satisfactory.
To end with the congress model, an exception in the Spanish party system was an obsession of the Puigcercos team, which already played in this sense in the last two congress.
In fact, the 2008 convulsive convulsion has been responsible for revising the congress model in a specific status reform congress.
The meeting remains inchecked, since the internal marty over the past years did not recommend the subject.
Now, without critical sectors in August, the time could be good to repair it and close it forever.

China maintains the objectives of reducing smooth gas
The representative of that country in the COP16 assured that its country had made huge efforts to reduce the carbon traffic and has detailed that it had maintained its offer to reduce the emissions of serre gas until 2020 between 40 and 45 per cent.
China maintains its offer to reduce 40-45 per cent of its gas emissions in effect before 2020, and has assured Su Wei, representative of that country to the COP16.
In its first public appearance at the 16th United Nations Framework Convention Conference (COP16), his Wei assured that his country has made huge efforts to reduce the carbon traffic and renew its industry.
In fact, he expressed that the last four years of its country had invested $245 million in efforts to reduce the emission of smoke gases.
However, it was clear that China will not change its objectives but will continue to work together with the international community in this area.
It noted that Chinese climate change strategy was divided in four areas: dialogue; capacity-building; construction of institutions and support for pilot programmes.
It has been recorded progress in all these areas, including the approval, the past year, of a new Energy Law, which recognizes the objectives addressed in respect of the reduction of serre gases, explicitly.
On the other hand, he emphasized that, in China, federal authorities have worked in a coordinated way with Governments and local authorities to achieve energy supply objectives, effective energy use and reduction of emissions.
Furthermore, it stated that there are various multi-annual plans that are currently undertaken, both funded by the Chinese government and by the Governments of other countries.
For example, the Energy Efficient Programme has been implemented for the past five years and received investment from the United Nations (United Nations), the Government and the private initiative.
There is also a provincial climate change project, another for the change of incannance lamps by economic lights and another attempt and adaptation, has been detailed.
At the same table, Martin Krol, scientific adviser of the Government of this country in terms of climate change, assured that China's efforts were greater than they think.
For example, he expressed that the emission per chain of gas effect in China is three tonnes per person, while in the United States it is 100 tonnes; China is responsible for 9 per cent of the historic contribution in pollution.
In the past five years, it has also made unprecedented efforts in the use of energy, how to increase 20% energy efficiency in the past five years and intended to make another similar to 2020.
Justic Exhibition of Espino: Ceesar Nava
The National Director of the PAN informed that the former Panist leader had the right to refer to the National Order Commission to explain what is right.
The National Leader of PAN C√©sar Nava V√°zquez assured that the exhibition of Manuel Espino Barrientos was legal and that the former panist leader had the right to address the National Order Commission to explain what is right.
In the previous interview of the Protect of Gabino Cu√© Monteagudo, he said that the Exemption of Espino is a decision adopted at the local level.
"There is an autonom decision of the Commission of Order de Sonra."
"Mr. Espino has the right to address himself, in the case where it is, by making an appeal to the National Council Order Commission, so that it is a decision taken within a competent body," he noted.
On the other hand, he explained that it was not time to think about 2012 and there was never on the presidential candidature table to negotiate a covenant.
Nava V√°zquez said that national action would be stronger after the internal elections of the next 4 and 5 December where a successor should be chosen.
"This (un Union in 2012) is an aspect that has never been on the negotiations table at least for the time, at least a approach to the local elections which had been successful and reached its objective," mentioned it.
The Panist manager mentioned that PAN was supported by 71 years of dialogue, because "the internal competition does not fear us; otherwise, "We will save it and make us stronger", said he.
He said that the advice could be able to eliminate the best leader/and whose National Action needed for the next three years, so he would give the "to the person determined by the Council."
"I'm completely quiet and open, I'll be proud of leave the Chairman of the Party at any five."
He proposed that the report recorded by the Party to the elections past 4 July will be reflected in the next debate, even if "is still not the time to think in 2012."
"To the moment it is to acquire the Governor Gabino Cu√© in this task."
In this context, he emphasized that the three Governments who commit up commitments in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the drap and will be a reason for observation in all the country, so that "beauty of hopes in respect of them, and I am sure that Gabino will be on the height of expectations."
When the PRI's criticians were requested against President Felipe Calder√≥n because of his talks in his four years of government, Ceesar Nava asked the princes to consider the six years of the former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas of Gortari.
"If the PRI believes that the Zedillo and Salinas Governments were better than Fox y Calder√≥n; they start to defend them; they're out of 'armour'," he said.
He stated that the Title of the Federal Executor could make expressions like those he did in his speakers in the National Audit, because there is no basket in the country, and less than censure.
Obama promised in Twitter the law for students without papers
"If you are agreed with the approval of the Dream Act, call your Senators and ask them to approve this legislation," said the American President in the social network.
The President Barack Obama today joined the national mobilisation to support the Dream Act, to legitimate students without papers, with a message in its account of the Twitter social network.
"If you are agreed with the approval of the Dream Act, call your Senators and ask them to approve this legislation," said Twitt√© Obama.
His short message maintains a cybernate link with an example of document that requests the public to contact Senators immediately because the vote to legislation is imminent.
"Before a vote that we are hoped soon, now it's time to listen to your voice," said he.
The message was informed after 42 republic seminars have not been banned by the vote of any legislation if the extension of the tax reductions in the Bush time and the financing of the Government is extended.
An such blocking, announced in a letter signed by 42 Republical Senators, could affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Question on the Republical Blocking of the Law Dream Act and other projects, the President-president Robert Gibbs said that it was sure that once the fiscal problem was solved, it could be set up an addendum for the rest of the projects.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"We all agree that this fiscal problem must be solved before the end of the year..."
"I think we can get an agreement at a time given in this sense and then we can plan the sequence of the rest," said he.
The leader of the Democratic Most Democracy of Senate, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that he would ask a "club of debate" for the Law Dream Act, why the initiative to legitimate students without papers could be voted from the next Thursday in the Senate, even if the most likely would be the next week.
The Seatory version of the Dream Act or the American R√∂ve Act would legally be 800,000 young people who have come to the United States before the age of 16 years, remained in that country and were accepted by a higher education institution or by the Army.
However, the parties need 60 votes to approve the initiative, because they need the support of a large number of republics, in the times where the participating organizations of the project protagonist are a intense lobby to ensure the approval of the Law.
Democrats, most of which support the Dream Act, have 58 places.
However, at least one of them, Senator Ben Nelson de Nebraska said that he would vote against and only a Republic expressed its support for the law, Richard Location of Indiana.
That is why the parties of the Dream Act require the vote of several republics if other democratics decided to vote against the initiative.
Among the most shortest republics there are Senators Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, and Senator from George Lemieux, Floride, who complemented his mandate Senator Mel Mart√≠nez.
Other republics who supported the Dream Act are Orrin Hatch, Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson, Texas, but they said they were not going to take it in another occasion.
Another republic who supported her, John McCain, has not defined its post until now.
Even though the Representative Chamber has a different version, the analysis agree with the fact that the greatest obstacles of the Dream Act are in the Senate.
With the literatures on put the finger on the beach
The second stage of the Language Plastics was a promenade in which the participants made the narration.
"The sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the plate? What do you hope of me?" he asked the Luisa Valenzuela invited to open the second stage of the places of the language, a cycle that explains the literature in Spanish and that this time has used the subtitle of his question (and another round table was divided in the Sexe, she explained).
The finger on the plate"...We put into the ebarras," he slowly started the Argentinan writer to the public, most of the young people who were meeting at the International Livre of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this table modeled by Marisol Shultz and participated in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramirez, Mayra Montero and Luis Garc√≠a Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela read a delegated text in Gonzalo Celorio, which Shultz has defined after a great history, with Luisa in the first person as protagonist who seeks to know what is the "plaie", she goes from a doctor to another, without getting an answer, only tracks in the same narrative filter.
From infectiologist she is convicted: "The patience is not my strong, it may be my plague."
At the end, after a fruitful approach with the traumatologe who cut him the soup in the middle of the shoes, but he explains that it is not a scientific term; it is the psychanolyst reveals the mystery: "The plague is what is open in reality, the symbol is the cicator."
The suspect protagonist concluded and concluded: "I only could know that it is open in reality and that it does not exist", but convinces that the pleasure and the Language's paths must be very linked among them.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with the two.
Nicaraguayen Sergio Ramirez also expressed a referendum that he had called The introduction, where the finger on the plague is not appointed but in a given time is discovered.
With the touchs of magic realm, he talked about an ensorcellaneous famine that touched clouds, he made return to people who had gone away or revealed the verses that a damsel had lost, a narration that came to speak then to America, the great news which had since the beginning of his own chronics and quoted in Bernal Dayz of Castillo, which critically the exchange of the accounts of the concurrent capitals.
"The one who discovered us all (the writers) caused false witnesses that appeared in the stories presented as real, but in a fair way we would never tell the history of America with a imagination that had even missing the pudeur."
However, he emphasized, "the foss and mentors have the best imagination" and here the reality converts with the lies, no longer knows what part of the narration belongs to a band or another, where the fiction literature reached its support.
It is called the 'tradition of Cervantes'.
"It's thanks to his heritage that we're telling it."
At its tour, the writer Mayra Montyero announced and applaudiated the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the FIL with its round table The need to be on the beach.
Cuban-Portrica has focused on the great street of social violence through its country, and Latin America, which produces disputes on trafficking and drug sale.
"I think the good literature, the good position of the good songs refer to a taste commitment that is not certainly preceding," she said, after circling that the reality of the literature is the communication and the size of the commitment between the author and the readers, and that it is a "chimical reaction" of this last.
The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis Garc√≠a Montero, which also stressed " that must be on the street of the binding script".
He considered that in a world that lives in great speed as well as in respect of intellectual customs and the control of consciences which turn to the advantage of dogmams, "after each claim there is a small non-empty and behind each negative. "
"To be the masters of our own feelings and to be the masters of the reality, we have to be naked: and we‚Äôre a lot of times to throw the finger on the beach and to degrade the people who feel very excited by thinking in caricature, white and black, in ideas established and without nothing and also disgusting the powers that predict a white and black world," he said, invited to get the sense of writing.
Roman to escape his first title
Rub√©n Omar Romano had three defects in the ends, he had high and lowers in his card, but he reached three times the decisionary series.
With the dual of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the end, there are more two different styles that compare, marked by their technicians, which find a contrast marked by the results.
Rub√©n Omar Romano had three defects in the ends, he had high and lowers in his card, but he has reached three times the decisive series, even though he hasn't put in the thousands until now, and that's why this opportunity is very special for him.
Argentin ended with the sub-campion medal, it left a step behind the winners and carefully with the same team he played consequenceful ends.
The sanitary street occurred at its first end as along in the Openture Tour 2002 Tour, when he had the royal of Morelia, with which he lost a global result of 4-2 to Toluca; later, in the 2003 Cl√¥ture, it was also the two-decisive decision and again lost the result of 3-1 and it was specifically against Rayados.
With Santos Laguna already, in the Bine Tower 2010 again against the Diabetlos, Rub√©n undertake a reverse, because his team has made an equal match of 2-2 to the Choriceros after 210 minutes of game, but in the series of penalties he obtained a benefit for 3-1 with two opportunities to obtain the title and finally three of his players have disappeared from 11 metres and he understood the result of 4-3.
Rub√©n has lost two ends with the Royal Diablos and one with Monterrey, his rival to the tournoi, so he does not want to have the same way, he tries to detain the malicious to celebrate for the first time a title, even if he claims that the institution is more important for him.
"I want to be a campaign, I don't want to break any statistics, it's for a club, not for a passion that I have, and therefore I'll get the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," said the timonier when it was asked for what would be its low points in the ends.
It remembers many of the last end, of which he has learned many, "the only learning we can retain is until the arbitre isn't easy the end, we can't celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players also, for the last time, with two penalties to move us already prepared to run and I think that this is a lesson, before the end of the game, we can't feast."
He knows that this series could be defined by criminalities, which does not worry about it, because he trusts to his players: "We never seek to come to the series of penalties, we are trying to end in regular terms, but sometimes it remains us to prepare, the previous tour we have been prepared, unfortunately the destiny made us a bad tour, sometimes are the emotions or anger to hold the title between our hands, he has escaped us, it has served us as the lack for this end, and we hope that we have no longer arrived in this situation."
Romano now has an opportunity to be a sub-campion technicians and to enjoy for the first time the glory offered by the titles.

NASA announces the discovery of foreign life
The United States Space Agency focused on the press to submit a discovery tomorrow, which will have the impact on the search for living in space.
The National Aviation and Space Administration (NASA) of the United States will communicate tomorrow, Thursday, a astrobiological discovery, which could prove the theory of the existence of extraterrestress life.
The discovery will be presented in a press conference on Thursday, at 13:00 a.m. in the NASA seat in Washington for astrobiology experts, science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future life in the United States.
The NASA assured that it would have an impact on the research of foreign life, which has resulted in specifications from the part of experts from other countries.
The discovery could demonstrate the theory that there are similar creatures to us and in hostile ambitions that the inhabitants thought and put on the table the possibility to become intelligents like humans if his life conditions are improved.
It seems that we are talking about a microbee discovered from the foundation of Mono Lake in the National Yosamite Park, California, who lived in an ambiguant that it was too nice for any form of life, because the milk is rich in arsenic.
In any way, creature uses arsenic as a way to live, and this capacity makes us think that a similar life could exist on other planetes that do not have our well-being atmosphere.
According to the astrobiologicalists, if these organizations use arsenic in their metabolism, it proves that "other form of life, a second form of life, different than what we know."
The Space Agency will communicate the true port of discoveries in the morning press conference, Thursday.
At the conference, Pamela Conrad will participate in the geobiology, which studies the possibility of life on Mars; and the biologist Steven Benner, one of the scientists studied by Titan (the largest satellite of Saturne), under the view that his chemical is similar to the earth.
PRD, PT, Convergence and Blood
With reforms to the Congress Organizational Law, it is possible to reach the "bipartism", deno-t-on.
The 60th was to be installed when in the Congress had an opposing block directed by PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patr√≥n Montalvo, who had declared independently, and the four were asking something: the arrival of the "bipartism" in the Chambers.
Before the 60th Legislation session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodr√≠guez, of Convergence; Ezekiel Reynoso Esparza, of PT; Javier Corvera Quevedo, of PRD; and Patr√≥n Montalvo, 'took' against the reform of the Organic Law, because it excluded them,
With this reform, they reiterated the "bipartism" for now there are two people, in the same number of parties, who control the Congress.
These four deputys, at the coast of Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, Coordinator of PRD, were the only to vote against the Director of the Slovaquia Laopez Brito and Luis Antonio C√°rdenas Fonseca, Vice-President.
Corvera Quevedo mentioned that with these institutional reforms the political marginality of the PRI and PAN.
He pointed out that the next days they would speak to the representatives of the PAN and PRI to amend the scheme by taking part of a political will and if they do not, they will again be assisted by the two parties and so will end the opposite coalition.
"Again, it has happened (opposing coalition), that's what I look, because we are excluded from any decision, they have not even the political concept to consider the opinion of the rest."
Phillipe Manzanarez Rodr√≠guez mentioned that with PRD, PT and Patr√≥n, there are coincidences and that is why they strengthen a multi-group.
We can't let him continue, that the Congress, after being monopolistic or now "duopolistics".
"This is not the spirit of the reform of the law there is a eternal biparty in the Congress."
In order to start, this group starts with 5 legislators and now speaks with other colleagues to be more than many, the Convergent has increased.
Ezekiel Reynoso Esparza, from PT, explained that the Congress now transformed into a "butin" between two, encouraging PAN and PRI.
"Only there was only a party, now they divided it between two."
Pat√≥n Montalvo asked for respecting the personality of the deputy to give him his place to the negotiations tables.
"There are not leaved by collective agreements outside 5 which will probably be 9 deputys now that we see, separated in different fractions, we decided to join us to find a place in the negotiations table, that is the problem that in the reform they did, they decided, we are outside and we are not agreed with this reform."
$200 million more for "favourable"
The Marie de Mazatlan pays another cheque to the ownership of the electric equipment company.
Another cheque of about 200 billion weights for Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the Mairie.
With this, the amount paid to the second half of the owner of the electrical equipment company is approximately 1.2000,000 weights.
According to the Municipe transparency page, the last cheque number 9258447 was issued on 16 November for the amount of 200 000 144.56 weights in the concept of "liquidation of account providers".
The treasure Luis Miguel L√≥pez Moreno said that the Common would pay other amounts to this provider, which was observed by the Sup√©rieur Auditor of the State to sell to a higher price.
What we have not reported is the total debt, and therefore, how many cheques will still be issued for Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing has bought, it's just paying him what we need to, like the rest of the providers," he said in an interview.
The last cheques have "recovered" the last quarter of the year: 24 September, two of the October 15, 19 of October, 29 of October and the last of November 16.
Even though the provider has not yet published in the Official Journal of the State, in accordance with the previsions of the Act, where a company is provided by ASE, to avoid that other Governments use their services, the Treasury assured that they had not used its services again.
This, after 25 July of Norway, was published a review of the cheques issued by the Marija to its providers, notably that in the period March 2008 - July 2010, in the threeth of the Maire Jorge Abel L√≥pez S√°nchez, the Municipe to pay Camacho Palazuelos over 10 million weights, through 42 cheques.
He also performed transactions with Jumapam, acquiring cheques over 3 million weights.
Tourist sites must be signed
Touristic entrepreneurs regret the accident of the foreign tourist because of the bad circumstances of S√°nchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in a growth of the round point S√°nchez Taboada, the Mazatlan tourist sector requested the authorities to take attention to the areas and sites that are in bad conditions and design a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, President of the Association of Commerceers of Zona Dorada, recalled that they had several times asked that the image of the destination should be signed and new activities should be replaced by others that the tourists find bad.
He said that the bad state of the streets and trottoirs affected the fact that the tourists are coming to walk and see the disorder and avoid near trades.
"Politics do not know that it means closing a company a day and they don't know the force that it was lost, otherwise they did not work for so long and without adequate planning."
Jos√© Ram√≥n Manguart S√°nchez said that the crack of the tourist has expressed the lack of prevention and maintenance of the Mairie.
"The municipality must take its responsibilities and avoid that it goes again, how to do it, therefore through preventive entrepreneurship and just to do the correct," he said.
"We want to play a own city, because not only because it is a tourist area, but as inhabitants who have a proper place to live there and Mairai must change its strategy to maintain the city."
There are other sites that are refused and incomplete, as well as Esdoo and Venadito of Mazatlan.
"Today, because the tourist comes, it is not only depending on the promotion, it must have a good product, a city that has own in its beaches, bolevards, holding permanent attractions," he said.
"They have not given their attention to the need and this type of facts stresses something that is notory for all, the maintenance is necessary."
Ra√∫l Llera Mart√≠nez, Secretary of Touristic Promotion, said that the recovery of the Mazatlan tourist sites is urgent because they are not used correctly and designed a bad image.
He spoke of a series of places that should be online together with the municipality and be a priority to have the town of updating, own, ordered and attractive because it has a tourist vocation.
"Mazatlan offers many stories and cultural sites that we should first order, clean and make them online to make them attractive to add them to the winner we have to make the promotion of this destination."
IP Reviewing results to the Congress
Eduardo Davalos, President of the CCE, proposed that the Deputys be a great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations in which they are compared.
The Mazatlan Business sector requires a worthy and free working law of agreements between parties and government executive, because Sinaloa is enlarged and faces great problems.
The 60th legislative legislation formed by seven political forces, 19 presidents of PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the New Alliance Party, two of PRD, one of PT, one of the Convergence and one of the PVEM, totally 40 popular representatives.
The list of experts that the new government integrants of the Congress is a own and bonded management with society and the various sectors that need to be responsible legislation work and that the same models of partial or paternalism are not reflected.
Eduardo Davalos, President of the CCE, proposed that the Deputys be a great responsibility to be an example for a better Sinaloa because of the various provocations in which they are compared.
"We hope that deputys actually act their right, free of agreements between the parties, because the coutume is that they are doing pacts to ensure their own interests and they turn into the carnaval mass of governments and leaders of parliamentary fractions."
That is why I ask them to certify the commitment to establish the needed positions by the Governant to progress.
"We will ensure that they are doing a worthy and especially associated with society and sectors, because the people of Sinaloa have given them their confidence vote in the past elections.
Jos√© Ram√≥n Manguart S√°nchez, President of the Association of the Tres Island Hotels, considered that one of the great provocations of the 40 popular representatives is to pousse and add forces by seeking the economic growth of the State, as the economic situation is now very complex.
"The most important is that they make economic growth, that they generate stimulations for investment and infrastructure, and that will so stimulate the generation of job posts."
With regard to the tourism activity, he requested the new legislators to give its importance in the Governmental Budget to consolidate the Government Tourism Secretariat.
"I understand that it is the second secretariat of the State with a more reduced budget and is not confronted as an important economic and general activity of visual and investment and which revalues directly with the industry."
Apart from the fact that resources should be classified to detoning tourist projects that have been assigned to the State and to update the Alcool Act that previous legislation could not be resolved.
We're looking for a king mage
Pouped, cars and bicyclettes, among other players, are the desire of the children of the Coonado Valenzuela family.
For their parents, the next day of the Kings of Mages will be difficult to fulfill their illustrations, because their foyer is formed by less than 12 persons and a skin.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, Jos√© Alfredo, Mary Guadalupe, Isaiah, Jos√© John and Miguel are not lost the hope that Melchior, Balthazar and Gaspard will take their games and clothes they want so much.
The family lives a humble home of Colonia Salvador Allende and they live on the day because their father has no stability.
"After it's very difficult for us, because my husband has no work, but we're selling mandarines and patates... and afternoon I go with the 'plabes' to sell on the street," said C√¢dina Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
Adelaida, four years old, wants a poppe or bicyclette, and his sister Isabel, three years old, would like a Barbie poppe.
At his tour, Jos√© Alfredo, from 10 years old, urged to have a "monster truck" and for his little brother Jesus, of 8 months, Citana suggests size clothes for a year.
"He said to me (Josee Alfred," I would like that monster, "but I said to him, 'they will see, my son," because he was very lovely," remembered Cmitana.
For the larger children, who were at school, clothes and chausers would be the ideal.
Mary Guadalupe, of 11 years, cut the size of 12; Isaiah, of 10 years, cut the size 10, while Miguel, eight years old, cut the size of eight.
Jos√© Juan, 14 years old, needs a couple of sports chausure, so a couple of the size of five and half or six would help him much.
If you want to really help make the dream of children of the Coronado Valenzuela family you can participate in the Cherche Roi Mage campaign On Cherche Roi Mage, giving a play or money to the reception of Norway.
14 drug trade unemployed presumers
A ten inquiry investigation was carried out in Strategy, Friday, in the context of a production and sale of cannabis.
Fourte persons have been arrested and will face several accuses.
Research was led to Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, mostly in drug production places.
"On about 750 cannabis plants, four kilometres of haschich, money and equipment that served for the production have been entered", said Louis-Philippe Ruel, a port of the Qu√©bec Safety.
Nevertheless, our men and three women have been arrested, including the two leading heads presumed from this network, two men of Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons had to compare Sherbrooke's justice palace in hours following their arrest.
They could face cannabis production accused, possession in order to make it traffic, compliance and services flight, among others.
These investigations were conducted after a long heat investigation, which durationd around one year.
"It is the information received from the public which allowed us to carry out these arrests," said Mr. Ruel.
Some 70 police police officers of the Regional Research Module of the Qu√©bec Soviet Exterior, Sherbrooke Police Service and the Mimphr√©magog Police Region, participated in this police operation.
Clandest migration may continue without problem
The draft law of conservators, which, according to the Government, should address the problem of nuclear migrant vessels, will be clearly blessed while the three opposition parties had known mercy that they could not support it.
"I'm strongly supporting the Charter."
"I'm standing on with a party that created the granite under your feet," said Michael Ignatieff's officer, while he was around deputys after the celebration of the weekly meeting of the cocks.
The Liberals claim that the draft law, as proposed, would allow the holding up to any year from a ship identified as a Clandesian immigrants, would oversee the Canadian Charter for Rights and Freedom.
The Chief of the Quebecois Block, Gilles Duceppe, also indicated that it could not support the draft law, because it takes it to the wrong goal.
"We are against and it seems that all the parties of the opposition are against, then we will see what the government will do," said Mr. Duceppe.
The NPD's immigration crisis, Olivia Chow, rejected the reverse of the hand, the criticians wishing that its party is not enough close with respect to Canadian immigrants.
"The non-democrats are agreed to take measures against the clandest passengers and that is what we do through the submission of another draft law, C-35," said Mrs Chow.
"We do not approve the draft law of the conservators because it takes it to refugees and imprisoned children for at least one year," explained Mrs Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, accused the parties of opposition to play the political and ignore the will of Canadians.
"The Canadians say massively to the deputys that they do not take this kind of climate migration, these criminal operations aiming Canada and treating the country as a pallesson."
"They are expected to take close measures to Canada," replied Minister Kenney.
The Government has not announced a confidence vote on its draft law, which would be able to conduct the country to foreign elections that reject it.
However, a conservator said to the QMI Agency that the Government would ask a vote to make each deputy that would be opposed then to the election.
The new unit does not make onenimity
Despite the announcement of the possibility of establishing a permanent unit to combat corruption and colussion by John Charest, many observers continue to ask the establishment of a public investigation committee on the subject.
The Minister of Public Safety, Robert Dutil, supports that this idea is not dated here: Quebec would have consulted the Department of Investigation in New York on this subject since January last.
Metropol has a permanent unit on corruption since 1870.
However, the march's advertisement surrounded more than one.
In meeting of the Standing Council on the Police Services of Quebec on 29 October, this measure has never been discussed despite Robert Dutil's presence.
It was no longer necessary for the public security crisis, Stefane Bergeron, which is the advertisement of "lapin out of a chapeau" and "briculated solution on the coin of a table."
Minister Dutil answered those who fear that political power has too much influence on the possible future unit.
"You're going to see the result when we're going to announce it, please show it."
"It's aware of this problem."
For the President of the CSQ, Rejean Parent, nothing can be replaced by the establishment of a public investigation.
"Plus Mr. Charest is obliged to not wish to create this investigation committee, more people think like you and I have something to hide," explains he.
"The only means of having a investigation commission is the release of Jean Charest," explains Yves Boisver, professor of Ethiopia and Government at the National School of Public Administration.
In order to go out of this impasse, he suggests Quebec to give a special mandate to the general verifier to investigate colussion and corruption.
"You must be able to expand the mandate of the general verifier," he tranched.
He also believes that Quebec could give the same powers to the verifier as a Commissioner, which allows him to enable people to demonstrate.
The creation of a permanent skill is not the only project in the Charest Government's cartons.
Quebec would also request Ottawa to amend the Criminal Code to be better adapted to this type of crime.
This would be the prosecutor of the operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisprudence is not explicit in this kind of investigations.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews, has confirmed him that his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, is presented on some amendments related to this case.
During the 2001 printemps operation, which was slaughtered by the moor groups, even though the Criminal Code was not adapted, 131 persons were arrested.
Ottawa later adopted the gangsterism Act.

From 20 to 40 billion additional rain was expected from Thursday evening, according to the regions.
The sectors in the north of the River and the Outaouais valley were the most touched.
They could receive up to 100 millimetres of rain in total.
As these drops should be added to the source of the snow already accumulated in certain sectors, the delay of several water courses is feared.
Warning warnings were issued on Friday evening by the Qu√©bec Civil Safety for Uareau and Achigan Rivers in Lanaudi√®re.
The northern rivers, Saint-Jer√¥me, Laurentides, and C√™ne, in Lotbinia, were made the object of anonymation vessels and continued under monitoring.
In the Lanaudi√®re region, the strong storms have entered the delay of some lakes, Sainte-Julian, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare and Rawdon.
In Saint-Calixte, a temporary pont was made because of strong rain.
10 residents had to be evacuated by preventive measure.
In Outaouais, the delay of some lakes has entered the closure of several ways, including in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontefract.
Civil security remains on a warning feet and monitors the situation of nearby Annik Bouchard, a security adviser.
The Quebec Crescenter for its merchant part of the warnings of strong crowds for several rivers, including Maskinonge, Asomption, Ouareau, Achigan, Batiscan and Loup.
Partly Blue
The Qu√©bec St√©phane Dupan radio animator has introduced a part of turn to the Canadian Radio Level Council for adverse proposals on social assistance and the Ha√Øtians as well as its larger tongue in waves.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupant and its team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but some proposals contained "inexact information on social assistance, individually negative representations of Haitians and large languages that do not match emissions distributed during the day."
The Council also concluded that a debate on the suicide, including the dissemination of the name of two persons who were subsequent, have not been released by radiodiscipation codes.
The CCNR had received several complaints on comments made during emissions distributed between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was made after a complaint of the Joint Front of Social Assistants in Quebec.
The group noted that the amounts in the emission were inexact.
The animators must provide solid information rather than false information.
Concerning the suicide, the Stefane Dupan animator felt that suicide was a gentle of lake.
The majority of the members of the Committee concluded that the tested message was that sucide should not be seen as a solution to life-related issues.
"The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes put on the middle has discussed a delicate issue in a fair and appropriate manner."
So no blue has been retained in his place.
The last literacy was on statements followed by the earthquake in Haiti.
Stefane Dupont and Jean-Ren√© Dufort were then delivered to a Mediterranetic face face that had followed many reactions.
The CHOI animator said that he did no gift to help the Haitian because we couldn't know with certainty that people really needed to receive money.
The Committee believes that these comments were not abusive, but that their contemporary effects are a negative representation of Haitian.
"I've already cleaned my suspension of three days above."
"My dossier is pregnant for a half years," said the animator.
In all decisions, the Committee expresses the dissemination of large languages.
In each case, the CHOI-FM radiodiffusive collaborated "after its obligation".
The consequences are minimal for the station which should, among others, announce these decisions once during large hearing hours within a period of three days.
A King of Cong-fu in Montr√©al
The Montrealais of Algerian origin Nacereddine Zemmal is extremely special.
The Atlete that exalts in "sanda" (kung-fu "full contact"), kickboxing and tai box on the tatamies and around the world in searching for new challenges.
"I started doing martyr arts such as cong-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria, explained Zemmal, installed in Metropol since 2008 to evolute in professionals."
"In my case, I'm looking for fighting a little everywhere, because for those who do not love the ground game present in mixed martyr arts, the competitions are rare in North America."
Receively, he who worked as a security agent and as a complaint for the UPS company has just released bad news to its rivers, giving two gold medals to the Ombudsman of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA), from 23 to 30 October, Edinburgh, in Escosse.
"I brought the kickboxing categorys full contact and tai box, explicitly."
"Actually, I'm ready to go to China for the sanctuary world's coffee."
"The fighters who ended among the four first at the last world campaign in each category were invited."
"I've brought the bronze in 2009 to Toronto."
"In 2005, in Vietnam, I finished eight."
"In 2007, I concluded the tournoi at the fifth rang, while I came to Toronto in 2009, did it add it?"
"What's interesting is that I have progressed every competition."
"To this rhythm, I'll be first this time or next year."
The "san shou" or "sanda" is a original discipline of China where the poing and foot bottles are authorised as well as the ground projections are.
The duals are originally leaving on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous pugilist of this form of combat is the Vietnamic American of origin Cung Le, well recognized in the world of maritime arts.
If Nacer Zemmal has only one event in his card, he will certainly answer his presence to the superturn "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Cong-fu.
"This competition is the most highest and most pregnant in China, explained the gaillard sympathy. "
"It's a bit the equivalent of the Lumpine Stade (the largest stad of Thailand)."
"When it was a super experience."
Zemmal paid his first fight in half-final of its category (80 kg) before the end of losing.
"He who won me was a real pro, analyzed."
"There are four combatants per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 90 kg).
"The winners of the half-finals are in the end of their category."
"Therefore the winners of each category are faced to run a single campaign, the King of the Cong-fu."
450 million contracts without calls
Hydro-Qu√©bec granted an amount of $450 million in contracts to engineering firms for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
In the heart of this academy, more than 100 contracts, it is a consortium for firms BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor that has obtained the most important project generation, for a sum of $295 million without an appeal.
In 2004, the consortium called Energy Generance was concomitant to the selection of Hydro-Qu√©bec to confid the private sector's responsibility to manage this important hydro-electronic project of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Consortium Energy Gerance decreased the lucratif contract without the call of public offers.
For the Chebekois Party, the use of business consortiums poses a serious ethical problem that risks to eliminate competition and bring price increase.
"It's the new way to make the colussion and combat competition."
"It's saying that people, instead of doing this secretly, now do it openly," said the Deputy Deputy Sylvain Simard at press conference.
On the morning, Mr. Simard stressed the question to the National Assembly because he said difficultly to see how public interest can be served in this way.
The Minister of Natural Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, replied afternoon, since he had been colussion for this contract.
"I started to have my journey," she felt, supporting that the PQ was "malhonnest" and had "reaching".
She said, "It would be the least thing" that the PQ apologizes.
Consortium formula is a current practice throughout the world.
It is usually a limited commitment in time allowing two or more enterprises to gather their respective experts to respond to a call for a comprehensive project.
The Eastman project contains a high level of complexity, taking into account the expansion of work.
The cancer is running and must be shot up until 2012.
However, the contract was admitted without the competitive game; it was negotiated.
Therefore, the design of consortiums is no longer exclusive to Quebec, even for relatively simple projects.
As the past week revealed The Devoir, the formula of consortiums in the gentle sector is an investigation to the government.
A rapid overall of the registry of the Qu√©bec firms allows the number of more than 200 consortiums, some of which seem to be permanent.
The firm Dessau is therefore working in partnership with most of its major competitors, including CIMA+, G√©nivar, SNC-Lavalin and other Roche and Tecsult.
Each combination, and there are tens, returns to one and even moral person, or Dessau.
For the Energy Consortium, the Minister Normandeau emphasized that "the Territory of Baie James respondes to special work dynamics and that Hydro-Qu√©bec is particularly responsible for it for the 70s."
The large patron of the Eastman project, Real Laport, the Energy Society of the Baie James (SEBJ), explained that the project's generic agreement has been granted to greater.
"If you're going to call for offers and there's little submissioners, your prices will be higher."
"You have two choices: or you take the people who are in this market and you say, we will negotiate a satisfactory understanding and with a good price."
"But the idea is that it is not the price that is important, that is the competence of people," said Mr. Laport.
This contract granted to the Energy Generance Consortium is part of a long list of contracts of more than $50,000 obtained by the Cuban Party.
The contracts have been granted by Hydro Quebec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Reupert project.
After verification, the Devoir has assessed 109 gene-consequent contracts granted between 2002 and March 2010 to firms or daughters, including land laboratory laboratorys.
SNC-Lavalin took 22 contracts, G√©nivar obtained 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without taking into account its participation in energy.
All contracts have been negotiated.
They are total of $449,783,344, including the Energy Energy Agreement of 295 131 564.
Sylvain Simard said that the four firms that compose the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor) are "by known to the Liberal Party of Quebec".
The Minister of Normaneau decreased that the PQ is also related to those companys that "financent", before exacting that it was rather than his leaders.
Barometer of the responsible consumption - The "verte" label inspires not trust
More green, but franchely sceptic.
The Cuban consumer has very little confidence to the actors of sustainable development, but also to the fair marks and ecological certificates to guide its choice.
Pis, even if he bails in a Mediterranean universe where the messages for more responsible consumption are encountered, it is a lack of credible information, unfortunate that he has even qualified free to his commitment, the Barometer of the responsible consumption, whose first reading has been delivered yesterday.
Even though they have increased the consumption of these socially responsible products in 2010, the Quebecois seems to be very few credits to those who try to sell them.
Twenty-thirds say that the environmental commitment of enterprises as well as the green publicity of companies does not believe, it reveals the measure tool developed by the Observatory of Consumation responsible for the University of Sherbrooke.
Another note: half of consumers are unfortunately reliable to official certificates on the products that are accurate, but also of the credibility of products and marks that appear as economical, the Barometer indicates.
In the same vessel, the speakers of the politicians on this topic are seriously taken by only 14.6% of the Cheb√©cos.
However, the responsible consumption information seems to be primordial to stimulate the current animated consumption bread near the third of the Cuban consumers.
In fact, the empty and the doubt of information was 46% of consumers.
It is the second free identified by the Barometer, after the highest price of these products.
Furthermore, a third of the Qu√©bekois is also disappointed in the performances of green products or services which are seeking to put into the hands.
In another note, consumers have changed their usual and mostly changed by mark of one or more products in response to their conviction.
At 61%, they also favoured purchases from their village traders and privileged the purchase of food products in their region, the Barometer states.
More green and responsible - the index of responsibilities has reached 64 on a maximum of 100 for this year - the Qu√©bec Consumer Homo likes to present himself as the King of Reyclage who seeks to reduce its environmental impression by concerning the protection of animals.
However, its social and environmental conscience seems to remain outside of his car, the Barometer states: in 2010, at least 28% of the Cheb√©cos have shown use of common transport or preconscious co-ordination to defend their green interests.
The road and the glass were also supported by 39.1 per cent of the participants in this broad behaviour investigation, which is to take its first climate.
A provision of the State for the eXcentris rachat
The Government of Quebec, to which we were requested to engage financially in the race of the complex of eXcentris by the Angous Society and Parallel, agrees to collaborate, but in the competition of a loan only.
The Angous Development Society and Parallel, who hoped a donation of seven million dollars from the Ministry of Cultural Cultural to acquire Daniel Langlois the complex Chinese eX centuries on the San Laurent Bulevard by paying him its full vocation of China, won't receive what they claimed.
The Government agrees to be involved in the dossier, but in its own conditions.
As long as the donor is expected, the Quebec Government proposes a loan that the amount would be lower than the initial expectations, which could constitute a viable solution at benefits, at least the view of the sources of the offices of the State.
A first action plan and a request for 12,8 million had already been rejected by Quebec the last print, but the requests have been revised to the decrease.
A proposal and a plan of action was sent to the Minister St-Pierre by the President of the Cultural Development Society (SODEC), Fran√ßois Macerola, which pilots the eXcentris folder.
He made him a last report ago a ten days ago.
But the contra-proposal of the cabinet has arrived in SODEC on Tuesday.
Parallel and Angus have to answer it until 31 December.
However, it seems that the hypothesis of the donation of the State is really disappeared.
Reaffirm that the Qu√©bec Association of cinemem owners and cineparks was opposed to a direct investment of the State to support eXcentris rachat, arguing that the Ministry of Cultural Cultural is not to finance real projects, which did not for other census rooms.
But several of the environment's interventions, in contrast, claimed substantive economic assistance.
Daniel Langlois, the teacher of Ceans Master, has brought the author's census to his places after funding his own construction, which could justify a derogation of the Treasury Council.
The lack of rooms for independent films is crying in Montr√©al, and eXcentris had its customer fidely.
The Angus Society and Parallel, with their Christian Yaccarini, pilot, on their side, a private financing campaign, hopes to recover $700,000 to pow down the race of the acquisition.
Since printing 2009, one of the three screens, Parallel continued to diffuse eXcentris films.
The goal of future acquirers is to open the three rooms on 27 February next by designing the very beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Man and gods.
But Christian Yaccarini did not remember The Devoir and it is ignored what he and his group thinks of proposals to the lower they are made.
The glass lifted up on a complex Canada...
The new diplomatic chambers of WikiLeaks distributed by the United States consider as the complex of incertainty of Canadians toward the Americans, but in the same way they have the sense of sustainability of those last to Canada.
Thus, the American diplomats stressed that each Canadian election had no Canadian relations with the spirit by vote and believe that the visit of President Obama helped the conservator Government to adopt its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the American Ambassade in Ottawa and Washington, held on the public place yesterday, offer more crousitive details than the substantial content to be put under the dent.
A chamber dated 22 September 2008, or in full federal electoral campaign, indicates what point the United States do not be part of the bonds discussed by the political leaders.
At the great wonder of the American Ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Mr. Wilkins provides a few clarifications to this situation.
"A almost inherent Canadian indigenous complex may be the Canadian political leaders to speak about daily internal internal places rather than to make this election on the United States (as in the 1988 free-term campaign) ".
The United States, therefore, are concluded, "the proverbial reflection of this choice: absolutely, but potentially too damaging to speak it."
The ambassador is now less than that "seasing silence" that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship.
"Is he think that the capacity of a candidate, a party and more of a head of party to manage this vital relationship should be a key factor that the elections have in mind by vote."
On 22 January 2009, Terry Breese, who was responsible for business in Ottawa, preparing President Barack Obama at its first visit in Ottawa.
"And your journey will help to ensure the survival of the Government in the February ' s starting-up to the Federal Budget, by which Canada will show its first deficit over a decade because of a report plan of $30 to $40 billion," says Mr. Breese.
No part referred to that the Government had to extend the Parliament before Christ to avoid being reduced by coalition and that opposition parties would make its conditional survival to the quality of the proposed report plan.
Another communication dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins is prevailed by Washington from the most negative image than the dramatic series diffused to CBC returning from the United States.
The ambassador concerns the emissions of Border, Little Mosco on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little sub-string references are observed in Maher Arar, the "No-Fly-List" or the exhibitions for muscles from the CIA.
Another chamber tells that, at their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked his French homologus Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to receive some prisoners in Guant√°namo.
Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of the "cass per case".
At the end of the meeting, is he written, "He sent a paper to the State Secretariat about Omar Khadr, a musulman of 15 years of Canadian origin."
"The Secretariat agreed to see the dossier."
Finally, we note that the spirits are out of the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a very close adviser of Stephen Harper, declared on CBC's on CBC's wages that the responsible of this massive flight should be "assassined".
It was Mike Huckabee's echo in the United States.
A global plan to resume the light
The United Nations has proposed to Canc√∫n a renew plan of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries to get a reduction of serre gas (GES), which is almost the third of the additional reduction needed to be realized in order to establish the planetary climate from 2020.
This ambitious plan is located in the foul of the United Nations's concrete projects that it is hoped to make Canc√∫n to compensate the absence of binding commitments to reduction by industrialized countries.
According to the yesterday plan, if the incannant emblems that monopolies still 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by fluocompact ampools or, better, by electroluminescent diodes (DEL or "LED" in English), the sensal of 1,8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GES emitted on the planet to clarify humans would be avoided.
The light is responsible for 8 per cent of the global emissions.
This is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planet automobile park.
In Copenhague, last year, the large emittenants, such as the United States, China, Europe and others, including Canada, have been engaged in voluntary reduction plans that should take the overall GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
But this balance is still 5 Gt to reach from 2020 the increase in climate at 2 centigrade levels to avoid that it should not be out of control.
In the incannant ampoules, 95% of energy is dismissed in the form of warmth and the remaining, or 5% of light.
With fluocompact ampoules, energy expenditure is reduced by 75%, and with new EDLs, the need of energy is reduced twice again.
Fluocompact ampoules are averaged from 6000 to 10 000 hours.
The new bands at DE, such as those launching Philips producer this week, also participated in the United Nations study, have a hope of life of 25,000 hours and consuming 80% less than an incannant ampoule, which gives an idea of the economy possible with a position plan that would be applied to 100 countries.
All these new ampoules can also function with reheostats in addition to emit very little warm.
And they have no mercury.
Several specialists have shown reservations on the place of fluocompacts because they contain mercury and have to eliminate them as dangerous wastes, which is not always possible in developing countries except if producers have placed consigns.
But the report indicates that the main source of mercury emission on the planet is not the ampoule of fluocompact, but rather the thermal centers of the carbon, which produces many mercurys to produce explored electricity in incandants.
Only in the United States, these centres are emitted 25,000 tonnes of mercury per year.
The report details the gains that each country would be made through this international programme.
For example, Indonesia would be a billion of dollars per year in electricity purchases and eight million tonnes of CO2, or the equivalent of 3,5 thermal centrals whose construction would cost 2.5 billion.
Ivoire Cost is waiting for the nervous announcement of electoral results
The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Ban Ki-monon, declared the publication "with-term" of the results of the Presidential election in C√¥te d'Ivoire, after the expiration of the deadlines set out.
"The Secretary-General emphasized the need for the independent electoral Committee to acquire its work and to announce the provisional results without more time, has emphasized a speaker door of the Chief of the United Nations".
"The Commission requests all Ivoire parties and institutions to demonstrate responsibilities and to depart from any initiative until the announcement of the provisional results."
Despite the pressures carried out by some foreign governments, the electoral Commission left the date of mercredi mining, without publishing the results, three days after the Sunday scrutin.
Forty-minutes before the expiration of the time, the CEI Chair said to the television that the Commission continued to work to announce the results.
The calls have been multiplied in the world to make the CEI finally proclaim the name of the second tour winner between Laurent Gbagbo and the opposite Alassane Ouattara.
But the Gbagbo camp takes into account the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of votes "fraudosous" in the north, held by the former refusal of the new Forces (FN) since the missing State of September 2002.
Pascal Habi N'Guessan, Chairman of the Ivoire Chairman, stated that the elections carried out by the FN's elections in the north of the country had dismissed the parties from the President to go to vote.
The election could be cancelled if the complaints proposed by Gbagbo are retained by the Constitutional Council.
But the adversary of Gbagbo feels that the highest core of the country is not neutral because it is directed by Paul Yao N'Dr√©, a closely wide politics of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a northern man who deployed any link with the former republics, tried the "unacceptable" delay in the announcement of the results and asked Gbagbo to respect them, but he did not go until he returned the victory.
His allegeds claim that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because he knows that he was lost and denied before the Constitutional Council, after preventing the electoral commission to disseminate the results, it would be illegal.
The second tour of the President, on Tuesday, was worthy to cut the process of reunification and reconciliation of a slaughter country in two years.
The United Nations has reported merried the Ivoire political class that it could be responsible for events of violence.
Laurent Gbagbo ended the first tour on 31 October, with 38 per cent of the votes against Alassane Ouattara, which received public support from the former President Henri Konan Bedi√© (25 per cent in the first tour).
Unemployment rates remained in France at the 3th quarter
The unemployment rate in France in the context of the International Working Office (BIT) has remained stabilized to 9.3% in metropol (9.7% in compliance with the oar-employment departments), showing the corrected data of the periodic variations (CVS) which were published in India.
The number of unemployed was 2.631 million in metropol.
The data of the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3 per cent of the active population in metropol and 9.7 per cent of the DOM.
In one year, the unemployment rate is increased by 0.1 points.
More widely, 3,4 million people in France did not work at the third quarter, but wanted to work, to be available or not in the two weeks to work and to seek or not a job.
The situation of young people on the labour market was still degraded, with a new increase in the unemployment rate of 24.2 per cent in metropol (+ 0.9 points for three months, +0.5 per year) and 25 per cent, including DOM.
In the third quarter, 637,000 young men from 15 to 24 were unemployed in the ITB.
The elderly recognized a lightly increase of unemployment, to 6.4% in metropol (+0.2 points for three months and for one year) or 482 000 people of 50 years or more, and 6.6% with the DOM.
Only 25-49 years of unemployment in third quarter, 8.3 per cent in metropol (-0.1 per months, +0.1 per year) and 8.8 per cent in France.
Insee has no longer published a monthly unemployment rate since 2006, after a polemic on its calculation method.
Eurostat, the European Union statistics Agency continued to do it and announce a 9,8% rate for France (including DOM) in October after 9,9% in September.
Alexandere Gu√©rini under review and detention
Alexandere Gu√©rini, 53 years old, leader of waste-treaters and brother of the PS Chairman of the Buches-du-Rh√¥ne General Council, was examined and signed at the Luynes‚Äô arrest house nearly Aix-en-Provence in the framework of an investigation on fraudlent public markets.
Alexandere Guerini has been reviewed for abuses of social goods, deterioration of funds and public goods, recal, active corruption, trafficking of influence and detention of munitions.
"Alexandr Guerini is battle and is trying to explain about all the questions that the judge will possess it, and not fantasms."
"It's easy to continue it for a multitude of reflectable leaders, it's another thing to prove them," said the AFP's lawyer, Florence Rault, before the hearing of his client.
Mr. Guerini, the brother of the strong man of the PS in the department, John-No√´l Guerini, held through the intermediary of his lawyers to make the judge before his hearing a memo to explain.
One of his neighbours, Philip Rapezzi, has also been conducted on Friday night and discovered.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his client has never done anything else to do the downloads he had to manage.
With regard to the allocation of markets or the destination of funds related to their operation, he never knew it, said to me Simon.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, the former General Director of the Agglomation Services, was examined in mercury for public and complicity deployment, and left free under judicial control with prohibition to meet the protagonists of the case.
"My client has made an explanation to the facts that were reproached to him."
"The prosecutor, taking into account the notion of liberty," said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons have been reviewed and released free at the Tuesday Tuesday on Friday, with a position of judicial control for two of them, said the added prosecutor of the Republic of Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Director-General to Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is continued to "influence and passive corruption traffic".
Two officials of the agglomation of Aubagne, Michale Duval and Christophe Bringuier are considered one for "substration and displacement of public goods by a person charged by a public service mission", the other for "compliance of public funds".
Finally, the company of Alexandr Guerini, Jeannie Peretti, has been examined for "abusing of social goods".
Among those who have been confronted with Mr. Gu√©rini figures St√©phane Bruengo-Girard, recently recorded in a parallel case of fraudulent public markets touching Corse.
Researchers are surprising its companys that have served the money of the great banditism.
The investigation is carried out in the framework of several open judicial information against X in April 2009 following anonymous posters for fraudes presumed in the transition of public markets, particularly in the area of waste.
In addition to the investigation, investigations are focused in particular on the terms of appointment and functioning of a La Ciotat deployment, which collects Abuagne's waste and some cities of the urban community in Marseille (MPM).
Case Clotilde Reiss: Elis√©e exhibited the mediation of Syria
During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for "spionage", held the opinion in hate in France, put the diplomacy warning, and engaged the deterioration of relations between Paris and Teheran.
It is under the attention of the United States diplomats.
American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by The World shows some under this crisis.
They describe how the Elisee explained its strategy to the Americans to give them advice for the treatment of their own "hotages" crises in Iran (a small group of borderers).
They showed how the French officers were seeking to convince Washington that the release of the young French had not been in contravention to the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and seeked by the American justice for material trafficking to the benefit of the Iranic Nuclear Programme.
Finally, they put under a crucial light the way the French Presidency tried to manipulate the media to increase the idea that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss.
Actually, there was nothing.
A reported diplomatic telegram on 12 August 2009 in Paris is called "Iran: French comments on how to manage home cases".
The Adviser for Strategic Affairs, Fran√ßois Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, engaged in American diplomat Kathleen Allgrone.
They explain the French method.
They advise the Americans to make it so much to repatriate their own citizens of force in Iran.
"Take of the voice," they say, "not stop" in the media the words "the fundamental man," "innocence," "immediate liberation".
It is necessary to remove the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image.
"Don't make it so far as Iranians ask you not to do it."
Because, through the attempts of discussion by discrete channels, "the silence will not regulate anything," the Iranians are "masters in dilatory managers".
Mr. Richier adds that the arrestation of foreigners is "the Family Iranian tactics: the hosts for political singing".
He announced that the release of the prison of Clotilde Riess (hich will intercept on 16 August, the day it flights to France's Ambassade) "which will require the payment to Iran from a large sum of money" (230 000 euros).
And he knows that Elisa anticipates other housing crises, a phenomenon that "aggressive."
The Iranians may "for a future nearly stop another of the 1 800 French citizens living in Iran," said he.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde Reiss went out of prison for twelve days, but remaining blocked in Iran.
A information is distributed: Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose United States claims the extradition for an unlawful electronic trafficking to Iran, is released to Paris, on decision of a judge.
The American Ambassade, such as many observers, asks about this huge co√Øncidence.
For Washington, which translates the Iranian Clandest networks of acquisition of material for the nuclear program, the extension of Majid Khakavand is a bad new.
Does France accept a good?
The release of Iran against the French?
During a new intertaining with Kathleen Allgrone on 4 September, Fran√ßois Richier ensure that this is not the case.
He said, not only, "It was fully surprised by the decision of the judge," but was trying to oppose it.
"There were viable exchanges between the French Presidency and the guard of the skills" (time Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot return to the judicial decision" he observes.
Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains placed under the "etroite" supervision of French information services.
The Adviser of Elizabeth consists of a telephone number, raccroch, then report the American diplomat that Iran ‚Äúactually placed in buildings in Paris by the Iranian Ambassade‚Äù.
During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elisee does not appreciate its efforts, through communications and "furts" organized in the media, to believe that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "important" and "influent" of "mediator".
Americans observe this activity not without irony, and remark that manipulation brings its fruits, since several press articles repercussion the French official version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 refers to the 'bitz' mediatic' officers.
On what it is based on so much "grateness" expressed to Mr Assad, the ambassade in Paris is requested.
"In addition to their full louange statements, French officers recognize that they are only a vague notion of what the Syrians actually did."
The document then refers to the reasons for which Elisa had made to send in this fiction.
The efforts of communication "for the validity of Sarkozy opening policy in Syria" is an analysis.
A policy launched in 2008, which was "forwarded by many critical voices in France and foreign, as prematured and imm√©tried."
By "exaggering the Syrian role", Paris seeks to "demover Syria what lovers it can be taken by playing a constructive role in the region."
The goal is also to "mear discretion grains between Syria and Iran."
The American Ambassade knows you about a good source.
On August 11, Fran√ßois Richier trusted him: "With certainly, we don't know if the Syrians did what it is."
"But we rewarded them even."
"This should at least sow the confusion in the Iranians."
Clotilde Reiss returned to France on 16 May 2010.
Nicolas Sarkozy received her to Elisa.
In a communication, he thanks the Presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role for the release of our fellowship".
No online games for young Koreans past
The South Korean Government will adopt a "de Cendrillon law" which will prohibite adolescents to play online games after a minute by blocking their access, indicated government officials.
A draft law will be submitted to the Parliament in December to request online play companies to block access to these games after less than 16 years, with representatives of the Ministry of Cultural and Family.
"Infants play these games all night and then have difficulties to study school and to have a normal life during the day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and their right to sleep," said AFP Jo Rin, the ministerial responsible for the draft law.
Online games will be available at 6:00 a.m.
The companys will have a year to prepare for the application of the law, as specifically.
The Government also intends to ask companies to limit daily access time for young people whose parents are requested, he added the responsible.
It will also provide people who call for free software that allow you to limit the past time on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most connected countries and the newspapers regularly report different facts related to an intensive Internet use.
The country is also the uncognised country's global playing competence.
In November, South Korea had brought four gold medals to the World of Cyber Games, with 58 other nations.
World 2018-2022: The Fif designs the organizational countries
In full tournament due to corruption suspicions, the Fifth Executive Committee describes the world organizational countries of Couples in 2018 and 2022, an enormally political choice where influence and lobbing fights may take step on technical criteria.
One thing is sure, the edition 2018 of the Queen Fifa will happen in Europe, traditional basis for discipline (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands-Belgica).
This will be a greater exotic, the International Federation hopes to grant new territories (Qatar, Australia), after a first on African continent in 2010, or to continue its installation to the United States or to the Austrogen East (Japon, South Korea).
The list of personalities made by delegations (David Cameron, Princess William, Jos√© Luis Rodriguez Zapather, Jos√© Scrates, Bill Clinton, the emir of the Qatar, Belgian and Dutch government leaders, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) gives the measure of the economic and political enemies of a world.
Thus, treatments in culinary treatments may be sustained until the last minute.
For the rest, it's difficult to establish a herory between candidates.
According to the Fifa Evaluation Report, the English, Spanish-Porgais (2018) and American (2022) have better arguments than their competitors.
But these considerations will not be very hard for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of vote.
Sunday Times, in the origin of the revealings which had been held to the suspension of two members of the EC corruption (Reynald Temrii and Amos Adamu), could so have disappeared the opportunities of his country, the football beverage who had received the World only once in 1966.
The BBC delivered a Monday, distributing a documentary that expires three influent members of the EC, Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Livingou.
What to keep the Fifa and put the English responsibilities, which have been launched in intensive lobby these weeks with David Cameron‚Äôs first line.
The Chief of the Government hopes to reaffirm the case successful by his President Tony Blair, which had obtained in 2005 for London the JO-2012 organization.
Does this intensive activity suffice to restore the lowness of England to the EC?
It is not less sure that the two Spain-Portugal has not lack of anats with its already ready stages, its expertise (Mondial-82 in Spain, JO-92 in Barcelona, Euro-2004) and its foot culture.
But the shadows of economic and financial perspectives of the two countries could doubt their ambitions.
Representatives against the English and doubts about the solutionivity of Spain and Portugal are only to increase the Russian cotton, being abroad of weight, despite the lack of its dossier (stations, hotels, transport).
However, the Prime Minister Vladimir Poutine decided not to carry out the movement to Zurich and set an "delocal concurrence in the preparation of the vote" in a severe complaint to the accuse of English pressure against the members of the EC.
"On covering the bottles, you're trying to engage them," said Mr. Poutine.
For 2022, the United States, strongly in 1994 experience, appear as logical favorites.
The first world economic power, the main sponsors of the Fifa, seats of the country, seems to have a long progress on Japan and South Korea, which separately built a very beautiful project.
But these new candidates are prematured for two co-organized countries in 2002.
Another threat: the winning of the World-2026 to China, which would failly desire the Asian opportunities for 2022.
With the Qatar, who has spent the big game by proposing future stages, and Australia, the Fifa would continue its extension to new conflicts, but these two countries are more risks than certain.
Australia, such as Japan and Korea, could also suffer the weakness of satisfactory TV rights (for the timely disappearance) by European countries, the war nerf.
Second mandate: revelation
De Gaulle had really herself.
Mitterrand had believed he was heitating.
Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no less hesituation.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is less than they.
A mandate to Elizabeth called another.
So the active head of the State will be candidate in 2012.
But the revelation does not fail with the side of mystery attached to the presidential function.
So we need to do as if the doubt was still.
In a sense, like in the other.
In 2006, even without faith, the friends of James Chirac said that a third mandate was not exclusive.
On 15 November, with a serious air, Nicolas Sarkozy would ensure that he would take its decision "which part of the autumn of 2011".
That he calls for UMP parliamentaries, on Tuesday night at Elisea, the perspective of "Two mandates" has therefore sown a little festival.
Is it the official advertisement of his candidature?
We were away from there.
The President only recalled that the constitutional revision of 2008 was limited to two of the fifteenats.
He made a note, not an announcement.
It is not the first time that he calls the President, on the tone of the humor, in such meetings.
"Our worse, or better, you've still seven years and half with me," he started to them in July 2009.
Rebelote in May 2010: "Don't believe I'm not thinking about the step below."
His proposals of beforenoon make it not more candidate than the guard; they do not make it less.
If they are subject to comments, it's for a double reason.
The acc√©l√©ration of the course in candidature to the PS, on the one hand.
But it's not the entrance in the royal Segol√®ne, which makes Nicolas Sarkozy to divorce.
It is contrary because its candidature in 2012 is clear that many of the PS claims a more pre-cost fighting order than planned.
The bad dreams, on the other hand.
For the first time the right elections would prefer the candidature of Fran√ßois Fillon to the Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to BVA-L'Express).
"We have a candidate and there is no discussion in the UMP above," he immediately reacted the environment of the Prime Minister.
"If he believes the possible deficit, he will not be candidate," confided John-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will always believe it will win," corrects Alain Jupp√©, resigned to the revelation.
Euro: the ECB forced to maintain State procurement purchases
The last meeting of the Council of Governings of the European Central Bank (ECB) should be the opportunity to clarify the criteria of crisis output or at least to announce a good number of non- conventional operations of monetary policy which must be completed at the end of the year.
The crisis of the European Sovereign Debt is obliged, the Francfort Emission Institute will be unfortunately allowed to be so punishable in order to arise a situation more than today on European binding markets.
Political costs would now be higher.
Today, at the time of a press conference, Christianne Lagarde welcomed the active role played by the ECB in favour of the crisis of debts in Europe.
She didn't want to say whether she was estimated that the Central Bank should do more, for example, increased its acquis of sovereign obligations.
"I reserve my reflection to my European partners (...)."
In Brussels, in his hearing by the Committee of Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament, the President of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, has not been disappointed any further concerning his intentions, endorsing that the State purchase programme on the second market "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" at the meeting of that Thursday.
Only certainty: the ECB will keep its main management rate in 1%, its lower historical level since May 2009.
In fact, the Czechlor's obligation purchase was doubled last week, at about 1,35 billion euros.
And, according to the indicators of market operators, it would have performed new purchases of Irish and Portuguese titles yesterday.
In total, the central banks of the Euroosystrum bought for 67 billion euros since May 2010.
In addition to the market operators, the advances of a purchasing purchasing do not have any doubt (see page 29).
The economists no longer wait for noticeable cap change.
If loans for more than three months have already disappeared from the ECB‚Äôs seminar, the last process is still inadequate liquidity allocations according to general conditions and for periods from a week to three months.
Economys are expected to extend this device for a few months.
"I can't imagine that she can't change its program importantly."
"It would take the risk to cause new short term tensions," says Michael Schubert, economicist of the Commerzbank.
"An progressive outcome announced during the first quarter of 2011 appears more likely," advanced Norbert Br√§ms, economicist at Sal.
OK home.
In the scope of its public debt interventions, the ECB should maintain an acquiring volume of these obligations to an atony market, add Norbert Br√§ms.
In view of the importance of the exposures of European banks to the sovereign debt markets of the euro area, the emission Institute has no choice but to maintain its presence on the market.
"There must be replaced by the lack of investors on the market and thus act in order to prevent the immigration of the benefits payed by the most fraud States," he demonstrated an important obligatory manager yesterday.
Because if the interest rates are enhanced, the States will be more low to reduce their ends, otherwise to stabilize it.
The safeguard of the euro is at this rate.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government makes the two rounds
After the beginning of a week concerning Italy, the situation was a little wide, yesterday, with the refluence of obligation rates to 10 years.
A return to the precaire calm.
At the end of a meeting with the Minister of Economy, the Presidents of the Region had heard Giulio Tremonti qualifying the situation of "in-dechifferable" and waiting for an "incredible" weekend, which the interested was then denied.
On Tuesday, the disabilities with the long German rates had reached the record of 210 base points and the cost of contracts against the risk of faillite (CDS), 263 points, involving a certain expenditure to Rome.
In the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi noted that in Spain the difference with the German rates was over 400 basic points.
But his right arm, Gianni Letta, said, "effortunately worried" by "the market turbulences" and by a possible condensation in Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy, third economy of the euro area, is not like Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that it is like Portugal", explains Irwin Sttelzer, economicist at Hudson Institute.
Of course, its problem is the lack of growth and the anonymy of the tax returns that are going to be moved to the State in order to cover its funding needs.
The last predictions in Brussels were a cold duke for the government.
Italian growth is now expected to 1,1 per cent in 2011 and 1,4 per cent in 2012. In 2012, the table budget has been examined by 1,3 per cent and 2 per cent.
In these terms, the European Commission calculates that the public deficit will also represent 4,3% of GDP the next year (with 3,9% planned by the Government) and 3,5% in 2012 ( instead of 2.7%).
As far as the ruler of a new budget collective that could be set after feasts, for a amount of 7 billion euros.
"If necessary, new austerity measures must be taken," said the Commissioner for Economic Affairs, Olli Rehn.
At the time, Italy receives support for international institutions.
"The basic values of its economy are in order, and its accounts are good, we replied it for a long time," assures Arigo Sadun, the Italian Manager to Italy's International Monetary Fund.
"There is no problem in the term, or in the short or long term, because despite its important debt (119.2% of the PIB in 2011, NDLR), the efforts for stabilization requested to Italy are less than those requested to other countries," observe Pier Carlo Padoan, the OECD Chief.
The question of political instability remains.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will confront a censure motion to the Chamber of Deputys, as a result of the previous elections could be organized by the end of March.
It would then open a little appropriate period for decision-making in case of serious crisis.
The Europeans consider the strengthening of anticrisis devices
Christine Lagarde has still married him yesterday in the context of a press conference in Paris: "The Europeans, I think we have still demonstrated it tonight and night, are apparently solid, determined, bonded to defend their currency and their currency."
Although relatively, the detention registered yesterday on the rates of the European State obligations provided water to governments and the ECB.
But we can't talk about a start of normalization.
The Standard & Poor's Notice Agency announced that it could degrade the notice of the Portuguese debt, the biggest goal, which is now seen by the speculation.
"Come in May, there is a fair lack of political clarity and visibility, particularly on banking systems," said Exane BNP Paribas.
As far as "the political time is farter than the market time".
As aware of this heat and the danger that he joins, European countries intensify the discussions to strengthen existing anti-crisis devices.
Informal consultations between the Ministers of Finance and, more widely, with their G20 partners will be a good train.
And this is also in view of meetings of the European Group and of the Ecofin from the beginning of the next week.
The ECB meets today.
In the menu, the type of non- conventional support measures to the euro area in the market collector (see above).
With regard to the European Finance Stability Fund (FESF), its Executive Director Klaus Regling started on Tuesday in Singapour to inform the extreme-oriented crisis development investors in Europe.
If the objective of these visits is not to raise funds, it is certainly to prepare it.
The first FESF title emissions are scheduled in the next month.
Today, a official representative of the United States trusted the Reuters Agency that the United States would support a significant increase in the funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment of the IMF.
The countries who are first online, Portugal and Spain are encouraging to adopt structural reforms, including in the field of work market organization.
Reforms that are added to more removal extent measures.
Lissabon and Madrid wants to strike a different way from Greece and Ireland.
One and the other have all prices to avoid asking international assistance before the establishment of their own budgetary corrections and to decide essential structural reforms to renew sustainable trust.
Finally, European funds are available to accelerate the standardization process of sovereign obligations.
By transition to Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber had the first idea that if the 750 billion euro mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund had not been sufficient, the Union would not be able to put the hand to the portfolio.
The Barclays Capital Economys, actor of all first plan of the European Sovereign Debt market, judges that a roulant length of about 100 billion euros would suffice, "preference" in the form of direct liquidity injection.
The vehicle exists: it is the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism to this day of 60 billion euros.
A council that has all the opportunities to be attentively reviewed in the European capitals.
Sure if the market conditions would start.
Snow and glass: 24 apartments in watching orange
Negative episodes continue to generate difficulties of circulation, including on the secondary network in Britain, and they risk some economic activities.
Twenty-four departments are now orange watching because of the risk of snow and glass.
The Eure, Eure-et-Loir, the Two-Sevres and Vienna, have been added to 20 apartments already in orange watch, 18 since Monday and two, Dordogne and Gironde, later night.
According to the Mediterraneo France, the north of Gyrone and the Chartens affect the north of Gyrone and the Chartens, and it is weakly swim on the island of France.
Snow beds from 2 to 5 cm, point 7 to 10 cm are expected for the departments concerned, and from 1 to 3 cm, seeing up to 5 cm for the Paris region.
The departments concerned are the Charente, Charente-Maritime, C√¥tes d'Armor, Finist√®re, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and those of the Base-Norway regions, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
Negative episodes are sufficiently notable to generate circulation difficulties and to cause some economic activities, the Mededeo France is concerned.
In the Coasts of Aarmor, several departments have been prohibited to more than 7.5 tonnes, including Guingamp-Lannion acces and Saint-Brieuc-Loud√©ac.
The circulation on the secondary network in Britain is very difficult in accordance with genearms that recommend that its vehicle be taken only if needs and the movement of certain TER cars has been suspended for the day.
School transports were prohibited for Thursday in Picardie.
No specific measure was considered on Wednesday night to restrict the circulation of hard weights.
The prefector "invites all motorists to the greatest talent on the roads and to adapt their ways accordingly."
The Civil Aviation Directorate-General (DGAC) requested the airlines to cancel 25% of their parlian airport flights from Roissy and 10% in Orly because of the coming neck cracks.
The DGAC recommends the air passengers to contact their company.
In Great Britain, the Gatwick airport, southern London, and Edimbourg in Ecosse, are closed until Thursday.
Metro Grand Paris: First financial investigations
Since the debate around the modernization of transports in Ile-de-France fights its full, the billions are pleasing.
In the debate at least.
In particular, 23 billions are called for the Grand Paris Metro, which must build the Grand Paris Society.
In order to start this SGP, the State announced a capital donation of 4 billion euros.
In the theory scheme, this sum will then allow the SGP to improving the markets a part of the financing of its double bucket.
Today, we are finally coming to the first addendums.
The 2010 Rectificative Finance Act, considered in the National Assembly's Commission on this morning, contains devices planned for the start of the money.
They are two: the creation of a special equipment tax and increased tax on offices in Ile-de-France.
The first, in the text of the draft law, is "for the benefit of the public establishment of the Grand Paris Society".
It is encrypted: "The product of this tax is EUR 117 million per year."
The second is a reamendement of a tax on the offices that already exists "for modernization, increase the product and impact this increase in the Grand Paris Society".
How much would it report?
Mystery.
This is not encrypted in the text.
We're away from 4 billion.
"It is pr√©cised that these tax resources are added to four billion euros of capital dotation which will be mobilized by the State and brought to the Grand Paris Society at the time and in the project", may be read in the statement of the reasons.
The SGP does not find this choquant system.
"Af the time that receipts are created (two taxes, ndlr) can be covered in three years and then tapping in four billions after, explain-en."
"There will be included in the budget and cut off and measured."
The SGP believes that four billions will begin to be included in 2013 for the 2014 budget.
This device, in which 4 billions are still subsequently subscribed, may cause a parliamentary debate a little harmed.
First Public meeting on 7 December.
Hackers and speechs in love
The WikiLeaks case has a double value.
On the one hand, it reveals a apparent scandal, a offence that appears as a scandal only before the hypocrisis that regulates the relationships between States, citizens and presses.
On the other hand, it announces deep changes at the international level, and prepares a future home by the Republic.
But process on order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks, is the confirmation of the fact that each document represented by a secret service (of any national) is exclusively of press crimes.
The "extraordinary" American reveals on the sexual customs of Berlusconi makes only reporting what could be read in any newspaper (except those which Berlusconi is own), and Khadafi's unfortunately caric profile was long for the artists of sketch matter.
The rules in which the secret folders must be composed only newly known are essential to the dynamic of secret services, not only in this century.
If you are going to a library dedicated to the Sovietary publications, you will see that every recurrent works (on the Graal, the mystery of Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, the Temples and the Rose-Croix) exactly what was already written in the previous works.
And this is not only because the author of hidden texts does not like to do inevitable research (not know where seeking news on the inxistent), but because those who want to serve the culture are believed only until they already know, and who recognize what they already learned.
It's Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same thing for secret folders.
The Informateur is parsis and parsis (or limited) the Head of Secret Services (unless it might be, I know, editor in Lib√©ration), which remain as true as it recognises.
The top secret information on Berlusconi that the American Ambassade of Rome was sent to the Department of State was the same as the newweek's week before.
So why did the revelations on these folders make so much sound?
On the one hand, they say what any person has already been collapsed, namely that the ambassades, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the Heads of State can be phoned or take a aircraft to meet dinner, lost their diplomatic function and, except a few small representation exercises, have been transformed into pioneering centres.
Any investigation shower knows that very well, and that's only by hypocrisy that it seems to ignore it.
However, the fact of reprehensive publicly punishes the duty of hypocrisy and serves to place under a bad light the American diplomacy.
Secondly, the idea that any hacker can capture the secrets of the world's most powerful secrets in the world takes an unrealisable occasion to the pre-apartment of State.
So the scandal does not make the victims as well as the "bourreal".
But let's come to the deep nature of what happened.
Jadis, at Orwell's time, could be able to make all power as a Big Brother who controled each manner of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy was completely advertised since, in order to control each movement through the phone, each transaction carried out, the host, the host's own self-employment and soon, the citizen was the victim of the power eye.
But when it is demonstrated, as it happens now, that even the ciphers of power secrets can not escape from the control of a hacker, the control report stops to be undirect and must be circulated.
The power of each citizen, but each citizen, or at least the hacker - chose as a venture of the citizen - can know all the secrets of power.
How can a power that no longer has the possibility of keeping his own secrets?
It is true, Georg Simmel said that a true secret is an empty secret (and empty secret may never be disappeared); it is also that everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is actually an empty secret, because relevant from the public area; but reveal, as the WikiLeaks did, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets mean to remove him all power.
WikiLeaks did no tort to Sarkozy or Merkel, but did too much to Clinton and Obama.
What will the consequences of this wounded wound to a very powerful power?
It is obvious that in the future, States will not have any reserved information on the street, which would return to publish it on a collapsed area on the coin of the street.
But it is too clear that with current technologies, it is worth hopeful to hold confident reports by telephone.
Nothing easier than discover whether and when a head of State moved to a aircraft and contacted one of his colleagues.
How can they be maintained in the future private and reserved reports?
I certainly know that, for the moment, my prevision depends on science-fiction and therefore is romantic, but I am obliged to imagite government officers who are discreetly in uncontrolled precautions to the uncontrolled engineers, while only portors learned by heart or, mostly, by casting the rare information written in the silver of a chausure.
Information will be stored in unique copy in key locked tires: at the bottom, Watergate's explosion tentative has been less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology is now in crab, that's how to relax.
A century after the non-Film telegraph renewed communications, the Internet has retained a telegraph on sons (telefonics).
The videocasts (analogics) allowed researchers to explose a film not by going forward and back and discovering all the mountain secrets, while now the CDs (numerical) are allowing only to escape in chapter, i.e. by macroports.
With the high speed trains, we go from Rome in three hours, while the aircraft and the movements it included needs three hours and half.
It is therefore not extraordinary that the policy and communications techniques returning to horse cars.
Last observation.
Another time, the press tried to understand what was involved in the ambassad secret.
These are the ambassades who require confidential information at the press.
Climat: How France bids its financial promises
An year after the Copenhague Agreement, it is time to consider the compliance of the outcome of rapidly developed financing promises (the fast start or precoces) made by the developed countries.
And the large French bidouillages are revealed.
In the Copenhague Agreement, developed countries were forced to provide $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union promised 7,2 billion euros in three years and France 1,26 billion euros (such as 420 million per year).
At the opening of the COP16, the EU has issued the great game to convince its partners of the reality of its commitment on fast funding: report details the action of its Member States, press conference, great event, brochures distribution...
Transparency is appreciable and appreciated to its fair value: developing countries and civil society would like all developed countries to do with the same level of specification.
The EU has declined in 2010,2 billion euros, which puts it on the right way to respect its commitment of 7,2 billion in 2012.
But when we look at the detail, things are more complicated.
This money must be, in accordance with the Copenhague Agreement, "new and additional" to ensure that an additional effort is carried out without the decline of public development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement on what means "new and additional".
While the European Commission had proposed harmonization, some Member States whose France have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the reference that is the best to him.
For example, the European Commission considered as a reference in 2009: international financing are maintained, and it adds 150 million per three years to fast start funding.
Other countries have chosen similar references in terms of year or in terms of public development assistance.
On the contrary, France believes that the funding of "all the new projects" in 2010 is "new and additional".
Otherwise, there is no reference to the expenditure of the previous years or to the global public assistance level for development.
Consequently, the total amount of France's support to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease), it intends to respect its commitment to "new and additional financing"...
Another crucial element, distribution between donations and readiness.
There, there is no rules and each chooses its calculation mode.
Some, like France, think that 1‚Ç¨ is equipped to 1‚Ç¨.
Of course, this is difficultly justified: the effort is not comparable.
If the use of loans can be justified for certain investments that are income (or projects relating to the allocation of emissions that are based on more effective technologies), it is difficult to present a euro that the euro will be recovered as equivalent to a euro that it gives... Nevertheless, it should not be accounted on its commitments that the cost of the pr√™t for the supplier country (as the equivalent of an interest rate).
However, France has only to do this reason: it is "respect" its commitment of 420 million euros by making 91.5% of the loans (389.8 million euros) and 8.5% of the donations (36.1 million euros) - see the EU's document to check by you.
It is the only Union country to use if it is massively ready.
Germany requires 46 per cent, while Germany, the Netherlands or Slovakia (and other) comply with 100 per cent of donations.
On the other hand, when the very large majority of the European Union is 1‚Ç¨ to meet its commitment, France is only 10 cents and considers that the challenge is comparable.
Good password tour!
In re-resuming, in its fast starting financing, France is working a double screening: one part on the evolution of action in time and otherwise on the reality of financial effort.
Although only 36,1 million euros, it is going to believe that it is in expenditure 420 million "new and additional" in coherence with its promises.
The manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (for it seems that it is Bercy who has done the arbitration) might have a double negative impact at the EU time (for what other Member States would continue to give if it is enough to provide?) and in the negotiations, as developing countries are not completely doubts...
The Chapter of the previous funding is only a small issue of short term, in relation to all climate debates.
But it could be a sable grain more than the UNFCCC machine.
Let's hope that this will not be the case.
Whatever it is, it is necessary to carry out the lessons of this first year of previous funding.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accounting mode for the years 2011 and 2012, in a spirit of respect for its commitments and equity with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, France could make the discussions on long-term financing gaps (other crucial chapter currently discussed): it will not be exempt to the question of "additionality" or the mode of accountability.
France could change its position to become so progressive on these enthusiasms that it is on others.
The hope therefore is on the new Minister of Environment, Mrs Kosciusko-Moritate, which will come to Cancun next week.
A surprise announce on the fast start of France and its vision of "additionality" and the use of loans would have increased the level of international confidence needed to progress in discussions.
Advertisement to children ' s petrols
A 10-year-old child leads to a 81-year-old chemical substances, according to a study published this mercury of the Futures Association (ex-Moviation for the Rights and Respect of future generations).
The association, which provides its results "no significant statistical value regarding the low number of analytical samples, but are illustrate of the treated problem", has bought between July and September the foods used in four springs and a day by a child of a ten years, in the oversights of Oise and Paris.
These type repairs, including official recommendations - five feed fruits and feed fruits, three milk products and 1,5 litres of water per day - as well as friandis, were examined by laboratorys in search for chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other polluants.
The asylum balance is accompanied: 81 chemical substances whose 42 are classified possible or likely cancers and five cancer-classed substances, and 37 substances that can act as endocrinian perturbants (PE), according to studies of several institutions such as the International Centre for Cancer Research.
"If, in the almost total of cases, legal limits for each chemical being taken individually are not exceeded, we are seen in our investigation that the reality of the exposure of consumers to cancer contaminants may be concerned and/or PE is concerned," notes the association.
For the little dinner, beer and milk contains more than one ten of possible cancer residue and three abortioners such as cancer cancers and near a twenty-year-old residue residue that can pervert the hormonal system.
The thumb, imported by Brazil, as in case of the study, presents traces of six chemical substances, which still prohibited in France.
Even something for the green arroths in Kenya, including the dinner, on which the study detected the traces of a powerful insecticism prohibited in the EU.
