Triunfo of the right of the people in Austria, together formed 29 %
The elections to the Austrian Parliament have been made according to the first approximate results, a appreciable debiliation of both parties from the current large coalition and an expressive strengthening of the party of the People's right.
A strong and special loss has suffered the Austral Popular Party (OVP), where the position of the current President, Wilhelm Molterer.
On the contrary, the Leader of the Aliance for the future of Austria (BZO), the Chief of the Government of the Caribbean State, Jörg Haider, prepared its triunfly return to national policy.
According to the approximate results, the Social Democracy (SPAU) remains as the strongest party in the country with a 29.8 percent of votes, so that a 5,5 percent of vote in comparison with the latest 2006 elections.
The OVP has still concluded that a 25.6 percent requires, almost nine percent votes.
These are the worst results, literally catastrophic, in the history of these two Australian large parts from the pogry and especially for the populars that have gathered these advanced elections.
Still at the beginning of July, when the OVP went out of the coalition, populars had a significant advantage in favour of the SPO.
However, it is clear that the voters have punished them to allow the Government to be dragged.
In the first reactions to the results, experts have been made on the demission of the Chairman of the Party and, until today, Vicanciller, Wilhelm Molterer.
The observers believe that this month could already be reached at the exceptional meeting of the Chairperson of the Party.
This clearly would facilitate the road of the constant and closer part point of the electoral results, i.e. the renewing of the great coalition between SPO and OVP.
In view of the strengthening of both parties from the People ' s right - liberals (FPO) gained approximately 18 percent and BZO, one percent of the votes - and that social democrates at the same time expressed their fears that it would be resumed in the same year 1999 when populars negotiated with peoples (the FPO was a unit, but in 2005 BZO was deemed to a coalition government that had come to generate a sanction by the European Union.
For this evolution it clearly adds Haider, which has already announced that he is ready to cooperate with any party and that he already refers to Vienna to national policy.
The Green Party has also been able to reach the parliament, even though he had lost lightly and descended from the third to the fifth position between the austrian political parties.
No other party clearly overlooked the limit of the four percent and therefore, not part of the parliament.
Blackenberg: Relations with India can be disappeared
If it is not possible to resolve the problem of the chemical scientists who have been accused in India by recovering illegally slaughtering could be reached to a disappearance of the Checo-Indical relations, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Karel Blackenberg.
This showed the minister in New York after today's meeting with his Indian Homolog, Pranab Mukherjee.
"If this would not be resolved then, then, if it would be securely reached to this disappearance," he remarked after the meeting organized by the Checa initiative.
Mukherjee said, after the meeting, that in legal matters it can difficultly make executive.
However, he revealed that in the case of Petr Úvácha, which was exempt of accusation and punishment with a lot, the government could negotiate with the local government of Darjiling in which jurisdiction was receiving the case.
"Your problem could be solved," said the minister.
For Emil Kučera, condemned to three years of prison, it would be the best, according to Mukherjee, to spend to the highest instances.
After this, it explicitly requested the exoneration of the cause and waiting for the sentence.
Blackenberg confirmed that his colleague was expressed in the same terms during the meeting.
"Associate the Supreme Court and then it would be the stuff," said the Chair of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way in how to enter into the matter the Checa Party is pursuant to the condemnation of a "Auditoral Support", the Indian Minister.
On the other hand, he said that such a type of support is already achieved by India.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining India the best relations, which have a long tradition.
The Indians also recognize it," commented Blackenberg.
On the other hand, as the Czech Republic said, before his colleague, stressed that the problem of the cheque enthusiasms was very important.
"We really consider a terrible error of the carrier and condemn these chess scientists," she announced.
The Minister commend the answer to the question whether he received from India the promise that it would be concerned.
"I have received enough promises," she just found.
A cheque claims a fight in the sea fund
I'm close to a wall's e-mail map, in which it represents the red sea Australia.
However, it is not interested in the continent but a small point lost in the blue ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and together the sea fund that runs it.
The region is, at the same time, both large as one continent, said the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who belongs to the thirty members team that work in the United Nations Division for Ocean Rights and the Sea.
Your head, Director of the Division, Chairman Václav Mikulka, continues the exhibition and sometimes it is complete.
Gobier this talent and enthusiasm of work.
The sea fund hides a little known world, rich in natural sources.
You can find petroleum and other mineral primary materials, but also unknown agencies to this day they take the key for development of medicinal products against cancer.
Fund is greater than the firm land
Costa countries have started today to discuss the new territorys under the sea.
According to the United Nations Treaty, these rights are used for the rights agreed in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is mainly the Continental Borde, which is some often exempt to hundreds of kilometres from the cost of the given country.
This has, in accordance with the Treaty, exclusive rights in all the resources of the continental border.
"Continently, by continental border is the part of the sea fund and its surface, which is natural continuation of the continent under the water.
It comes to the border of the sea coast, and often, to the border of the sea hundreds of thousands, i.e., clean economic area," he explains Mikulka.
The request given by the country to the Commission, for the delimitation of the external border of the continent, must be delivered by scientific documentation based on investigations and measures.
It is the result of a series of years of work preparing.
" One of our tasks is to organize a technical and legal assistance commission.
The Commission has made five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand to this day.
Now, only the three recently mentioned countries have gone forward," added Mikulka.
Not far ago, Australia's success had a global impact as he was the first which principally enlarged its sea dominio.
However, it also pursued New Zealand – the seaground surface that the commission had provided for him last week is 1.6 million square kilometres, i.e., almost six times more than the size of its own state.
Both countries invented millions of pain for their study.
The gain that will be removed from the use of the marine fund shall be, as promised, invaluable.
Other states are also submiting their requests at little.
You can do it up to the ten years since they ratified the "Trade of Montego Bay".
Where the continental border begins the ocean fund declared by the Treaty as " common heritage of humanity".
There's no nation has an exclusive position.
The right of exploitation in these areas is managed by the Treatys established by international institutions.
"The Sea Foundation, however, is not an gold mine," said the director Mikulka, adding " because its separate areas are legally restricted and clearly restricted and its contract-defined regime".
The Cheques in the Pacific
And today, a part of the marine fund also belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is divided with other countries of the East Block in the common organization "Intercean metal".
This took it in 1991 with a treaty as a inversors as other few States, named "the pioneer inverse".
He has a ability to explore in the area of ClarionClipperton in the Pacific Ocean, between Mexico, the Hawai Islands and Kiribati.
The area to investigate the inverse is something greater than the old Checoslovaquia.
The fund is there accidental, it is something as well as a marine replica of the Tastra.
"A total extension of 75,000 square kilometers can be exposed.
The area is rich in habitations of polymethanic convergence containing Niquel, coffee, cobalt and mangane," adds the Indian lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian employer of the Division, Rober Sandev, brings us a sample of this type of convergence.
We remember a little patated or with a little fantasy, the Shem, who, according to the league, lived in the Golem.
During the release of rehenses, the German special force command was on the place of action.
To solve the rehensive crisis, the Egypt Government had requested Germany's assistance, and experts came.
When the situation was serious, the command of special forces was ready, but the operation was not carried out.
More details are known on the circumstances of liberation of 11 European tourists in Egypt.
According to the data of the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Interior in salvation, the German special forces also participated indirectly.
As a result, there were Germany ' s specialists and GSG 9 officials, Federal Police Aviation Square, the Federal Criminal Research Office, also the experts in the field of logistics of the Beneficial Technical Institution.
As the ministry reported by the ministry by the night, the German forces were not needed because observers, taking into account a violent release, left their prisoners to escape.
The Egypt Government accepted Germany's assistance to use it as a support on the place.
"After it hasn't come this moment," said a prisoner of the Federal Minister for Interior.
On 19 September, asylums in the south of Egypt had secured a group of 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Roman and its eight Egyptian partners.
After the surrounding in the southern wilderness of Egypt, the rehenses brought them from one side to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of surveys was unknown until the end, as well as the details of release or possible payment of rescue.
As long as healthy and healthy people came to Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the released rehenses were under the protection of Germany's embarrassement.
He said no word about the details of release.
At the beginning in Berlin there was no information about the return of them to Germany.
According to the "Picture" period 5 tourists and special forces must return to Germany from the air forces and get to Germany on Tuesday.
The Chamber of Representatives of the United States does not approve the saving package
The first room of the United States Congress was lacking a large saving package of $700 million for the financial markets.
Dow Jones fell very drastically.
The Chamber of Representatives of the United States rejected 227 votes against 206 the package of the Government for salvation of financial markets.
Despite all calls by President George W. Bush and former both parties' politics have not come to most of the programme with which the disordination should be limited in the financial markets.
With a dramatic action, lost defenders still tried to convince criticians to accept the large package of $700 million.
Barney Frank, the leader of democratic negotiations had requested the Members to make a vote, although the plan is not so popular.
"It is difficult to receive political adoption to avoid something that has not yet happened," he admitted.
During the vote, Dow Jones fell to more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The cause of this was the concern of the investors that the State salvation package could break.
At the end of the vote, and after the fracase was made public, it was again falled.
Experts contain other serious turbulencies in international financial markets.
To stop entering the programme into force, the Chamber of Representatives and Senate is necessary to be adopted.
The organizations register the increase in the number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German travellers:
According to a study, the volume of sales of travel reservations for the next months increased in comparison with the past year - even the winter time of more than 30 percent.
According to a study, despite the debilitated coycling, the desire of traveling from Germans remains as before.
As the Monday informed the association of travels from Germany (DVR) in Berlin, with travel reserves for the winter time, the travel offices registered a volume of sales which is 31 per cent more in comparison with the same period of the past year.
According to the GfK market investigation Institute, the reservations for the months of October were already submitted.
So the volume of sales of travel agencies in October was almost once percent in comparison with 2007, the DVR informed.
The basis of the results is GfK numbers that are analyzed information on reserves in 1200 travel agencies and approximately composed for the whole market.
The data collected are the travel reservations carried out until the end of August 2008.
Because of the tank rate on all travels to the United States, DRV was greatly requested.
In this case, the number of reservations increased almost one third.
The favorite destination points in German are not only Spain, Turkey and Greece, but also the regions of Germany.
Over all organized trips are very favorite, Klaus Laepple, President of the DRV.
In view of the fact that energy and food prices increase, in this case travel expenditures are "much calculable for the customer during a individual trip".
Among other things, consumers can provide money with anticipated reservations or with All-Including offers, explained Laepple.
In the months of summer, the travels were well reserved, so that the volume of sales in comparison with the past year was reared - even though after another study, the number of Germans performing a travel, comparing the past year, was fallen.
My first Octoberfest
The Hits of the festivals under the sky open in the Balneary without end, the brain in a lithrough and the famous people clothed in traditional beachs of designers.
A debut in a campaign tent.
Really Susanne Kronzucker and I don't have much in common.
It is rubber, the moderate in the television and brings a traditional bacterian trail at measure.
I have the dark hair, I'm a student and my clothes are already used.
But there's something that we are: we're still at campaign, the photographs have already split to us and have filled their memory cards with photos - it's very lowly because I'm first in October.
So makes friends.
The traditional Bavarat Bavary traces seems to fulfil its role.
In fact, as a tourist in the north of Germany, my feelings of well-being with a traditional Arab trap to this day was still limited.
But after coming to the Prado of Teresa, everything is not so much.
Similarly all the world brings the traditional bought or cut pantalons; no one seems to be drunk or feel ungrateful - everything is absolutely normal.
Only my deanal receives rare looks on the side of a platan status in the chocolate.
One municipale calls my attention on my manner that I had put on wrong manner: "The left part is sudden, half is the virgin, on the right side is committed, then is widow."
Oh, my God, now I'm back behind the left.
"It's okay," he says nothing.
The others do not worry about many of the sustainable methods to flirt and take hots where it is written "To drink to be clothed!" and show, without throwing them, their naked ass.
A young guy who has been conducted in exhibitionist way called Bob, is England and is also first in October.
He looks like "gorgeous," what pronounces with a "o" very long.
I got it after I had put her vessel on the side of a brass lit that's finished drinking.
He put it directly on the side of the fire mouth, most thinks that it's a basket cube.
Then Bob is one of the famous people who know a lot drink.
Others do not have much luck and can't consume so much alcohol.
On the eight of the night, health groups go through the feast and have to worry about poor guns.
Healthers always appear in the group - at the same time, four people are who bring the covered speeds from a campaign team to the other.
This works as with most visitors: Sovereign arrivals, return ridds.
It's not seen who suffers the levels of alcoholic and is in the wheels.
"They are those who "not more," said a healthy response to me, answering my question and disappearing in the tumor.
Excise of accident identified by the police
The 63-year-old peaton has been identified after being killed by a car in the Essex road.
Carole Paulson, of Chemsford Road, in the city of Brentwood, was involved in the accident that happened in Shenfield Road afternoon.
The woman was brought to Queen's Hospital at Romford, but later he died.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested under the drug conduct suspect.
Since then, it has been released under fianza.
Turkey enlarges its diplomatics
Before Turkey had been a member of the European Union, European powers encouraged the desire to fall into this country.
In the eastern part of the Baossforo, perhaps only 20 steps within Asia, is one of the most interesting of the imperial ambition.
The Hidarpasha train station was designed by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu, in a new-renacentist style.
At least, this is what the leaders say.
The building is ordered to prepare the end of the platforms and bring two tours, one for each area, compared to all a typical German accommodation.
The stone is sweet.
The building in your complex is a little decade.
But once the ball overwhelmed, there is no doubt of what was the largest of the company that this was the West door.
The station was inaugurated in August 1908 by the German consortium Anatolia-Bagdad Corporation.
Germany, a "laccomer" in the imperial game, had the ambition to dominate the Middle East through this rail that was covered to Damascus, Bagdad, and more than today Saudi Arabia.
However, the ambitions of this imperial Germany have disappeared during the First World War.
His fresh roads were attacked by the Arabian Lawrence and their irregular Arabs.
With regard to the island of the circumstance regions generated by the congelated borders of the Fry War, low
the British dominio and when the forces progressed in Egypt, drove Turkish and German partners outside Palestinian and Syria.
The news were also bad for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train of munitions explosed destroying its technicians.
Turkish sources commented that it was a sabotae.
Since then the station was decayed and left the marge of the history.
But today, this railway door, the entrance door to Anatolia and all the eastern centres, serves - at least symbolally - to emphasize Turkey's will to extend its diplomatic horizons.
The Government ' s Justice and Development Party planned a new external policy for the country.
The relative island of the circumstances, generated by the congelated borders of the Fry War, has been disappeared.
There is now a new cooperation policy.
The Turkish Government maintains excellently good relations with Israel and Syria, both Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To appreciate the parameters of this new external policy, I went up to a letter and went to the Ankara Turkey capital to visit one of the AKP leaders, expert in the external policy, the Turkish Minister Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning - one ten hours later - after a saudi trip, which produced the caddences of the former world in the famous documental The Night Mail, I came to the Turkish capital - a new city, thought to control a new secular state away from the past Otoman.
However, the AKP, with its clear islamic races, represents a paradigmatic change in the Turkish consensus
which has raised some suspects in West and, in particular, in Washington.
A taxi leads me to the AKP site, a ultra-style and steel-modern structure - built ad hoc - in a development suburbio, rolled by built by middle commercial centres and "powerer paths" where the media class managers of business leading - men and women - gather together at the first hour of the morning to make business agreement/making.
The Kiniklioglu Suat could be a central policy of almost any party in Europe.
I'm sure he's still having a Blackberry.
"The goal of the outer policy of the party is to return to Turkey into its immediate neighbourhood.
The Fría war was an annomaly," she said to me.
Turkey has been cut in relations with its inside.
Today, you need to look at the east and west at the same time.
It is not a case if it is not towards one or another.
She's got to do both things.
"But certainly at some time," asking him, "Turkia might be obligation to choose?"
"Turkia," he answered, "not wants to deceive this choice."
Following, he subscribes a point that almost all I have spoken to this time have been pretty memory: the relationships Turkey have not only with the Middle East but with the Caucasus region, and with all the Black Sea, represent a benefit for Europe and the United States as to Turkey.
The message seems to be: with Turkey on the boat, Europe in its complex can be metafhorically accompanied by these rail lines which open the world towards East Asia and the Middle East.
Once again at the Hydarpasha station, after another night without sleep, my thought returned to the two German ladies, Mr Ritter and Mr Conu, who attended the construction of this building, over 100 years ago.
How much would Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East be, mostly, today in Turkey's hands?.
And while waiting for the terminal, the ferry that will bring me back through the Batsforo, I agree that Turkey was considered "the sick man of Europe."
Then there are no many doubts in which it will be the continent to revital this fascinating country.
Recording views: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: Whose musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (esquela, 11 September) was responsible for the Guildford Orquest Orquest Orquest.
As part of the musical project for the city, in the next year, he founded its magnical core of youth, Proteus.
It is supposed that it should be for less than 21 years, but at the time the Proteus sing his end in 1979, several of us were ending the 20 years - only we refuse to give up the core.
The name of "Proteus" (the changed metological being of the forms) represented the core will and capacity to execute any music that is presented to him, either madrigal or Messian, indifferently if not accompanied or with full orquest.
The musical versatility produced by this core of youth was often surprised, always emotional, and everything was due to the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for music that continued to be absolutely constant for the years.
Often Death told us to "again the music to speak for himself."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
It's all in music.
So just needs to sing!"
His variety was always absolutely clear and accurate, although never imposed, nor too flowed.
Everyone outside the scardar musical, always ended at an even greater level.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any leader should have been a gun, this is Vernon Handley.
I was very well known for the two decades in Guildford’s Guildford Philharmony from 1962 to 1982.
In particular in the last 40 years, I have revised more than 100 of their concises, and I can honestly say that, for no one, I have never been deceived – otherwise, often I have been inspired by them.
Handley had this rare combination of personal size and extremely modest.
He hated the leaders who, in his words, simply, were "one or two horses of war very well known throughout the world."
We'll be missing much less.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In his scene of William Woodruff (25 September) he states that "In 1946 the economic story studies in Oxford and in 1950 won a Houblon-Norman Research cup... at the same time he studied for a licensing title, one of masters and one of doctors."
This is learned in a note of the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is not completely correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history in the University of Nottingham, during which he completed a doctoral techs on the industry of the British Caucho, supervised by professor J.D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 with the title The British Rubber Industry.
He passed the years between 1950 and 51 in the United States, enjoying a beach of Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 in the Universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he finally left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason because Woodruff opposed to pass this part of his cart, it is not known.
J. Vicente Resino in Philology Facultad
"Recommending the exhibition of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco and Life", because its photographs in white and black, documental style, are fantastic.
They called me to care for their simpleness and for the power they transmit, always being treated to the protagonists with much respect.
An exhibition showing a lot of feelings.
Resino knows to catch magic moments."
Second stage for Honda's supervents
In November, Honda will begin the marketing of the second generation of Jazz.
If his previous man had already contained a wide location, this new monovolum presents an even larger internal space.
To all this, refined mechanicals are subject to increased conductiveness and allow more fuel.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Jazz presents a very similar line to the model that happens, the changes introduced in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, a new design, a new platform, larger sizes and new mechanics can be indicated.
However, before an analysis of the new model, it is necessary to comment that this new Jazz is going to be six years after entering the first generation in the market.
Therefore, a first comment is that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than employed by other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Jazz is less known, in other markets this model is a phenomenon of sales.
This is the case of Japan, a country where Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Precisely in Japan they were sold near a million of Jazz units since his launching.
The second market was the old container, with around half million units in six years.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz allows to increase sales in the segment.
Thus, while the Japanese signing was sold to a total of 83,000 Jazz units in 2007, in 2009, estimates were approximately 100,000 cars, which would be 17% growth in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, Honda has marketed a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, which is 6.7% of Honda's total sales in Spain.
With regard to the new generation, the Spanish filial responsible wait for sale 2.000 Jazz's units in a complete year.
Precisely the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to make the decline of sales in Spain.
In fact, trade unions are expected to finalize the year with a total of 22,000 marketed units, which is at least 4.000 less than in 2007, 16% lower.
Despite this increase in Honda sales, its market quota has increased in Spain, reaching 1,8 per cent, compared to 1,6 per cent of the past year.
The Japanese signature also hopes to reach 2 per cent in 2010.
To achieve this Honda quote, it trusts the arrival of another new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid of five gates and compact size - 4,37 meters of length - of which the Japanese company expects to commercialize about 200,000 units every year.
By markets and according to the estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50 per cent of the insight sales will be produced in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be divided between the old Continent and Japan.
Insight's commercial launching is planned for the first months of the year, once its presentation is made in society in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its cats.
The length reaches up to 3,90 meters (5 centimeters more), the width to 1,69 metres (two centimeters above) and the distance between eggs to 2.50 meters, which is an increase of five centimeters.
The height, in turn, would not go and stay in the 1,52 metres.
Along with the increase in size, the internal room also increases.
This gain must be, on the one side, included a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of the fuel deposit in central position, a solution adopted in the former Jazz.
Furthermore, the malter capacity - which has a double fund system - reaches up to 399 litres, 19 litres more of the maltrate of the first generation.
It should be noted that these measures are the version of the engine 1.4, as the capacity of Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - besides external elements such as poster readers or the possibility of uploading the panoramic cristal - is an improvement in the access to the back spaces.
And it is that the doors that give access to the second fill present an opening angle of 80 degrees, against the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
The engines are also new in this second generation of Jazz.
This small model shall contain two gas oil propulsors of 1,2 and 1.4 litros at the start of its marketing.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that enjoys a smaller consumption, emitted less carbon emotics, enjoys an excellent mechanical refinance and at the same time reaches a high portion in all the motor systems.
The first mechanical of 1,2 litres has a power of 90 horses to 6,000 revolutions with a maximum of 114 nm. to 4.900 rounds.
This propulsor - which previously reached 78 horses - presents a expenditure of 5,3 litres and 125 grams of CO2 emissions.
Respect to the previous propulsor, that in the previous generation lobby 83 horses now goes to 100.
This Jazz 1.4 of 100 horses enjoys a combined consumption of 5,4 litres and 128 grams of CO2.
The "abeja" who prevents colissions
To progress in the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents of Nissan, this time, in the nature, in particular, in the grounds.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, taking the flight of the aircraft, avoid accidents.
This is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C that offers the first step in collections prevention technologies.
The engineers of the Technical Centre Advanced by Nissan Motor Co. It has developed this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Science and Technology Advanced from the Tokyo University in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Public Relations Director and Research and Marca Management Management, the BR23C is presented as an expanding of the Nisan Security Exploitation Exploitation of four areas.
This robot has an intention to strengthen the capacity of prevention of the collection of the vehicles of the brand.
During its flight, each abeja creates its own personal space with a valied form that seems much to the Nissan Security Escudo.
But most important are the eyes of the abeja, which are able to see with an angle of more than 300 degrees in all directions, which allows you to fly without interruption within their own personal space.
To get this visual function, engineers designed what they called a Laser Range Finder (Laser Range Finder).
This detects the obstacles available to two metres of distance within an 180 degrees before the BR23C radio, calculates the distance to that object and sends a sign to a micro processing micro processor that is immediately translated to the prevention of the colocy.
"In the time that you detect an obstacle, the small robot will follow the movements of a shot and immediately change in direction by turning its roads in the right or greater corner to avoid the colosion.
The greatest difference with any existing system is that the evasion manager is totally instinctive.
If it was not so, the robot would not be able to react with enough fastness to avoid the obstacles," Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobility Laboratory and main engineering of this project.
On the contrary of a pit, the robot can't be moved up or down, or in diagonal; only can be moved into two sizes and in the direction that allows you to turn their roads and not in infinite directions and ways such as abuses.
For this reason, Nissan has used a rotation function, besides acceleration and desacceleration, so that the small robot prevents collections.
"This device only needs to process information every few seconds and act according to these data.
Do not need to keep information or intuitive logic of previous managers, so you can continue to work with only a couple of memory 12 KB.
This may be surprised, but we're not talking about memory gains, nor even of mega."
This is the first step to develop new collectively preventive technologies, a technology that Nissan Vatican will be introduced into series cars within ten years.
The robot uses polymer battery battery, which are lighter and will harder than the variety of lits.
Another possible future application of this technology could be the integration of the unit with a satellite browser GPS system to lead the driver to your destination by avoiding the obstacles on the road.
Temporary before hypotecs
It must be recognized that the Department of the EEUU Team is not fair of engine.
Before the crisis, and to avoid the fact that the United States are embarked in low-based hypothecs in questionable solution banks, they have created an amend and information game for the browser: 'Bad Credit Hotel'.
Or, the "Hotel of bad credits"... or the lions.
The technological aspect of this accommodation and especially of your receptor is to think one, two and three times if it is time to ask a credit.
And, above all, where to do, what probably is your goal.
This is that he has useful information, but little detailed.
It's more a page for adolescents than a site for all publics.
What if the game is complete?
Because it appears a bedroom in the hotel.
Something's something, because we buy a better house and we don't talk...
Morgan Stanley sales MUFG participation
Morgan Stanley announced the entry into its Commonishi Finance Group (MUFG), the first Japanese Bank, which would discharge nine million dollars to acquire 21% of its capital, a news that has been accepted with a strong low bottle.
One week after discovering an provisional agreement, both banks explained that MUFG would buy $9,9 per cent of the ordinary Morgan Stanley actions at the price of $25.25 or $3 million.
The agreed price is lower than 19 % of the account value of the titles at 31 August.
MUFG will invest six thousands of additional dollars with the purchase of conversional titles, which will ensure the performance of 10 per cent and a conversion price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said that the global operation would be performed as a basis of a cost of $29, or a 28% above its current change.
Morgan Stanley action, however, lost 6.79% to 23.07 dollars each at 17:00 GMT.
"This strategic partnership is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley to the bank holding status ", explained John Mack, the Secretary-General of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which would have to allow you to diversize its activities but it is going to pass under the authority of the Federal Reserve.
His partnership with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis to the larger names of Wall Street is to take a more prudent behaviour than before.
Moreover, the modalities presented in the past month show that the agreement was amended during the last days: Morgan had announced that Morgan would sell up to 20 per cent of its Japanese actions for almost $8.5 million.
" A week ago, explained in Tokio Toshide Mizuno, the Executive Director of MUFG, " we thought that the participation was only composed of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation of the economy and the market, we wanted to minimize the risks and cover us."
With the base of the average price, MUFG will pay its titles Morgan Stanley at 7% under its account value.
And the operation will be translated by a dilution of about 20 % of the benefits by action.
The Agreement provides that MUFG may become the half of its preferred titles in regular actions if they are sold with more than 50 per cent above the conversion price, or be at $ 47 more or less, for a given period.
Morgan Stanley ensures that MUFG's capitals will allow you to cooperate investment opportunities, strengthen its balance and increase their liquidity.
However, a group ' s portrait was refused to give precise decisions on the strategic projects of the two new partners.
After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should show an animal solution ratio nearly 15%, one of the best of the sector.
Morgan precised that its balance had much disappeared since the end of August.
The last weeks were expensive for the group, which saw its cotisation in bottle down half while security costs against a risk of defects on their debt was disappeared.
This cost returned the past month but remained at a high level, about 12 per cent.
The past week, Goldman Sachs, the only "supervey" of the great investing banks of Wall Street after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the buy of Merrill Lynch, announced $15 million in part for Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffect group.

Letters - Cultural Mayoria
A debate on the financing of culture makes the lacks and occupates the current electoral campaign.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains always forgotten.
Who will be raised to declare the lacking sums granted to small museums, files, archaeological excavations or national historical places die from hunger?
What political will be pressed to remember the Federal Government to disappear his monuments and heritage buildings?
Why do we do not have true laws that actually keep our inheritance as in Canada and Quebec?
Did you know that the French government dedicates three million and average euros to restore it only the Chino's castle in the Loira valley?
In the United States, it is written in the Constitution that heritage protection is part of the culture of the United States and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all elected and all government departments, and all this, in concertation.
In Quebec, in the Federation of History Society of Quebec, at least 40,000 people revolutioned in 211 story societys, heritage, files and genealogy are concerned about the history, keeping with little money of private files and keeping archeological clothes.
These are often the dogs of our heritage, who protest with energy and disappointment when promotors and responsible lay their bulldoers against our old stones and our forgotten cementaries.
How long, a monument for history and heritage?
The Netherlands Governments nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank.
The Netherlands States, as the first in Europe, will assist the Slovakia Bank with a nationalization in the Fortland Bank, which is in a slightly due to the impact of the North American market crisis: the three countries will support in total 11.2 million euros to this financial and insurance institution that also has business in Hungary.
This weekend, the Governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and Holland have held higher consultations with the President of the European Central Bank and the responsibility of the European Commission's economic competence.
Fortis Bank is the first that has suffered the euro area crisis within the international financial crisis which is produced in several olive oils more than one year ago, so the decisions taken on the Bank may, in some sense, be considered as previous.
In accordance with the decision taken on the Sunday, the three States shall buy approximately half (49 percent) of the ownership of the Bank in their area.
The Bank with all security will sell a part of their business, among them, in particular the activities - mainly of insurance- buyed over the past year of the Hungarian ABN Amro.
The actions of the Fortis started a strong decline last week and for the second half of the week were seen important crises in the institution.
However, analyzers agree that with 85 thousand employees this Bank is too large as to allow it to be desired.
The company’s actions only saturday reduced a 12 percent, as this is the lowest point in the last 14 years.
Since January, the value of the actions reduced more than two thirds.
Noteing the current prices of the actions, the total value of the group capital in the market is approximately 14 million euros, but according to the executives of the company is not real.
The Bank ' s direction imposed the fall of the Fortis ' actions to the North American market insecurities as regards the adoption of the American package plan of $700 million.
Monday, actions showed a lower increase.
The Thursdays were appointed to Philp Dierckx as a new bank director.
The Bank also seeked particular investors, but no one has given a specific offer.
The Belgian government had already been secured that the investors had no concern, but would not lose their money.
Among the bank customers have not been produced any pound, they have not invaded the bank offices to get their money.
The Fortis has its own carrier in Hungary and has also bought leasing companies.
Smoke in the galliner
In the United States, health insurance and enterprises when seeing the data of the acquis of medicines, often refuse to sign a insurance contract.
The specialists of the privacy policy fear that the market of personal data is incontrolled.
"There are personal data protection programmes, which is one of them to the approval of the given person in all cases.
The same must be in independent hands, because if not, "we trust the road gallinero" - quote Washington Post to Richard Dick, designer of the medical recruitment programme.
Safety companies are dependent on the price of the insurance and compensation of the customer's health status and if they believe that the risk is excessive, they simply do not make the contract.
Before they sent to the medical control client and signed the contract with him, knowing the outcome of the control.
Dick has 10 years ago invented a more barried procedure: with the customer identification number, the list of medicinal products bought in the last and medium year and the program has concluded the customer's diseases and the health status.
For example, if he takes systematically large past doses to reduce colesterol, indicates that the fat level of the blood is practically high, so it is immediately included in a higher risk category.
A number of versions of the programme, some have also set a number of risks, so the insurance company is to have something to do, although there are small difficulties in this regard.
For example, some medicines are multiused, for example, some substances serve as to treat head pain as calor oils and even as antidepressive.
The last is an important risk increase factor for insurance companies while the first is not.
Special companies were represented to consult and process these data, which were before obtaining the pharmacists the necessary information, request the approval of the patient.
The authorities are already bound to this, although they have not received much for the disappearance from now.
Some companys also lastly develop the results of the laboratory reviews and linking them with medicine consumption data have more specific information on the status of patient health.
Every more company has access to these data and simultaneously is always more difficult to control their use.
There is a exclusive law for the protection of personal health data, but only applicable to health care companies and health services.
It is already before the Congress the draft law entitled to the authority for the control of specialized companies for the delivery of personal data.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is insufficient: therefore it has developed its program, which will require the specific approval of the person to provide its own personal data.
It is another question that this person cannot deny its approval, because if not the insurance companies will not sign the contract with him.
So the gallins, despite all, are exposed to the good will of the steel.
Marsella Global Menu
The European Union duplicates its trade with India
As the European Union and India are mutually commercial partners, this theme also addressed the agenda of the ninth Summit.
Today a Franc-Indian Summit will be held in order to mainly address nuclear cooperation.
Although the European Union recognizes that India is a great democratic development power that should be voted and voted in international affairs, but Member States have not yet been able to reach a common denominator if they should support New Delhi as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
This question has not been addressed in the ninth summer beginning in Marsella.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, President of the EU, José Manuel Barroso Chairman of the Commission and Javier Solana, the chief representative of the external policy, received Manmohan Singh, first Minister of India with which they have reached an agreement to duplicate in five years, i.e. increased more than 100 million euros, its commercial exchange.
In view of the fact that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods increased from 25 million to 55 million, this is not an extremely ambitious objective.
Thus harmonized legally the twentieth bilateral civil aircraft conventions with India, so the air transport can also fly in the future.
India until the end of 2009 wants to sign the Union's free trade treaty.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate negotiations.
The goal is the balance, since the EU is the first trade partner of India, New Delhi only contains in the ninth place between the Union trade partners.
The summit focused on global matters.
Both the parties condemned the Afghan and Pakistan and the terrorism, all of the forms of that last, and the convocation of a United Nations conference.
The conclusion of the Doha trade liberalization round was also endorsed, although both parties have great responsibility in their fraction.
The EU confirmed that its energy and climate programme would be covered, i.e. until 2020, he wanted to reduce contaminating emissions at least a 20 percent.
India is also agreed with this, as at the Climate Conference of the next year, it should be reached to a global agreement and reduced up to 2050 with a 50 percent of the production of gas that produces winter effect.
They also wish to stress the increase in food prices and support the convocation of an international conference to revise financial crisis.
Today, the Chief of India's Government will travel to the French capital where - at a bilateral meeting - will sign a peaceful agreement on nuclear energy use.
I think that French companies will receive carriers for a value of 20 million euros to build nuclear reactores.
According to news agency information, the agreement would be for a 15-year period.

The Commissioner stated that there were no human rests or in the aircraft nor around.
The Millennium, 63 years, has been dead in February.
The American Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) has known that some hours after the aircraft of the rest, a research team has been sent to the device: it was own of Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed since 3 September 2007, when Fossett dismissed from Yerington to Nevada by a flight of three hours.
Tomorrow, always in California, not far from Nevada's front, some personal rests of Fossett have been found by a couple near your house of Mammoth Lakes.
It is two documents with the name of Fossett, the two issued by the Federal Aviation Aviation of Illinois, effective money and sustainment.
Fossett's search had been interrupted a month after their disappearance.
The Millennium has been acquired a post in the history thanks to a long series of privileges.
In 2002, the sixth attempt was converted to the first man to complete the world's round in a aircraft: two solemn flight weeks.
Three years later, he had made the around the world in airline and without scales.
Among their records, also those for flowing to 15,445 meters of height, on the Andes, but with a coplet.
Glk, the publicity you don't expect.
A Suv out of the screens with a original design and well established with defined lines and rings.
This is, in syntesis, Glk the last birth between the camions all the "compact" field of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a news window in this sector.
Proply by the content outside the traditional, it will be expected and not conventional, the communication that will meet the launching of the suv Glk, available in the Mercedes-Benz exhibition rooms from the next 17 October.
The public campaign that joins the deployment of the new car launchs an inevitable communication modality through a 3D public campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a self-mobilistic brand.
A project with maxi-poosters, recorded in three different phases, which dominates the central Milani shopping street as arrived as until 15 November.
The first stage of this new type of communication starts with the presentation of the car in esteroscopic version and thanks to special donations distributed in the arrival As you can see the new suve in almost real sizes and in threedimensional format.
Effectively, looking for the image will be the printing that the car goes outside the potter.
Successfully, through the use of the innovated Elumine8 new Glk will be lighted in different times in all of its details, to be recommended in a single image.
Instead of certain Mercedes with this publicity, you're trying to introduce something new in the self-mobil communication.
Can this formula take the interest of the future buyers?
It's clear who are the Italian Hooligan
In the Third, the prohibition of access to sports manifestations is played.
But who are these 150-200 girls and girls whose Italy is now confused? There are part of the "Urra Italy" group that remains for years and that, until now, the truth, has never been created too many problems.
And never were found with the rival fantasies.
The extraction of the group is right.
Promotors come from the Trivente.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These Sofia have been added a small group (a few units, actually) from Campagne and Apulia.
There are three-color bands where the city of military origin appears: Saturday per night has been taken out so that they are not identified.
They are inspired to English fantasies.
In Bulgaria, they have found a group of real national fantastics, the Levski.
The Figc had been available from Italian fantates 144 items for the game: all already with the names, so easily controlable.
And the minister of the Interior had already controlled them all: among those who had gone out to Sophia there was no one with a Defence ( prohibition of access to deportive events) at that time, no one who had forbidden him to fresh a stage.
At four Italian fans, who had previous crimes in stadios, they rejected the bill and travel.
Now, the Ministry of the Interior is expected to read the acts arrived from the Bulgarian police to take measures: in this case, it is possible to give the Decrease ( prohibition of access to proportional events) for five years as at least the fantastics that have been arrested or who has been identified in the disorders.
A Deep (interruption of access to deportive events) international that prevents not only the Italian statistics but also those of all Europe.
Our hooligans, they don't have to stand in a stadium.
Successfully!
But now it is the fear of the imitation: that those few fifty, are added to others.
"We must pursue this fire and do not legitimate who acts in this way," said the Ministry of the Interior.
Therefore, "goods good open" above all in view of the game of the National Middle at Lecce."
In Apulia there is also a small point of supporters in Utras Italy.
Morning the Observatory, the Tuesday, the Cams that can also mention a section of the Aise (Information and External Security Agency, i.e. the secret service, which is responsible for the problems in the statistics.
"The hearts of Duce-Duce and the arm elevated during the wine of Mameli? In Bulgaria is not a reato ...."
This is the thought (expressed in a little happy way) from Sundayico Mazzilli, the Director of the Observatory of the Ministry of Interior (He took the position before it was from Francesco Tagliente and after Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was the Chief of Public Safety Trieste, where there was a number of employers in the Urras Group of Italy, founded in 2002.
It's true, as says Mazzilli, that in Bulgaria is not weak to celebrate the Duke but if, the behaviour of those 150-200 fantastics that have been confused.
"I don't do the sociologist – add No.1 of the Observatory – the reactions of granted in the countries where the fact happens.
Until now this group has been conducted well now, we will see what happened and we will take it into account for the future.
But we also do the silver at Mameli's wine: these are not a reato, but if they don't allow them to be also from education..."
