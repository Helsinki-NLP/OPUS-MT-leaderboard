It seems to be a typical rugby club.
In English university, maybe...
Nothing to see with the rugby clubs I know at NZ.
But it doesn't justify anything, isn't it?
Of course not, but the premature that says it's current in the rugby is all the big...
Yes, finally, we don't stop musulman prayers and we do not cut the neck of person during the drinking games (without it is part of the game), but we are actually sweet in black for some disappeared evenings.
I never played a Nazi's Nazi theme.
Yeeha and Ride the Bus are sufficient.
I left a similar comment on the previous article because the language and the feeling expressed in the perspective of the students of the first year, I was very typical.
This says, this new information will not make any doubts to my eyes that they're going well far than the myogyn plates and blagues under the company of alcohol that often associates university rugby teams.
The incident with musulman students shows particularly that they are trying to provoke maximum.
You really don't know anything to rugby clubs.
But let's go, why do you leave your prejudices and your stereotypes to bring the facts?
I imagine that the rugby LSE team is a tradition of old students of these schools for which competition rugby is a tradition.
Otherwise, the old boys from the private.
It is very different of those playing rugby in NZ, very different attitudes.
The “misogyn plates” are therefore acceptable?
It would be the rugby club of my university, I never saw racist behaviour, but the courses driving through the campus, the flight, the damage of goods and the mission would be all parts of the game.
Of course not.
I'm sorry I didn't express it in my last comment.
You can see it otherwise: Are you saying that your own body is part of this ancient water.
I'm gonna win in series.
Indeed, this interstal cloud also (or not traditional:)
@lux You have not read the article: a small half of the water of your past has more than 4,6 billion years...
Yes, well, you can even consider that past flower has easily more than 2.3 billion years, which is not so bad than that.
A holy feet of nut to the catastrophists and heats of any powder that predicts us the end of the oceans and water resources, while that water is still present.
A irrefusible evidence that the recovery has been arrested 20 years ago (see the remarkable work of Serge Ferry funded by Total and Areva).
@manon too: What is a proof that the removal has stopped?
I don't see the link.
I believe Manon Troppo's comment is ironic.
Hey, and for the second degree and irony you have what's like signaling?
So you don't understand greatly about ecological problems.
It is not a question for the “Catholics” as you say to worry about the disappearance of the oceans but rather about the reduction of the water reserves that consume by humans (You know the smooth water that represents less than 1% of total water reserves on our planet).
And then more generally this is not the climate recovery that is the most missing for our species but mostly the reduction of small or not renewable resources (gas, petrole, rare metal) which supports our live modes of more worse.
With regard to the study you quote and which you make the generous efforts to cite the source, it is of course little doubt about the effectiveness of the conclusion.
As regards the sweet water problems, I'm going to raise you the French are far from being concerned xD Then it is necessary to stop consider ecology as a dogme without fashion, the bucket of the ozone cot is to refer to quietly (em 100% for 2050 to the current ritm).
Ecology yes, religiously dogmatic and irritated ecology, not thanks.
"After it must be stopped considering ecology as a dogma without fail, the bottle of the ozone break is to move quietly" yeah, it is not like if it was a spontaneous movement that would not happen to anything.
@martin: I just want to specify that climatic heating is a need for if we emit too much CO2 our land will appear to Venus.
A serre that, through the action of oxygen, will take heat without release it and that in a victory circle will accelerate the screen process as exponential.
Did anyone see direct actions until now?
Or the less sign indicated that 10,000 good men would come on the ground to plant trees and do what a green army is supposed to do, what could be well?
Unfortunately, I'm not!
In the small brain of Abbott, perhaps send the RAAF to the Middle East is its version of a direct action.
We're going to repair, it's certain.
When are they going to get away from this idiot from the village?
The latest revealings that the vegetation would be 16% of CO2 more than any possible climate model give priority to replant.
This is not logical, since CO2 is food of the most abundant plants in nature, and it is necessary to keep the flower throughout the world.
It seems that this scientific fact has never been placed.
Did you see the army green somewhere?
Don't do anything, dear government.
CO2 levels increase from 280 ppm at 400 ppm and the rate is increased, your argument of the plant food is only a false disorder.
And before you start your green against Dooms wall, the most abundant CO2 is not the nitrogen and the soup.
The most abundant of bio-generated materials may be carbon, but it doesn't mean that it's the most abundant green, so Silverhead argument is unfortunate and merit to be ridiculized.
Direct Action is a fashion, because it can't happen again.
The LandCare budget was seriously reduced and this money is now paid by the Verte Army.
The problem is only instead of investing the money where it was the most well-being, it is now investing where he will receive the most publicity to remontate liberals to the marginal electoral.
Your contribution, in turn, mix the price of ignorance, a good campaign.
SilverHead, when there is too much CO2 in the air, plants make less photosynthese and contain less nutrition.
This means that animals and people must eat them in much more quantities to benefit from their nutritional well-beings.
That the deputy may be puery is a clearness.
Until now, it has not submitted academic rigidity certificate that prevents it to disappear from the rules of the XVIIe.
As soon as to sanctify him and not to Theevenoud, it is uncomprehensive for a worldless, even if the AN Regulation is not a fiscal treaty.
That this lady does not have any case to be honored, especially it seems like hystery.
If Mitterrand had put on the friend who were about to Mirann...
I remember that in the debate on the femininization of names, the "Academy" was denied: "Let's say to Mrs Lady or the Sceaux guards" (a post that which has never been occupied by a woman until there).
Certain massis!
"The Political Aren."...!
The sable bath, the back-style of the Republic's reply, the marriage of the gorge , the illusions table, and...
But the argen is supposed to gladiators, people who take real risks, well-greed, bad.
Qd the philosocratic Humpist seated on the label and the parliamentary regulation, in turning the + elementary civility under the false paraplue of good ways, sanction applies to him "the quality" for its partial header and the misuse of the political arden.
The behaviour of this deputy is or worthy of its position.
He makes a provocation to speak of him.
To now it was unknown, now it can be angerous to be known as all cancers of a primary class are known.
The academy at a good dose and you see that the deputys are sensitive from the pocket...
The UMP should wait to solve its internal problems and stop the provocation of coachs and scandals.
Academy has a good two, especially when we're doing what she doesn't say.
The Deputy is a colleague in full adolescence crisis, which is the provocation and whose friends are going to delegate, see the Principal to cancel the colony hours.
and by defending it on the basis of a text they have not even read!
Women are not even 15 per cent of the signatories of this tribe of the UMP deputys.
Mr Judge, I call for two experts as a few thousands of years separate.
That's why I like time with the animals.
The joy they feel when they play is so evident and attractive.
The dogs, the dauphins, the otaries, the horses, they do all stupid things for the simple pleasure that it provides to them.
On the other hand, it seems that we suffer the majority of our 80 years to work, to move us and to make the stores.
What strange phase we have reached -- we are able to multiply both of our life, but we pass the majority in the umn.
How did we get here?
Thanks to the illusion that is anthropomorphosis.
The game is a metacommunication.
Try again.
It's always an illusion.
In addition, the "Communication" requires an appropriately shared symbol system.
A pretty difficult concept for you, maybe?
I think that the concept of inter-species of communication is not compatible with your believes.
That's true.
I can see when a dog has wanted to play and I can communicate to the dog I would like to play – a basic body language.
After this, there is a variable indicating whether the game will be a course, a object to go to search, etc.
It is not difficult, and there is no anthropomorphosis – but I'm aware of the idea that we're hearing a lot of conneries on animals that are to " play" while they're just to communicate.
Maybe the game is not only 'util' (which can be, or not), it is just something that exists.
For example, David Graeber is a view that " there is a play principle based on any physical reality."
"If he had learned at school that a woman is not an object, it might not be violent" Maybe yes, hope makes life...
Rejoice the hope to give you the opportunity to live, be in good health and power today to answer an article when you had to drink the information without reacting at least 15 years ago.
In general, I am not against the ideas, and you would even have to be sufficiently enthusished by those who make fools of first.
But when we see what many have retained from their education at school, especially among the public the most likely to be delivered to aggression on women, my enthusiasm does not find the least start of ancracy.
“the most potential public to be delivered to aggression on women” We would like to know some more.
Or rather, no, no, it's okay, we're well understood.
And yes, reality doesn't always feel the rock, even if it does not correspond to your thought shapes.
It's true that the youth sleeping in Neuilly and other beautiful villages don't listen to much in class.
She prefers to play on her iphone6.
Evry's borrowed youth too!
If the reacts were no longer reacting, Twitter would not be proposed to follow the Pen and Sarko in the first choice.
I haven't learned anything about this at school and I have never guilt anybody (and it is not in my intentions).
Do I think I'm gonna be lucky?
Unless I had parents to teach me some values.
The family society is the learning of social life.
How can we interfere the read of life when you don't know how to read?
And is it that youth socialists are going to bail schools to teach men and female equality?
It would be more effective than making moralising mountains on Twitter, but it should be necessary to get out of the beautiful villages...
Great this campaign.
They are everywhere but to give moral lessons, that remains the best.
Everything has a photographic, but yet I want to see the bread in a chapter.
There's a blague there to use his bread.
The article of this week will not be mould.
It's not the time to make a bitch around the bread, my boy!
A bit of sensitivity!
You made a double word game with the word "Nan" to refer to a grandma.
60 books for this?
It would not even fill the exomac of an old 90-year-old retreat house.
How do you do that more we pay, less there's in the seat?
Because the quality of experience is not necessarily measured in the weight or in the number of calories, however, as the quality of a film or flat is not determined by its length.
Yeah, I agree with you.
But why should good food be served in portions that would not even satisfy a minor?
It has no sense, and it's just a delimited policy that is intended to make you buy more plates.
It is obviously not to be like this.
The Sportsman in Seasalter is at least a very good restaurant where the portions and prices are both reasonablely high.
You're paying more because you're still hungry after several mini plates.
More you pay, more you have an opportunity to receive a child portion available with art in your seat.
At least they've been able to put nakeds.
So when I want to go to a decent restaurant in York, you're telling me I'd have to go to a restaurant in London...
Maybe you should try to try one of the many others (excellents) restaurants in York before you decide that London is the only place on Earth where you can get good plates?
Is the Manif for everyone just a Catholic and Muslim movement.
Yes, that's good: a kind of homophose collection.
But it's not just crazy.
There are also atoms and humanists that do not want modern systems of "fabrication of children".
A child must not be high in a battery heating or manufactured by a technological device.
Battery alive?
Where do you get this out?
And if you contest any technical intervention in the "fabrication", the prohibition of the PMA for heroexual couples should be the merit of coherence.
I also appreciate that the manif "for everyone" had not yet this logical refund to its attracting catalogue.
It is exact that they are not the only cathos that show: the other religions also, Jewish, musulmans, protestants.
This placed, it is even useful to remember that these different churches have been opposed to all developments of society: in 1865 (and I meet G.
Kauffmann) a Jewish, Mr. Dupanloup was violently ensuring the will of the Gvt to admit girls to school in the name of "the family defence".
We're still in the same scheme.
And, less recently, the same currents have turned to the end of civilization and the destruction of the family when the school has become mixed.
This is what the credit can be granted to the positions of these people.
You don't need to be cathosed to assess winters and kids...
All this is in the right line of the decade of Western civilization, more condemned by others!
For me, the freedom stops herself: yes to the recognition of homosexual couples that have the right to love himself as others.
But it is not tolerable that the child is a mere object.
And this is also valid for the GPA research heroes.
I can't just love that guy or recognize his results.
If he had a better ballon control and had been able to avoid the moments of fould stupidity, he could be a more popular player.
Furthermore, I am sure any other attack, all of Heskey, who plays so many matches for England, will meet a respectable number of goals.
Imagine how many purposes Peter Crouch would have been marked if you had given him more than 42 selected in national team...
I can't be disagreed, at least not Cathographically:) Because this article speaks of the goals he has marked, I will not speak about other things he brings, especially in ManUtd (as RvP, Mata, Kagawa did not add or take nothing), but may be another reason for which he has gained was much more often chosen than Peter Crouch.
Botham77 hodle1 07 October 2014 12:48 Recommendation 119 This is the mode of criticism Rooney at this time, so we can forgive you to do it too.
This said is good to take into account since he signed with Manchester City in August 2011, Agosero marked 56 goals and made 23 decision-making steps in 93 matches.
At the same time, Wayne Rooney marked 59 items and made 32 decisive steps in 96 matches.
So many people will have to find another excuse to take it to our Wazza because their field states are excellent.
Furthermore, "Wazza" is rather a good reason to ridiculize it.
I'm obliged to ask me if you really look at your feet, or if you think Peter Crouch A) would look at how many choices that Rooney and B would be marked as many goals if he had so many choices.
I really don't understand where the criticians are about Rooney's capacity as a footballer.
The hardest, it is to be regularly selected in the country team for 13 years, and to continue...
Are you seriously compared to football qualitys (not to attack) from Wayne Rooney to those from Peter Crouch?
You're doing this without blame?
There are really people completely at the mass.
Please also note for your government that Rooney has not always been the front-center machine at England during his card in England team.
Instead of that, he played the face back, the role of Beardsley/Sheringham.
He played behind players like Michael Owen, Mr. Crouch that we have mentioned above, Jermain Defoe, and recently Daniel Sturridge.
You've been truly written this by blating.
In a country where the arms port is removed and in a state where 71 per cent of people have a weapon, I find it totally spozophrine and paradoxal as a way to proceede.
And even though those of this school are not just all agreed with the arms permit to the United States!
The use of the crayon is always suicided.
Shut up: the girl's five years old.
How many kids are playing with weapons made at this age?
Is this actually the murderers in power for so much?
Even though the arms port is in the United States constitution and that it is strongly affected by the culture of the country, I don't think that the rich children are significantly different from our country.
A little good sense and reasoned svp.
It's a disarmament process!
Come back, you've been shocked!
The information on this different fact is insufficient to assess whether this little girl is actually, or does not contain everything, prejudices to the goat of the morbide.
Can we get out of the principle that a serious killer cannot already have a strange behaviour at the age of 5?
If people need a psychic follow-up, it's more the mabouls of this school than students!
She's in danger!
It's completely agreed.
Those who lead this school are apparently totally sick.
Your response is the most relevant.
Alabama is not the most refreshing state in the United States but it is part.
What incomprehensive country!
You relative young?
These blue blue coasts that men take nothing of a undertaking!
What's Alan Sugar or Richard Branson to bear at the beginning of their card?
In their first photos, Lord Sugar had a long kitchen, and Sir Richard Branson had a rocked shot.
I can't comment too much because I've never seen it, but everything came so nervous and without soul.
I don't think it's what he's supposed to say.
Contrary, maybe?
But what does it seem to be depressed?
You missed me.
I would have thought that a small English knowledge would be an appreciation for business.
I'm asking what Mr. Bjayou does these days.
Maybe it was to say 'attracer', he wanted to say 'alone'.
It would be logical.
No, I thought that's what he could mean, but it's still not a sense.
On the worse, if all candidates were inhabited like Carmen Miranda and Sugar had a green costume, it could be progressed that their intention was to overcome it.
But here, no.
It seems that it was corrected – weirdly. Maybe the whole sentence has been discovered!
It's not weird.
Hey, who knows what he might say?
Of course, but somebody wanted to cite something...
So yes, the word used in the article was well "attracer," which absolutely wanted to say nothing.
The homage rate in the United States has still disappeared, about 6 per cent.
You've never seen since 2001.
The prices of the skin are lower in all States.
American economy, with Obama, continues to strengthen.
Who's saying better?
You have a very short view...
Does their economy become "unless"?
In order to live there at this time, I will say that the U.S. is still nervous of the explosion as inequality becomes foolish.
Political system is literally led by the status of the financing of electoral campaigns.
Racial tensions, police violence, mass incarceration have an enlargement that we don't imagine in Europe but Americans keep an incredible optimism in the future of their countries and them!
How long?
This is the main question.
A few days ago, the English financial environment said that France was still lost.
Now, it's America at the end of his rock.
Happy, there will always be the UK to save the world.
Another of these articles who simply forget the feeling.
The consumer level of the American economy is no longer sustainable...
Budget debts and bills wouldn't be able to give the change.
Based on the extension of land resources and growing needs from the rest of the planet.
And by reason of the weakest and poor, a very great majority of citizens, they will "three" or rather disappear.
I can't blame this Farrage.
Will the Labour finally understand that his Chinese and liable policy of any complaints from the foreigners makes him more support for him?
I probably don't think.
Multiculturalism and diversity must continue to advance any price.
LOL It was to enjoy our American masters and their cold war continued with Russia.
Honorate Labour Performance, Ed Milliband is in the mousse, it plays 617 votes.
Quant to Clacton 11% for the Labour – choquant, really choquant.
Everyone is more or less than the massive immigration policy of the Blair Government was designed "to smooth the right neck in diversity"
The Labour provides the partial election, the Tories lost the partial seat's partial selection against ukip = Critical Labour Did you talk about your reality against a therapeute?
I imagine that it is the same multiculturalism that leads this manifold return, the pendule has been very far from the end of war, and I think it is now going to resolve in the other sense.
Did you talk about your fight against reality with a terapiete?
Lol - Safe Labour Chamber, a difference of 617 votes.
It's depressing Jack, you know, I know, anybody who doesn't know it.
Of course, the Tories saw the worse, but for the Labour is a victory to the Pyrhus.
Search the word "Victoria" in any context, and you will see that when it is used arguously against the word "abused", it wins the battle!
I'm agreed to Jack, it's a victory, but she's nice.
The Labour had to win from at least a few thousands of votes.
If they register a performance like that in a safe seat, can you honestly imagine them to bring the majority?
Personally, I'm not a little interest that wins in 2015 until the Lib Dems are not there.
You don't obviously understand how our parliamentary democracy functions, right?
Yes, I know the glass of Canada, Greenland and the north of Russia are hard.
By contrary, asking me if the alignment of Venus and Marchs and etc should not be considered in the same way?
Overall, the earth must see more “pathful ” or faultable than we imagine.
Is that the way?
Some small perplexity.
On the other hand, Wylie speaks of a "profitly simple mechanism: with the disappearance of the glass that falls on the earth's crowd, the pressure on the clothes will be relaxed, what would give/degrade a coupe to the magma production (b) while facilitating its access to the surface??
In any case, or the "fown knit" or the facilitation of access to the surface will be (more or less) localized.
It is difficult to distinguish the cause of the effect and inverse about climate disappearance, it seems to me easy to focus rather on its environmental effects, which is already quite complex.
So friendly, Patriceduceud, does this volcanism have an impact on our environment?
Is it effect on our future, future, or past?
Doesn't she go back again?
When complexity is not aware of simplification, we apply this simplicity and observe.
Yeah, but it's too, when he's done night, it's less good.
Hello, the end of the last glacier period was also accompanied by a stronger sismic activity in particular in the Mount’s "active Chains" where on the very English continental parties of Canada, Scandinavie.
CB Cordial
It is too often ignored that the flying land crowd on the magma and that the only transition of the moon is rising or down from a few 30 to 60 cm, after its transition to Zenith, as it does for the waters of the oceans.
What gives that the loss of the tectonic plates, as well as marine, is more or less easy by this moving wood, as far as polar calottes are disappeared by the source of glass, which therefore causes a change of ground balances to the ecuador, as the volume of the earth remains constant.
I appreciate that "man", said the top of the Nature and his commanding Commander, rimped by his stupid action on the environment that created it and which was so separated that has become nervous, and himself and this environment.
And all this is to remain the upper commander of this nature that overlooks it in the organization of its own viscers, through an inventory that consists of finding all possible ways to manage his neighbour, the other, through cooperation, money.
The earthly crowd is not resting on the magma, but on the earthly clothes, which is a solid rock.
Personally I find it impossible to look.
Pretty and arrogant.
It reminds me of Man de Bronowski.
Live the next part.
Beautiful Wild1
This reminds me of a totally general series of 2002, named Ape-man.
One of the best documentary series I've never seen.
Early, almost nobody remembers it now.
Damn that you're never passed beyond the first impression.
Your lost...
"The irons, our far-avorites" You should look at this past again.
Or read about evolution.
Super Thanksgiving program Brian
I am almost sure that the documentary "History of Humanity" has already been done several times, they're always going to Ethiopia (evidemly)
Oh, there I don't support this man, Brian's "light of thousands" Cox, which is going to Ethiopia to prepare your eyes to make a brain in a mouth.
And his story...
It must be hard for you, obliged to look at Coxy.
Maybe there is a group of support for you, that says.
I agree, it's all in a way I can understand.
I loved the program, wonderfully well filmed.
Is Marcel Gauchet a marxist bussole?
Effectively, it is the individual identity that is prevailing today.
It therefore needs to be themselves, in-sui, not in conformity.
Of course, but Descartes is also located at the time of the event of individualism, and his intellectual question expresses this event.
But at this time, these are just the premies that appear, today the individualism structures the whole society, education or not, cultured or not, rich or poor...
We're well in the "masse" individualism!
Without doing this an unpassable horizon, there is no parent with the chartesian start to consider what we are getting to believe, what we believe themselves.
More than the refusal, doubt is hidden.
Foucault's revolutionary fair is an absurdity.
Many xx-liberals are reflected and revoked.
His work on psychiatrist has produced a contradiction!
With regard to the problem at the level of its paranoid nominal, he blowed all progress and all reflections on the reality of fool.
And I introduced the most reduced and reactionary vision that submits: the behaviorism.
Gauchet has absolutely reasoned on this point and to be anti-conformist, is fighting this decline.
We are requested to Marcel Gauchet to be a defender of the order.
Good idea!
Be beautiful and rebellion, ask the ones...
Black and river, others.
Beverages and robots include the most followers of those who seem in their midst.
In any case, thanks to its concurrent polematics to put under the fire of the newspaper Marcel Gauchet, this patient humanist and persuasive, and so clearly.
David Cameron supports the increase of the tax tax on heritage
How many other budget offences will be necessary to pay for the social benefits of this rich person?
Dave the robot will well increase its pure value once he's no longer on power.
Business Councils, adjudications, consultation expenditures, a series of best-sellers written by a nign on the “serial policy” – it will be 100 £ once it'll pass the weapon on the left.
Of course, he doesn't want to imput on heritage.
Isn't the same lie as the last choice?
And the richest are those who are very certainly paying at least taxes on heritage through highly payed accounts and fiscal evasion programmes.
This has all the signs of a Empire in determining where the heritage kills the innovation.
It's gonna be 100 pounds once he'll get the gun on the left.
Nothing.
It's probably going to propose to increase the weight at 1 million euros, that's good about what you say it's going to be.
What was your position when the Labour doubled 650 000 for couples?
Did you also think Brown thought only to his own heroes, or are you just a tribalist without brain?
We didn't choose it last time. We had a coalition on the place.
You could not allow you to accuse it to lie if we have chosen it actually.
As the rest of us, "Dave" will not die "normally".
The climate change and deeply imminent it will end, he and the other of its accent.
His “search ” will be so unnecessary as the one of the others and will not save him or his children.
Income is a social benefit, especially in a country where government debt has exceeded $1,000,000,000.
We must all be imposed to pay the essential services and reimbursement of the debt.
I agree with you Exdionys.
I don't say that the discipline doctor is unnecessary, of course, I say that it is insufficient to compensate some natural "insufficiences".
Declaration little reasonable for the math professor she was!
Like what...
It's better to recruit and form teachers that results from a qualitative start.
However, the French policy class does not know any other approach to a quantity.
There are 2 responses, the 1st would be to select teachers according to their ability to transmit knowledge => Reform of recruitment modalities.
In +, she hates children because she doesn't understand them.
Without no understanding, it doesn't know how to act or react to work well => it is reduced to establish a challenge relationship that suffers everybody purly lost => it would need 1 training to teach.
A lot that learns, of course.
But pedagogy is primarily a art, natural provision and vocation before being a technique.
Working on and with human beings, it is not to manufacture car parkings.
The pydagogie does not even evaluate when we are math professors!
"Education sciences" cannot compensate a lack of natural aspects.
What is now lacking is a real vocation in the bcp of those who embrace Professional
If the donations exist, the pydagogie (I'm preferred of discipline) allows those who have less desire to do not mistake.
There are ways of addressing a more effective issue.
The real unknown one today is the students who say to us: Teaching is not serving anything I already know what I think.
A Slaw's article describes sufficiently the chaotic situation of this entry.
Register the old schools of Institutors.
She ended at 3 hours from this week, but she starts at least.
If this is in all ways of work of time.
Oh, I didn't know that, thank you.
It doesn't be mine!
It's been a year ago that his emission starts to decrease.
We have this thing that is called iplayer and that allows us to listen to emissions at the request when we want it!
Internet, it's rather incredible, isn't it?
I don't have iPlayer on my phone and with a maximum download speed of 4 MB at me, I can't really listen to radio emissions.
I have a type usb adapter to the two of my SKY box and that is linked to the Internet but listen to the radio on my telephone has seen too complex.
Yeah, I think I was stubborn in the horns, I had to hear Richard Lester about 3 hours.
Although there are men in the day on Radio 2, they could at least put a woman in his announce hour when one of the men is in vacation or sick, it would at least please people.
They should begin by get away from Jeremy Vine.
Its emission is of any sensation that has been dismissed in the debate, and it would be better on a chain like LBC.
The lack of women DJ on the day, where no of the regular animators, from Chris Evans the morning to the emission of Simon May the night back to the work, is not a woman
It's five emissions.
So what (of these five) is the most likely to be changed.
Shenna knows it very good, but he doesn't say anything - for now.
Steve Wright is the most semi-detained in these times.
Jeremy Vine may be sent to the offices as a true journalist, but keeping the whole glacial air of a Daily Mail radio.
I think he's quiet, waiting for the current team in married or let her go.
I was born in Soisson in 1950!
Is it too late?
It's normal that these people vote FN.
Since 40 years, we have both the same parts that change the power and make the keys of the country to the other at least good state than they took it.
The campaigns are very poor, just more poor than the banks with the isolation.
We need to get a cinem, a bar, a gymnase, a theatre.
But as they don't burn the car, they don't attack, they don't go, they're not interesting political men...
But thankfully don't speak of a department where you haven't been alive.
Yes, Doclocal, they are under men, sociology is well good to think about them.
They have the rate of absolutism and high precoce alcoholism too....
The FN is promoting on human beast, education and ignorance as well as telling that it is still a huge potential of growth, really needs to be bad to make it better...
Today, the NF is particularly on miserableness, the fear of the daily, the one of the other and the feeling of having no perspective.
But yeah, you're right!
What kind of painful humanity.
Honeyfully there's a post of people like you, smart, worshipped and eveed to save the honour.
They've been looking for him.
To take the selection for c...
That's what's going on.
Who are they?
In fact, there are at least less resources => while dots.
This is the comment I left on twitter (@priya963) listen to, you can't just add and miserable, women must be integrated in the development process.
What I mean is that in many developing countries, the existing standards are refered to question, such as the maintenance of children and the socio-reproductor roles.
This allows women to recognize that they can work in the economic sphere and that it is necessary.
But it is not possible without acknowledging the fact that women will then have a double flood, that is that they will be waiting for the work while continuing to fulfil their socio-reproductor role.
I'm not convinced my sister.
Economy and benefits do not recognize the roles of genders.
The money speaks, and if a sex is not high, then!
The benefits are moving from the life you lie.
What are you doing, what is the advantage and what you have to offer?
The benefits are moving from heroism and children's education.
If it was a crime, the enterprises would listen to.
Workers' friends will never work for women aged 20 to 45 years.
Well, this is my sister.
It is very difficult that no one speaks about social work not reimbursed in this article.
In some countries, the value of unemployed social work (for major women are carried out) must be equivalent to more than 50% of the PIB.
The unemployed social work does not receive enough support and is undervalued (such as speaking of the fact that men do not enough it), but it allows us to work and keep our work.
The unemployed social work is also an important reason why many women are not able to find a true "economic emancipation" outside the foyer...
Thank you for all your comments - to return to the point of Mskayadee, how can we take into account the responsibilities assemblies in a way disproported by women when men's integration projects?
A very practical article.
I'm sure he will help many people who have to "mount a case."
The tigre is not Russian only the Western propaganda.
Chineses are only responsible for the current situation and would better sit at the negotiations table.
The right to self-determination and Russian soldiers are simply operating near the border, long-term periods before the current situation.
Furthermore, the tigre has no anti-aerous missile in its own possession.
Free Tigritan!
You made my day!
Oh, yeah, stop.
He just came the same kind of idea.
This is a pretext found for arming a few separates to be added to China.
If the Siberia tigre is in China, China is in Siberia.
It's just time to repair this appointment.
Why is a article on a great, happiness and real danger of extinction, it finally transforms it into a betty leading article against Poutine?
What's he coming to do?
This is therefore not a table on the Siberia tickets, but a sheet on the suites of a com operation of Poutine.
When both the media are exposed, it is also expressed to irony, seeing the critics.
The returnal of perpetual victiming of soviet poutinian sympathism.
Holland had also been full of her herd with his chamber without the anti-France compound.
Our teacher Alain Bougrain-Duburg Holy Protector of the Great Russia was personally and physically involved in the reconstruction of this tigre.
In any case, he's got it, he's got a bar...
That's what Hollanda's going to do, it's something.
First of all, it seemed to be a terriblely surprised idea.
But on the basis of the article, it seems that it is a response to a real problem - the dental emergency subventions - and effective.
So it's difficult to find something to return.
And if only 53% of this sample was stored before, and 73% after, it's a little empty sense of complaining the paternalism.
After all, there's no one invented to cut the dents!
In fact, the complaints seem to be compared with the fact that they are targeted to unemployment and that it confirms a negative stereotype.
But if it's exact, then it's not a justified crisis.
Belinda Smith, the Regional Health Committee of Canterbury, said that the Ministry was concerned about the number of emergency subsidies offered by the Department of Laboratory and Revenues of the Ministry of Social Development to youth unemployed.
On a mediatic plan, there would be better ways to implement it, I think.
But he seems reasonably well thought.
There's one unconsiderable to break the depths.
If you broke them after drinking wine, it can end the enamel coffee.
If your dent breast is old and rigid, it can push the genitle and cause a flower.
And I remember a emission on the book Guiness of Records where someone tried to broke the dents the most long and the guiness judges at the time had strongly decided to do it because of the negative effects of a frequent and extended dent browser.
' to first view' - very ridiculous.
It seems to be a huge experimental concept.
The simple way to be voluntary for this study will change the standards of participants who knew that the dent browser will be studied.
That is why most of the behaviour studies include things such as double blind, witness groups, etc.
There is no way to reject these results on the programme itself.
Those texts will be sent to each young agency of social benefits, there are two things that different from the test: 1) These are not volunteers, and 2) do not give information return on the time they broke or no dents (the results easily mistaked in the air by people that give their results on the results of the successed expectations).
Is there the impact at the epigenic level?
Studies (Pr Lyonnet) showed that the maternal environment (including the urus) could have effects on genetic heritage, not in the genem, but in the expression of Genes, and that these heroes could be transferred to the next generation.
Does this phenomenon influence?
The nidation seems to a kind of greff.
Consequences are likely, but as we don't want to kidnapp a perfect clon of himself, is it a problem?
It seems to me that it's go beyond the limit of the reasonable.
The desire of maternity and paternity must not be able to go far further, without to ask the issue of ethic, risk, mother and baby.
Not the doctor is all powerful, it is not without limit, and yes, it is painful and doubt to accept that all women will not have it, or the children they want to have.
This has nothing, absolutely nothing, to see with the tran
But let people, women, the others have their body, of their mind of love that can go to risk and manage your little witnesses to you all alone, only in your small pantolon only to you.
of their "convincing" this magic sac that they were this wonderful moment of immense.
Why would I keep it secretly in my co-fort if he can even give love.
Currently deteriorated circumstances make the FRYDMAN comprehensive PR on its communication, but if it had been accepted to think, "see" is admitting that it is only sac and not the genetic material involved.
What will you do as an anti- argument: cf here these reactions all males carefully....
Marjane, every organism don't have anything of nadin.
I've been a plasma donor for years, that's not totally anodin.
I was registered as a pearl damager (I have never been selected because the selection is very rigorous and it understands both for the receiver and for the gift), this is a real operation.
Now as a man, I wouldn't allow you to judge in a sense or other part, but I will listen to the women to speak.
@Margane: actually, this has nothing of nadin, and this strengthens the love act that implies.
Give a queen to a member of his family who needs nothing of nadin anymore, and it's done!
Please, don't combine Mexi v Ronaldo.
It's lower.
I agree, we don't need that.
Sure there's no real competition...
Ronaldo is the best athlete.
Mysi is the best footballer.
The Deportation became a yoo club.
They're too good for the Second but they're not the Lega's standard.
Rivaldo was not part of the title winner team.
Thank you for correcting me.
But Rivaldo played well for the Deportvo before you go to Barcelona.
Ronaldo who continues to do everything to fight all the purpose records of Real Madrid this season for then to return to Old Trafford this age with quiet conscience...
I'm sorry to believe him.
I think Ronaldo will put a term to his card to Santiago Bernebeu.
I think you want to talk about the stage of the International Investment Society?
I looked at it on a fucking connection, so I can't tell you greatly if Valencia has well defended and without account of the possession, they would merely win.
I was afraid that the field environment couldn't overcome too fast but they've played well.
Parejo's game becomes better.

It's interesting.
A comprehensive article, signed by the young researcher Amandine Marshall, “Of the origins of momification”, is well illustrated in the Archeological magazine of the last September 524.
It's good to have arguments to confirm and date what is intuitive.
It's not wondering that before we're complicated, it's simple.
All science progresses by small steps.
And was “the organ ” of the woman who had been preserved to him so?
Passionant!
Welcome and thank you for your bills.
It seemed to read me a few times ago that a black child mom had been discovered in the Libye's Act and that this discovery opened new horizons, including geographical and timely (I think I remember the mom was previously before 1000 years to the first known African moms).
Do you have information about this?
Thank you for advance.
It's a little reading.
This may not be contaminations in modern times.
Is the wilderness at the time less far than now?
Why do not imagine plants like cannabis powdering on the place where there is only the sable now?
We knew the song.
And it's enough that one who knows that it is aware, but no evidence, so that it is a scientific truth: the Egyptians and so the Africans today have never discovered anything in their home.
But the song did not tell us who are the inventors of African inventories in Africa.
If it is not and is always “of his bad debts.”
You should read the article.
This is an article prescribed by free market neoliberal cucks which preachs against the mobility of persons and the mobility of goods.
I think there are other persons affected by Ebola and on whom the Spanish government is missed by us, so that we don't have a bad image and protect tourism.
Today, I would like to believe that tourism is the last of their concerns.
But they could be quiet to avoid a general panick.
I would like to believe the same thing as to tourism, but the right governments in particular (e.g. Spain and the United Kingdom) have tend to protect the interests of enterprises rather than those of people.
Stop, stay not to call your local MP and call you for the lack of transparency.
Even though I think that the government here is only a connard band, good to nothing and corrupt, such as Madrid is not a very tourist place, I doubt that it is their greatest concern.
What are you waiting for?'
(with all respect and compassion for the hospital and its colleagues), because tourism is one of the only things that allows millions of people in this country to keep the head outside the water, I would say that yes, it is important.
If they had to absolutely repatriate missionaries, I don't see why they couldn't send them to a military base and throw them in a field hospital, rather than in the capital.
Rajoy was for the departure of Spanish health service, privately privatizing national hospitals in Madrid, which is its power base until the courts have entered.
It's nothing that a right bottle of support for public relations such as Cameron, and as Cameron, I think it has happened to the next elections.
To be right to Cameron (I know that it is not easy here) socially is far from his right and would well find his place to the right religious fountains in America.
Now he must sing the loans of the hospitals he had come down to try to achieve its goal that is to protect Spanish tourism.
I'm sorry, but you can't really compare the Turies or any other European party on the right of Spanish.
These are cases, believe me.
The Spanish government is often concerned about all that is concerned.
It's not like if someone could accuse you to spread unfounded rumors.
So you have tangible evidence to support this idea?
The Guardian section calls the comments are free.
Thank you, Mr. Supiot.
With respect to its rights and guarantees, it will not be gone out of the work of the production and the economy centre.
Great article but most exciting reactions on the Forum .
Many of TPE patrons - PME seem to read The World to take time to condemn the proposals of the Pr.
Let's go on the anti-intellectualism of the ambiant sea.
A professor of right to France College seems not to be able to know the labour market except if it is a Nobel economy price and proposes to liberalize it completely
It was so better before, that was true when Dr. Villerme found the work of the children aged 8 hours per day, when Canuts had gone out for a collective convention signed.
Oh, the good old time...
Your reaction is so exciting by your conconnaissance of the TPE Chamber!
His mercy is not to know the right in all its mechanics, but to manage and produce.
4 manuscripted amounts on my payment bulletin of my youth, more than 100 information today!
This is an example, which might be cited much more, which illustrates the permanent flow of confidence, imposed without measure of consequences, and which enhance the small company.
Your paper would be useful if you had written it as a expert and not as a Sorbon client.
In order to cut the archisodesised arrangement of the French Labour Code, a serious university would be extended into the Swiss texts and would compare the amount of official texts and then the comments (the absence of these recently means that the Swiss laws are more understandable than our homes).
By comments in a Code, whether it is work or not, the jurisprudence in particular is seen...
And yes, in France, there is still a judge who is responsible for applying laws when a wage is licensed, for example...
Who's compliant?
Are you sure the law rules (wets, jurisprudence, conventions, contracts) are in terms of work and insufficient enterprises?
What does he do?
How long does that do?
Pullmann “The art has practically been immunized against Mrs. Critics.

It's certainly time that new revolutionary absurdities make crystals...
For each article on Ai Weiwei that I have recently read, you are part of the first three comments that make it popularity.
You're going to get something else!
Go to see otherwise, the choice does not lack in the art world.
If China is able to produce new artists who are not the Communist Party Ports, the world will be interested.
Yes, GhenisCan is probably a troll of the Chinese government.
I think China has produced a lot of good contemporary artists.
Those who are the ports of the communist government are not appreciated in West, and those who are not ports are so connected as Ai Weiwei.
For those of you who think that the art of Ai Weiwei is a kind of fraude, that's what you rate.
Thank you for this, you're coming to break my little dinner.
I'm sorry, but at all the prices it had to be exposed (or to do bad word game).
It's the man who puts out the former ceramics and calls it from the art, right?
There is the art, and then there is the vandalism seeking to take attention.
The real artists do the difference.
A beautiful artist.

MARSENTY DEMISSION This lord is not obliged to take elective mandate to the extremists of all sides (including syndicates) to disappear
Philip Karsenty and his ridiculous theories of the completion, who worth a number of judicial condemnations, are shameful to Israel as well as to the Maurie of Neuilly.
It doesn't represent one or another.
Philip Karsenty leads his fight against the only truth, in marginal.
RESSEMBLE S'ASSEMBLE
What is the Maire of Neuilly against Philipe Karsenty, who acted with injuries a journalist and his family, who calls publicly to attack this urbanist?
Crime Apology?
I don't find Neuilly on my card?
Is there a new administration that has these new privileges??
This type needs care, in the same way as Ulcan Chelli, they both do in the theory of the antijuif/anti-Israel compound and whose resorts are perfectly identical to those of their most furnished detractors.
In the same way as many of people believe in every political decision the hand of the “sionists” (the term of which the sense has tend to destroy, because of the fact of his abus), these both there, in the same way as the LDJ or the CRIF, believe in any critical, even banal, an anti-emitism imposed “which is not remembering the darkest hours of our history, because he is still hidden the womb of my good dame, it is believed to return to Russia from the 19th century!”
Note that the incredibly stupid theories of Karzeny on the reporting of Charles Enderlin are more stupid than those on 11 September.
And God knows that the theories of the completion on 11 September are a good bottle.
And this kind has political responsibilities, it is extremely concerned.
To clarify my similarity with the complementary theory of the 11 September, we speak of a knowledgeful dissony on how to address the subject.
Totally healed by a totally harmful truth, having been too long, paid too much money to steal this, it is insufficient to the adaptation of this theory to detaining it (such as in the case of extreme religious).
As a logic and unfairly escaped before, the end justifys all the means, even falsely, which is a comble, but combined seems not to perturb the mission of the concerned.
You will advise you to take attention and not put everybody into the same panier, but that's what you do for the 11th September.
There are still a flat of questions without answers for this event, and Bush/Cheney/Saudis/considents are not angry to answer it.
There are actually theories that are very painful, but official theory is also, at least on a few points.
Oh, nothing's funny now...
The health NGOs and public health ports find that the results of the study are widely in favour of their efforts of awareness.
And, of course, they will need more subsidies to follow!!
As the fact of smoke was socially accepted for 50 years ago and now is recognized that what it is actually, alcohol will also know his time of judgment where the real damage that it causes in our society will be expressed.
More than waiting for everyone to attack me now...
Well, it's easy to say stuff as "excluding alcohol consumption is increased," but what is required (a little) more attempt, is to give real facts.
I'm sorry if you're thinking it as an attack - are you gonna drink a white and spread?
It's better to risk this rather than put my mental health in danger when I am absent.
The Government ends with pleasure when it costs money.
Here are other alarmist advice based on little reliable statistics.
Two mediums per day is at least a low level of alcohol consumption, and the first citation seems to indicate that it increases the risk of many cancers, but the second implies that it is more or less without danger.
Maybe the Council of Cancer and the National Council of Health and Medical Research should agree (autor of one or two white but not three) and give us a number on which they are agreed - to be justified or not.
Now we're gonna get them down, like smoke!
They're already doing it, soon it's herb!
My father didn't drink and smoke him, and his cancer hired her in 64 years.
So I'm going to continue drinking my two red bottles on the vendrees and seventh evening (and the other evenings when my wife is not there).
Why the Cancer Council encourages children to go to the places where alcohol serves It is an old moment that the Cancer Council has deleted very ignored.
What is not related to a risk of cancer our days?
The skins don't touch cancer - they eat anything but they're not a good company.
The rivers can take the cancer - the hair cancer.
Charlie Whiting's understanding is a recurring subject for many years.
You don't want to run when you can run and recycling.
Comprehensive agreement.
Whiting is Bernie's blessing.
To them two, they destroyed us the F1 under security pretext.
Let's hope he's better than Schumi or at least worse Wendlinger ap his accident in 1994.
Of course agreed with you, but attention to point 1: it is not F1, but the circuit instances that refused to advance the departure in order to not lower the TV distribution creatures.
It's exactly, +1
I just want to want a fast and fast restoration in Jules Bianchi!
Brazil 2003, Europe 2007, the accidents that have occurred between disappearance and f1 have been unemployed warnings.
We knew that one day it would happen, and James Laffite, in particular, said it for years.
How disable the course organization and FIA have allowed these managers without the safety of the car?
I can't accept that the risks of the meat or the fault at a chance when it has not been prevented.
But that accident was it.
It must even say that there was a yellow dragon, which does not only mean "a prohibition to overcome in the area" but has the first purpose of reporting a danger.
It's not hont, it's happy for the family that had to be before the television.
Even under yellow dragons, pilots will just lift up the feet.
In changed circumstances, virage may be much more pigeous to the next tour and the pilot, believeing to arrive with enough marge, may even be at the speed " reduced" compared to a normal ritmo.
But well, you're caused in the empty there, as you're not seeing the images, you can't submit an opinion set.
I don't see what this changes too much.
Is there the wounds?
According to the CBC, no wound has been reported.
The CBC showed the information this morning before it happens, what makes me ask what has caused the disaster.
It's difficult to believe that there are still jobs where you have to keep 24 hours at 24.
I don't think there are people wounded because Canada is almost empty.
Probably there are animals wounded like ours, washing rats, etc.
I hope it's Irish.
Some parts of Vancouver have the most strong population density in North America and the Toronto agglomation accounts at least six million inhabitants.
In Saskatchewan’s campaign, trains are not deprived as incanning, and these types of trains often pass through few urban areas.
Although every Canadian city is passed through a railway line, and trains are very difficult, very often in one day.
In addition, as water courses often follow water courses in the regions where lakes, rivers or oceans, they also walk in deeply deeply deeply deep places, because people want to live close to water.
So, all the rail traffic through the center of a city because there was a central element of the original construction of the railway lines here.
You may have tried to be funny, but there is a huge potential for railway disasters in Canada.
Mansbridge made a report about that last night, really hot.
Of course you haven't read the article on the desolation and the explosion of a train in a city of Quebec who made 47 dead?
Actually, you have some reason.
Vancouver's city was a good portal city before the iron road.
This says, when the railways were built, they were through the centre of the communitys established because it was the direct and central road.
Maybe employees of the Canadian Railway Society should go to the next Conference on dangerous products in Calgary in Canada on 2 and 3 December 2014.
CN employees are long formed to the transport of dangerous products.
This article as many comments affect the primary religious question: a religion is a reveal truth and for his believers it would not be able to exist other truths.
The whole problem is there, and the exegences of the theologists only strengthen this fact, unless what is good to speak about the sex of angels?
"God said that's good - that's wrong" > it's not compatible with democracy, it's called dictatorship (variant: theocracy).
The word of a leader (musulmans but not important): "But without religion, how do you want to hold the people?" .
In other terms: Listen to the cure to premature rabbin's immune pastor and make your prayers, it'll be better!

Yes, that's what they thought of Voltaire and others, Dont Robespierre in a certain way trying to found a culte of the Supreme Area.
But our oligarchie also has its cultures: the strong Euro ( rather pallet at this time ) or the free market ( passively supported by the State when refreshing ) , andc .
Great ideas of religious surveys.
Yes, but especially where there was no distinction between religious and profane.
Where the rational is emerging, the religious is at the remorc and expressed in the shame.
Religion is born as ideal support of the State, and gods who have been put to the service of ambitions even if it also had provided forms of condemnation.
The decised theology in the form of revealing and adapting time airs did not know the doubt.
The fanatism is often described as a bad interpretation of the "saint texts".
This does not respond to the review of these texts that are imposed by explicit appeal to the hate of the mechanism.
It's rather the moderate religious (and happily that they are the most many) who "lease" texts and think it only concerns humanism and common values all humanity, athletes and different believers.
For me, the fantasism is the animal and evil application of transitions from sacred texts out of their context.
Therefore, some verses of the Coran calling to kill "creators", "increased", "hypocrites", "Jifs" or "Cretiens" are incomprehensible and therefore unacceptable if some higher or lower verses are read that these executions are justified only in cases where musulmans are attacked, killed and in the situation of legitimate defence.
on Yves Petit :" concerning the "foulard", it is well a religious requirement that today makes almost unanimity at the "savants".
There are idiots everywhere.
The only positive point to get out of this is that it has caused a general condemnation.
Sure in Australia.
Are you not guilty of the same prejudice as that shows in the clip?
Overpayed and hypersexualized Neandertalian band.

An insult to our intelligence, that's what he gave us!
If you discovered your telephone eyes for a moment, you will see Australia has a rich cultural heritage, starting with peintures in greets and stones made by his indigenous peoples and are still source of inspiration for modern artists today.
And then there is Sydney's Opera and a national operating company that produced a wonderful song such as Joan Sutherland and Nellie Melba.
Australian cinéma is a film product such as The History of the Kelly Gang, Mad Max and Gallipoli.
The notable Australians include Errol Flynn, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Heath Ledger, Geoffrey Rush and Cate Blanchett.
The only thing that blasphemes your understanding, is you and your ignore.
Russell Crowe is New Zealand, and the Bee Gees were English.
Your intelligence really needs to be insulted!

Approximately all 331 dead since the feu are the civilians of Donbassian bombardement victims of the army, so uncontrolled elements according to Kiev.
The presentation of hypocrised responsibilities suggested in the article without obliging to describe explicitly the separatists is in the otanese line of the world which does not have to invest facts and responsibilities to maintain the fable of pro-European neonacy nations faced with the poor Russians

I'm very well opening this page on firefox and mac.
If I understand your proposal the wicked are the Ukrainians and the Greeks, the Russian Stalinians you aren't a little communist by hazard
Except from the (because long) document you quote about MH17: "This bill is absolutely not to say that the pro-Donetsk residents are innocent."
The Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation said that Ukrainian is responsible.
From the propaganda?

This says, I can't support Piturca team, they don't represent me.
Piturca is a member of the powers in place that has not stopped denial the red football to the pathic level it has reached.
They formed a network that produced the "Cooperative", which decided before the beginning of the season, which campaign teams would be paid to Europe, which teams would be regulated and white the money at its low, mostly by selling players who were well underestimated.
Gica Popescu, the old Captain of Barcelona, did business with the subsequent agents, and tried to avoid payment of taxes (approximately a million euros), then paid them, but apparently he was badly consulted by his lawyers, refused to admit its mistakes to the court (which he had worthlessly purified condemnation), and then took three years and half prison.
The process also valued the prison to the brothers Becali, four owners of clubs, the Mihai Stoica Steaua, and Popescu, for offences related to football.
George Becali also cleans him a penalty for trying to do soup (and after the facts) a team that it fights us (CFR Cluj) in the last game of the campaign, to win the title and get the jackpot of the League.
The team he tried to subdole was our neighbors of Cluj, University.
We won 1-0 in their stage, a result that allowed us to be the first campaigns of Cluj, while they were resolved.
I'll always know how much this time.
In the dissmulation of this corruption attempt, Piturca was involved, among others, which signed as a false witness that the money that the police had confided to Cluj was in line with a landing sale.
So this poor guy hasn't been educated, idiot, tricking and liaring isn't representing me and will never do it.
Hungarians are only a band of national creatins today.

At each new period of unemployment, it is tens and ten candidates that I address employees who most often do not even have an accused of receipt was automated.
This is also the total absence of follow-up or support of the Poland Emploi.
To conclude, I will add that the "socialist" of this government appears to me as an insult to the memory of Jaunes or Mens France.
Did we read a article of the kidnapped canard here?
It is learned that a unemployer can stay several months without news from his agency, but that it must continue to seek employment through its own means.
It is learned that controls have been allowed to radiate persons who have no longer touched unemployment for more than half.
It is therefore questioned how the control of people can never see.
The sanctions are asked for any person who has access or access to employment services or unemployment allocations.
And if it is possible to admit that this reform will enable more radiation, we will ask us what it will help recruitment.
"We learn that a unemployer can stay several months without news from his agency, but that it must continue to seek employment through its own means" effectively, it is honger.
It should be questioned why these countries are in the EU while the authorities are clearly unable to defend European legal ideals?
Isn't it as if Spanish or Italian authorities had done greatly about racism in foot?
Should we get them out of the EU?
The EU was only in the economic origin and should remain it.
The purpose is not to be a "country of thoughts".
The EU is a peaceful project.
She has no sense on an economic plan.
This is probably the reason why the Great Britain will soon leave the EU, which is the most irregular society in Europe.
What equal?
The Eastern Europe teams continue to be through the rebels of the corrupt mafia that is the EUFA.
The best solution would be that the whole East leaves this fair lucrative organization and created its own.
At least we'll look at the football.
This antiracism croad is only a screen to cover injustice and corruption!
No, it's not true.
The currency and trade exchange, rather.
European gender ideas?
So what does Europe leave to enter into the United Kingdom?
Uefa should applaudi them for the deployment of the board and its men.
It's happening everywhere for a few years, and I'm not out of it.
Touch the Guardian from two or three days ago:
Does he hope that he would see a retaining small symmetric phrases, just story to enter into the polemic?
Whatever it is, it is a fact that at each small event to peace there is, there is there and there will be people who have 'employed to throw the oil on the fire.
The decree would be to say that Western States are against a Palestinian State, which they are pro-Israelian and that it only explains that these States have never done anything against the Israeli State.
The decree would be to say that in order to address the question of Israel Palestinian, it would be necessary to act against the Israeli identificative state of oversearing occupiant destructors of the colonial oppressor.
In 1945, rather than creating a Jewish state in Palestinian by a Arab population that was not for nothing in Shoah, it was more reasonable to see the Bavière of its German inhabitants (which they were victims of Shoah) to replace them by survival Jews.
It would have been justice, the Germans had nothing to say and Europe would have kept millions of education, undertakings and dynamics.
Mr. Let's take the example of the colonisation of the West Sahara...
That Maroc is the colonialist, it's clear!
But, as for Israel, it also needs to ask the History, his allegeds and support to interfere truths.
The colonialism, whatever it is, has never been altruist, we're agreed.
Then stop your paintings to support Israel as a colonisator.
The Gaule has been colonized by the Romans but now there is no discrimination between the descendants of the Romans, Gaulois or others.
In Palestinian, there is a discrimination on the basis of the origins.
In addition, the Israeli State is defined as a "pea judical" which no Jewish can take part.
The Israeli State discriminates the non-Judads, from there the contents.
Conclusion: To solve conflict, it is necessary to break the sionism that opposes Jewish and not Jewish.
In Maghreb, some peoples have even been baptized by the name of their first status by this salvative civilization!
Two realities that we need to stop ignore.
First, the European sionist project (Colonist Adjuster Palestinian) involved the exposition of Palestinians, therefore it was an intrinsive anti-palestinian project, the solution therefore needs to break with the sionism.
Secondly, sionism is a political ideology.
Uruguay missed the morde since the start.
Their earthic results will give them what the fingers do.
It should begin its rehabilitation by small buses.
I hope he hasn't lost the game appetite.
Thus softs are tolerated, including racial injections and physically hard tails in the football, but they have been sanctified by Suarez too hard.
I'd like to see him back to England. It's a little bit of what the cleansers say.
Yeah, I hate all of these molecules.
The football is a contact sport where the tails exist and so the players will be blue.
The fact of returning his dents into the flesh of an adversary for a benefit has certainly no place in the game.
A rugbyman was suspended for 80 matches to have made a similar geed.
Now it's the third time that Suarez does that.
If you're gonna marry someone at work.
What would the consequences be according to you?
I knew someone was going to kill.
If you're dyslexic, I'll forgive you.
I'm really lightly dyslexic.
I'm forgiveing this sarcasm to two balloons.
I think he'd beat back to play full of dents.
All these words on Suarez are in fact to lose their drugs.
I'm angry.
The need for a good school course is the respect of the teachers of their teachers and the school institution.
This functions if parents incline this respect to their children.
Parents make this easier respect if they feel as well respected by the professors and the school of their children.
In the good institutions, those who advance their students, parents are considered as partners and not as emm.
Who can believe that this is the professor who should do all the work (learn, teach, teach respect, the limits, live together) is the parents to do at least 50% of the tax.
But, unfortunately, it's easier to take it to school.
It's not operating about parents.
Nobody actually took them.
It will remain limited.
On the other hand, the school institution could have many things.
Operational solutions and resident.
It should be necessary that actors (profess, herories and ministry) play their role and do not continue to touch.
We can disappear a troop that leaves her to relax, not family.
How not speaking about teaching.
It is true that communication courses allow to change.
It seems to be teachers, but we forgot the first role of school.
Sending knowledge.
And if parents require, it is that school ensures their children's instruction.
What is the ministry who will reiterate what was called the Public Instruction.
Article decreased: little information, partial and destructed reflections.
Did you really wait for a smart comment on this drink of the eastern banks?
It's a drink, it's clear, but I think it's rather Willoughby, and so the north coast...
Sloppy Joe does not understand the figures.
It refuses to accept the facts.
No wonder that we have a budget emergency.
Let him put it down and the economy will immediately wake up.
Hunters Hill, actually.
truly true
That's it.
A little of Aloysius.
Her elector is Sydney's seat of the North Sydney.
Effectively a drink from the North Coast !!!
Well, if British BBC telespects want to compare the neoconservant governments of our two countries, they would obviously come to the conclusion that the two are conducted by the Raving Tory Wang-Bangers party.
It's going for a grinch, our days. :(
Yes, but his leader regularly leaves him on his famine.
You're so much grinching as well as if you wake up at a morning and you'll realize that you'll never have the role of Prime Minister and that all these legal and illegal benefits of life will remain outside your port.
Paire Joe.
Really pathic.
He at half tried to present a budget and then left.
At least it doesn't worry about anyone.
Brittany Ferries needs a new ship.
She will well be able to command him, without gas turbines - in a far-related country and call for support to the State.
And as she knows to do lobbing, not fearing the result.
And so much swimming for employment in France, whose nothing to do, she is always ready to cut when their corporation has loss on the markets, in particular...
That's just because their lobbying did not function that the command was canceled.
If the company had obtained the period or an appeal for Marpol, there is no doubt that the project would be overcome.
To know whether it's good or not and how BF will be in accordance with the law, it would be a symbol that "the world" falls above!
Brittany Ferries company is detained by breast legumes.
Those who burn the centres of tax and suicide.
They want the State's assistance.
That they didn't seem to me at least normal.
And even though a military ship under the French metropolitain plate is 30% more than any other civilized plate, yes, it is normal to wait for a bucket of the State.
Or then we are condemned to be tolerated that Britishs have a monopolic market.
It's the choice.
The ethnic problem of French that considers its maritime façades such as tourist destinations, not as activity areas, where sometimes lives different people from the middle parliament.
This difference is paid every day, lack of investment, short-term life.
One of the reasons for which Britain must find its sovereignty.
That's that and after they will create the breastplay with equipped equipped with pure swimming bretones.
With this, they're sure they're going to reduce the costs significantly...
Of course.
Unfortunately, that's what we're expected from the BBC now.
They always denied everything that was related to the prog, so it is not surprising that they had chosen to go through the only Hackett card, which has always been closer to the spirit of Genesis in the 70s than those of the other members of the group.
Hacket was for Genesis what Malcolm Young was for AC/DC.
If you don't understand how important he was for the sound, you really don't understand their music.
To say the truth, they almost don't mention the work of Gabriel's only.
I don't think the BBC can be accused of “detecting everything in the prog” because they are going to diffuse a documentary of one hour and half on one of the larger groups of prog that have never been existed.
I have not yet seen the documentary, but it is a movie about the Genesis group, not only about its members's projects.
With regard to the card only from Hackett, which would "a closer to the spirit of Genesis in the 70s," I am not agreed.
Hacket has no right to take the road, play a changing rate of Genesis on which he had a variety of levels of participation and proud of having a relief with Genesis that David Gilmour has no right to gather a demon tax at half ends and call it a Pink Floyd album.
Oh, wait...
I think Steve Hacket is not asking anything more than a just representation, but he didn't get it.
At curious feeling, the first album of bank, only, is absolutely gentle, and in fact in the spirit of Genesis in the 70s.
Moreover, they're passed the card only from Hackett because, being honnest, she fears.
Yes, it's one of the best prog groups but would the documentary have been done if they had not had their trade pop success in the 1980s?
I haven't always seen the BBC to distribute a long documentary on groups such as King Crimson and Gentle Giant who have a very interesting history but lacks the popular attract that Genesis has.
Good comments.
I would even say that the BBC has "ever" denied the fact that she's ADORAIT's progressive music in time.
A person with a personal interest cries “prejudiced”: certainly.
A little more than interview with Jonathan King on the DVD version?
Chanson is absolutely great.
If death penalty is an attempt to redoubling a terrible act by another terrible act (including sometimes against innocents), then it is an explosive success.
There will always be a difference of size between a condemned crime and those who kill him.
The Criminal did its act since his faultful understanding of society and rules.
Those who kill it do it since vision and reflection are the most fair and wise of a society.
I mean, they don't have any excuses.
They're undefendable.
Yeah, we understood your point of view, the first time.
This is precisely the difference, Mr LeClos.
The spirit must be a good difference of the common of the deaths to play violence.
That's what the crime has done since his fault of things.
But it is also what produces pain, hate, wine in the neighbors of the unfaithful victim: a false understanding which will never be prevailed to those who are wisely decided of the death of drunk since the saint and just reason of their peestal.
But in order to try to balance the analysis, we could always say that the condemned to death, often, has committed a wild violence, which he could play, against humanly friendly people, who have made it freely.
The neighbors of these harmful victims will obviously see their pain with the disappearance of him who has been the bourgeois, sometimes the tortionary, being loved and harming their nights.
Let us not contempt their emphasis.
Thanks Emilio for this reflection I find very fair.
Articles strong and emerging.
With regard to Marc Asnin, he proves a great intelligence.
The heart cell.
That's uncertainly what I've read more exactly for a long time.
However, it would be believed to read stories of another time, old things, that the barbary of the past would be excused, and then see the dates that closing, 2009, 2011, 2012...
I really don't think Philip Roth is so gentle.
It looks like two of the other "Best American Romanciers" towns here.
Roth, Pynchon and De Lillo are all surrounded.
I thought you had stopped the white.
What's going on?
Roth is great, well better than De Lillo or Pynchon.
And Roth is incomprehensively better than this pennable Bellow, who has received him the price.
Maybe the judges of the Nobel of this year decided that if we have an American layer, it might be likely to have a [leger] racist.
Munro is very good, too.
They're all produced as a literature romans.
His homonyme Joseph is against...
What do you read?
How many of DeLillo's books read?
I never ended Underworld, but a few years later I started reading his other books.
Did you read The Body Artist?
The news as “Women moments in World War III ”?
White Noise?
The first lighter Romans, more sweet, smaller, and their dialogues, are also super.
I don't know if I'm gonna end one day Underworld.
I just know that if I meet someone who wants to live in the same world as I and have read enough books of DeLillo to reject his writing talent, I can only fear that his favorite romancie is Tony Parsons.
Why would it be a conflict...?
It's just interest.
It was an humor trafficking, 'the law' not a definition request.
The text and the spirit appears likely to be here as EVIDENT that the dame has acted in the only interest in SON, and it is absolutely not in the institution she represented, what the term "conflict" comes to do.
There was no conflict for her.
I hope she'll take it very sweet!
Yes, the State Services are very practical: or they prevent a dynamic undertaking to create a value or have not prevailed it from the danger.
After we will hear that French employees are not dynamic and are looking for peace only.
Inondable areas that become constructive on the next day when a large construction program will be launched, it is classic, and not only on a low cost.
Look at the aluvial plains near the rivers.
It has been said to us: "Of our days there are no ambitions more than through regulation bars."
Now, we need to increase the retention lakes in amont and grow the fingers.
But this will be because of the State's services, of course...
The benefit on the field, about all the promotion?
By your land.
So 6 million euros.
It's clearer, there, the interest?
Take the calculator and you'll dream at the life you could have been at the place of Mrs Babin, 1 Adjunto UMP de La Faute on the Sea and the former President of the Commission of Urbanism, which allows you to build!
The 2 mams of the triomphant Sarkozysme are the old and realm.
I'm left and not all sympathising with Sarko, but svp, no political or lower shots all asylums, you're not there in a battle of pushing bulls.
I ask whether the police involved in these recent fusillads were also involved in these incidents.
The U.S. police are enduring crimes.
The U.S. is a mercy.
So, in what kind of fun you live, you?
The U.S. is not a mercy troop.
Yes, American police police are endured because of the races they have been conducted daily.
Of course, no one of them does anything, but the polices “come to emerge them because they are racised”.
That's a good excuse.
Racism is inadequate to the United States, it is unfortunate that there is an accident like that to encourage people to see the problem nearer.
Your generalization shows a deep ignorance of the US...
You don't know it here.
Good polices must reject corrupt racists.
WAND-LES!
Do the calculation.
This kind of open racism does not exist here.
Is the first time you participate in a conversation?
This is not a conversation, you accused someone to be uncertained while it's clear that you don't pay anything - of many sources (US resources) have noticed the perpetual problem that is racism in the United States (these is not an Oisive Specification).
It's very likely that you under-estimate the extension of the problem and don't appreciate what point the tension comes up to this issue now.
And therefore, the border between public and private security for power and privileges, which has never been very strong, becomes more insignificant.
Wall Street finances the NYPD in different ways, so that the treatment undertaken by Occupy is there.
Whatever I think is the naïvety of some and I've taken the fault of VA and others.
And where do you think the journalists find their information?
On the Internet?
They will ask those responsible, speak to them, be sure of confidence.
That the man goes to the Elisea has no wondering thing.
Then, what is the recovery, the verification, the analysis.
And there we understand that the sarcoasters were concerned to be done.
@Munstead, our current President has been elected on an anti-sarkozysme vague on the basis of business mounted from any parts (unless place and no condemnation) which seem to have been accompanied by judges(2 in correction), two friends in Holland.
If this college is revealed between justice, political, executive and pressure that is not imposed by a power organ, it is that your spirit is awaiting you!
RV with Holland...
And of course all this is only co-incidence and non-interviewed !!! ...
If you're thinking only of Sarkozy's support are indicted!
From the extract I could read, the VA article only makes the arrossure.
I've been so weird.
For the rest, the complaint of the World has little chances to abuse because the journalists are not "astraints" in the secret of the sources, right?
It seems to have no connivency between VA and power while it seems to have a conniveness between the power and the journalists of the world for an operation against an opposite.
I must not be the only one to wait for an explanation of the World on the background and its dangerous relations.
We are well before a status scandal that would provoke the crime of the involved government.
From above this editorial to the abois, which is long about compliance with the current government.
This is not a question of left or right, it's more serious.
I would have thought the oil would be good with the smoking smoke!
It's just for the numbers and to reduce the wages and creating housing problems, I'm sure if I was an immigrant of the second generation whose life was pleasing because my parents were coming here I would have had my doubts on the issue of immigration, but it is not a reason to oppose controls.
One of the most sensitive people in a BBC emission on immigration was a second generation Sikh who said that she was at the same time with the number of people who entered and the changes they brought with them, she was associated with a musulman who was not all co-operant, even denied to give soup leagues because of the religion of the dame, he also refused to enter into his place of culture as well as she said that he was not obliged to pray.

As we all know, if we let it do, the United Kingdom will continue to go right - whoever imposes limits and contests, it must be admired even if it is a pub director:) How much better for you!
More right?
Where are you living?
If this country was more to the left, it would be a communist.
Thus what did the New Labour, particularly left?
The liberalization of a country, NHS is to repeat, the mass immigrant immigrants' immigrants' immigrants in their own terms to well-bear the right neighbouring), the culture of social benefits, the age of all oversight, the politically right that kills the freedom of expression.
I understand that the Labour is a left and not a communist centre, I said this to blame, I mean that they socially manipulated a very high percentage of the population to make them dependent on the State.
It's typical from the left, if you want my opinion.
Let your arguments as much you want, but what I asked is specific examples of gauchist policy or a left program defended by the Government of New Labour.
Can you do that?
With all my respect, it's not what you asked, you asked Daniel Johnson what had done according to him the New Labour, which is particularly right.
He gave you his opinion, and then you refused to accept it and changed what you asked.
Yes, it's more the Territory of Tim Bell.

The EU is only a goal that is to make the rail transport sector totally.
In term, this means that the whole pans of the French territory will no longer be served by rail.

Is there another problem with alcohol?
If that is, wouldn't he certainly be a loveth head?
It seems to me that you haven't really succeeded to distinguish the problems that were during the marriage and that you are of course always at the end of pain and anger now which have passed over five years.
Of course, having a former alcool living so close to you and having what seems to be a daily impact on your life is earning and very difficult.
This says, I would feel feel like to love the process of division between your life and the complications you have heritage.
It seems like that's what they do, but it's like an hostility.
Because you all live as close to each other and that the complications seem to be able to continue while new surfaces are made, have you thought of a "sack" plan to make an offence between your life and your future?
The financial problems have a negative effect, but with a competitive real estate credit society, a good lawyer and a little pressure from the court, they may be solved.
It's winning and persisting.
Why not go to a Family Advisory Group to say things openly and to provide it a support to help it to resume the work and pay food pension.
I think this is the key.
Your life is doing more than the time you have passed with your ex.
Good advice.
My advice, ask kids what they want to do, even if it implies to meet the new woman.
Tell them that you will support their choice.
Notify them that he will not hold his promises on contact and ask them to think how it would feel and how they will manage the deception if he does not hold his performance.
Try to keep contact with their father.
If they see that you do this for their good, despite your feelings because of the way he has treated you, they will respect you.
They will never stop loveing you and if you do everything you can do to facilitate a parent/child relationship, they will know who thanks when they will be greater.
I think that children end with understanding what is wrong, if you let them see things by themselves.
Go to a little effort you're close to the Godwin point.
This has increased, in 30 to 40 years, civilization will be disappeared, short term economic interests are too powerful, is the land powder against iron pot.

These are not C02's climate-ceptics.
It's all those who are calfed, those who use the climate, those who take the air or car, who enjoy housings that have to be built, those who buy industrial products that it had to be produced and transported.
These are not the climatesceptics that have demonstrated against the ecotaxe, but the camioners.
No policy is a climateceptic and Arnold S consumes much more than me.
But nobody said that climatosceptics are more than CO2.
The environmental defenders are also delayed for conferences.
It is that individual actions, even if they account, will not suffice.
It is also necessary for political actions (other energy sources, reducing dependence towards car, etc.).
And the politicians are partly in response to their sensitivities.

The United Kingdom depends on immigration to pay all our pensions, to take care of our old, to see their hygienic basins, enter the 30,000 people who die every year of hypothermy or hungry, (Don't forget your laine and your good, which allow you to escape you, to disappear the heat and to eat this sandwich in the dinner).
Don't be like this.
Uncontrolled and not tested immigration will bring Ebola into Europe and the rest of the world.

It's more comfortable.
This is how public money is played in order to allow a minority of individuals to go through a good time in the space to make galipes and roll through the clowns in front of television cameras.
Therefore, television has nothing found, and the authorities are surely expected that a child is designed there to burn the world and raise the median coverage to the Western Queens used for tableid maternities.
It might be that they should reward on the earth to find that we're caught!
In contrast to what you seem to believe, you don't send men or women into the space to make galips or clowns, but to work.
And these work are very useful for humanity in general.
And that is, in all areas.
Many of things that improve our daily, are issues of space research.
So yes, it's the money that's usually expensed.

If you think to buy a plastic gun...
But, and those who don't think to buy plastic weapons now but who have the potential to buy it in the future?
Maybe they're the most dangerous of all.
Not because the plastic sword was a decoration in a private residence.
A plastic gun in a bank is used to try to handle people to believe that it is a real weapon used to make a disappearance.
The plastic swords may be kitch decorations, but nothing else.
A very bad article, would it hurt him the author/editor to put a photo of the 'Sword' in place of general photos of 'plastic swords'?
Or even be pretty curious to ask what it was about to say the inscription (in the next case) who had been shown above?
Mauvais typical reporting, it is attacked on the fact that "it is only a plastic sword" and not on the inspiring jihadi text that is written above.
The sword, a Zulfiqar or Dhu al-Fiqar, is one of the major symbols of the Swiit Islam island.
The Dirani family, contrary, is a musulman born in Afghanistan, the terrorist groups who are seeking to hit the Governments in Syria and Iraq are almost exclusively musulmans.
If only people stopped rid of the fact that plastic cattles are unoffensif.
They may be dead.
Even the small covers that are given in the fast remainings can perish flesh.
Thank you very much for this information, so if it's a common decorative object, it justifys the ridiculum that the author gives him.
Not to try to do it, "ha, ha, a plastic sword", the facts you have described them are in fact supporting its argument.
I at the moment saw these decorative objects in musulman houses, or paintings on the walls, they never looked malicious, just another version of a "Creix".
Honey Jesus, you have right.
And this takes all his sense now...
I saw that guy who looked like to be from the Middle East to Kebab Stop and who distributed plastic coats to anyone all night!
I love the conclusion.
All the wonderful news, often technologically, are given to think of many people that it is a right and a need to benefit it, but they have an immediate and worse cost, a steady cost (abonnement, electric consumption) that are in the budgets.
And it is impossible to profit new technologies generated from frustration.
For example, call for the Energy Solidarity Pact, which allows you to isolate the house combs for 1 symbolic€ when it is inhabited by a modest manner (the costs of work are undertaken by the suppliers of energy!).
Simplely, even if more than 3000 houses have been isolated this year!
Interesting this PES.
But I've never heard it.
Who can call it and how does that work?
for information for 60 million consumers, testing water doughts and preconscious the supply of water equipment on roads and WC.
The study shows that a 4-person family can reduce 30% of its water facture (of 150 m3 /an at 100 m3) is 50 m3 of water economy per year, while keeping the same comfort.
This is not an application crisis, it is a crisis of the system that does not be able to produce sufficiently overcome (which then would be distributed in real terms of real income) to give them the increase of expenditures you are classified in the "related expenditures" category.
In other words, energy precarity, is "right" the turn of the medaille because the economy is no longer going to grow as quickly as it would.
Note that the classical theory (neo) of the economy is totally unable to respond to such a question, as for it there is no intrinsic limit to economic growth, and there is no element that can constrain, a more stronger decade after the decade, the economic growth ritm.
By the same definition (in physical) energy is what allows to realize any physical transformation.
Since it is essentially transforming, energy is allowed to realize the lower economic production (by or service).
And more we want to produce, more energy needs.
This means that any license to the increase in energy obtaining (improprily called 'energy production'), even in the form of an increase in its price, which is contrary to the production of the production (for example, to improve energy efficiency, but to improve energy efficiency requires still lower investments, which are not rentable if energy is not sufficiently coherent).
Besides, there is a very strong link between energy precarity and the fact that it comes, or not, to grow the 'production' not crowded.
And the data published very officially, for example by the International Energy Agency, shows that the situation can only be enlarged in the years and decades that come from (IA, in the last reports, indicates clearly that the pic of conventional petroleum production was reached in 2008, understood, of iron.
But petrol is the form of the most universal energy, because of its very strong energy density, its easibility of transport and manipulation and storage, of its possible variety of uses, etc.)
Three points, good work or performance.
It was a good performance in Germany and there was nothing to return to it equals things.
Take this to France!
You don't have the 18th.
Are you a Guardian webmaster?
As it was noted before, it's good to win.
It's good to win.
Indeed, good jobs are guys.
Although many English likely moving Ecossas when they lose, there's nothing to say, they bring some color to tournois when they come to qualify, at least until they're going to eliminate the first tour.
It's even more rigole if we play against them;)
England begins to worry about me.
Because, now that the “sweet swift generation” is removed, they may have a decent team with all these young people.
Ferdinand, D.
Batty, Joe Cole and David See back in the starting XI, why change a team that wins?
The only English footballer, who, at my humble view, was really "to international class", is David Beckham, a little feasible, perhaps, but I think if he touched a patate like me, he would be completely exhibited.
People forgot their athlic constitution, in addition, speaking about athlic constitution in the sport, Wayne Rooney...?
I'm never moving the Ecossas.
I'm tending to overcome by watching their hot colors with nostalgie at the end of evening...
The only English football that, at my humble view, was really “international class”, is David Beckham.
Yes, people often seem to forget that he was, at his best hours, a very good player.
That is why Juppe would have been badly asking 100000 euros for a conference in South Korea.
And not on what he would get them if he asked them...
You're saying people come to riddle a good thing?
For the rest, I would be surprised to learn that B Debre is, for example, sees only on its deputy payments...
I, mostly, ask the question to know what it can tell in its conferences.
How to reduce the deficit?
How to return to full employment?
I would like to say that any serious confidence of a scientific discipline, some of its scientific level even if it is undertaking a Nobel Price, would not think to ask the least sum.
Content conferences are most free or almost free time.
And I can make sure that these young people are actually working and that the results presented in their -gratuous conferences are real.
At the time of the Restrictions on the Research budget, the reporting of these two figures is designed.
The research conferences of researchers are even paid by the Labo!!!
That's to say...
Everything's clear for me.
They look at the sun.
So N Sarkozy is a worthy of the UMP Ethic.
I'm like the impression that we're trying to win money?
I'm far away from being one of his fans, but we're obliging him to be bad (or painfully) to manage its OK campaign.
But to make conferences, it seems to me to be a entirely legitimate activity.
To add Nina's comment, remember that its movements are undertaken by the contributions.
Epidémiology Rules No. 1: isolar.
All American and British flights to or at the start of Africa should have been suspended for weeks ago.
Human lifes are more important than the right policy.
It is present in Spain, GB, Texas and in other potential locations.
What density of infection of the population is that politics will decide to take the right decision?
So if I want to go from Africa to the United Kingdom, I take the air for Spain, and then I'll renew a Spain airport to the United Kingdom.
If Ebola undertake in West Africa, I see them well prohibiting all flights and vessels in the direction of the United Kingdom.
We'd always need to send goods that says...
What damage that international media panicks for Ebola will not be used to speak less spectrum health crises, but more deadly affecting the inhabitants of West Africa.
We're threatened TOUS.
In every part of the world, men, women. It's so triste journalistic article, a big title so low.
I could read each paragraph and replace the word of men in other contexts (as well relevant): Women are the first read care - men travel from a community to another, etc.
As well as more intelligent comments could be made on ways, reasons and places where we all can contribute to understand and interpretate cultural and social approaches, and the differences in the role of genders that could help Ebola fighting in Western Africa.
Let's go, think and write it, we don't enjoy the voice.
There's a time for everything.
If you're not able to offer a good analysis and an intelligent opinion, maybe you just have to think before writing?
Although I would put the female genital mutilation on the same rang as the disappearance - a shape of terrorism, his survivor rate only makes a different form of torture - to say that its temporary suspension is a "light of hope" override the hearing.
In fact, I see that the contributionr is Sierra Leone, which can give a certain range of "validity" to its opinion, but in that case it is obviously not a better perspective than that of a medium-activist on the street.
And I who believed that the Guardian was in terms of “feer ” as a worldly resource of the journalism - reaching in the 21th century, while his precepts were founded.
Who, in the editional team, let it look like this?
For a territorial or other the money is not considered.
I read without ceasing that the territorial public function increases its effectiveness, and I have never seen articles giving them the word or explaining why.
That would be legal, effectively .
There will be lies without doubt and truth, to separate us the good grain of the beast.
The core of accounts cuts to tell how many economic weaknesses are.
It's true they never had anything to manage Cambon street people.
The CTs do not deficit have funding needs only and only investments they do.
In the power of useing concepts too slightly the press, as the world makes the game of all the darksis.
Debt is profitable because it is financed by investment, collective heritage
Unfortunately, the debt is mainly financed in operational costs...
And as the surrounding of officials (for making beautiful round points for example) gets a growing and incomprehensive charge (obligently load until their death, because life-related work), these collectivities are larger in investments.
The statute of staff must therefore be removed before the decrease of the dots.
And also the financial responsibilities of the males.
It's fabulous, the intercommunities would have joined a decrease of common effects and is the inverse that is produced, demonstrating that the summit of a team is not effective without removing others.
How do you want to manage large territories such as cocahute at the time of the TGV and the car?
The time of the horse for which these territories have been created is restarted, it may be time to react.
They wouldn't prefer to remain impressed, worse embraced, in the administrative tunnel, would it be!
Even warranted attempts, it is not too strong to explain the situation of blocking to which the VAT has conducted with its providers.
This started actually with Pétain.
Then he continued to move to the series "a end of suspicious" came strongly about.
Why are they not going to live in a apartment of $250 million in Monaco above a tank to leave all this suffering behind them?
Europe is also built on a cemetery, and it will be a long and difficult process.
When will these people learn to take care of themselves?
Don't even try the genius’s reply "It's the fault of white".
"Answers" not "responses"
I certainly hope it's a sarcasm.
That was in my previous post, if it was not enough evident.
That's what happens when we're going to be the first.
Whatever the sarcasm or not, there's a argument to pass.
It is now agreed on the fact that the modern Sapanian Homo has evolved to North-East Africa about 200 thousand years ago, and for a particularly huge period, they have been able to travel to North to the Middle East, and the remaining (or at least eight thousand years) is part of the history.
The Acting Minister of Defence had declared a few months ago that there would be no military hospital.
He therefore lies.
It was unfortunately the only government who seemed to hold the road.
We know that we can't trust him again.
Get out!

Very good decision: the Val-de-Grace was a past symbol, a doctor for necks and their families, the care of "Grand V" of a 3-screen doctor.

Do you know that 70% of patients are civilians, of all horizons?
The London Wasps?
I felt their fans based on Wycombe/Lounge.
Like London Irish and London Welsh?
They left the "Londra" the past season.
It's just the "waps" now.
A French of any other name...
At least they're going to Los Angeles, right?
This changes that a football team uses the area of a rugby club instead of the inverse.
Furthermore, the outdoor movements for the Tigers and the Saints will be much easier.
No, it doesn't change anything.
In Stockport County, we have been lacking to be bought by the Sharks Sales, and we have ended to lodge our own stage with them once we found our independence.
I would say the same thing.
The way they stressed to lead on the field, although they had access to other locations, we did not benefit.
I love support Coventry City.
Good news do not stop.
There is always a United Coventry now.
It must be frustrated for a team that hasn't misleading supporters and who had been at the top over 30 years, to see its stage backed by a rugby club.
I have aware of recent CCFC problems, but this must be a good yeff.
For my part, I'm not the club rugby, and to be honned I don't know anyone who only makes it some Watps fans at work.
A few thousands of other people in South East will certainly follow them from far, or are they now to support another team?
Beauty article pro-dome and good popularization.
But who cares about it?
But then why are the computer systems not based on these concepts?
+ as a huge mass of preexisted programs (cobol, java), +parks that all systems do not need them, + because there is no magic baget ++....
And because for most of the computer systems, bugs are not really important, that's the first thing to be on the segment.

Real information time has become a key sector in many areas, and few of those who know the intime details of these processes.
It's 15 years ago I didn't go to a Olive Garden Olympic.
The quality-prix report lowered.
I'm sorry for those who will lose their job, but it's better than closing the box.
I would recommend a simple menu with choices of popularity known.
Reducting costs and prices.
There are already too much salt in our food regimes.
Don't ask Olive Garden to not put salt in the future.
It seems that they are reasoning more benefits with Faisons, and not Faisons of the healthy plates and the best quality-prix report.
They're taking us for pigeons.
Oh yeah, look at the fact that people don't have too aggression.
And then let's make our suspicion by someone else, it's better when it's industrial.
Make sure there's full of salts from there, it replaces the real ingredients.
We would also add some sodium glutamate too.
The amount of salt you have to add to the water of pasture is negative, but it has considerably the goal of the end product.
This is not only the honey of the salt, it also affects the way they cure the pastures.
The end product is so better.
There's no food.
Everyone should try alternatives to the company kitchen.
Is there family restaurants and are they offering saving plates at reasonable prices?
What happens to the United States is very triste.
A banal accident of work that missed.
A young prosecutor, who wanted learner, followed his father's card to kill.
A man shot everything and was badly stopped this birth vocation.
It appears to be condemned at 10 years of prison.
Where are we going?
All agreed!
That humour!
The desire to disappear is evident and difficultly excused and obvious at times...
Effectively the desire to delay it is difficult.
That's what I'm doing for a 15-year-old sympathy.
During the process, the father of the child was denied to never again see his son but without asking for forgiveness to the neighbors he killed himself.
Who's really victim in this story?
What are you going to miss!
The father of the child was condemned for what he did.
With regard to the convergence of lost balles, the accused and criminal, he just knew that the ballets were dangerous.
The kid did nothing to be accused!
So let him pay for the crime he is responsible!
10 years old, it's a little bit in my opinion.
To have had the understanding to go to that young man to make a noise?
In fact, it did the voice!
If the opportunity is present, leave a vacation in the Mosulla Valley and sleep in the B-B of one of the small viticulers.
It makes it twice when I do it, wine, landscape and food is excellent.
Furthermore, if you're there during one of the many vinicous festivals that are in each community, it's better.
I'm sorry, the Moody Valley, I've got too fast.
It is pleased to see that the German wine is recognized.
Only important, the German vineyards traditionally use only a single variety of rain, which means that they must really be hard to keep a certain quality.
Of course, some young generations do experience with different rains, such as France, Italy, etc.
There is no only the family's region that should be recommended - France, the Palatinot Rhein (Pfalz), Baden merely to be visited.
A French interest region is Alsace, which is like a mega between Germany and France.
The wines are German style (or maybe it's inverse, short).
The Germans prefer the drink.
Traditionally, they drink wine after feeding.
Bearing aware of the popularity of sec white during the breakfast, they are now offering a lot of them, and with a higher content of alcohol than their 9-year-old levels.
But their traditional wines are so complex, the sweet is superbely balanced.
Try the Schloss Fullrad Spatle with a homard thermidor next time you go to the rest.
Search Hallgarten online to have a good selection.
I used them when I had my restaurant.
The World Atlas of Wine de Hugh Johnston is a good guide, superly illustrated.
I understand that there will be new readers of the Guardian who discover wine, but this is a recapture of every new newspaper on the German wine since the night of time.
On the other hand, there is a article on the German wines that are now to arrive, the new secs of Baden who are now going to join the plates, the reds that are extremely vigerous, but mostly, are not these Liebfraumch debouts that people drunk when they were young (hey, I really don't think that it is always true or an evocator, except if I address me to more than 40 years - which, as I say, will already see all this).
Close the Grecia Valley would be a huge error and an illustration of the lackable state in which France’s administration is.
A crime against Louis XIV and an ass in the feet of my grand-pair and my grand-Sheet who made their studies there.
In democracy, public health management should be submitted to the vote of the Deputy Chambers of the Ministry Chambers who are under the barbichette and the closed home decisions have become insufficient.
Sorbogroin's right.
It should be done as in Soleil Vert: Euthania from 70 years old.
Furthermore, we could return the flesh that will feed our poor (sic) poor assets because they can no longer go to the market.
Actually, you will find job to our unemployed, the real job, and you will have no more deficit problems!
For older people, time came to pay a little more because national solidarity is not able to provide...
Actives, in the way of disappearance, can not only hold this demographic transition...
So the genery, certainly, but to think otherwise than a hospital model of the 30 glorious ones.
The maximum growth of 1,5% (the case is already 30 years old) for the next 50 years, we will want to recover all the model defined after war!
Val de Grace is the symbol of medicine exception in France: a certain rigour and discipline that was more known in public hospital.
If this symbol falls, it's really a mistake.
First of all, there was no error because the rest of hospitals is not high.
The offence is that the presidents and other elected are being emphasized by the public hospital.
The solution is more in the increase of public service offer in other hospitals than in two speeds.
The Val is a French medicine extraordinary, and of course hearing a symbol.
It would be a fault, a sign of more to walk to the medianoscribed in France.
Without speaking of the military status, which must be absolutely kept.
"The Hospitalization Day price", a hospital management unit, decided by the Ministry with local supervision of the Regional Hospital Agency.
The abolition of our nation continues.
Finally, I mean, of course, the baby is only one of those economic refugees, he came to Australia to have a better payment than the one he had at home.
In almost all countries of the world, a child is born in this country from two non-citizen parents is almost always not civil.
Australia is far from the most of the countries born children from Australian residents.
But it is Australian who is criticised because it does not meet some highly high standards, with difficult consequences clear.
Why?
It seems to me to do two weights.
Send Abbott to the Middle East, Pakistan, Sri Lanka in order to end all persecutions and crimes and wars that have escaped people from their country and have been able to find help in Australia.
If he doesn't want people to come through the boat, then you need to solv the problem that generates this traffic.
I have nothing to do about life in Sri Lanka today.
Civil war has been 26 years old, ten thousands of people died on both sides.
That's what happens during civil wars.
However, war ended six years ago and the country returns to normal.
Everyone takes his sense now, nimrod...
He wondered that the British Prime Minister David Cameron had not believed this small survey when he was in Sri Lanka with Mr Abbottt...
Cameron has described the crimes of war and the abuse that were still done.
Many European countries have since stopped the Tamoul's deportation with LTTE links, thinking they would lead to a risk of torture to their return.
UNHCR revised its directives to assess asylum requests in December 2012 and recommended that those with LTTE relations should be considered risk of return.
In the year [2013] he saw a mount of attacks by buddhist warrant groups against Hindus and Muslims.
The elections for three provincial advice were held in September.
Good afternoon, boys!
Mr. Nowak, if you've gone the cock with so periodic.
In fact, this guy couldn't even get a chance to make it.
Does he not have health insurance in the States?
So he wouldn't have been given any treatment.
I would like to know who is going to pay for medical expenditure during his stay in the hospital.
The city of Dallas may be, unless any labor pay for the purchase of the body?
In the United States, the rule is first cash, help comes later.
Specially in Texas
Unmount the system to %s
Another little, it was explained that the ebola was so fast killed that a large-breaking epidemic was impossible ( there is all a scientific literature on the matter, with models and all).
Then we told us that the risk of condensation of returned persons was zero.
We're more weird, more I'm afraid.
You have to read a newsgroup to believe that a risk can be zero.
You can see three weak but not zero.
Finally, it is a scientific real, more a virus is rapidly (in general) less has chances to spread because the death of the host signs his own death.
The combination of 2 (gain transmission and death) is sometimes from the Spanish named grippe.
It is the general quarantine to save humanity. ..
There is nothing to do before the Mediterranean buildings of certain braves and virtuous, but to the decrease of thousands of other African diseases, which are not known or knowing the place, or the bravour, or the green?
Of course, it brings into light the action of NGOs and encourages them to help, but the repair is a terrible part of the advertisements.
The freedom of expression, both loved by conservators.
The suspension was to keep the doctors under control.
I ask how many doctors have voted for Newman and Abbott, brothers of weapons attacking the freedom of expression and the right to private life of Australia.
I am obvious that they never imagined their conservators would have exacerbated them from their rights to the freedom of expression.
I ask how many doctors have voted for Newman and Abbott,
I'm sure there's one who's not gonna do it next time.
Yes, it is exactly what we need at this time, less of health professionals available during a potential health crisis.
A heat tour for when the problem is really out of control.
There are no enough doctors working in the regions around Australia as well.
The refusal of Tony Abbott to take part in the “life” against Ebola illustrates his philosophy concerning medical challenges.
The Joe Hockey's Plan for a New Medical Research Fund, which should reach $20 billion from 2020, would be truly only a black fall for the budget.
With the pretext of the noble medical research, it will recover $20 billion and, at a later date, transfer these funds as a general income.
I hope Australian voters will see this excellent Russian for what it is.
Tony Abbott is more smart than we don't want to believe it.
It explains that the sale of Medibank Private is compensated by the Market Fund for medical research.
However, it is a loss for diseases, a loss for older persons and a loss for people with low income.
Maybe it's very smart, but it's not just.
Finally, the "menor rose" and its Telstra markets Fund were excellent killers.
If it's not right, then we're mounting to Abbott who's smart.
Send it to the next selection.
The most terrible for Nadine is even the "ancient personality", savourable....
I also noted it, very corrosive as a comment.
If only it could make a dissuader to introduce a buzz on her constantly.
The worst destiny for a policy in the end of the carrier: not to be recognized on the street.
Good morning She has not been recognized in his city of Toul as being sufficient to be able to administer it.
How the good sense of “ provincial ” has of good!
We're seeing a hate time, Madam Morano.
I'm sure against the burka port, but there's no question.
What it tells this anecdote, is the pure state: the middle of minors with a role of ministers, a confusion between the government function and the execution function (when he could Sarkozy could come with his tofa on every point of the road to show that he is well guarding the public order), greatness and uncertainty of their maximum level.
I propose that the right to Morano, Sarkozy and all of these "ancient persons" who have been unable to bear a fire and a teacher, they would like to make it easy to execute their self-proclaimed function of justiceers.
But who's Nadine Romano?
It is actually the main education of the case: even the policemen turned the Sarkozy page, may not even regret it.
He really needs to stop before it becomes sweet for him.
I want this agent who didn't know Nadine Morano's existence, if I could just do the same...
Like bob, to the bottle.
Nothing, thanks to her we're well...
Nadine, if she wasn't there, he'd have to find her!
It's still easy, it looks like Christine Boutin with a blonde drug.
In that case, N.
Morano, obviously, did in the disappearance, in the distraction of the police officer that she had against it, and who had certainly had to multiply the courbetes and the "Yes, madam, certainly, soon, tell me, Madam in what direction I have to run to take me without waiting for this vial woman."
“In one of the cases, Australian Super Hornets left a air attack on an Isis target when the risk of killing civilians became too important...”
The Americans are not bad about that, but I think even if they're going to overcome them or have already done it in Iraq, at least someone counted the bodies now.
For civilians at the industrial level, nothing is revalued with the West War machine.
I am not agreed. The sanctions imposed by the United Nations (including non-westal) between the two Iraqi wars would cost life to millions of Iraq, especially children, older persons and adults.
Most of the anti-arbour demonstrators I knew preferred sanctions to the decrease of the war machine.
Are you also the kind of man who prefered sanctions to order and men on the ground?
Very good note - the United Nations has acted in an incredible and unconsistent in the past few years.
The sanctions are generally ineffective and are not able to touch the election - a reason for which they have the opportun approval of the Security Council.
You may remember that insurgents have not lost time to mark their main enemies when they saw it in recent war in Iraq.
This was the UNCTAP attack that they had been entrusted at Bagdad in 2003.
They struck this place with force and two repairs and I imagine with satisfaction and blood-froid.
So bad and hard this bombing, I was surprised by the shock of people to know that a United Nations mission was like this.
Good note, I really forgot that.
Thus, add half million people to the total number of deaths of the Western nations (or at least with the recent problems in Ukraine, the economic activity was directly dirided to those who were intended to hurt).
It is not helping your argument only to execute unbelievable statistics.
The only loyally reliable numbers of the dead related to sanctions are the children of less than five years and they are even very suspected, since Saddam Hussain refused to leave inspectors objectives to clarify the facts.
It was apparently in his interest to exaggerate the negative effects of sanctions.
The most reliable is that the number of additional dead for this age group is between 200 000 and 400 000, but no one really knows it.
With regard to additional dead in other age groups, estimates are not better than hypothesis.
Since the number of pre-sanctions in less than five years was approximately 10 times worse than in the United Kingdom, for example, the number of after-sanction dead could be widely part of this age group.
It is obvious that it should be feared, but also the gift of gates in general.
It is necessary to stop doing as if people were pure spirits, that love was all that children needed, and that we could do them with unknown ones that the parent or the child may never know, without consequences for them.
One of our myths is Oedipe, 60% of the French are of genealogy.
It's a vital and deprived thing to know his origins.
Instead of making it clear and use fantastic arguments, it would be necessary to explain what serious problems a child can happen or designed with gathe donations.
If you had learned that the parents who have not provided the legs you were issued, you might be able to give it to my opinion, because they hadn't committed any crime.
The latest advanced PMA (e.g. tuberry groups) are at least too discussed as a reasonable GPA.
The true question seems to me to be: the frustration of the desire of children justifying these acrobances, and it has nothing to see with marriage for all.
It's just like a point.
It is clear that the GPA needs to be afraid, which is that this stupid question
Of course, it's triste that you can't have a child when we want.
That's a problem I knew with my wife.
Yet, however, it is less serious than being born very disabilized or become it, contracting a serious disease, losing all her children in an accident etc.
Of all the matters of life, it's not the most serious.
It's a frustration among many others.
This does not prevent life.
And we can always take care of the kids of others!
In a company that does not support any form of frustration, where the child becomes well consumed, the GPA is me unacceptable.
Child's desire is not a captain where the other could be used according to its good wish.
The solidity requires reflection and acceptance.
