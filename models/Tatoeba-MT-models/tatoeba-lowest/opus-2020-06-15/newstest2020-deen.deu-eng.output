New York.Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given his electric carcer with the view of new record numbers to the barriers. "We have the opportunity to reach our first quarter with 100,000 deliverys," wrote Musk in one of the Branchenblog "Electrek" e-mail to Tesla workers.

Available: We can't be kitchen yourself
A kind of bremse in the Great Lake prevents that people can kitchen themselves. This found scientists of the Humboldt University in Berlin with aid of experts to Rats as they shared in the Thursday. This also has been achieved progress in the question why children are so strong against the Kitzels only to ask more.
Finally, it has also been shown why only the nearness of a kitchen hand has been removed before the lamentation of the lamentation. This lies to a deep burden in the larger village, which already extracts the lamentation at the expectation of the Kitzel.
According to the information, previous research showed that Rats with "Laughter" in the Ultrashal area, when they are combined by people. This "laughter" will be transmitted by part of the larger villages, which is the central processing of the haptical approval.
Love is pressed during self-breaking
Moreover, it is found that the brain between self-management and drugs can be different - so people can not be kitchen themselves. The Berlin researchers now found the experts at the Councils that the lamentation is like the activity of the relevant area of the grandchildrins during self-deployment. This is likely if lives are self-developed. During foreign guides and coals through scientists, the activity will be relaxed in the hill and the impopulation.
However, pass the self-guiding and the direction through others at the same time, if the laughter is also depressed. This points out that the brain of the Council is not even between the self-related and the leading of others. The new knowledge is close to the people’s not able to self-country because the self-aming can be actived in the larger.
The Rats are also trained, themselves to kitchen. As well as they turned this initiative in the experiment at the time, sometimes have shown flight retention or sharing. This ambivalence equals the behaviour of children. The ambivalence of the Kitzelns is a reaction of behaviour that is equal to Rats and people.

Iran gives British tanker free
The UN General Discussion has not been solved in Iran's conflict, but now there is a less problem, and the British Oiltanker "Stena Impero" held in Iran could be a partner in the peace plan of the Iranian presidential Ruhani.
Since half July, the British Oiltanker arrested in Iran has returned to international water waters. After release by Iranian authorities, the ship was on the way to Dubai, as the Reederius Stena Bulk shared.
The "Stena Impero" has left the port of Bandar Abbas and the Crew now walks for medical studies to Dubai, explained Reedeficial Erik Hånell. On the middle of day, the ship left the Iranian waters.
The Foreign Minister in London described the settlement of the ship as illegal: "This is part of a model of trials to affect the freedom of the sea. We work with our international partners to maintain the ship and the international law," said it in a communication on Friday.
The Iranian revolution gardens found the Tank on 19 July, under the prerequisite of the Sea law in the Persian Golf. They were seven of the 23 members of appointment have been released at the beginning of September. The remaining 16 Crew Members went to the circumstances, said Hínell. You would have kept in view of the difficult and dismissed situation in the past 10 weeks. The travelers now worked as soon as they were possible to rejoin with their families.
After the definition of the "Stena Impero", the British Gibraltar was a supertanker with oil that was intended for Syria to be put to the chalet. The delivery had rejected the authorities in accordance with the respect of the EU singing against Syria against the Syrian Republic of Syria.
Iran said of "Piraterie" and droved with consequences. In the middle of August, the "Adrian Darya-1" was finally released. It was a couragement that was treated for a task in order to get the "Stena Impero", which was so far back in London.
The road of Hormus is one of the most important Seastres in the world. It links the Persian Golf with the Indian Ocean. A major part of the world oil exports is disappeared through the sea. In the past months, the trade ship was entered into the conflict between the U.S. and Iran. There were too many interact cases with tanks and drugs.
In addition to the disparities between Teheran and Washington, the Atom Strategy of both countries. The Americans put the Iranian leading to build atomic weapons. The Iran revealed it. The United States 2018 had to go out from the international nuclear agreement that Iran would lead to the construction of an atomic and economic isolation and should be along with its political and economic isolation. Since the US government sets the guide in Teheran with mass economic sanctions against the country to enhance a closer and extended agreement on other areas.
The United States are working on a coalition for military protection of trade ships in the region through the fight on the "Stena Impero" and other cases with tankers in the Persian Golf and oil plants in Saudi Arabia.
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani presented a plan for security and peace in the road of Hormus, with the 'Coalition of the hope' initiative for the Persian Golf, Iran wanted to ensure, together with the Arab Golf States and without foreign protection forces for the security of the ships in the Persian Golf.
When its protectionist economic policy is a better future.
When it is actually predecessed to the "Criegs winner". The face of the criminal offences, which restrained by the American President Donald Trump against Chinese producers, sees foreign producers in the People's Republic aggravated to deploy. The financial heads of Asian firms who intended to establish their production from China in another country called India in a survey of the UBS as one of the preferred alternatives. This has not only done the incompatibility of the Chinese-American Trade War. With a Riesen-Pool to young workforces, and an internal market of 1,3 billion candidates, India seems to be found in the globally sensitiveness of the Chinese and American trade wars.
However, now India has been in Trumps Fokus. The United States viewed the prohibitive market access for farmers, mobile phones, spirits, motors and others requires better market access.
On the world card of trade wars, the reizen with India freely bloss make a neighbouring place. In addition, America has the world's most largest democracy of the security policy. Delihi and Washington engaged the concern about China’s powers in the South Ocean. First of this background, a Salve American Criminal Law against India is incredible. Indeed, the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has reached a second five-year period of time, should be in security.
The problem is therefore in another place: the empirically strengthened those that open markets have accelerated the economic development, in the Socialist Republic of India has a serious position in Modi. Its reformal is mainly on the Brazilian irasins, which has firsted every one undertaking spirit. Business will now receive rapid construction benefits for buildings. They benefit from a better energy and transport infrastructure, and a strict insolvency and competition law, seems to be liquided with high-country companies.
The success of these efforts can be seen and measured in the relevant rankings. From economic optics in India, in the first five years, many of the best ways. However, the trade policy does not apply, but it is not in the view of protecting international little competitive enterprises from foreign providers, the national conservative government has even produced new diseases.
In the Western, Modi of the Nimbus of the Energy Reformer, which renews its country economicly radically. This impression is not last of the fact that the charismatic Prime Minister is only all too well to know what Vokabular Western Managers needed. The Kern pressed the "India First"-Advokat but never declined from a protectional economic policy, which prevents the Indian companies to discover abroad from abroad-onestistic rescue and thus implemented for global competition. Business, which was acknowledged by the rescue of their Branchs, includes the capitals of the National Bhartanian Jaya Party and these shortly politics.

The competitors aimed at goal: Dabo is the first secret hero of the easeathletic-WM
The world's pipet was already in danger in the purpose of playing in the elected Khalifa International Stadion. At the first stage of the men's 5000 meters, Jonathan Busby from Aruba, he was able to take care of 300 meters before the goal, and was still on the knees, moved in unwanted stop, as Braima Suncar Dabo out of the Western African country Guinea-Bissau was soon understood and supported the last half stadionrun in the target. The arms were still rich in both, but after the end of the end of the armband. As it had been not enough to stop.
"I just wanted to help him. Everyone in this situation would have done the same thing," said Dabo after the rain in Mixed Zone, when he was fully waiting for the attention of the collected journalists, he wanted to only speak about his herother. Finally he wanted to put his personal busy time and he would have noticed that it would be difficult to help only a gentleman. And without anyway, he would only be stolen to represent his country that was invited by the WMs. In normal circumstances he wouldn't have been able to start. "There I've been slow to call here for my country," he said.
That he did at the evening with oppression - and much more intense as he was thinking about it. Because this herdentate will remain in memory. As well, Dabo, his competitors even left the goal and voluntaryly overlooked the last place - but the rest of five minutes after the Ethiopier Selemon Barega, who had received this transition. It had nothing at the end, because that only with much help in the objective, Busby was disqualified exactly at the end of the world's live-life connection.
Dabo, who lived in Portugal and studied in Lissabon, was able to make a personal time at the WM in Doha. It was the voice of official data at 18:10.87 minutes, even though he was enthusished: "I wanted to run 17:55 minutes. In 18 minutes I was once." Allirding only in the triining, since not the best time.

Last week, it was come to Kairo, Alexandria, Suez and Mansura to Protesters with hundreds of participants. They were sentenced against the Government of President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, the critical corruption and Misswirtschaft. A so open proof against the political leading had not given it in Egypt for years. The Swedish Exhibition of Egyptian Bauers and Watch Mahammed Ali, which was the demonstration of videobots on Facebook's roles, has not been called for the day of free to a "Milionenmarsh" in the country. Ali requests a "Volsrevolution". The man for the most younger Egyptians, not even for the United States, but for the United States, for the United States, for their military, has been aware of their army.
The number of festivals related to the Protesters continued to follow two observer groups. The Egyptian Commission on Rights and Freedoms (ECRF) has reported more than 1.570 festivals. The Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights (ECESR) and the Human Rights Organization of Watch (HRW) said of more than 2.000 Decrees. Independent, these numbers have not been confirmed first. The Government has confirmed and not commented the numbers.
Voluntary conclusions

The prejudices against the festivals made rich, according to their complaints of "Proliferation of false information" to the membership in "terroristic agreement". In Kairo, Alexandria and in other cities, the warrants in the Uniform, but also in civil clothes, to use HRW instructions.
HRW also criticised the Zensur in the North African country. Afterwards the government in Kairo websites and online services to connect further protection against Sisi.
Online guests: Senders should be able to speed easily
For online hosts, many lost packages have been backed. It is about 20 million return countries so on the mull. However, there is an alternative.
The Ministry of Finance has shown a way as they can dependent on the products instead of destroying them.
Although the enterprises could not be exempt from the expenditure tax to Sachs, the Ministry explained on a question of the Green-Bunde Day fraction reporting on the periods of the Funke Medium Group on Friday, but the traders could be low to fix the market value of the unconscious returns that they should not be paid or only a little exchange tax.
Academics of the University of Bamberg found that the federal bushers returned every sixth package on the Internet. Around four percent of the goods - around 20 million products - landed in the pool. You would depend on the company after the current legal situation, as the financial authorities estimates the expenses as an expenditure on which the expenditure is then affected.
Green-Green Group Chapter Katrin Vistaing-Eckardt requested financial Minister Olaf Scholz (SPD) to clarify that enterprises can not be assessed in accordance with legal products and freely depend on common organizations. The companies should not be retained for unless. This is not only for the online channel but also for other businesss from the model to the construction market.

Brexit debate is like a "Spacegang in the park"
The powerful attacks of the British Prime Minister of Boris Johnson on Brexit-German in the Parliament are not in a climate of the Hassy. In comparison with the election campaign before the Brexit Referendum 2016, the current conflict is a "Spacegang in the park", Dominic Cummings said in the Friday of a book proposal. "We will enjoy this. We will (of the EU) and we will gain."
Johnson had attacked Brexit gentlemen in the past days and presented, among others, the "Congress" in the people. Prosecutions that he could bring the deputy Members to risk because they could be about the purposes of murdering, he put out as "Humbug".
Cummings said that the only way to restore peace, if the Members would finally respect the decision of the Brits for a exit from the EU, it is not surprised that people have been brought to the Britain of three years after the referendum of the EU.

Pakistan President Khan requests Uno-Introduction in Kaschmir
With an emotional appell, the President of Pakistan, Imran Khan, at its first meeting of the United Nations, requested the United Nations to introduce in the Kasmir conflict.
Otherwise, it is a new war between the Atomic Pakistan and India, probably said Khan on Friday at the Uno-General debate in New York. "When it's wrong, you'd need the best, but you're prepared to the worst." The United Nations had a response to Kashmir. "If you had to prevent it."
India and Pakistan have conducted three wars since their independence of British Colonal Governance in 1947, two of them about the shared region of Kashmir. Both atoms dominated a part of Kaschmir, another part of China. At the beginning of August, India had taken the Indian Kaschmir region to the autonomistatus and thus increased the spaces in the relationship of Pakistan.
Don't even a flat water
The demonstrators in Kairo require the tour of the Egyptian President al-Sisi.
The current protester in Egypt reacts the government with a hard hand. It is allowing the population to appear more than 2000, arrested in prisons to the 60,000 political prisoners who have already been in Egypt. Protestation was never a year old. However, since the transmission of General Abdel Fattah el-Sesi in 2013, the State equipment makes it all to avoid a scenario as at the time of the Arab printing.
But one of the Protect 2011 was the bad economic situation. Poverty, perspectiveness and feelings to be resolved by his own government triggered millions on the street. And this is a problem that also does not get the regime of el-Sisi, matter how hard it is against oppressors. The situation has even disappointed.
Today, every third in Egypt lives under the poverty limit. Since 2016, the currency has lost more than half of its values, the inflation rate is at ten percent. He wants to buy a flat water in the Super market, to decide who is funded: Nestle, Coca-Cola or the Military. Last is not only responsible for the subpression but also the greatest economic actor. The military forced roads, households, footballstadies, produced food and many more. This was already before el-Ssi. With authorised governments has many experiences in the supermarkt, the Egyptic people will also be a former dilemma. Cristics then, if large parts of the population have been lowing over the water.
Tüv tests in the terminal: BER-Cheef: No "Showstopper" more for main stages
Two months have been verified whether the complicated installation was not functioned in the BER-Brand protection in the joint game. The operators are satisfied with the history. However, the pit is not yet finished on the BER.

Lütke Daldrup said that in many cases there are no indications, less about a new cabel. There is still no release for all dubels in which the cabelettes belong. The aircraft is expected that this is to the end of the year.
Furthermore, the border protection is not satisfactory in the street under the terminal. The problems had been brought into a further crisis before three years ago. This time it is about railways that drop down at a bar like a leather, so that it does not extend the road. They are too far. 36 engines must be exchanged so. Then it will be the beginning of the year.
Problems with brand protection and other trees and planning errors continue the discovery of the airport for years. Originally, 2011 should be operated. The costs have increased since the beginning of 2006 from two billions to approximately about 6.5 billion euros to open the next year.

Study of causes of heart diseases
Smoke, oversight, unmatched food - there are risk factors for heart crowd diseases. But what do you actually solve a heart hazardous or an infarct? Hamburg researchers want to see the inheritance of 9,000 healthy and gentle people.
On the analysis of the host of 9000 people, Hamburgers and Swiss scientists want to come to the cause of heart-Creislauf diseases more detailed on the screen.
The research project is the greatest of this kind in the German language room, which participated in the University Climate Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) on Tuesday. The Kohne Institute promotes the projects with 12,5 million euros. From Switzerland, the high browsing climate Davos, which is listed to the Stifation and the University of Zürich.
Oversight, raw and unmatched food contains the essential risk factors for heart crischool diseases. Genetical factors define the risk. The combined between Gene and external infringements is only not sufficient but are not sufficient. Now the scientists want to compare the full benefit of 8000 healthy people with the 1000 old patients of the University Herz and Fabric Centre on the UKE.
It is now known in more than 4000 of the relevant human genes, possible human disease changes in the DNA - so-called mutations - called the clinicum. Every year approximately 200.
The aim of the five-year project is to develop new options for precaution, recognition and treatment of hearty muscles, heart-making and heart-infarcings. The data may also be able to develop new options in the study of other people diseases, such as Stefan Blancenberg, Leader of the University Centre. New knowledge to play between hearts, herrs, heart and necks and cancer diseases.
The Chairman of the Kuhne City, Klaus-Michael Kohne (82), also stressed that it would also be able to use the data also to investigate other diseases. The clinic of the building in Davos has been treated so far as allergian. Now it should be covered a center for Cardiovascular Precision Medicine and be created a Professional for Bioinformatics. In order to address his commitment, he said that he was covered in Switzerland for three years in Hamburg in the open heart and very grateful.
The biotests of the healthy participants are also made by Hamburg City Health Study. With 45,000 probands, the largest local health study of the world. In the event of the encryption, they will be closely respected to the protection of anonymic data, the scientists. It goes to a petabyte (1000 Terabytes) to data, Holger moch said from the University's Enterprise.
A person’s heritage can today be encrypted by UKE within 24 hours. The clean costs of 1300 euros are in place. The first general sequence of the world, which has been published in 2001, have been designed even more hundreds of millions of euros. The study will begin on 1 October, the end of 2020 must be analyzed all 9,000 results. In this year, the first results will be expected.
Nigerian police frees hundred missed boys
In Nigeria, the police has released more than 300 people who had been collapsed and misused from a core school. According to the instructions of residents, the security forces searched the school in the northern American city of Kaduna and discovered the victims of other years, such as the police speaker Yakubu Sabo shared. “The victims were mistained. Some of them were given to be entitled by their teachers," said Sabo.
The boys are kept under the preconcept to be teached and "favorited" in the coran. Of course, they have kept the shopping of their teachers under "the most and unmensive conditions", said Sabo. Some hundred students, including children in nine years of age, were in a small room.
The Coran School was reported in accordance with the information for about ten years. The inhabitants had noticed the authorities to reiterate irregularities in the institution. The parents had shocked to show themselves when they were instructed about the situations in the core school, Sabo said. They had no idea of the suffering of their children.

Worldfußball selection: Forwards to Mess and Clopps Core
football "invalid subtitle"
Jürgen Clopp, Lionel Mesi and Megan Rapinoe
With a Gala in Mailand, the World Football Track Fifa sets the best player, the best player and the best train of the year. For Lionel Mesi, it is the sixth honor and record.
After Nicaragua's Captain explained that he has never decided at the World Football Valley, there are other countries' prejudices to the Fifa and Egypt was not evaluated - with a curious congratulation.
Many of the Fifa has shown in the past years as a relaxed way: the WMs, dubiose plans of her President Gianni Childin, the general behaviour of different corporate functions. However, the Fifa-Weldballer Wolf has not been defended to disappear us - if it is seen that the stipulated national trainer and national society capital of the Membership is often more than the sympathy of the objective estimation.
However, after Nicaragua's complaint, he did not have decided, now there are other misunderstandings on the day: Egypt claims that the voices of the National Trainer Al-Badry and Captain Mohamed Salah were not taken into consideration. In fact, they are not in the official and public votes.
The Fifa appeals that "the signs of the electoral forms have been set in the large books and therefore have not been valid".
Sudan Trainer also surprised
In the case of Egypt, the Swedish Union has also been elected in the case of the Sudan's election, as it was finally assigned, as it was finally estimated: with Lionel Mesi, the Virgil of Dijk on two and Sadio Mané. In the meaning of Fifa, the vote has not come as well with the signs and official steel of the Sudan Union.
Forwards Nicaraguas, Captain Juan Barrera, also said: "Don't decide for the #TheBest2019 Awards. All the information about my voice are wrong, thanks," he wrote. In his case, he was enthusished that the Nicaraguan football connection was simply fixed in his name.
On Friday, the message came now: Stimmt, but it was of course not an intention. The election documents are "irturally" with the name and the signature of John Barrera, the Captain of the Nicaraguan selection, called it in a Communication of the Contract. Actually, he chose the second Captain Manuel Rosas. "We transmit the responsibility of the administrative error," said it in the communication. As Rosas and managingstra of Henry Duarte had been appointed for Messi, "when is the way that it is in the official list of the FIFA".
The other cases are allowed to check the Fifa in an investigation now, but it notes that the election process is overseered by the Waterhouse Coopers Price. As long as Lionel Mesi remains once again unresolved passenger of the World Football Woe - and Jürgen Clop World Trainer of the year.
Ukrainian Officer: Ranghohe Republicans speaking for official investigation
Two ranghe Republics have opened a formal investigation against the US Presidency and Party and Donald Trump. "I think that the investigation is important", said the republic Governor of the United States Vermont, Phil Scott. "When it is set by the facts that are set," he would like to know more about the Whitewill Officers before the action of actions. An impact can lead to the appointment of the President.
Scott said he was not surprised by the enthusiasms. These showed that Trump had re-examined the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj in a phone requested the activities of the Democratic Presidency Minister and the former Vice-President Joe Biden in Ukraine.
The Republics have resolved Trump's critics because of the white-level workshops, which have only noticed few obstacles. Scotts are now a first sign for them in Trump Party, and the moderate Governor of Virginia had already acted again against the Trump policy, such as the removal of environmental protection provisions and the detection of immigration rules.
As an elderly ruling Republican also said Charlie Baker, Governor of Massachusetts, for the investigation. "It's a deeply disappointed situation," said Baker. "The right action and responsibility for the Congress is now to investigate the matter and to go on the reason."
Scott and Baker have not formally been speaking in the process against Trump decided in the Congress. Its exemptions are therefore very important. However, the first Senators of the Republics have also expressed critically about the situation. Along with Romney, the Federal State Utah in the second parliamentary Chamber, said that the case is "removable, extremely disappointed".
In the introduction of an official decision procedure against Trump, the democrates in the representative house have announced an investigation in this case. They have put him power use for for foreign impact for their own political benefits.
There is no exact time plan for the decision-making procedure. With its majority in the representative house, the democrates could focus on a so-called Impact. The decision on a real official decision falls in the Senate where Trumps Republics have the majority. The visions on the success of such a procedure are therefore low. Unless US Presidency has been enthusied by an impasse effect of the Office.
Good Foundation at the Board of Rackets "Sea Watch"?
Three men have been found in Belgium, they must have been monitored and murdered in liberal refugees.
The German Captain Carola Racket (31) was arrested in June after she was undertaken with the Rescue ship "Sea Watch 3" and 53 lybian refugees at the boat unlawfully allowed the port of Lampedusa. After the greatest protection and international criticism – also by Austrian Federal President Alexander of the calls, her homearest was re-ested after a few days from an Italian judge.
Now the new hard prejudices against Rackets are called. Thus, three men who were found in Libyan flights who have come to the "Sea-wach 3" in Italy. The suspects were in an acquirer in Messina (Sizilien) after migrants had recognized their peiners in Italy. "We can't exclude this, but haven't even secured information," said the "Sea Watch"-Sprecher Ruben's new constructioner of the German Prise Agency.
In the middle September, the police said that the suspects in the north African country had been murdered, killed and even killed. It was about Mohammed C. (27) from Guinea, and the two Egyptians of Hameda A. (26) and Mahmoud A (24). “The migrants have been systematicly exposed and produced, by renewed and permanent physical violence,” said it in the communication.
NGO and help organizations now show that they don't know exactly who comes on the ships. "We can't scann who are the people. The people come without pools," said new constructors. Indeed, it is one of the main reasons why people from Libya flee. It is therefore likely that they can also be found in the ships.
Italian Judicial Ex-Internal Minister Matteo Salvini requested Rackets, with regard to the aid of illegal immigration in Italy.
Musk stretchs the release record in Tesla
The Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has given its electronic auto-concert with view to new record numbers of records strongly on the bars.
"We have the opportunity to reach our first quarter with $100,000 delivery", wrote Musk in one of the Branchenblog "Electrek" e-mail to Tesla workers.
The question is strong so that Tesla could visit 110,000 orders, it was called in Musk's round writing. The challenge is to bring cars close to the customer. It also needs to offer Tesla to the quart as many resources as possible.
In the second quarter, Teslas Aktien went out with more than six percent of the trade. The currency was so strong for almost four months. The second quarter of Tesla had been equipped with 95.000 cars and thus reached its best value.
Musk needs records to achieve its high objectives. 2019 he wants to deliver totally 360,000 to 400,000 cars. For this, it needs to get six numbers in the next quarter year. First of all the most current Tesla Model 3 is asked, but there are little winning margins. Although the tree was last lost, it was lost.
US Budget Street: Renew a press financing
The new financial year will begin in the U.S. on 1 October without a ordinary budget. The Senate has been followed on Thursday to the representative house and has decided a transitional financing until 21 November.
Although the American Congress and President Donald Trump in August have increased the expenditure limits for the bienniums 2020 and 2021, the United States have decided the new Fiscal Year before the beginning of October 1st year. The Senate was held on Thursday to the Representative House and has decided a transitional financing (Continuing Resolution, CR) until 21 November. If such decision comes on the middle of the Midddle East, it has been part of the Federal Administration.
Removing Remote
The Federal Administration is now funded at the level and with the priorities of the expenditure plans for the past financial year 2019. This, because the Congress is not in time to the 12 expenditure laws, could some of which are able to provide the various departments and authorities to provide the resources. For the first reason, the Federal Administration cannot benefit from the new financial year of 1,3 Bio. by $1,4 expenditure frameworks.
The Democrats have completed the majority of ten of the twelve laws, but the expenditures reflect the priorities of the Democrats, which have few chances in the dominant Senate of the Republics. In turn, the Senate also has also made ten of the 12 expenditure plans, which are less or less ready to most.
In particular, the spirits are divided on the subject of resource allocation for the area of internal security and border security. In the Senate, the Republics are trying to demonstrate $12 billion for the wall construction, one of the great prioritys of President Trump. Democrates focused on the wall plans and funding for other military constructions and projects. The fight on the wall has already been calculated in December 2018 and had been held to a 35-three-shaut building.
At the wall building, the spirits separate themselves
At the same time, it is clear how the parties want to come close to this question. Probably as an agreement on all 12 expenditure laws in the coming seven weeks is an extending transitional financing over 21 November.
Following the continuing incapacity of the Congress, some of the 12 expenditure laws, and the risk of an incidence to the automatisation of the process on popularity. Proposal No 1877 on the prevention of Shutdowns would continue the financing of the Federal Administration at the previous level, engage the travel of parliamentarians and retaining their loans until the new annual expenditure plans.
France allows artistic feeding for readers and Singles
In France, the future will open only women and lessons: the Paris National Assembly has made great majority for a Government's legislation proposal, after which all women can take an in-Vitro work, and that the request should be clearly requested by an independent seed.
In the thirty-term emotional debates, the proposal was still needed to be agreed to the Senate. Critics were in the right position that many “Cinders without father” could grow in the future. The French Bike-Bish Conference is against the news.
The new regulation is the core part of a bioethic setting, the Minister of Health, Agnès Buzyn as "Chance" for society. It is the modern family in which children with only a parent or individual parents are protected. After their views, the costs for artificial benefits for all women from social insurance should be paid.
Prohibition with Sperma of dead marriage
The majority of the National Assembly, with which it was a amendment to give youth access to the sperma of her dead man. In Belgium, Spain and Britain, the artistic feeding "post-mortal". In Germany, there were cases in the past, in which women had been seen on the production of the sperma of a destructed sperma. In Paris, the pre-president of Paris, a likely produced child gets a "a particularly serious shicksal".
Number of Members of the Government Party La Republic and Marche (The Republic in movement, LREM) by President Emmanuel Macron and Members of the Opposition had spoken for the artistic benefits of the sperma of the lost partner. They noted that a widow would be a "duplicated road" when the death of her husband and her children were not satisfied.
The initiativers of the amendment now have been unfair to make a widow for the future with the sperma of an unknown partner but not with their own partner.
Today, the artistic employment in France is allowed only theerosexual couples that could not produce children. You must be married or lived at least two years. Buzyn has already announced that the mourning will continue to be prohibited.
However, it is often difficult for all women in Germany, the former theoretical use of all women.

The discussion of a climate of flights from universities and high schools is renewed before the Sommer Pause.

This is the first step "decreased" should also be a wide debate on the availability of flights, meaning in their opinion. The Urgent has already been held in July.
Russia takes a festival of North Korean fisher
According to the secretariat of the FSB, the arrested illegal in Russian waters had been taken. Decade days ago 161 fishermen from North Korea were taken. At the same time there was a smoke change between the borders and the boat retainment. Three Russians and a North Korean were banned, but the fisher was later leaving sustainable violations.
The Communist North Korea leads to chronic food mixtures. North Korean fishermen were then moved into Russian oil waters, and the Russian Watch is on their own information to protect their more biological resources.
30,000 Tintensian complaints
In the new controls, 30,000 tickets were discovered and found on the boats. Moreover, the information under three fisher and two motor boats were brought to Naodka and Posjet at Wladiwostok.
The Russian fishery Authority also had not been issued to the northern Koreans in this year, but thousands of fishers from North Corea have already been established in this year.
The Chief of the Russian Fisheries Communities in the remote region of Primorje, Georgi Martynow, recently appealed highly ecological damage by the northern Korean fishermen. They were banned in Russian with enthusiastic synthetic nets. With these would also take small lives from the sea. The nets would easily get out where they were 200 years to be distributed.
The future only 18.000: USA without Asyl-Ober limits
The "Greundest Nation in History", Donald Trump, here at a meeting with selected police officers in the white house.
The richest country of the Earth is close to protection visitors: As the Foreign Minister in Washington confirms, the higher limits for the legal allocation of refugees will continue to be removed. The future will, above all, receive detrimented faithful and Irak Asyl.
The U.S. Government wants to reduce the slow limit for the adoption of new refugees. In 2020, which works in the United States from October 2019 to September 2020, at least 18,000 people in the country, as stated by the United States Minister for External Employment.
The Government of President Donald Trump has earned the preparation for protecting researchers from all the world in the past years.
However, the highest limit of 18,000 refugees would be the lower since the introduction of the US refugee programme in 1980. The Foreign Minister called the United States as the "effective and greatest nation in the history", a formulation that recalls the use of the US Presidency's officer.
A "competence of responsibilities" with refugees stressed that refugees can return to their homelands to help reconstruction, Trump explained. For its hard course in the migration policy, he has a lot of support, but there is also massive critics.
A great point of combat is the border to Mexico, the Trump wants to finance. To be able to finance a border wall, Trump has reduced the national emergency. If it is a timely link between the current measurement and the current internal developments in the US capital, it is unlawful. The Trump is currently under pressure of the Selenskyj's workshop and a possible official decision procedure.
The U.S. Government will focus on the adoption of two refugees groups: people who are persecuted because of their faith, and Irak who have helped the US military in the country and have been in danger, as the statement of the Ministry of External Ministers is issued. From Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, a maximum of 1500 refugees must be taken.
The U.S. wanted to reach that, in particular, people from the North Threeck, Central America in other countries of Asyl. First of all, the United States have closed the Guatemala and now also with El Salvador and Honduras Migration agreement to join migration to the United States southern border to Mexico.

Conflict between Iran and the United States: Ruhani speaks of the end of sanctions - Trump
The Iranian President Hassan Ruhani, after returning from the United Nations Volal Assembly, spoke of a pleasant offer of sanctions to rise from the United States. The United States would have put an end to all sanctions on his official website.
However, President Donald Trump resisted the Iranian officer on Twitter: "The Iran wanted to resume the sanctions that I would resolve against him so that there was a meeting. I said, of course, no."
The events are likely: The Federal Canadas Angela Merkel, the British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and the French President Emmanuel Macron were present in New York and would be grieved that a meeting was held. "And America said that I had the sanctions," added peaceani. The type of crimes to be completed have been held in the debate. "And they have clearly said we had all sanctions."
However, this prevention is not done in a acceptable way, crystalized Ruhani. The face of the applicable criminal measures and "the forgotten atmosphere of the maximum pressure" no one could prevent the end of negotiations.
At the beginning of the week, Kanzler Angela Merkel was met with Ruhani in New York. The foundation was the hope of the Europeans to release nuclear agreements negotiated with Russia and China with Iran. This should stop the Islamic Republic to develop nuclear weapons. Frances President Emanuel Macron had as a Merkel on the border of the United Nations Volal Assembly, hoped that the Ruhani would be met with the US President Donald Trump.
Three earthquakes near Istanbul - Fast 200 Foundation

14 schools in Istanbul were closed from security reasons. hundreds of buildings were defended. The earthquake of the strength of 5,8 had been destroyed the Marmar region before Istanbul and solved Panik in the millions of meters. Now the government wants to establish a Commission to prepare the country better on earth.
During the past 20 years, Turkey had not been prepared sufficiently on beasts, said Istanbuls citizens Ekrem Imamoglu. In the city itself, it will always be ignored that the damage has been ignored. Every year, the badly built habitat houses - among others have caused the many small earthquakes, which regularly disappeared in Istanbul.
City plans such as the famous architectin Mucella Pharici, since years old, have been built up large open areas in the center. First of the 20th day of the dilctch ground in August, the building chamber of Istanbul had not been valuated for a million building in Istanbul.
The Episcenter of the Bevery on Thursday was located in Marmarameer before the beach Silivri and around seven kilometres of Tiefe, as the Catastrophe Protection Author of Afad shared. A small afternoon was a few minutes later for a greater Panik on the streets.
The Istanbuler citizen Ekrem Imamoglu participated on Twitter, not first reported the latter or damage. The TRT states showed people who railed out of the houses. Students were brought out of security from the buildings. Some schools laughed like to see pictures.
Estanbul is particularly threatened. Under the Marmarameer, a section of the so-called northanatol Sterncy, which marks the border between the Eurasian and the anatolic earthquake. Turkey is always destroyed from earthquakes. One of the most destructive was the beast in the closest of Istanbul in 1999. At that time more than 17,000 people came to live.
Researchers fear that a earthquake of the strength of 7,1 to 7,4 might lead. However, when it comes to the earth, it is unhearned. At Thursday, the west of the country and Istanbul has come again.
Corporate removal plans, private leaders have completed go-bugs with all needs packed by households, and bring schools to children, how they have to take themselves when the earth wake. If the next large beast comes, it's unlawful.
The Turkish President Recep Taygun Erdogan said that after his return from New York, eight people were disappeared. Some buildings were easily harmed. The Istanbulanbulan citizen team Ekrem Imamoglu followed the developments from the Istanbul Catholic Coordination Centre (Acom). After their information, two mines of Moscheen were entered into the Adcilar and Sariyer.
Warning before following in Istanbul

The chief of the Turkish red halfbmonds, Kerem Klinik, warned by Twitter. He called people to stay far from buildings that had been shot.
The date of the requirement is specified by official information according to 13:59 (Orts time). Only a few minutes after the first beb, CNN Turkey has been given a subsequent follow-up that has been given on the court scala of 4.0.
On Sunday, a landscape of the strength of 4.6 had destroyed the Turkish Marmora region - it was to spring to Istanbul. It was also the episode center located in the Western Marmarameer of the Millennium Metropols, the Catastrophe Protection Author of Afad already in Sunday.
It was not the only earthquake that was assembled for pitchers at this Sunday: even Pakistan was taken by a serious earthquake.

A call in Ukraine, and all is understood? The US Presidency Donald Trump might be able to check after the turbulent enthusiasms of the past days in fact with a official decision procedure that democrates want to make it as soon as possible with their representative's own investigation in the house - the speech is from weeks until a decision would be taken.
At the beginning of the Skandal, the telephone port with the Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Sellenskyj. The prerequisite of the whistleblower, which is concerned about the national security and the democracy of the United States with his complaints, is monströ: The President has missed the power of his office to make the Government of another country influence on the election 2020. He has used the independence of Ukraine to be actived against a political heir.
The Kern of this project is also to be completed in the letter of the conversation with Selenskyj, although she does not return the full word. The telephone of 25 July is only a greater history in which the center of Trump is especially his own lawyer: Rudy Giuliani.
The story takes from the view of the public in May 2019, when the New York Times by Rudy Giulianis reports to the Ukrainian trip plans. He wants to meet himself in Kiew with the President Selenskyj, and he himself knows very exactly that his intentions are ill. "We do not enter us in a choice, we're missing us in an exhibition where we have the right," he says the newspaper. You should think it's unrealised, but "Daran is nothing illegal." Giuliani wants to be followed in Ukraine, for which it might be a found - "for this information is very helpful for my clients and could be a helpful way for my government."
The lawyer and the former New York citizen seems to have infected rights of disappearances fixed at Trumps against Candidatin at the election of 2016: Hillary Clinton has concentred with actors in Ukraine, has said that criticians at the time to build a statement for Russia's publications in the United States.
The version of Giulianis and the President is the former Vice-President of the President of the Democrates of the Democrates, Joe Biden, has been a representative of the Ukrainian Government of Obama on the delimitation of the Ukrainian General Secretary-General Wiktor Schokin, and is of course to stop the investigation of the Gas company responsible for the supervision of his son Hunter Biden. Biden senior has been financed by the Ukrainian Ukrainian General Chairman for the courts of his family.
In fact, the end was something else. When Joe Biden requested the Ukrainian General Officer, the exempts against the gas were already concluded, Hunter Biden had never been injured directly. Schokin was also submitted to itself deeply corrupt armed, which the US government was not the only Western partner that was disappeared on his decline. In this case, the Obama Register was also supported by the Obama Government even in extremely the exhibitions against the company.

Warning: Smartphone NIE unnoved download
Practice but shame
Industrial technology via Qi standard is extremely practical, but should not be used.
As last, several new smartphones have come on the market, which support free download and sell very good - all the new iPhone-11 models, we want to call again a study from early July in memory. The free load of mobile devices is extremely practically, but not inadequately recommended.
Higher temperature sets Akku
Researchers will warn before loading the smartphones. This is according to the knowledge of the Uninety of Warwick is extremely damaged for the devices. For this reason, the highest heat development is measured. If you have a normal handy by cash, the acku is in terms of three hours on 27 degrees. In the layoutless load, the researchers themselves have at the perfect installation of the Smartphone on the laddle rises more than 30 degrees. The handy is something next to the screen, the temperature is still higher. In addition, the Watching of the Ladpad is again consumed in the higher height.
Capacity and Life time
According to the researchers, the temperature is an important factor for the continuity of Akkus. As every individual degree plays a role. When loading with higher temperatures, the battery is not only to be able, but also keeps not so long. So the lifetime is less. The researchers are therefore slow to load the Smartphone continues to be in a cash. As an accustom is connected to modern smartphones with high costs, it needs to be a helpful tip. Apple has recently the costs for an accutaucher even once again and that it is aware for all iPhones.
Practice
The technology is extremely easy to be used:As simply put the device on an appropriate load - these are even in many restaurants, airports, hotels and cars - and the acku is loaded without a long-term chamber and a comfortable stecker mile. As Qi (soft for industrial energy transmission) is a global standard, even with apple, there are few limitations. Since the technology should be used only in the exception of the researchers.

Iran is evidently high
Iran President Hassan Rohani, in the war about the salvation of the historic Atomic Agreement, increased the pressure to the European treaty partners. "Theremore shows the European States unability or lack of attendance if it goes to concrete actions," said Rohani on Thursday, at a press conference on the border of the United Nations Volal Assembly in New York.

Rohani said: "Thoses who are subject to such accused should prove," said the European leaders in the conversations with him during the United Nations Debate, but they would only call on the fact that the rebels in Jemen could not do such a attack.

Commons of other stars overwhelmed sun system
Astronoms are currently observed a comite from the world's deeps. This has been the first time. The commission allows other sun systems.
What was only a mutation now is confirmed: a interstellar gast grows through our sun system. The comite from the depth of the space has been baptized after his discovery on 2I/Borisov and has revealed the interest of astronoms throughout the world.
The largest comite was discovered by the Amateurastronom Gennadi Borissow on the Margo-Observatory on the Crime on 30 August, with a self-building telescope of 65 centimeters. Following observations of different observatorys, they confirmed not only that it was a unknown commission, but also showed that he does not come from our sun system.
2I/Borisov is after 1I/' Omumumumumua from 2017 before the second interstar object which was searched at a flood of our sun system.
2I/Borisov offers astronomen the rare opportunity to get out of the nearby views in a foreign sun system before he is evacuated in Nierways. The first observations shows that the interstillar comet that our system looks like the Astrophysical Institute of Canrenes. "The current speed of the comite is high, about 150,000 kilometres per hour, which is clearly above the typical speed of objects around the sun", reported David Farnocchia from the US road Authority of Nasa in a communication.
According to the analysis of a so-called hyperbelgyle race that led it out from our system - and clearly interstellar origin, as the International Astronomic Union (IAU) has been shared. It is also responsible for the name and catagorization of heavens bodys. To the honor of his discovery of his interstellar weapons, which was firstly carried out under the C/2019 Q4 number, by its name 2I/Borisov, notifying the first part of the name, that it is the second interstellate object that has been described in our sun system.
The Astronoms have pleasure: In contrast to 1I/'Oumumumumumua, 2I/Borisov has already been visited in the flight. So the researchers remain a lot of months for research. "The object will reach the greatest healability to be seen until April 2020 with medium-scale telescopes," said Farnocchia. "There will only be watched with greater professional telescopes. "
Several observatorys have already taken the visitors in Visier. So a team about the Karen Meech of the University of Hawaii, which had already led the characterization of 1I/'Oumumuamua, in a first study, shows a clear weight of the sky object to 2 to 16 kilometers.
Researchers and Researchers of the Astrophysical Institute of Canans (IAC) have already gained a primary spectrum of the interstellar Sweefer, which offers a kind of fingerprint of its chemical composition. "The spectrum of this object is like such by the commissions of our sun system, and that shows that their composition should be similar," reported IAC Researcherin Julia de León.
The discovery of the same two intersectional visitors within two years describes that the IAU appreciation could open a new way to investigate certain processes in other sun systems. How often such stipps are, it is still hard to assess. One of the next intersteller visitors may have been planned satellite mission of the European Space Training Statistics.
The Agency wants to statize up to 2028 on a warning position in 1,5 million kilometres Delivery from the Earth the three-party spacious "Comet Interceptionr" (deutish etwacome composer). It's to be called the Ese Science Director Günther Hasinger or to a further uncovered, fresh coma from our own sun system, or to a intersortary visitors such as 1I/'Oumumumumumua.

New overall flight will run 2030: In four hours from London to Sydney
From London to Sydney in only four hours - the British room journey UK Space Agency. It is possible to make this for the 2030-year-old airport (Synergetic Air-Breathing Rocket Engine, Sabre), which the company Reaction Engines from Oxfordshire has been established by the US-Sender CN. "This is the technology that can operate definitively," said Agency Graham Turnock to the Sender. "We speak of the 2030 years for the operation, and the work is already very advanced."
In order to advance the project, the British space journey with Australian a co-operation. A flight from the British city to Australian Metropolis is now about 20 hours. As the only overall flight for passenger transport was the Concorde from 1976 to the introduction of its 2003 the strecks of New York Paris and used for three to three hours. In 2000 it came to a case when the start of a Concorde on the Paris Airport Charles de Gaulle, where all 109 Insassen came to life. In the past year, the US-American aircraft Lockhe Martin Pplanne was known in a case when the United States Re-Areign Aviation Aviation Aviation Aviation has been found in the "Paigma".
"Sabre will make the world smaller with its high speed-pounkt-zu-Punkt-port", writes Reaction Engine, among others on his homepage. The Sabre antrieb could be used for effective travels with a speed of Mach 5 - that means five times as fast as the shal. In addition, such aircrafts are also insecurable outside the mass and allowed the "first generation really reutilized railway devices".

In the context of his work, it wants to obtain information from several Government employees, which the US President "the power of his office" to achieve that another country has been in the US Wolf 2020.
In the centre of the Pre-Awards, a contrary telephone between Trump and Ukrainian President Wolodymyr Selenskyj end of July, in the Trump, encouraged his offices to defend his political rivale Joe Biden. This is the former business of Biden's son Hunter in Ukraine and an opportun efforts to protect his breach from the Ukrainian justice. Beden is in the road for the democratic presidency scenario for the election 2020.
The white-lower accused the white house with regard to the Ukrainian telephone also: the leading Government employees would try to keep the precise word interpretation under the deck. As usually an electronic vocabulary protocol has been established. This is only a green conversation log on the instruction of jury from the white house but from a customly designed database and stored in a specially protected system.
The "New York Times" identification has not been known. It should be a employer of the Foreign Secret Service CIA.
Trump reiterated the credibility of the source in question. In a series of Tweets on the subject, the President wrote, among others, that "so-called Wistleblow" has spread information from the second hand that had been expressed as unrelated.
As Trump stated in New York about those who had to play the white-level information, it was to be solved. The President of the US Representative House, Nancy Pelosi, reacted and condemned, the Trumps Exhibition has more integrated the government's integrity.
For months ago, the representative's house runs several investigations against Trump and its environment. The views of the Ukrainian warrants are now undertaken by the democrates with a new light to establish a possible official procedure against Trump in Gang.
"The Whist League has given us a car plan for our investigation," said the Head of the secretary Committee in the representative of Adam ship. Trump took the ship on, he sent a false indication of the things and requested again the return of the Committee. Trump was regularly disappeared and requested for months ago.
More than 300 previous US government workers from the security and external policy sector, which were mostly under the democratic but also in the Republical Chairmans, were published in a statement issued on Friday after the investigation undertaken by the Democrats for a possibility of official decisions. If the prerequisites were certified, it would be the "skrupello power use" by Trump.
For the other process, there is no exact time plan. With their majority in the representative house, the democrates could strengthen a so-called vaccination risk. The decision on a real official decision falled in the Senate where Trumps Republics have the majority. The visions on the success of such a procedure are therefore low. Unless US Presidency has been enthused by an impairment trafficking of the Office.
Training Council: Working locations are built "displying"
The Marke VW plans, in the production of the costs, could go to the burden of the fertilization in Germany and Europe. This concerns the operational Council of the carrier. The brands will take its annual manufacturing costs of 10 billion euros to 2023 around two billion euros. This is the need for 500 million euros in this year.
A key for this is the staff costs. The 2016 between the company and the operational Council, "Subsequent package" is already available to the construction of 14.000 jobs only in Germany. Basically applys: a workplace can be built only if it is almost demonstrated that the related operations are not needed.
As our newspaper has now been produced from operational crisiss, however, in the production places that do not actually face disposition, "effective" over another way - so on the official course, which would often not be restored.
In these cases, the operational Council has not been able to enhance the recovery, but it is not possible to have many places of staff to allow the defence of employment to be more careful than a global exit of vehicles and to ensure that the vehicle could be produced after and from Germany and Europe, because it is more useful in other parts of the world. On the VW, it only said: "A adaptation of the employment development has been achieved as a conformed contract for the coherence."
The VW Mark wants to make the production in the world more standardising and to control new projects. In addition, the costs should be reduced and accelerated - the goal is that the productivity and that the competitiveness of the world should be increased. The production terms of Andreas Tostmann said on a manager conference in Berlin: "Grade in unsuccess time from Brexit to the drug trade war between the United States and China, we are well encouraged to make us a crisp".
For example, in this year since 2013, the production costs of each vehicle compared to the previous year. Tostmann said that the production time for the golf 8, which was to be presented in Wolfsburg on 24 October, at about 1,1 hours. Exact numbers of production periods are not called VW, according to the information of our newspaper, it is about 7 in the Golf.
20 hours.
In our region, the Room Wolfsburg is the only VW factory that are produced in the vehicles. The works of Braunschweig and Salzgitters are prepared. For Wolfsburg, the VW-intern regulation should be built for an annually 800,000 cars to ensure that the work is satisfactory. 2018 was laid the extension in Wolfsburg but only about 700,000 vehicles - the synthetics of this demand and the problems in the rehabilitation to the new uses and excursion procedures WLTP.
As Tostmann has announced in the past year, in Wolfsburg "perspective" but a million cars from the band should be rolled. This should make the introduction of golf production in the steel – because the work of Zwickau through the location of the e-auto production is the golf festival.
In addition, the SUV Tiguan and Taraco (Seat) are produced in Wolfsburg. Nevertheless, the sales of Golf and Tiguan are developed in recent refreshment. This is why the expectations in the Golf 8. He must remain, despite all efforts to build the E-mobility for the first time, the Brot and Butter car of the Wolfsburgers.

He's trying to trick yet?: Johnson's slightly question about Brexit tactics
The British Premier Johnson critifys the "Capitation Law" adopted by the Parliament.
The Parliament is back to write a law to the British Prime Minister to avoid a Chaos browser, but criticians are afraid that Boris Johnson could still use a bottle, and that is likely to say that the Tory Politicians would not be able to do so.
The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has seen whether he wants to implement a unregular brexit - although the last decision decided by the Parliament, which exactly was to prevent it. On the question, Johnson said only to the journalists, his Government will hold the right.
The law provides that the Government should be invited to a decrease of the exemption end until mid October, no agreement with the EU should be made. Johnson criticises this as “caption law” that causes negotiations with the EU.
The former British Prime Minister John Major had expressed the conviction on Thursday that Johnson could try to use "political Shikan" to implement the law. The first can establish a procedure screen which would be able to enter into force of the law at the time after the EU exemption. Johnson said that he was able to strive a treaty with the European Union. "We are sure to leave the EU on 31 October, and the best way is with a agreement."

The Polyroid Diaries of Linda McCartney
Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan or Janis Joplin - she's all standing before the camera of Linda McCartney, one of the great Rock photographs. But it must not always be the great glamour. The photo book "The Polaroid Diaries" (Taschen) is deep in the whole private world of the McCartney family.
Paul McCartney, who was married from 1969 to Lindas in 1998, was obviously stolz when he presented the "The Polaroid Diaries" picture in Victoria and Albert Museum in London. At the illustral guests also were Ringo Starr, Stella McCartney, Olivia Harrison and PretendersFrontfrau Chrissie Hynde.
After the start event, McCartney wrote to Instagram: "#ThePolaroidDiaries is a flight view in the life of an extraordinary family from the time before Instagram, a festival for the memory of LindaMcCartney as an enthusiast artist and the sustainable magie of the Polaroid film".
At Linda McCartney, the art story at the University of Aizona had studied until she found the photography, the camera was always in it. There were thousands of Polyroids who have been made, some hundreds of them now will be published in The Polaroid Diaries.
It's portraits, styles, landscapes, several Hamsters, a tail in the kitchen and other interesters from the early 70s until the late 90s. "They wanted real moments," writes the artist Ekow Eshun in his term. And of course, it is still a second point: your husband Paul - how you might never have seen it.
As he tanks with his daughter Mary on the schools, he calls in the Bademantel with a tail on his head, or takes a whole normal life. Sure that the McCartneys were an extraordinary family, but on the side of the farm in Southenland or in Shotland. So Mary McCartney said that she had been sleeping as a baby in a bed that her father had laid out of old cartoffs. And it was not always found at the McCartneys.
As a little other medium, the Poloraid Camera starts the immediate moment. The accommodation of Linda McCartney is certainly a kind of family day book, but they are much more than clean shots.
It's about the decisive click: you should recognize if a great photo is happening before you. And then you have to knip it in the exact moment," said Paul McCartney. "If you were two seconds later or two seconds, it could be a completely different photo." And Linda had the gift to start exactly the right moment. "You just knew that it had," said Paul in Eshun-Essay.
As the light, the composition, the image size and the colours, what the "The Polaroid Diaries" does not only a substantive picture book for Beatles-Fans, but also ankdotics is a great ecothetic congratulation, where landscapes have also operated as an abstracted petrols. The perfect complement to the exactly renewed beatles album "Abbey Road", which appeared exactly 50 years ago.

From Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, a maximum of 1500 refugees must be taken.
At the 1980 programme, refugees will be selected from UNO campaigns in all the world and are re-earned. The top limits of 18,000 refugees for the biennium 2020 would be the lower in the history of the programme. The current level of 30,000 is a depth value. When the US President Donald Trump, Barack Obama, the white house was left, the number was laid at about 85.000.
Aid organizations reacted to the advertised disappearance of the upper limit. "This is a very hard day for America," said the Head of the International Rescue Committee, David Militband.

It was also an attempt to discover a congress in a possibility of official decision against him, the Presidents of the Committees for External, Secrets and Representative Services.
The white-lower is the President who has now published a complainant to have misused his office to enhance another country in the US-Wal 2020. It is, among others, to introduce its strict telephone with his Ukrainian office of Wolodymyr Selenskyy in the summer: In the conversation, Trump was close to his possible democratic challenges of Joe Biden and his son Hunter in Ukraine. Trump bests every feasibility.
Another unknowledge who are both the skills and their informants. As the New York Times reports, however, it should be analyzed on an analysis of the foreign secret service CIA.

"The last Friday have been held over four million people for climate. We're doing it again again!" she wrote to Twitter. As long as it had given it in the streekwoche 6383 actions in 170 countries, she added it.
In particular, in Germany, the past Friday was very large. A good third of all world demonstrators - about 1.4 million - had been classified by Fridays for Future in 575 German cities in the Protesters. This time they are a list of the movement in at least 65 cities. In Metropolies such as Berlin, Hamburg, Munich and Cross, but also in small communities and cities such as Jeeks in Northern Western or Westernland to Sylt people want to go to the road.
In the age of 15 years, Thunberg had been set before the Swedish Parliament in August 2018 to call for a stronger use for climate protection. In a short time, the Fridays-for-Future movement was developed. The climate-protects participate mainly in students and students, but also in increasing measures of scientists and other adults.

New World climate protection of Fridays for Future
One week after the greatest international climate protesters today, but thousands of people want to go to the streets for more climate protection.
To the end of an international climate, the Fridays moved for future actions and customer developments in Decade countries in the world.
In Germany, Protestes are planned at least 65 cities, including in Metropoles such as Berlin, Hamburg, München and Kilogne, but also in smaller municipalities and cities such as juchen in Northern Westernland or Westernland to Sylt. Climateactivists Greta Thunberg wants to participate in a large winter in the Canadian Montreal.
Climate Protester ◆ Who are actually Thunbergs Hintermans?
Justices and Muts are high toughs, even in the 21th century, in a world full of wars and raw manufacturings that rise the climate. For the reason that a 16-year girl extensives the powermans of this time keeps the skill before the nase. But what do it seem to do? Is it the help preparation or the skill market of a climateactivist? Historic master service or manipulate tactics to want his own?
On the other hand, Greta Thunberg sets the masses in move and brings young people to rise to a better climate world. It is not the historical one of Europe that a young man can get a collection for children and youths. Nevertheless in 1212, a child named Nikolaus was feeling out of cools to take place for a just world. At the same time, it also has a shadow of young people for self-employment, and it encourages the sea to overcome, like Greta Thunberg, to reach himself in America.
However, there is a shadow page? Why it needs an action named "We don't have time" to save the world? Furthermore, Greta Thunberg reques PR manager on its side. Alongside its mother has published a book which has been widespreadly sold, thanks to the daughter standing in the ramp light. Also, the high-speaked followers of Greta Thunberg were a little deployed about the last PR show, or the trip with the boat was likely to disappear some followers. This is not also unfounded because the action came in the media world's greatly well to implement and it is very much money thanks to the imposing action.
The spirits are now separated: Is it morally correct to operate in the rescue of the world's freedoms? Is it still an authentic if some individual crises are working during the world's resolving action with barsenmakers? It's the same position that it is recently going to make a critical and reflected view is always more important in a democratic society, because democracy lives from different views and discussions. This is why it can also be possible to ask from projects of certain trends.
Comet discovered: Intersteller guests grows through our sun system
A strange comet transcends our sun system at the moment.
The shifts of the astronoms have confirmed: a strange comet transcends our sun system at the moment - he is only the second kind of his.
Garching/Washington - Long the researchers have just changed it, but now they have awareness: a comet of another star transcends our sun system at the moment. He was baptized after his discovery 2I/Borisov and is currently employed worldly astronoms.
2I/Borisov: Comet was discovered by Amateurastronoms on the crim
This body was discovered by a amateurastronom named Gennadi Borissow. He looked at a self-building telescope to heaven and other follow-up observations confirmed his first disaster. It is actually a unknown competitor who does not come out of our sun system. He is only the second kind of his look at the flight.
The great opportunity for astrophysical Institute of Canaries is now to get out of the nearest views in a foreign sun system. It is clearly similar to the Committee to which our system reports the astrophysical Institute of the Caners. The Commission is clearly interstellar origin and is currently on a so-called hyperbel traffic that brings him out of our system.
Comet has already been watched before flight and can be observed for several months
But before it is far, the astronoms can watch him immediately. Because, in contrast to his actor, 2I/Borisov has already been seen in his approach, what means he can be studied for many months from the earth. "This object will reach the greatest healability and then be seen with medium-grow telescopes," says David Farnocchia from the US-Raum Removal Authority Nasa. "But then it will be observed until October 2020 only with larger and professional telescopes."
Foreigner of the new visitors: 1I/2017 U1 "Oumumumua".
First knowledge about Comet 2I/Borisov wear hopes in science
According to the first knowledge, the comite is estimated at 2 to 16 kilometers. At the same time the sky body seems to be similar to our comites - because as the IAC researcher is expressed by Julia de León, the spectrum of the Swiss is similar to us. This observation is nearly read that comites in other sun systems could form similar processes as in our colleague, complemented by the León's colleague Javier Licandro.
However, the observation goes out of individual knowledge. That is already discovered two such objects within two years, in circumstances, allows a new way to investigate certain processes in other sun systems.
Asteroids are always employed by researchers. First shortly, a riese asteroid passed over the earth and came nearly.

Influencerin will Gratis Opgrade: Living long air condition at Cathay
Surely, if Jaqueline Ng per Mail of Cathay Pacific has been guaranteed a update. However, when she requested the check-in, she wouldn't have stopped on boat - and she should never be able to fly again with Cathay.
Spontan get upgrade for the Business class - the dreams of many airports. Sometimes they have happiness, and the workers at the check-in offer a weak out of the economic class free.
However, this case shows how to not be done: A itself explained influencer has asked the Cathay Pacific Airline for a free upgrade. On Instagram Jaqueline Ng follows more than 65.000 users. On May 30, she was returned from Taiwan to New York and on 7 June.
On the road, the employers refused a update, although they had an e-mail shown in which their Cathay Pacific has probably made an upgrade. The letter wants to receive the influence from a branding worker of the airline. The airline is accused of Jaqueline to have a mail.
