A republic strategy to obstake Obama's selection
Republic leaders justified their policy for the need to fight electoral fraude.
Now, the Brennan Center considers this last half and states that electoral fraude is less frequent in the United States than the number of people die because of the fall of a ray.
In fact, republic lawyers have been found more than 300 cases of electoral fraude in the United States over ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In that respect, these measures will take part in the American democratic system.
In contrast to what happens in Canada, the American States are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
And in the same line, most of the American Governments have made new laws that have difficulted the registration or vote process.
This phenomenon was extended after November 2010, which saw the increase of 675 new republic representatives in 26 States.
Thus, for 2011, 180 draft laws were introduced to be restricted by the exercise of the vote law in 41 States.
The new electoral laws require the electors to submit a document of identity with a photograph, además of an American citizenship test.
Furthermore, these laws reduce the periods of vote, illegally the right to be registered as a elector on the day of the scrutiny and take their right to vote to the citizens with criminal pre-decessors.
Before the 2006 elections, no American state requested the electors to submit a photograph of identity.
The Indian State was the first to require him.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of Indian law in 2008.
Therefore, the republic authorities were pressed to extend that practice to other states.
In the past few years, these authorities have supported the law projects in 34 states to strengthen electoral to submit a photo-identity document.
It is important that, in contrast to what happens in Quebec, American citizens do not have a universal identity document, such as the social security card.
In fact, 11 per cent of the American citizens, that is, 21 million people aged to vote, do not take account of any identity document issued by a government agencies of their state.
On the other hand, five million new electors in 2012 have no identity document with these characteristics.
But often the obtaining of the required identity document costs more than hundred dollars.
Consequently, new restrictions affect young people, minorities and people with low income.
In fact, 25 per cent of Africans, 15 per cent of those who gain less than $35,000 per year, 18 per cent of the citizens of more than 65 years and 20 per cent of the electors from 18 to 29 years do not take account of a photo-identity document.
And there's still more.
In many states the students, the electors who most voted to the democratic candidates, cannot use the identity document with photography issued by their institution.
In addition, those same states authorize members of fishing clubs or cash clubs to vote to the republic parties to use the documents issued by those clubs.
No state was required to vote before 2004.
Arizona was the first state to submit this requirement.
Since 2011, a tenth of states has adopted laws that require electors to demonstrate that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly seeking limited the Spanish vote.
It seems that two of each three Spanish electors support the democratic game.
On the other hand, the republic legislators supported certain laws in 2011 that rejected the registration of electors on the same day in eight states.
They also limited the right of persons and groups to create aid service to electors who wish to be registered.
These restrictions have consequences.
For example, in the 2004 general elections, electoral registration campaigns contributed to around 10 million citizens.
The measures taken since 2009 have been achieved that the registration rate of new electoral was falling in 2010 compared to 2006.
Furthermore, the republic legislators adopted laws in other five states promoting the reduction of the vote period.
For example, in the 2008 elections in Florida, 33 per cent of the electors who voted by the adelant were African, while those were not more than 13 per cent of the state electors.
In the case of the Spanish, it would be exactly the same.
These represent more than 11 per cent of the electoral, which is equal to 24 per cent of the citizens voted by ademulated.
However, white, representing 76 per cent of the electoral, represents more than 46 per cent of the citizens voted by adelant.
Of course, democrat lawyers and their parties have been offended by the adoption of laws which restrict the registration of electoral.
In this regard, the Democratic Governors have blocked several draft law.
The United States Federal Minister for Insuring the most contrary laws.
In part, the damage could be limited.
For example, only 16 of 34 States adopted the law requiring the presentation of an identity document with photograph.
However, it is unrealisable that the new regulations adopted will comply with the exercise of the right to vote in 2012.
Democrat criticians state the partid character of the laws which have been voted, since it is clear that it is intended to affect the results of 2012 in the key states.
A report of the Brennan Centre of 2011 shows that the states adopted by these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral collection to achieve the Presidency.
It is too fast to confirm whether these legislative amendments at the level of electoral system will have an significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidency elections.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this regard, the measures will take part to the American democratic system.
Detection of prostat cancer: Do you make the test or not do it?
In fact, the PSA test presents in cases erroneous results with false negative results, or even false positive results, after which medicine interventions are decided.
It is more than enough to doubt men, already resolved from themselves, on whether they should be made or not the detection tests.
Did you make the test or not?
We asked for advice to two specialists.
In the studies carried out in the United States, a large contact index between the sample groups has been detected, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to make firm recommendations.
The European study showed some differences of mortality between patients who had been conducted detection and not.
The study, with a follow-up to 12 years, also demonstrated that between 30 and 40% of the possibilities to pade metastasis if the detection test was not carried out.
So I recommend the test from the 50s, or from the 40 years, if your father has suffered prostat cancer.
The African men of origin have a higher risk index.
The key is to take a good decision once cancer detected.
There are aggressive cancers and other cancers that are indolect.
It is truly necessary to ensure that the patient understands the risk level of his cancer. All possible options should be offered and not necessarily treated by prostat cancers that do not oppose long-term life, in which the case is to be opposed more by an active monitoring of disease.
Many men today who have detected a cancer are not treated, because cancer said not is aggressive or causes a risk for their life.
Instead, we suggest a active monitoring of disease and, if it is progressed, we offer them a treatment.
We always define more frequently necessary criteria to decide who should or not be treated.
Recommended the test in any case.
But it is important to do with your doctor to determine whether the test should be made or not.
Movember has created, in collaboration with the International Urology Society, a tool that allows you to assess the pros and contrasting of the PSA test.

Prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no wonderful receting to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of healthy lives is still the best way to reduce disease risks.
We believe that if everyone eats well and moves enough, 30% of the cancers could be prevented.
"If nobody smoke, that rate would at least be exalted to 50%," subraya André Beauléu, the Canadian Society against Cancer.
Instead, we assess that approximately 10% of the cancers are heirs.
Many others remain inexplicable.
For the Canadian Society against Cancer, the fight against tobaccom remains a priority, despite the reduction of the number of fuels.
The tab is linked to 85% of the cases of pulmonary cancer.
It also constitutes a risk factor for other types of cancers.
The health of people is extremely threatened.
"Today, there are still 1,5 million smoke in Quebec," said André Beauléu.
A date of hope: 10 years after smoking, the risk of cancer die reduces half.
The weight
Regularity and obesity also encourage the appearance of disease according to the CCCC.
Increases the risks of mom, colon and recte, shape, páncrees and summer cancer.
"The investigations show that the regular physical activity practice during all life protects the mother cancer," adds.
Food
The body recommends also limite the consumption of red fleshs.
In large amounts, they are scaling the risks of suffering a colorrect cancer.
Charter products should also be avoided.
The conservation of the flesh for its aspiration, seed or salazon may cause the training of cancery substances.
"You can harm the body cells and lead to cancer development," explains.
Vitamines
In recent years, several scientists have studied the links between vitaminical complexs and cancer.
However, their investigations are not concluded at the moment.
According to the SCC, studies on vitamin E are contractors.
While one of them has noted a decrease of the risks of perstance cancer, otherwise, has been an increase.
The effect of vitamin D in cancer could not have been clearly determined.
Furthermore, Mr. Beauléu stressed the importance of speaking concerns and the pre-families of each other with his doctor.
"Doing detection test does not cause cancer."
The Higgs boss in detail
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boss generated a great consommation last summer, and because.
In fact, it is believed that this boss is partly of the responsible mechanism of the mass of all that exists in the universe, nothing else.
And whatever is, it is the part of which there is the standard model: our best or "born" explaining the nature and the behaviour of the material, which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physics, it's not completely clear that Higgs is treated.
We know without any doubt that there is a new part and it seems much to the Higgs boss predicted by the standard model.
Furthermore, new data developed this week in an important physical congress held in Kyoto seems to confirm that it is, although there are still more data to be completely secure.
In any way, we suggest that this is Higgs, since the possibilities to be wrong look a little bit.
There is, in this great world, a generalized and unlawful law that implies that two things can not be found in the same place at the same time.
There is no way to infringe that rule and not to try it too much, because it will end being damage.
Although the physician of the particules is a very complex world, it has been shown that there is also a law of these characteristics: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two parts can not take the same space at the same time if they are in the same "wantic state"; a "status" that constitutes, greatly, of some of its characteristics.
Physicals classify the particules in two categories.
On the one hand, we met with the good citizens called Closus, who are awarely obedient to the principle of Pauli.
And otherwise are the boss, a pand of anarquists that has no respect for nothing, or at least not for this principle, that means that they can be found in the same place and at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories that, of course, is extraordinary, the boss are divided in two groups: the months we don't speak here, and the "Free Partys of Force", which the large nature forces are spread and with which the Higgs boss would become an unspecified form.
These boss, could submit here, aren't the exotics we could believe.
In fact, if you read this chronic, it is thanks to an extraordinary banal boss: the photo or the "Light Party" which acts as "mensajer" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a part with a speed-related electric load or changing direction, "ordinate" the electromagnetic field around that requirement, a little as if we lay a stone to a stack.
In this "orden" is born an electromagnetic ond (of light, of infrastructors, of ultraviolets, etc.), and this wage is not another thing than a photo; that's, one of the "porters of force".
More stabilitable Camp
It happens likewise with the Higgs boss, with the difference that it is about another field, the Higgs field, which needs to be "decorated" to appear this boss.
Now, the Higgs field is much more stability than the electromagnetic field. To enable it, it does not need to get to extremely high energy, a little as if it's a green garden in which only a green rock could be disappeared from the surface.
For this reason, there is a large accelerator of particules such as the CERN (the great culminator of harones is an angle of 27 km of circumference!) to reach such energy levels.
The similarity with the electromagnetic field is a new tool that explains the relationship between Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all parts or all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like believers, do it, but others not: a pen of paper, for example, will never be kept for himself to the door of an ever.
And in the same way, not all the parts interact with the Higgs field: those who do have a mass, while the rest (such as the photo, indeed), do not have it.
Now, what can you bring all these investigations, Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, this serves to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and also allows physics to scrutin the differences between MS observations and predictions.
For their part, many want it clearly to find them, because the smaller difference could open a door to a "new physical" that drags some sides of the model.
This, need to say, is still a huge debound, as it does not propose any explanation concerning gravity (ups!) or the dark matter, which complies around 80% of the universe's matter (Other!).
But we have not found such differences in the CERN until now.
Repercussions
The impacts of these investigations today are difficult to prevent, but we do not believe that we are wrong to say that there will be nothing.
To see: At the beginning of the 60 years, Laser pioneers in the laboratory do not absolutely suspect the revolution that their work would cause.
They interviewed scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, as the physical Willard Boyle said, he worked in the Bell laboratory, where the Laser was discovered in 1960, and which developed the first continuing leaser (the first bused) in 1962, the Lasser was mostly considered a "soft laboratory park".
Imagine...
Furthermore, applications may also result from all the instruments relating to the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a light captain in 1969 in the course of its research on optical issues.
Although he was not in absolutely his original intention, this captain served now from "hoo" for all the digital devices of the world, that was the Nobel of Physicians in 2009.
This does not mean, of course, that LHC's activities will need to transform our lives, but that you never know...
Palestinian care. The best way to die... ◆ Le Devoir
In his Commission, Quebec murdered in dignity, recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate must be immediately resolved while a draft law is prepared.
Now, within that essential domain, there is still much to do.
Devoir tried to see him closely.
Last weeks ago, Mr. L. was alone in his apartment of Montergy.
The prostitute cancer that he had destroyed him had given him a reverence of two years.
"There had given me five years of life, but I've already taken so seven," reported a step, throwing on his bed in the center of Palestinian care of Victor-Gadbois of Beloeil, which came the previous day.
"But it's always a shock, we can't be prepared for this," continues.
The illness caused you extracts: a huge deficiency that prevents you to go only to the bathroom and even eat by himself alone.
Besides a dinner advertisement, it is accepted to help you eat.
Valently, it is even going to smile, to talk to the unknown persons who dedicate attention to him, to bring him medicines and offer a bathroom.
The power of the ordinary death.
"My greatest desire is that I cure the diarree, it's humble," she trusts.
A few hours later, the team found the middle of that evil.
"In the transition of our lives we learn that a man has footership," says Peter Brodeur, psychologist in the Victor-Gadbois center.
Return to their childhood, for some people, is an unacceptable humble.
"This depends on the capacity of the person to accept that return," he stated.
Because, according to the opinion of most people working in Palestinian care, the large moments have place in the heart of that return itself.
All patients entering in the Victor-Gadbois Palestinian care centre have cancer.
You have a maximum of three months of life.
In that state, the team of doctors and sisters that run them no longer offer the "curative cares".
Ms. A., 89 years old, is dead "conscious and ahogada."
But the disease has discovered her children.
"I have a good kid," adds.
"It's no longer desires in this life," says, "before you accept a mask to help you respirate.
And wait, in the next days, a last visit of his son who lives in Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, a group of volunteers is offered for the care of the body and helping food.
They are paliative care that are given to them when nothing else can be done.
To help your death be more comfortable.
In Quebec we contact with a bed of Palestinian care for each 11.700 inhabitants.
It's very little, because we know we're all gonna die some day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christian Martel, one of the doctors of the center.
It is already at physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
In the deaths you are offered with brandy or Pepsi, according to the demand.
The diabetes are no longer controlled by their sugar rate.
Death is part of the daily.
Yesterday, we served a bracelet to Mr. X, who died in the night's transition.
Her son ended the brain at the feet of the deficit.
"We help both patients and their dear beloved," reports Nathalie Saard, care director.
In the center of Victor-Gadbois the days are never equal.
On the side of a 94-year-old man who had his last family meeting in the palace, well placed among their almohads while all drinking their health, a young man of 36 years dies strategicly, turned by their parents, their wives and their two children, after he tried to survive.
"That's six months ago, there are always three to five busy beds for persons less than 45 years of cancer," Dr. Christian Martel was concerned.
A 53% of patients admitted in the Victor-Gadbois center come from your home and 47% of the hospital.
Problem of access to Palestinian care
A 77% of the Canadians simply does not have access to Palestinian care, i.e., care granted to eliminate suffering when a patient arrives to the terminal phase of their life, or in his home, hospital or care centre.
And several agencies, such as the Victor-Gadbois center and the Palestinian care society at the Grand Montréal, are almost exclusively specialized in the care of patients with cancer.
It is exactly that great lack in the health cares of Quebec makes many specialized doctors in Palestinian care fear the adoption of a law regulating eutanasia and asylum.
Since October, a manifold signed by concerns of Palestinian care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulated to demonstrate its opposition to this initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system of Quebec is not sufficiently competent to ensure that any person has the right to quality care before eutanasia is accepted.
"Recently," reports, "I saw a patient past 14 days in Urgency, suffering great pain without having done the necessary thing to eliminate it.
I fear that patients want to die only because they do not receive appropriate care."
And parallelly, many oncologes are obeyed with their patients until the last day, despite the worse prognostics.
Hellen Richard’s survival hopes were lower when he left a heavy chimioter treatment.
"When I said to my uncle that she wanted to stop the treatment, she told me that I had a lot of pain that I wanted to leave fighting," reported.
"Now, she told me that there was nothing else than to do!"
There is no privilege care
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the patients who ask to die thanks to their careers that they have not attained them at their requests once their pain has been dismissed thanks to a Palestinian care team.
But it must be said that Palestinian care is not absolutely lowly in respect of the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Palestinian care director at Grand Montréal, patients do not respond to pain treatments at 8 per cent of cases.
At the end of life, the doctors are likely to return to the Palestinian sedition, which is served to sleep to the patient until the moment of their defectation, or to be speedly or permanently.
We can't think we don't understand that part of suffering.
Any more time, the non-alived disease will have the possibility of having that Palliative seat.
The sick who are not alive say all the same: "I want to die."
But that doesn't mean necessarily, "I want Eutanasia," but "I want you to get me alive."
The implementation of this report was possible thanks to a periodism band of the Canada Health Research Institutes.
Accommodations in Quebec
Manufacturers of the BTP network, BTP traders, politicians and specialists of the Italian mafia account, day after day, what they know of a former "system" of which are part of the construction, officials, political, synthetics and mafiosous industry.
A "industrie" which is too nice to the cebaquens contributions, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's curious how the system is cleaning once we caught to the great means," Ironizes James Duchesneau, deputed in Quebec and old head of the Montreal police.
He led the stage of the scanner in 2011, which was possible through a financial investigation on the disasters associated with road contracts in Quebec, that the first free minister, John Charest, had not been allowed only to delay.
The "Information Duchesneau" has established a direct link between the industry, the clandest financing of the parties and the corruption between officials.
"At the beginning of the investigation in 2010, only the Department of Transport would have been paid a million dollars in contracts, with some of its institutions to stay with a proportional part.
The Charbonneau Commission adds, while he hopes to be able to "declare existing straights behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit created in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit created in 2011 is also applied to its team of interventioners, researchers and analysis of the government.
This unit also works on the police of the Marteau School, which, since 2009, made the "Cartel of Montreal" in Montreal is moderate at the time of inflating contracts.
In the last weeks, the unit has been registered in a series of fraud and corruption against municipal charges such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, from a city of the outside.
The next list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, which ended from his Laval Laval post, the third city of Quebec.
It is suspected that we have repeated soups have been embodied to change public contracts.
It was formally accused to engineers of Montreal's vial network and the companyers of Italian origin, such as Tony Acurs and Lino ZÁ.
The latter has caused a concours to explain the mechanical of the "system" of receipt of public contracts.
He himself paid for three years a 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediator linked to the mafia translated money to Montreal Union, the Gareld Tremblay Chamber.
Mr. Zfeld divided money for the years of 2000, provided more than $88,000 Canadians ($68,000) to provincial parties, especially for liberalities in power.
He also admitted a collection of illegal funds for the former liberal ministerial, Nathalie Normandeau.
Infringement of the cost of the contracts of alchanged
In Montreal, the system of corruption worked effectively.
Gilles Surprening, public workers, explained it perfectly before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts, trips, golf tours, restaurants, buckets and soups from construction sector companies for a total of $736,000, all of this to change rental contracts whose costs infringed.
Other carrier officers have admitted that money had been received to inflate factories between 30 and 40 per cent in the concept of extra false.
Furthermore, an organisator of the alcalde game, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay that he had made the sight of a paralel budget and filled its Swiss money arks.
As a result of these revelations, Mr. Tremblay left the beginning of November and brought Montreal to a huge crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first elected Montreal policy that sounded the alarm.
As an alcalde of the Rivière-des-Prairies district, in the east of the island, it is working since 2010 to sell a municipal field acquired by $5 million and returned for 1,6 million to the promotors in full of real boom.
70% of the money of the electoral campaigns was Swiss money
From the investigation that will finally be carried out, it ensures that you say "of a hair to understand the operation of the system, infilled by horms, to open the gangrena and to fish the faults."
And adds that the process is "looking, but positive".
We're cleaning the wounds but it's not enough a clean research unit in Montreal and be very warm to make doubt practices not be repealed.
How to make cleanness.
Regularly.
James Duchesneau, on their part, states that "the officials have rolled hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is concerned in particular by the role of the 'politics elected at the railway of the Strategic.
Swedish money shared in the financing of electoral campaigns in Quebec, ironism: "There have told me that this is not more than a fairly reflection of the reality."
The Government proposes to limit the donations to the parties, but it will not change the donation, according to it, "the more not limited electoral expenditures, will be sudden in the policy."
A complete review of the system of providing public contracts and financing of the parties: "We can't fall lower; we can go to the foundation of things, with power, will allow us to build the house with more stronger bases, with more controls and laws."
If this story emphasizes the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who would look at the speed.
"The PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This timed time has obtained a new entity with the PSG.
How would this progress explain?
The new size of the PSG could be explained by a individual self-detection, but also by the new dimension.
The big players have come.
Today's spring on his side.
The technical staff has also brought me much.
And these elements are engaged at daily to increase the level of my game.
In a game, it's easier.
Everything's gonna be very fast on the football.
But I don't care.
From my beginning in the INF Clairefottaine preparation centre to my step by Saint-Etienne, I've always progressed on acted steps.
It will benefit from the competence recruited by Carlo Anceltti.
The recluts of this summer are accompanied to discuss parts of very high level.
They know that each transcript is crucial.
That makes a player like I have gain of fighting and giving everything.
On the other hand, Carlo Anceltti brings me much about my position.
He's supported by adjoints like Claudi Makelele, who played in the same position as I.
Ancelito is the man who needed the team?
Of course.
Ancelles inspired respect for all technicals.
Today, there is no one equal in Liga 1 and is between the best European traders.
He has a great experience and has won many titles with the best clubs.
He worked with large players.
I think there will be other titles in Paris.
In January, I had a very comfortable conversation with him.
I ended out of a series of lessons.
The confidence in me also explains my good performance.
What do you think about the PSG in the first part of the time?
In Liga 1, Lyon took us the position of leading.
But we followed the embossed.
One of our greatest objectives is the Champion Liga: we have been classified for the eight-end styles.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We're going to try to get the way possible.
From now, you can happen anyway.
But we have much to say to many and very good European teams.
We want to begin, to end the first of our link in front of the Portport to get the eight end return.
Can the PSG become a short-term European club?
You already have the budget...
In order to become a large European club, Paris needs to win titles and be there long.
Today, this is not the case.
At the economic level, the PSG is delivered to its means to make this project concrete.
Don't win the cup in the Liga 1, like in the last time, would you become a big fracture?
Of course, it would be a great deception.
This year, we will invest all our efforts to bring us this title of campaigns.
We're not coming away in the last time.
In May, we took a deception, as we shared with the best conditions to end first.
We had a strong time.
We're finished with 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points we should have been campeons...
But another team, the Montpellier, had a quite better time.
This year, I think it'll be the good.
Even though the large teams such as Marsella, Lyon and the Burdeos are fighting by the title, I think we're talking about the weapons to bring it to us.
Do you think the media are waiting for more than the PSG?
It's normal that they hope much of us if we think about what has been invested in the players we have.
We totally accepted it.
After we gain 4-0 home to Troyes, they still find things that reproach us is a little frustration.
We're asking what more people are waiting for.
We'll never win 4-0 all the weekends.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We tried to put a game project.
A team is built with time.
We showed that we can answer and be present at the Champion Liga.
Look at Manchester City who, after two times, has not been classified for eight ends, and they have also invested much!
In view of the inverted sums, we would imagine you with 15 points of advantage to the day.
This would have dismissed our adversaries and the campeonate of France.
Lyon and Marsella, who weren't well the previous time, were seen " embedded" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Liga 1 is appreciating.
I hope that in May we can say with a dream that, despite all the difficulties, we've finished leaving the trofee.
The PSG seems totally dependent on the success of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
It's better we say we've got a "ladden dependence".
This means Ibrahimovic is very competent and makes many goals.
He came to show that it's the star of the League 1.
And has shown in all the teams that has passed that it is a great player, a world star.
In the group we respect the man and the player.
And he also respects men who are around them.
What you did is really extraordinary.
This leads to others to increase their level of game.
The Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, also allows us all progress.
How did Eurocopa 2012 live with France's team?
It was a deception.
It was very excited to participate in this Eurocopa.
Unfortunately, my lection imposed me to assume the time of the game.
I saw things there and went strong.
Today I'm able to play good games in the selection.
That's what I was waiting for since my baptism with the "Blues".
We take the election of what happened in Ukraine, and we must have today an example of behaviour.
What's your vision of the first month of Didier Discovering the "Blue"?
It's getting results.
They are well located in the world classification group.
The chosen is rigorous, they're looking for players and inspired to win.
Like the case of Laurent White.
But I don't want to make comparisons.
White achieved its goal of classifying us for the Eurocopa.
I hope Didier Deshamps brings the selection to Brazil.
Does the start (1-1) of 16 October in Spain served to sit down the bases?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone shot for everybody.
Before that shock in Spain, I hadn't lived a like game in all my car.
With Bitcoin, pay and sell without banks
On the contrary to current monetary exchange, based on central banks, the identified transactions and processing loads between the parties.
Furthermore, as often happens in technologies, political vision is capable: the conviction that the current monetary system, composed of banking monopolies, leads to financial crisis.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (un pseudom), is at the same time a virtual currency converted to dollars, euros, etc. and a secure change protocol in the BitTorrent way, which allows the exchange of files equal to the same.
It has been registered nearly 200,000 transactions thanks to 15,000 computers from the network.
And nearly a thousand websites accept Bitcoins as donations or as a form of payment.
The catching of the bitcoin, after reaching the amount of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, caught at $2,5 later months before returning today to the 10 dollars (cotizations are estimated on the Bitcoincharts.com page).
It is nothing impresional if we compare this to the global changes in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
In this, the bitcoin was described as "viral currency with more successful success", "and works with the dalar or the euro" and "submit to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other systems with virtual currency types such as "credits" used to advance in a video and that can be gaining playing or buying (and even in caneries).
The Facebook Social Network also developed this type of system.
But in all exchange a central authority is controlled and treated changes.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are at the time depositors of accountability books, verificationers, currency emisors and buyers and vendors.
How does that network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two electronic addresses in electronic form.
A user can choose a different address for each payment, guaranteeing the anonimate so.
A number of information linked to this transaction is electronicly signed through a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify the transaction authenticity.
Thanks to the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that Bitcoin changes contain in the public account book that is divided throughout the network.
The key hit consists of writeing this new transaction in this book.
This step by the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to computers and winners, a provisional central banking kind, will be the privilege of adding that additional line.
This is a stage of drunk of file, i.e., transformation of a big file in a shorter and unique digital hole.
"Cogen" the new transaction and add a number before "trace" the whole.
The goal is to find the number that offers a particular hole (more ceases to the principle).
Once that number is found, the other nodos are easily verifying that it is good.
The transaction is then instructively linked to the combined chain of the other transactions; any change would change the wheel.
If, to combine fraude, a user would like to pay two times with the same money very fast (in less than ten minutes), the network would only accept as a valid one of the two transactions; the other would be warranted, since both have different hairs.
The computer resolved the challenge is about 50 bits.
In order to avoid inflation, this reward is divided in two regularly, with probability before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million but are divided to 100 million, which leaves a wide margin.
The difficulty of this challenge is also shown in each increase in calculation power.
The life of the network has already its highways.
The web sites offered for Bitcoin services have been attacked and have been rolled by bitcoins.
"The fall used does not affect the same protocol," says Peter Noizat, who has been launching Phoutum, a real currency company using the Bitcoin Network.
The ECB also takes into account the possibilities of money banning thanks to this anonymic service.
But the money in effect presents the same defect.
Weight actors like Wikipedia reject payments of this type.
Others, like Wordpress platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the accountability book and showed that about 80 per cent of non- circulated bitcoins.
In November, the "great rebits" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been changed," Jon Holmquist was glad, working for Coinabul, making you gold bitcoins.
Peter Noizat, author of a pedagogic book on this currency, believes quite in the potential of this technology beyond the transaction network.
Your system, Paytuania, equals a credit card (in real currency) or a payment for without contact, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, so they are more barried.
The carrier also manages its identity and may therefore stay in the anonimate.
The system is easy to run on trade, which do not need to install new terminals or software.
Just providing an address that a phone can "food and recognize", specific Peter Noizat, which will ensure you have thousands of users.
There is a general revision movement of the jürich systems by the most horizontal systems.
"There will be a time for Bitcoin to be imposed, but in 2013 he could have a change," predict.
Furthermore, in its report, the ECB is intended to re-evaluate different risks today considered, if this currency has successful.
We went out of Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Capisa and Surobia).
OTAN and Americans must go out at the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army turns away from its territory and that the Afghans choose their future, without waiting for nothing from us.
We have been punished above all the Afghan campaigns, which we have considered terrorists.
And to us, with our 88 murderers, more the slaughters and the mournings.
Talibans are accounted of foreign extremists and old refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often also with campaigns that reject the presence of the foreign army, such as in the time of soviety.
They want to defend their traditions, ancient and arkics, even if in their causes, the gangers, the Pakistanians, the Arabs, the uzbeks or the Taicus.
Tolerated, sometimes even helped by local insurgents, these will not be that when Westerns are making more discretes.
The game of the French troops from the Nijrab Base, which was observed from the high hills planted by Germans thanks to the French credits, was ordered.
The trucks and tanks returned to Kabul without any attack, monitored by the helicopters.
There will be nofluence of Taliban in Kabul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress between 1994 and 1996.
Kabul then was empty, and the country embraced in fire and blood because of the fight between different factors.
His country control was undermined as a kind of liberation, return to security.
Afghans have paid the price of the darkness of their campaigns override by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation is not better today.
The former Germans, the current government and the current Taliban are shared with the desire to maintain women in a lower position.
The main personalities of the anti-sovic war returned to power in 2001.
They have become speculators, making government fields to return them as soles for refugees who have returned from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from the United States subcontracting contracts.
They are disagreed; most of them have not fighted.
People, as I heard in the field, inspire a government that is not formed by thieves.
Many young people want to go, as well as those who have known to be used from American generosity: capital flight is significant.
Youth are stolen from war and their ideology.
They have lived the modern world during their outlines in Iran or Pakistan and have appreciated their advantages.
With about 65 per cent of its lower population than 25 years, Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth part of the total population.
In the cities, the state collections are full of both girls and children.
It will be necessary to give work to young people who will not want to return to the darkness of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders.
All, including the armed opposition, are aircraft by mobile phones. The television and its Turkish folletines presented by a modern world have great wonderings throughout the country.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities wish to direct the country will be considered legally?
Old commanders of anti-sovic fight are concerned about restoring provincial thousands that will flee from the central power.
Afghanistan, the mountain country, with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization to the image of the Western nations. However, the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with a strong presidency power, to remove the position of the first minister who exists from the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign control, in particular because of the elections planned in April 2014.
However, their country depends on foreign assistance from the 50s and even before.
No industry has renewed its services, no embalks has been corrected or repaird the important irrigation systems.
Everything is imported and nothing is produced except fruit and green.
The priority remains on the private initiative.
In a 30-year-old country removal, government control would be necessary.
It was expanded that Afghanistan had great mine riches.
And this did not more than increase the feelings that western people were there to help them.
No energy for extracting iron or cow minerals from the field and without means of transport to export them through mountains, there is no mining operation.
Children have already left the mixture of my Aynak's mixture, allowing international archeologists (financed by the World Bank) to extract the immensive budget and remain there as the most important employees in the province.
It will also be lacking that Afghanistan and Pakistan, widely dependent on imports and exports, restoring their normal relations.
The French troops left on 20 November.
The new Cooperation Treaty provides the continuation of traditional assistance: girls colleges, children colleges, a department of French in the University, the French Institute, the cooperation in military, legal, health and agricultural areas and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, with the aim of attempt to "gain the hearts and the spirits" and to make the impossible task to make the aid and offensive actions involved, a service of civil and military actions of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), removed in 2012, brought and brought through a small non-governmental NGO work of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation in tens of mountain locations.
These work, goals to get local work hands, have been able to help contain insurrection: river, pows, potable water, reforestation, fruit trees, solar protection and increased culture surfaces.
What will we leave as memory after two million euros of military expenditure?
A more modest budget will contribute to improving local life conditions, very hard in these valleys often situated at over 2.000 meters of height.
Ambassador received ten requests written with small agricultural proposals carried out by local communities in the province of Cape Verde.
In order to be free of the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, something that the farmers have told me that they want, would need to keep a small civil, well controlled and directly access them.
A Constitution with forceps in Egypt
It's a new double or nothing of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt is divided more than ever about the constitutional declaration, which offered to him provisionally full powers, he decided to play everything on all.
He assembled the world for surprise of the middle, when she announced that the Assembly would vote its final text on the next day.
Similarly a week ago, the head of State had given the Assembly more than two months ago to complete its work.
And it is almost two years ago that Egypt uses a temporary text, several times amended, which debilites institutional stability and leads to judicial implants.
This new initiative has made only increased fracture in the country.
For its opponents, the President remains in his "autocratic delirio" and continues "traying his word" and "pensing the right".
Through its participants, it is ensured that it is a measures to end faster with the institutional and political crisis and accelerate the transition process.
In the next 15 days a referendum should be organized.
A very short-term time lance that the brothers are obliged to refuse their project to explain the text under Article, the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to recover a popular and democratic legitimation, while the polarm causes extracts throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote on their favour, as she confirmed in an interview at the American Time week.
Considering that this resource has been voted with much speed, it contains an autumnity for the Egyptian people: "or votes my text or keep the full powers," powers that will soon be reached with the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in this strange environment in which 85 members of this Assembly Constitute, islamist in its largest majority, voted the text yesterday.
Most of the liberals did not accuse the convocation.
At midnight of November, a little before the constitutional declaration, they were closed the door because they believed that they could not be able to deal with their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities and civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary quarter yesterday, 11 persons, members, were joined to every press.
Some of them are very close to the muscle brothers.
As awaiting, the voted articles have been one-minutely.
The commentaries thanked otherwise to the fact that one of the few differences of the day has been expressed practically at the time of the prayer, so that several members of the Committee had come to think that the revision of the Constitution was bad.
The text, which lastmorrow was still voted by 234 articles.
Article 2 of all views, finally, remains identical to the Constitution of 1971, which stated that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of the law".
The Salafist parties, for which the establishment of the Islamic law is a fundamental reivindication, expected that "the principles" could be replaced by "norms", which would have allowed a more closer application.
For the Islamists, that this article has not been amended is a guarantee of its good will and respect for the other components of Egypt society.
The liberals do so of hypersensitivity and believe that it is not more than a public art.
According to them, the islamization of the Constitution is made through other articles.
In particular, article 220, which confided to the University of Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular for all those who have to confirm in accordance with the laws of the Sharia.
According to the specialist in Egypt Sophie Pommier, it is concerned that "the people called to proclaim is not elected and has no democratic legitimacy.
Here we see the premies of a theocracy."
The fears of liberals also seem to be increased by the fact that the next rector of that university would be quite less moderate than the present.
"Nor now there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution, we are within the framework of the civil state.
Most of the jurists who have worked in this text are not all universities but universities, some of them formed in the French system," Alexis Bluet explains, which prepares a tess on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But it recognizes that there may be certain ambiguity towards article 220, since the terms employed follow the religious vocabulary.
"We refer particularly to the term chah [islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question that could be planned in the future would be in what measure the competent civil judges to proclaim over all this."
Besides its religious character, the text voted yesterday has received many criticals concerning extended powers confidence to the President of the Republic.
Muslim brothers will declare that they are little compared to those who were during the previous regime.
Another conflict point: the powers given to the army.
In accordance with the desire of military, the review of the Defence Budget will not be subject to Parliament, but to a national defence Council.
They will not be prohibited by the processing of civilians in military courts, as they requested associations for human rights defence.
These also shown their concerns on the text, which considered liberty.
The crime of blasfemy is maintained and now the insults are prohibited, which could cause serious consequences to the freedom of expression, especially the press.
Furthermore, no article focuses on the protection of women, subraya Heba Morayef, of Human Rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive was the prohibition of torture in accordance with Article 36.
The word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
Although the President of Egypt had to go last night in the television, there are manifestations for this media.
The parties of the head of the State were demonstrated on the Sabbath.
In Israel, the Ukrainian tourists are waiting for them to the holy land, the umbration of the world and the sea of salt
The promised Earth combines the magnificentness of the Bible truths with modern comfort and a princess nature.

Visit only museum
There are about 300 museums in this country.
On one journey you can't visit them all.
But it is important to visit at least five of them the most interesting.
Among them is the Museum of Israel, located near the Knesset (Parlament of Israeli).
The old Manuscrites of the Mother Sea or Quemran Rollos, covered in the coasts of the wilderness of Judah, and about 500 thousand archological and anthropological pieces.
It's worth visiting Art Museum in Tel Aviv.

The fifth, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, shows one of the most dramatic pages of the history.
The most strategic section is the Memory of Children, built in memory of 1,5 million killed children in the concentration fields and gas cameras.

Ukraine is also mentioned.
Salud
The three main tourist areas of Israel are situated in the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Mother Sea.
In each of them there are pools, acute parks, definaries and museums.
It is wonderful that in the Red Sea they bade even in the winter months, since water temperature is not lower than 21 degrees and the air is warming up to 23 degrees.
The Death Sea is still more calm and there are baptizing throughout the year.
In fact, this sea, the most extraordinary in the world, is on the lowest point of the planet: to 417 m under the level of the sea.
The iron waters from there are a salm that easily support until those who don't know black.
The surrounding countrysides are really beautiful.
People are coming here to pass treatment courses with salt water, sanitation and sanitary barriers and to strengthen their health in dematitis, alergys, asma, eczema, artritis, bronquitis, diabetes and to order their broken nerves.
Touching the mysteries of the ancientness
They keep the old part of Tel Aviv, Jaffa city in the Mediterranean coast.
For her, it was the famous marriage route that had aunded Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in the old Greek and Egyptian league.
According to the loyalty, Noah built his ark and Perseo reserved the beautiful Andromeda with whom, in this place, brought a long and happy life.
Tourists like to pass through the streets that take the names of the signs of the Zodiaco.
They say that if you touch the walls in the street of your symbolism, the luck will be favourable to you.
In Jaffa, there are couples of marriage adults coming from all parts of Israel, even from other countries to photography.
And in Caesarea, the city of the king Herod, it is possible to pass through the Roman theater, "tomar" the strength of the crowds.
At the Roman time, Cesarea was the main city of Judaea and the residence of the Roman leaders, including Poncio Pilate.
The teatro, carefully restored, is now used for nocturn concerts and opper shows.
Remember Tourists
If he travels to Israel, he doesn't worry if his English leaves much to desire: in this country about 30 per cent of the population speaks Russian.
The money for this trip is not recommended to bring it in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be changed to sequels (dately $1-3,8 sequels).
The urban transport is mainly composed of bus, but in Jerusalem there is a fast transfer and in Haifa is the only metro line of the country, which contains six stations and connects the Baja City with the Alta city.
In fact, it is a subterritory functional.
Return in any kind of public transport costs 6 skells and for this price you can travel override for 1.5 hours.
In Israel, according to the Jewish tradition, the Sabbath sabbath is celebrated.
From Friday evening until the sun of the sabbath, markets and tents are closing, and public transport interrupts its work.
But Sunday by morning starts a new work week.
In many coffees, restaurants and hotels only serve cosher eating, excluding the flesh of dog, marine, fishing without swimming and plates in which milk and meat are combined.
There is a wide selection of plates based on vacation and oxen, softs and posts prepared with coke milk, the traditional Hebrew cream called hummus, great variety of salts, the falafel, which are mild garbans, fruits and green.

The Promised Earth, from January to October 2012, was visited by 118.8.000 Ukrainian tourists, which exceeds 51% in the same index of 2010 before the cancellation of the visa regime on 9 February 2011.
"The great and powerful" will bring you to Moscow: immigrants for language
While deputy-defenders and human rights defenders discuss the consequences that would bring the law on the obligatory review, they have already appeared in the timing country negotiating with "fals" certificates.
Every year, 13 million inmigrants arrive to Moscow, San Petersburg and other Russian cities.
In most of them, there are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Taikistán and Turkmenistan.
Its only goal is to win money to help their families who have stayed at home.
Since 1 December, a law shall enter into force, according to which each inmigrant employee must carry out a review to control its knowledge of the Russian language.
This Regulation is now applicable only to those who intend to work in the service sector, Community services institutions, home services and smaller trade.
However, as they promised in the Federal Immigration Service, the reviews will be made obligation to all immigrants.
Furthermore, it will not be sufficient to make the language review, if not the Russian history and the fundamental of legislation.
The language knowledge must be confirmed even in order to receive and renew work permit.
They are exception of the citizens of the countries where Russian is official language.
It will not be subject to this law persons who have obtained their certificates of education and diplomatics before the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.
Utility, fatality and defence of rights
The Institute of Lengua Rusa Pushkin, the University of the Amistad of the Pueblos, the Statistical University of Moscow, the Statistic University of San Petersburg and other Russian higher education institutions.
The immigrants can be presented to tests in all cities, now in Russia are opened more than 160 centres of this type.
The initiative on the introduction of the review was supported by Members of the State Duke and the Federal Inmigration Service.
But the defenders of the rights, a lot before the law enters into force, have many times achieved this question to the press: What will it actually bring?
What changes will the obligation of the language knowledge, both for the Russians and for their own immigrants?
First of all, representatives of the Immigration Service will allow them to reduce the number of persons suffering as 'employment slave'.
Many people today speak about the defense of the rights of the labour immigrants, explains Victor Sebelev, head of the representation of the Russian Federal Immigration Service in Thaiistan.
The defence of its rights must be started before its party.
Only an organized selection system will allow the problem of immigrant workers to be a 90 per cent of cases.
The problems have them without profession, education, no language or medical control.
Without the understanding of the language, Sebelev, the future will be condemned to find persons without secrets that, with the pretext of help, put it a "payed spectrum" to a spanish and stretch spectrum, where he and teachers of others are consumed for months without food or documents, working from 12 to 14 hours a day.
We received a series of complaints of our immigrants.
"In their country, they promise one thing, but when they arrive, they are deceived, they have not paid the promised wages," confirmed the Chief of the Working Immigration Office of the Immigration Service of Taikist, Tolib Sharipov.
Don't hurt you, man!
However, while many citizens of Central Asia who want to work in Russia are recognized that they are not only aware of the country's language to go but also in their own language.
Of course, this is not your fault but your own desire: it's few Turkmen, Uzbeks, Tayikos, which can be given to receive normal primary education.
This must be that their families even have nothing to give children to eat, to speak about their clothes, to clothe them and buy them as necessary for school.
When you get to adolescence, these guys would have worked at the first opportunity.
It's difficult, if you don't know the language, you recognize them.
"And if it feels humble and lower."
However, in terms of the language law, the rights defenders point a significant point.
The reviews will be carried out only for those immigrants whose legal status is.
If they do not have this status, there will be no review and, therefore, no official work.
Most of the immigrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Good or prohibited steps to foreigns"
Many visitors say that the official status in our country is not so easy.
The cause is in the burocratic obstacles and in the difficulties of the language in himself.
Furthermore, legalization costs money: from 12,000 to 10,000 rubles.
However, a false registration can be done quickly and only for thousands of rubles.
The Russian police employees know that we usually take false documents, we are not registered and there are cases of extortion.
"We ask hundreds or two hundred rubbers for cigarettes or tea," said the journalists, the citizen of Tajikistán, Umed Hushkadamov.
"Come, don't be taste, buy a painting."
On the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was marked that not only immigrant registration documents can be false.
Several "fals" language knowledge certificates have already been incarnated by officials of the Federal Immigration Service.
False documents had been printed in colour standard printers.
Of course, the hands of the new owners were not as the gift: each immigrant, wishing to facilitate the task of proceedings, paid by the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two times and half more than the official examination procedure, which shall cost the immigrant worker three thousand rubles.
The main task for the next future is to protect the system against corruption so that "diploms" cannot be bought, convergence of government officials and defenders of rights.
To date, the authorities may grant immigrant workers who could not have successfully been able to review the first time to study the basic course of the language.
Furthermore, the immigrants who do not speak in Russia will be offered work that do not require active communication with people.
The Ministry of the Interior does not take drastic measures against illegal weapons trade
The percentage of crimes committed with registered weapons is quite reduced
The Ministry of the Interior proposes that the law is more rigid with regard to civil use owners.
This is the reaction of the government to the recent incidents: Preparing breakfasts during marriage feasts in which, summer, there were no victims, and the mask initiated by the Dimitri Vinogradov lawyer, in which to take seven people lost life.
Police wants to prohibite traumatic weapons and possessions in public places and to higher minimum age for licensing to carry weapons from 18 to 21 years.
This idea was supported by the Head of the Dumas Security Committee and the fight against corruption, Irina Yarovaya, which promised that the reforms in the Armed Insurance Act will be carried into the Duma of the State in the next future.
Not all feel content with the fact that the Russian authorities are trying to address this problem by applying the "sharing hand politics".
In the network, a open letter, whose authors, representatives of different social organizations, require that such measures are dismissed of "inconscious jurisdiction".
The percentage of Vandalism acts with the use of registered weapons is minimum, reported to the BBC newspaper of Russia, the Criminal lawyer Vasiliy Lésnikov.
According to the Internal Ministerial Statistics, for six months of 2012 142 crimes were made with use of firearms registered in the Interior organs, against the total of 1168 crimes registered for the same period.
The open letter authors are sure that a more closer legislation in the civil use sector will not be an inconvenent in order to bring the offence to the black market.
Now, according to your words, in Moscow we can find any weapon under price.
While soon, the Ministry of Interior states that the situation of the proliferation of illegal weapons is under control.
Providers: from manufactures to officials
The Black Weapon Market is located through several channels.
The main channels are years old, says the retired coronel Victor Baranets, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and in the High Mayor State.
Screen capture that accepts weapon requests
The first, "State of the Army or of the Military" means the weapons that were rolled during the military actions in the Caucasus.
"Weapons were hurt by Russian officials and the same caucásics," says Baranets.
The following type of "Block arms", those rolled by crimes and representatives of the security forces.
Baranets explains that there are armed weapons from the police stocks and those directly rolled by officials of law enforcement bodies.
Illegal weapons go to sale from military arsenals.
In many military arsenals often had explosions.
"There are versions demonstrated that some fires were tempted to cover the lack," a exmilitar.
According to Baranets, weapon manufacturers also put their swimming grant.
"There are now proliferated private weapons manufacturing that are not competitive in the international market and distributed weapons under the black market, including Moscow," says the expert.
A more source of the black market is the contrabing.
A large number of arms and furnitures come from poor countries like Kirguist.
"There are undertaken with their own production, sometimes arts, and a mafia that has been formed by the arms flower," the former military explains.
Where are the arms coming?
Experts have calculated what is the approximate participation of each of these sources of providing illegal weapons to the black market.
A report on this topic was developed in 2011 by the Public Management Analysis Centre in 2011.
The experts analyzed reports of the Ministry of Interior and Rosstat, criminological library and public access data of ports whose thematic tours on weapons.
Most illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from armed forces and security forces.
The half of the black market weapons has arrived there 'for the offence of staff whose work is related to weapons', is reported in the report.
According to researchers, 17 per cent of the arms come from armed conflicts, 14 per cent of the cases are rolled during the production of weapons and 5 per cent corresponds to the " illegal archeology".
The dependent of one of the arms tents, who asked that his appeal was not mentioned, says that the weapons found by illegal excavators are not buying them no one for a long time because they are too old.
More often, the providers are guided to military stores when they need a game.
By some alpharez, the supplier buys a unit, for example a web gun.
They delete the register and pass over the valley.
"This brings the weapon to the city and sells it to 900 euros per unit with two loaders," we account
"But it is clear that the police is so much of all the matters, as usually, when it is necessary to fulfil the discovery plan of crimes, they make tests to the traders of illegal weapons," adds the dependent.
"It's in a luggage bottle"
The buyer and the buyer are always found through knowledge.
"See web pages and blogs until a guy I suggested that out of the "Begovaya platform" where a man would be taking me to a "sweet" where we could negotiate.
From the weapon price, I just entered me there."
Military Commentary Viktor Baranets
"To get a weapon I need a friend who has contact," says the dependent of the tent. "I have a friend so, but I don't trust in him much."
There are vendors in the markets, but there it was also to come, we say, "of Mr. Ivanovih, who asked him to tell him that he had caught a dent to his daughter."
Even I can get a pair of stairs through a person of trust.
He also gives them me just because he knows I'm not going to get him away.
The news are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Viktor Baranets has been tested on the role of illicit weapons buyer to mid-1990, when it was available to publish a article on this subject.
The scenes, according to their words, have not changed.
They gave you a photo album where there was no "of everything".
"I felt like in a luggage bottle," remember the military.
The buyer, according to the words of Baranets, won't offer you bonds for love: everything can be proved.
I, as a potential client, don't only buy; we're going with the forest vendor, where we put a white.
"You give me the opportunity to disappear, and when I make sure that weapon is well disappearing, we start negotiating," the expert process describes.
Sophos powder
Web search engines lead to sites and "Contact" groups where we are offered to buy weapons "for different purposes".
There is no document or personal meeting.
"It's enough to have a certain amount of money," they are written in the title of the public notice "Compend a weapon or a furniture."
There users make their requests and ask questions.
And you're coming to younger age?
"Your authorised, of course," asking the "Iván" user (preserved orthography).
"Back TT. Moscú" Laconically formulas your question "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fruitful web sites and has taken two hands to those who want to buy fire weapons.
And people's going, as a hungry powder towards the brain, and then, to extrace the carboon in Siberia
Military commentary and ex-military Viktor Baranets
I have heard speaking of these systems: in general, the website is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People make the calls.
The buyer performs the payment through a automatic carrière.
"In response, they send you a photo and instruction to know where the weapons is hidden," reports the NGO Press secretariat "The right to weapons", Dmitri Kislov.
Viktor Baranets claims that if an online request is made, one will stay without weapons and put it into prison.
The Federal Security Service has created a huge network of fruitful web sites and has taken two hands to those who want to buy fire weapons.
"And people's going, like hungry powder to the brain, and then, to extrace the carboon in Siberia," he said.
Makarv per $100
In the purchase of illegal fire weapons, according to experts, one can be paid from $100 to 900.
According to Dmitri Kislov of the NGO "The right to arms", a Macarov weapon can be purchased for $100-300.
It must be waiting for a month and half.
It's sent from the military stores by the middle rango heads.
In accordance with the official statistics of the Ministry, compared with the period January-October 2011, the total number of these crimes in Russia was of 7 per cent, which represents 22.900, and the number of cases identified the robot and extortion of weapons, munitions, explosives and explosive arts have reduced 7.8 per cent.
The employees of fast food restaurants and overmade in the U.S.
Before a 4th part of American adolescents find their first jobs as cards in "McDonald's"
In the last days, in the United States, a protest oil has been launched against the lower wages that are paid in the Walmart Society and restaurants of the rapid food chains, such as "McDonald's", "Burger King", "Taco Bell", "Wendy's" and "Kentucy Fried Chicken".
For now no one is urged to warn if it comes or not this bowl to the nine points, or if it is intended to lose forces and love yourself in its first stages.
Protect Actions contain the support of incidents and a number of NGOs.
Besides the increased wages modes for workers in Walmart and the fast food system, the goal of protest organizations is the creation of unemployment incidents in these companies.
This sector of the economy has now not been undertaken by the synthetic movement.
Fourty and six hundred per year?
The actions started last week after the day of action, the name "New Viernes". This day, in the United States, coomended the relief management that he hired millions of residents, and sometimes was accompanied by hungers.
In that day, some workers of the Walmart Corporation, using 2.2 million people in the world, left their jobs and formed protest pitchs together with the indents and actives of left in the holdings of the corporation, whose products are guided to people of moderate and moderate income.
Walmart sells all of all, from spanish, cock and battery flowers for cars, up to aspires, eggs and milk.
Products in their tents are average between 8% and 27% more baratos than the larger supermercadors.
That's why many bad workers from Walmart buy only in work.
Availability and product survivor has made Walmart one of the largest corporations in America.
According to two critical words, Walmart can be allowed to sell products at very low price, in part because it pays little to its workers.
These are also rejected from bad working conditions, such as the lack of mounting or scanners.
These "New Vierns" participants were required to increase the wages and felt that the cost of health insurance provided by corporation was of 30 to 100 monthly dollars.
For a typical worker of Walmart, who receives $9,5 per hour, this expenditure is excellent, said.
Scientists of California University in Berkeley argue that if Walmart increases the average wage up to $12 per hour, this will cost $3,2 per hour.
This is approximately 1,1% more than it costs in wages now.
If Walmart puts the wage increase in consumers' homes, each visit to the tent will be only 46 hundred more sweet.
In one year, they will pay the amount of $12,39 more than they are now paying.
Walmart's partners are satisfied that the protest had so much in nine states and that there was no loss to corporation.
The "New Viernes" was extended in his tents from the 8 of Thursday to the middle of the next day, and Walmart sold about 5000 articles per second.
In total, its registering cards performed the "New Winters" almost 100 million transactions.
The representative of the company, Dan Fogelman, declared in an interview on the left website of Huffington Post, who left its job "meen of five" employed in Walmart and that the protest was not more than "other sort of public relations", organized by the employeee.
"Cause free!"
The protests continued this week in New York, in which the objectives were not exactly the great stores of Walmart (which in this progressive city have no appreciation, and therefore now there are no ones), but the "McDonald's" and other barato restaurants.
McDonald's says that they sold thousands of portions, and then they don't even grant you low by disease and don't pay you for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the Municipal Council of New York
Currently, in accordance with federal law and New York, the minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Food restaurants are faster, but only slightly, and averagely, ordinary workers receive 8,90 dollars for hour.
Nobody wins less than they in this city.
How it is possible to survive in New York with this money, for me is something incomprehensible.
There was a time when almost the fourth part of the United States had passed by McDonald's McDonald and worked there, behind the showers, at parttime after school, even though they still lived with their parents.
A few were those who saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay there a long time.
Now, constantly tropizing in some interviews with McDonald's workers who want to have to live from this salary, and sometimes even to eat their children.
On the other hand, in a form of the Wall Street Journal magazine there is a comment whose author notes that it is unfair to have children if you don't know what to give them to eat.
The participants in the protests, which started at 6:30 of the morning of Thursday in the McDonald's 40th Street and Madison Avenue, asked to the fast food chains and cookers were started to pay at least $15 per hour, or whether they doubt their current minimum wages.
They also claimed that in the fast food sectors workers were in place.
The U.S. Act prohibites the administration to prevent this right and punish the civilians of the synthetic movement with warrants and dismissed.
On the other hand, the administration is rarely helping them to live.
But, because of objective reasons, it is easy that the incidents boil the rhydrical food sector.
One of the main is the excessive rotation of staff.
Disorders
Ruidos protests were the same day in other barato restaurants of Manhattan.
The culmination of the action was at half of the McDonald's place near Times Square, in which several local democrats participated, in particular the member of the Jumaane city Williams Council, who said: "McDonald's says he's sold thousands of millions of portions, and then he don't even give you a hospital or pay you for your honest work."
The demonstrators received the support of other high-democrats from New York, for example of the candidate from the city of Bill de Blasio, which said that "We must support the workers of the fast food sector to receive fair wages and economic prosperity that is paid for each neoorkin."
As described the New York Times journal, this was the most manifestation of this type in the American history of the fast food.
However, only a few hundreds of people, even not all they were employed in the speed food service, in which tens of thousands of people in New York worked.
It's still not clear if it's gonna serve a chispa to cause a massive movement.
"To now, lie to the brain isn't so easy."
The theme of the increased reality, so popular among modern technologies, last of all, is generally awarded by the special rate.
At the beginning of the summer, in his annual Google conference, he demonstrated a model in movement and later in November, was known that Microsoft had also submitted a request to recall the relevant patent.
However, on a conversation with the Chief of the 3D Interactive Technology Group in the Cambridge Laboratory, Izadi Sharamom was deployed that for the scientists of that company, the drags were already involved in a past stage.
They focus the perspective of manipulation of virtual objects in the air with naked hands and the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Please, in general terms, what is the object of your research group?
- We dedicated the interaction of person-ordinator, but we also try to expand the limits of this interaction.
For now, humanity in its large mass has remained attracted in the work stage with the pixels of the planet screen, sometimes touching it with the finger.
But we want to look at 5-10 years later and to advertise cardinal changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox comfort and the Kinect sensors represent a step forward and today no Xbox is sold without Kinect, since all interested on control by managers.
- What more about the future?
- Although Kinect has conducted the interaction at physical level, most of that still happens in a 3D screen screen, sometimes in 3D.
Introduction of information has improved (the system receives more data), and the output is still not very good.
We are trying to change this, we work on really three-dimensional visualization systems, based on various technologies, including designs.
The world should be freed from the information to our, physical, more tangible.
For this, however, it is necessary to recognize not only the user, but also the space that it runs.
So we can complete the real world with virtual objects of a more comfortable way.
First of all, the devil with those cases of virtual reality!
- What do you think about the voice control?
A very popular detail, but don't you think that they're overstood?
- Of course, you can't consider a panacea, it is expected to solve the issue of privacy, since you don't always want the others to get out of our actions and intentions.
In fact, all the types of interaction with computers are good, but each in his own field.
For example, for the control of devices in public places, we had a project in which we thought on the managers, but not in direct movements, but shorter.
Furthermore, the managers were captured not by the camera of the device, but by a push recording the movement of bones and muscles.
For now it is very large, but in theory can be reduced to the size of a pulse flower.
But generally, the future is for a combined type of control, for example manager + voice.
- How's that?
- For example, how would you ask you to pass this soda lake?
You will talk and show it at the same time.
- Usually I'm just talking.
- Oh, that's gonna be very difficult to recognize.
- Or do you want to obligate users to adapt what you can or can't do now the machine?
- It's not necessary, but it's an approach to each other.
I think in the next future we will have to work mainly in the design of new sensors that can precisely determine the reactions of the person.
These may, for example, be a Laser sensors, because they provide a good resolution in deepity, which is very important.
- If we talk about your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you want you have of modern cameras?
The lack of resolution, deepness or something else?
- First, the current generation is what can be the beginning of our work with the three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get eight megapixel at the speed of 1000 fps.
But the question is not in megapixel, but in the quality of mother and deepness.
From this last point of view, all current technologies are not sufficiently good for us; this gives more work to the designers of alcohol.
We must remember not only the resolution in the X e Y e, but also in Z.
The speed, the number of tables per second is also important.
Human movements are quite dynamic and the current 30 fps are really low, especially for managers.
Steven Batelli, of our Labor in Redmond, made a sense of contact with an adjustable processing delay from 1 to 100 ms and can be mentioned that the modern sensors produced in series are closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands what measure this affects human-maquin interaction.
I would be very useful for my work a equivalent of this device, but it would not need contact that the tables may be secondly more.
- And don't you need to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect has now three "cameraries", one of which is actually the emittor of infrared races and the second the receipt of the sign reflected.
But the third camera is actually a simple sensor of the visible diapason.
This is not used to determine the depth of the object.
Maybe more cameras could solve the problem...
Or otherwise, increase it and increase the required quantity of calculations.
It would be good to create a flexible analysis of Kinect, play with the location curvation of the cameras and see how this would help to define the three-dimensional position.
- So I remember, Microsoft, on a different way of Google, hasn't presented your givings to the public.
Does it not seem to be one of the most visible platforms from the view of the daily use of real technologies?
- Of course, through all the time supporting a smart phone in your hands, it's not very comfortable, but I think: the best option would be an increased "transmutable" reality when, based on a cloud platform, you could pass out of your hands to the intelligent phone,
The gifts are very personal devices, in this is your strength (the private things you can only see it), but also your weakness: an increased reality on balls will not allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- Let's imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is available not only for Tony Stark of the "Iron Man" film, but also for any simple mortal.
There is a problem in this idea that criticians are soon noticed: There is no tactil answer!
The hands don't hear anything!
What are your group's answers prepared for this challenge?
- In my conferences I often say that the increased reality is the seventh irruption in interaction between man and machines.
I think that the eightth could be added to tactile senses.
While soon, one of the most interesting trucks is the use of the second hand in the quality of support for the image.
Register the taste perfectly!
But there are also technologies that are truly orientated to give tangibility to these "images in the air." For example, the interference of several ultrasonic races directed to a specific point where the depth gives a sensation similar to which one feels if someone would be soft on the legs of the fingers, but this feeling is still very weak.
There are also pulses for the punch that affect the nervous ends of the fingers, this is also a promised direction.
- He tried to lie the brain?
Do you think he feels what he feels like he should feel at the time when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we've not yet tried.
Here is another challenge with which we will have to fight for a long time, how to make a person located in a very reduced space that goes to an open space nearly without end. We are also working on the idea of the wheats (no as the jamnasios), mobile platforms, as well as the huge globals.
Now, deceasing the brain is not so easy, it still needs to work for many years.
This is what makes the work attractive with the virtual reality for researchers that many things are found in a total conception status.
Subjective staff instead of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the "Vanguardism of San Petersburg", dedicated to the citizens who are before, to the advantage of art and culture.
In this list of the best figures of the art and the scene of San Petersburg, whose achievements come beyond the city: often find a recognition in Europe without Russia even knows them.
The new "Rosbalt Heroe" is the exvagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, a barbud clothed with red downward, which can be found near the Russian Museum, near the Verano Jardin or in mode and inauguration meetings.
Kirill Miller's tables are always going to people, where he wants to exhibition.
Kirill Miller is one of these pure sociofilosophs of San Petersburg, creators of new metology.
Kirill Miller is a brilliant representative of the Vanguardism of San Petersburg in the ends of the 80s of the 1990s.
Furthermore, it is a cityman, whose appearance appears on the streets of the desolation city in the songs and rises to all the state of soul.
Recently, he took a organ in his hands and became the San Petersburg organ, as he has made to do so hard paper, because his bohemia, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you on the city clothed with red clothing and not mourning or tourcery, for example?
- I've chosen the red colour because I'm a mode designer and I'm giving me to the appearance and image.
In this world the red colour is a commitment between the artist, the creators of images and society.
Although in society, everything that is not a little green makes aggressive and aggressive of property nothing good.
But my provocations are aimed at starting a conversation.
All the story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the debate.
When did you understand you should be an artist?
- In an exhibition of the Nevsky Palace, where my work were expressed.
I realized that it was my way.
Then the olive of non-official artists had ended, and the new, free as me, were still understood.
I made a friend of artists of the new oil, with the posts that were exhibited in Gaza and Nevskiy, who brought "Pushkinskaya-10," and the new oil has already been completed.
I took me into the teater for the robes, the music of all genders, but not for letters.
And all this was played in your Art Clynica... for me, it was important to find me in San Petersburg's cultural center, where they had to meet the best creative minds.
In 1995, I took a territory in Pushkinskaya-10 and there, while there were no reforms, there was a musical musical club, a bohemium club, the house of the Bohemia of San Petersburg.
Many are born there: names, Tequila Jazz, remembering how Schnur brought to the project to "The Audiry of Van Gogh".
Schnur and his friends sing light songs under the fonogram; they were customized pantalons, including the current composer of Igor Vdovin mode.
When the group began to touch alive, he became "Leningrado".
Trachtenberg was an animator of many programs before Hali-galivskih time.
We told them to Trachtenberg, and it was the beginning of their great carrier; basic education and training received it from us.
"D 137", "Club Griboyedov, are the rest of the Art Clynica."
There were our employees and asylum customers.
I'm a hero of the past century, when culture meaned something.
In the year 2000, the survey took place in the press, the prize was "The people of our city".
In the name "Annual Artist" I was elected, so my culture ended.
In these new times it is not comfortable to work; I am a man who loves truth, honestity and culture of the past century.
In our time, it is easy to be popular, but culture and popularity are separate. One can be popular but very little worshipped.
- There's something recognisable in your work.
- Many of my paintings are hits, they're clearly expressed today and happening.
I'll make a programmed exhibition, "The Russian Museum in the country."
The country is a temporary category.
I was society, but now being so painful and awful.
But in the landscapes everything is embarased and tragedy is abolished.
I love it great, I have great ideas.
For example, the salvation of the world through a total and obligation of clothes.
Now one still stands through his clothes, focusing on the outside, but not inside the person.
And, perhaps that person should not be put to him or give his hand, but to take it on his face.
And the false will be removed when he changes his clothes.
We've seen you in the city organism paper.
Who better than I to be!
- Well, but the best commercial artist can be beautiful?
- Now the commercial art must be explosive, sweet, having taste.
We are witnesses of the disintegration of cultures.
Before people were grouped in hands, the bohemios wanted something, the other simply.
Now all have divised in microcommunications, it is difficult to comply all.
I'm not a hundred dollar bill to like them all.
Now you need to think who you want to like.
Now, each collapse hero has its 100 fans.
- And to listen to Stas Mikhailov are coming for thousands!
- To see the left, there works sex-social areas.
And at a cultural event of 300 people, 10 thousand will never come. As a result, less management, less money, it's gone.
I have my guys, the most important thing is not to stumble them, not to lose what you've achieved.
When he was young, he did such tables that a collectionist had collates on the wall on the side of Falk and Larionov.
I started with paintings, with which generally people end.
Now you are often confusing the concepts.
Decree spiritual culture, consumption culture.
There is no culture in the consumption, this is another story.
I am a man of the yesterday culture, I grew up under the example of artists who lived in poverty and lived in poverty, they refused money only to paint tables.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what's the lack of San Petersburg?
- Good experts in culture.
There is a concept: culture official.
But not all of them can be dedicated to culture.
When the kings were the right all of the other way, the kings may not be very well understanding the culture, but they knew that it was necessary to keep the correct experts.
There are now very good advisers in Moscow.
We have people in San Petersburg who could well be experts, but they are closed, because they need experts at a higher level that correctly evaluate them and open their way.
Now you're prospering the subjective personal well.
The same Erarta, but the difference is that they say honestly that not all modern art is accepted, there are some artists that have to look for other museums.
- What's with you, San Petersburg?
- San Petersburg is not a cultural capital.
But on our stones it's difficult that the art grows.
We need cultural ground and now we have more writers than readers, this is bad.
In Europe there are a quantity of people with curiousness that is going to exhibition and concise.
In our case, this class is an infime.
We have to do that the art is kind of mode, as it was the beginning of the past century.
The project will be implemented with a subvention of San Petersburg.
Give light in space
Earth is in danger.
Global calendation or choke with a murder asteroid.
Space boats with people on boat are going to search for a planet.
To keep humanity is the main question: How can the kind continue in immense conditions or in the same planet?
I think there's a little bit where to choose.
In fact, only two are true planetes that can be colonized, at least hypothetically.
"There are Venus and Marte", says the Astronomy Institute, Sternberg P.K. (IAES), Vladimir Surdin.
But if the conditions in Marte are better for life, the temperature in Venus is 500 degrees.
Only you can live in large heights or in Venus order... in space.
It began to address the playing problems in space with the flower.
A half - century ago, experiments were carried out with plants.
Four generations of building guests in order were not different from the earthquake varieties.
Then came the crowd of insects in the order, small meats of the fruit, droofils.
In 1979, weapon oils were sent to the codorin space to check how the embryo was developed in embrysis conditions.
Let's get as a result of normal pollution.
But then they start the problems.
"The problem is that this pollution has to be found a support, must be kept on his own feet and start to move," Vladimir Sychev explains the Laboratory Director of the Biomedical Problems Institute (IPBM) of the Russian Science Academy.
With no support, the polluants were shots at the screen.
And after 10 hours in the receipts, a total athrophy of the instincts was given.
The pollutions did not react to light or sound.
And the unfortunate was that in four days they just died.
"And two times we succeeded that they were born pollution, but then we let it because it was impossible to work there with them," said Vladimir Sychev on the fracase of the experiment with the polluants in the space.
The last time a "miniar" biological flew to the order was 16 years ago.
In the spring of 2013, the experiments will continue.
However, in the biosatlet "Bion" only will travel species of the same sex.
There was a experiment with rates, which were sent to the space already with fetos.
In principle, there was nothing overnatural.
"It was exactly in the biosatlets, but this was a unique experiment, and studies such as this should be carried out," commented Vladimir Sychev.
After the earthquake, space wheels had descendance.
However, the problem of reproduction is not yet done in the space.
It's a difficult challenge.
The animals, to lose their usual habitat, are simply unable to perform their sexual institute.
The man, however, can, at the same time, be different from small animals.
The wise man has an abstract ratio and is able to create an appropriate emotional fund.
Any similar experiments are not carried out for ethical reasons.
But women travel to space for 50 years ago.
Tereshkova was the most risk.
And the most valuable mankind is the female body.
Our joyful flight, and no one on Earth could say, if it's after a space flight.
She can't have a baby after that flight.
"Indeed, no one has responded to this question," comments the veteran of the aerospace sector Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only after an year of space flight, the first cosmonauta woman, Valentina Tereshkova, bore a daughter.
The father of the girl, Andrian Nikolayev, was also cosmonate.
In 1988, the second cosmonauta woman, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was two times in order and even worked in open space, had a son.
However, the risk remains.
We are little, the astronautes are counted to those after long flights all has resulted well, and a healthy generation is growing.
"And if you can say more, it's dangerous even in orbital flights," the cosmonauta pilot refers to the Soviet Union, Russian hero, Valery Polyakov.
However, humanity must find some new ways in biotechnology, radiological protection, in the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaborator of the cosmon preparation Centre is a mandatory stage in the preparation for the flight.
In terms of nucleal flexibility, cosmons practise their workability in space.
Water simulates the impressiveness.
If for an adult water is a comfortable environment, even though still an hostil, for a adult child is its birth element.
Small men-anfibioes seem to confirm that life on the ground is surrounded from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that the baby is finding about 9 months within his mother's aminotic liquid, because it will be easier to touch the water after.
In principle, this is logical because from the date of birth to the time of the first bathroom are past only 2 weeks.
"It's very little to forget something," says Marina Aksenova, monitoring the birth of renaissance.
In a summary, if increasedness is a natural state for an adult, women need gravity, gravity force.
In the intensity of the abdominal muscles and the film are very fast decreased, the fet eradication capacity is reduced.
Well, we hate this, confiding on the action of stimulants for the part.
You can, of course, give a light in a special camera, it'll bear it.
"And what?", Valeri Polyakov makes this original question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without serious sensation, the body does not generate the shelter or the muscular system.
A receipt born in order is impossible to clothe it with a special trace for training, such as adults.
It will simply take care of what is vital for him.
"And this experiment that we're going to do together by allowing the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will give place to bring the Earth to a disappeared person to a totally unadapted person," said the Chief of the Bioethic Committee of the Institute of Biomedical Problems of the Russian Academy, Igor Pestov.
Now the birth of children in space is a theoretical issue.
However, with time this will be a reality when human beings in their boats are directed to a long planet that will be home for their children born in space.
Chief of NKU: The inspection of the "švarc" system has not given the faultful political
In terms of public prosecution, the Czech Republic has a good inspectors and a quality legislation, although its cohesional implementation.
Thus, Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (NKU) said in an interview for Updatena.cz.
"The law will never be perfect", but its application must be correct. "It is, in my view, what we have to do so describe the current situation.
The joint controls of the Checo and German inspectors also come to similar conclusions.
As an example of an wrong practice, Peter Nečas' attitude towards the system to be auto-named only on the role that is known as the "švarc system".
The first minister said recently that the ODS (Christ Democratic Democratic Pattern) would not mocker the enterprises with inspectors. Then is it prohibited or allowed?
"The law must be regulated in any way, and if it proceeds, in that case, neither the President of the Government can prevent the action of the office which has an obligation to carry out these controls or to require obligations," said Kala.
At the meeting of the Monitoring Committee at the Congress of Deputys, you have spoken of the common project between the Checa team and Germany, in which the legislation was compared to public provisions in both countries.
What exactly is it?
This is a paralel control that we started doing two years ago.
This is simplified: European legislation regulates how public liabilities should be organized, so it continues to continue the legislation in each country and then the practice in itself.
We have joined it all and, though the control has not yet been completed, we have obtained very interesting differences, generally, the legislation of our country is "more strict and more comprehensive", however, the practical practice in some parameters is better in Germany.
It is therefore confirmed that it is not enough to incorporate more strict rules but that it is necessary to focus on the implementation of the law itself.
What can this project actually bring? What do you think it's the conclusions?
Instead, a common control of this type could contribute to the lack of investing efforts in the establishment of laws, reduction and improvement of the limits, although this does not have so positive impact.
The shopping economy means reaching an appropriate thing to a reasonable price (that does not always mean that the price is lower) to avoid the riches and, at long, criminal actions.
But not because of reducing the limit of the customs, it means that we'll get it.
Maybe because the system is saturated with so much "papeleo", that those who want to find bugs in the system can easily do it if the limits are keeping so high as now.
You are talking about our country's problems with the transfer of legislation which regulates the practice of public provisions.
How does the control system operate in Germany?
Is it a office similar to our NKU or is otherwise organized?
How much the offices, such as NKU, acts the Federal Court of Compensation, with an organization similar to our, with a college also, is the only one that in its case is a very different way, but in principle both offices are parallelly evoluting.
Although Germany has a federal organization, the accounting courts are also found at this level. In this regard we are slowly differ from our system.
The Federal Court of Contacts (BRH) can only control federal money, which we call for state funds.
Public funds, which are administered by regions and communities, in Germany, are controlled by the Federal Court of Contacts.
With regard to local legislation, is it easier than our?
In general, I would not like to establish a comparison without specific data, but Germany is still a model in some aspects, but it can not be precisely precisely precise in what it is better.
May it be better, for example, about the quality of the inspectors?
That's sure I don't, but, again, I don't like to do this kind of comparison.
It is necessary to say that even those countries we take as a model must face a great number of problems.
If it wasn't so, you wouldn't have any benefit to cooperate with our office, don't you think?
With regard to the legislation of our country, what does the Office mean the amendment of law on public provisions?
Bearing in mind that the period of validity of this amendment is relatively short, it has not yet been shown in the control actions.
Since we carry out ex post controls, it is necessary to count with a certain delay.
Today, it is observed in the preparation process of future controls: we have started a new "non-economic risk detecting tool", which we have been held by almost 14.000 public adjudications, which have been analyzed. The changes will be seen perfectly reflected here because the limits are amended, the conditions of certain types of selection and similar process are corrected.
Do you consider that the adoption of this law is profitable or that, moreover, there is an extension for the burocratic system?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope it is.
The problem that can arise is that the regulation "to be undermined" and that it is impossible to fulfil it.
With the previous regulation, the controlled persons were bound to the contracteur (e.g., in the case of regional operational programmes of the regional Council), and each law not respected in the field of public prosecution was the violation of the budgetary disciplinary.
Does it mean to endure the law in this way?
I think not on this way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or use it and not punish those who commit a formal fault, which has no impact on decision-making.
A system of this type will only be able to create a greater burocratic pressure.
And how does it get out of that?
Let's see where we get this starting path.
The First Minister has recently declared that the ODS would not molese enterprises with the controls of the named švarc system, as regards the fact that it is only on the paper. What does this mean?
The švarc system is prohibited or allowed?
The law must be regulated in any way and, if it is prohibited, then neither can the first minister of the Government prevent the action of the Office which has the obligation to carry out these controls and to require obligations.
You can say, "We change the law and allow it," but you can't say that we will do as if nothing.
The law on public prosecutions, regulation is quite strict as to how formally it must be acted, and that is how to protect the public competition.
But, on the other hand, it is strategic that the candidate is excluded with the best offer to do not comply with the formal requirements.
The law will never be perfect, but your application must be correct. This is, in my view, what we have to do.
The roads present ice plates, although most of them are transitable
In several places of the Czech Republic, the roads present glass and snow plates.
Most ways are transitional, some must be extremely careful.
Karlovy Vary Region
Tomorrow, the roads in the Carlovy Vary region were transitable, but they presented glass and snow plates.
The temperature declines and disappears between five and ten degrees under brain. During the day they will slightly rise.
She left black in the region and lower areas, the snow cap is over.
Instead, in the growths of the Metallic mountains the snow is almost 30 centimeters.
In some places, visibility was still bad because of the weakness, according to the control centre of the operations routes of the region.
The rapid R6 path and the first category road in the region are now without restrictions.
However, it is recommended to extreme precaution, especially in some pumps whose surface can be healed and be rescued.
Also, all paths of second and third category, including mountain roads.
However, in some of them there are still packs with the rest of glass and snow.
In particular in the highest areas, attention must be increased in the road.
Region of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
In some roads of East Bohemia, there are dangerous heats and higher areas and mountains can have been formed a snow snow snow on the roads, notifying on its pages the Directorate of Travel and Autopista.
Road workers advise the leaders on the risk of ice plates, especially in highest areas in the Parduce region.
There can be heavy in Lanškrouna, Ustí nad Orlicí, Poličky, Svitav or Vysokého Mýta, and especially in the second and third category roads.
Routes I/43 and I/34 in Svitav have been chemically treated.
There are particularly snow on the roads of the mountains of Kkonoše in Orlické Hory.
There is a snow snow cap in the highest road areas in Rychnov municipalities nad Kn月nou and Trutnov.
In the eastern Bohemia area, the sky will be today between disappeared and partly cloud, without precipitation.
The temperatures will generally disappear between three under cereal and a positive degree, will be weak wind.
Pilsen Region
The roads in the Pilsen region are transitable today in the morning, although it is necessary to extreme precaution and to be adapted to time.
In the first hours of the morning, the temperatures will be healed between three and nine degrees under brain.
After the smoke and the backward of the temperatures, some ways could also be covered by ice.
In some places, leaders will be found with weakness, but visibility will improve progressively.
This is what is taken from the information of the region's control of road operations.
The D5 autopista is almost without restrictions, although it is recommended to extreme precaution, especially in the way between kilometres 80 and 131.
The surface of most of the first category roads is sweet and without ice.
In the area of the Pillen road and Tachov border with Germany, we can take glass plates.
The second and third category paths are homaged, so in this case also advertises along with ice plates.
The leaders should be more prudent, especially in the least transited paths in the area of âumava.
Olomouc Region
Managing leaders to the highest zones of the Olomouc region will be partly disappeared.
After chemical treatment, the snow remained in the port of ◆ervenohorské and the way towards Videlský kíí.
The road workers took the snow during the night; on the journey of âumper, some 3 centimeters of the snow, according to the road administrators.
In the rest of the region, most of the ways are not limited.
"In the highest zones of the road of âumper, there are noise remaining.
The leaders in the port of ◆ervenohorské will be found with a middle desk directed to Jeseník today," confirmed a worker of the road administration of >>bel<<.
On the ground and night, the Jesenicka also joined their colleagues and, after chemical treatment, the pists of the highest areas are now disappeared and mourned.
On the Olomouc roadway, the roads are without restrictions, the leaders should lead carefully to forest traces, where the roads still end housing.
Ustí Labo and Region of Liberec
Operators of North Bohemia's routes have reported about different complications to the first hour ofmorrow.
Besides some places in which he has shot or heat, according to the police database, the mountain road between Telnice and Kninice is closed in the Ustí nad Labe region.
The temperatures are kept under the cereal, even in the lower areas, so glass and snow remains in the heat. In the lowest areas, especially in the south of the Czech Central Mask, there are no problems and roads, generally, are sews.
Service complications have not been registered for merely.
The road operators have advised the ice presence in the area of >>yid<<tti.
According to the meteologs, the conditions have been ideal during the night. During the day the rain and the snow is hurry and the night the sky will be rescued and the iron will be.
Since the general roads have been declared unfavorable conditions on road I/13, in the border between the U.S. Nad Labo and Liberec region.
The road between Telnice and Kninice had to be cut through the branches of the trees that had been arched on the road with the weight of the snow.
†imon Ornest: In our concerts we want to accept positive energy
It's said that at least one month, at least the end of the world, what do you think about it?
It's just one of the many other alarmist news that we like to drag.
The Tap Tap music group likes us to make bromas on this and we like to say that we are the only music group of the world that can achieve a positive energy to put the end of the world or to avoid it.
Furthermore, in December you will organize a real original project: three conciertos against the end of the world.
Can you explain that to our readers?
This is a State Beneficial Act we have planned for two years ago.
We decided to use the marketing potential that has the end of the calendar to the day 21 December to 11:10.
The previous day, on December 20 to 21, we will organize three simultaneous concerts in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will end approximately at the same time when the calendar ends in the Kiribati island of the Pacific, 12 hours before our horn area.
Who has this idea happened?
At first, it was my idea, then we left the project all together with our designer Honza Augusta.
Besides wanting to gather enough positive energy and avoid the end of the world, we also want to reflect, together with society, on the state in which we leave the world to our children.
We also created a unique collection of articles: bottles, cups, bottles and original farms against the end of the world that can be acquired in www.e-tap.cz, another form of support for us.
The Tap Tap, together with other interpretations, also shouted the name of the wine against the end of the world, which takes the title "Find of the world, canceled".
Currently it is very popular in YouTube, can you hear in the Beneficial Concerts?
Of course, yes, and it'll be the last, good, always that everything goes well, and it won't be over the world...
It will sing all interests at the same time in the three conciertos.
The heats will be paid together by special remission directly to the Czech Television.
Tomáš Hanák has written the letter of this song and interpreted Jesus's protagonist paper in the videoclip, where also song Xindl X...
How did this cooperation occur?
We work together with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, except for organizing many well-being and concierated acts...
Let's all our commitment to participate in this project.
It has been shown that most of them interested and enjoy them to work with us.
What will the money placed in the concerts against the end of the world?
A balance for the educational centre without training barriers, which we take at terms in its sixth year consecutive with civil association Tap in Jedličk月v ústav.
The school students of Jedličk ústav regularly receive the visit of teachers with which they make fun and interesting activities.
The students do not have sufficient economic means to pay the teachers and we make an effort to make it possible.
In the framework of the finalization of work in Jedličk ústav, there will be an independent building that we will translate with this project.
In each concient, several groups and interviews act.
What are the selection criteria?
We seek to develop a programme which is attractive for all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, Chinaski, support for Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji月í Suchý.
To get more detailed information, you can visit www.kpks.cz.
Do you plan another "spectacular action" similar in the future?
In May, we will act at the celebration of Prae's year, so we will certainly prepare a treaty programme with interesting invitations.
The year that we'd also like to touch in the Bohemian National Hall of New York and I, personally, useing that we are in the United States, I would like to complete it with actions in Washington and Chicago.
Our foreign plans are not exactly minimal, until now you have acted in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap is, however, a group formed by persons with disabilities.
How is logistics and organization of these travels?
It's not so hard as it can look at first.
There are five members in the electric road scene, the boards must travel in the sharement for equips and also take a lot of weight, the boxes with instruments...
However, until now we corrected it well. ◆SA and British Airways were perfectly prepared, what I don't let me surprise.
Even in Moscow, where we returned a little bit ago, went out without problems.
Thanks to the outcomes to the foreign, you can compare the different attitudes of society to disabilities and other aspects.
What have you been found to now?
In Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities, everything works better than here; in Russia we have been witnessed that, in the east, there is a lot of way to recover.
On the difference of Praga, Moscú is full of barriers, there remains without being fresh that a person is alone moved through the center of the city in an electric road.
Something like it is, for example, to prefer someone in ascensor scene, there is no.
Successfully, civil association has been created to address the problems of persons with disabilities.
In what aspects should we make an example of more advanced countries?
There are many aspects in which we're going behind...
But it is important to mention that the improvement and improvement of the situation is always depending on those directly affected.
In London and Madrid, it is very normal that people with serious disabilities are moved through their public account and can go to the museum, where you want to...
But it is not very common that a large number of people with disabilities participate in social life actively, in this regard, with The Tap Tap are a little before!
A respectful or without barriers society is something, but when it comes to the time that there will be overcome superstitious sports, artists, actors, political or lawyers, it will begin to change everything in truth.
To now, there are cases isolated by people who have a great will force.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, but if we look at a few years ago, what has it brought you to form the group in 1998?
I'm coming as a teacher in Jedličk ústav, where many young people were around me who wanted to dedicate something.
And since I'm musical, too, among others, the saxofon, I funded a group of friends with a workman.
And with time, as our moderator says there's Angelovič, we were a little of the hands.
However, popularity hasn't come to the last years, or do I miss?
It is true that it helped us enough to connect you with famous songs and also work actively to promote the group.
We come to the conclusion that the work that you don't see is like if I do not exist.
Thanks to the European Union's aid, we can also allow us to professors of quality, equity, etc.
Did you want to get so far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I saw the potential it had, which can be done in another way.
The world of the spectacle is full of things seeming to each other.
It is logical, in his way, all the new thing is choosing with care and spends a long time in accepting.
There's a few extraordinary things, but I would like to say The Tap Tap is one of them.
The impression of someone who first sees us is clearly compassion, is a natural reaction...
But compassion is totally superfluous because people with disabilities are not to be abandoned that they suffer and of those we have to have compassion.
There are people who are able to live full life and develop themselves with the condition, of course, that you have the necessary means.
I always say that if something goes well to people with disability, then, it is not only an advance for them, but for the whole society.
Have you helped the fact that you are a requisite head, as described to you many people?
If we want to do a quality work, we need to be rigorous in many aspects and to require certain disciplinary.
I think it's completely normal.
Some people come with a romantic vision and with the head in the clouds and when they understand that they need to take about two days to run, go to the preparatory test and take a long time traveling and in concients, the initial eufory leaves them quickly.
But this is how it works in every group that wants to work and get something.
The Tap Tap Group currently has 20 members.
How many of them were already at the beginning of 1998?
Only one: There's Angelovič.
We're a open group, people come and go, they can't be avoided.
Whoever has will and wins will always find open doors
It will be the day before the expected end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21 p.m.
It will be placed in the Incheba Area de Praga, Fleda de Brno and Plynojem in Ostrava and will participate in 12 groups and other musics of the Czech Republic
Three cities will be connected at the end of the board through video conference to synchronize the song of the The Tap Tap "Fin of the world, canceled"
The goal of the concient is to meet the resources necessary to finance the multi-functional assessment of the STUDEO without barriers in Jedličk ústav of Prague, the cost of which is 25 million cheque crowns.
The income to the concient cures 400 CZK and children up to 12 years have free entertainment in the advanced sale option in Bohemiiteck
Polonia and cosmos.
At the meeting of Ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency held last week, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of the ESA. It is the second country member of the ESA of the old block of Eastern Europe after the Republic of Tschech, which was become a full member on 12 November 2008.
Polonia initiated intense cooperation with the ESA in 1994 and participated in the Agency's project commission during the next years.
However, the path of Poland towards the cosmose began far before.
Poland enthusiastes were already dedicated to space flights before the Second World War, although he had not always understood its work.
I remember, for example, the conference of A. XXXternfeld in Varsovia's astronomic observatory in which, on 6 December 1933, he presented his ideas on the pioneer study “Introduction to the cosmonutics”.
The ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the indigenous assistants and, years later, †ternfeld remembered that Dr. Jan Gadomski was the only one who had been interested in his work.
In 1934 †ternfeld received in France the prize Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for its "Introduction to the cosmonautic".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966), mentioned previously, became a great impulsor of astronomy and cosmoutics.
He published hundreds of articles in Poland magazines and wrote a series of books dedicated to this scientific disciplinary.
Gadomski became a promotor of the cosmonautic, was known throughout the world, and his contribution to science was rewarded when his name was put to one of the hidden faces of the moon.
In 1925, a drought was built in Poland in 1925.
Unfortunately, who was the author of the proposed proposal and has not been known to the detachment of the project.
It is not clear if the cohete would be used for the drought or for its cut.
The information on this dresine is limited to the collected in the press of the time.
Since 1933 the polar artillery began to dedicate the mixtures.
The research was funded by the Comórka Techniki Usbroheia in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslawem Wolfzem and Prof. Gustawem Mokzyckiegim.
It is clear that the investigation has come to the stage of practical tests.
However, with the arrival of the German tropies, the investigation was interrupted.
In 1937, it appeared in the specialized press type of a photo-elecctric missile designed by the engineer Rohozićski and the next year it was published the study “Rakéta - torped powietrzna i rakitomba lotnicza” by Leliwa-Krzywoblocki.
Both projects were designed to the military use of motors for mixtures.
Before the war, the provisional scientific adviser Committee (Tymczasowy Commissioner Doradczo-Naukowy) was responsible for all projects for military use and coordinated all work.
The Committee was funded in 1937, but after two years of activity, he was interrupted by the beginning of war.
Other studies dedicated to cosmonautically appeared in the polar press after the war thanks to the work of the Political Society of Astronáutica (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
In the edition of November 1954 of the magazine problemy is first referenced to society with four very extended articles dedicated to astronautic.
In one of them, professor Mr. Subtotowicze was proposed that a society would be devoted to the cosmoutical.
At that time there were projects of artificial satellites and it was obvious that the cosmic research was a discipline with future perspectives.
From the principles of 1956, the Political Society of Astronautics (PTA) was endeavoured to form a part of the International Federation of Astronautics (funded in 1951) and in October of that year the ATA became a full member.
The next year, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), was the Vice-President of the International Federation of Astronautics.
He deployed this charge to his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA participated significantly in the development of the audio cohete RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was a success and became the first polatic cohete in which scientific research was carried out.
The first type RM-1 was ended in 1957 and was first launched on 10 October 1958.
The cohete had an approximately 1,800 meters, about 80 cm long and not reached 5 kg weight.
Further, the RM-1A version and the spring of 1959 was started the air tests of the RM-2 two stages in the wilderness of B月dów.
The cohete measured 1.4 meters and weighed about 11.5 kg.
Another type of development cohete would be a real scientific study. The RM-34 cohete would have a 14.5 km support and its mission would control the wind of height.
However, in 1962 the work were suspended.
The successor of the first RM type cohetes was the Meteor-1 cohete, which was built during the years 1962 and 1965.
It was designed as a cohete of two stages, with a total length of 510 cm and a initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types have been developed (alled meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which were differentiated among themselves by the available space for scientific devices.
The space available for the volume was 0.4 liters, in Meteor-1B of 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum support in the three types was 37 km.
Among the years 1965 and 1968, the Air Institute was developed in the Meteor-2 cohete, whose first air tests were started in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 cohete had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to bring a useful weight of 10 kg to 60 km of height.
Posterly the Meteor-2H version and Meteor-3 was built.
The entry of Poland in the COSPAR (Commission for Space Research) in 1960 and the training of the national COSPAR committee two years later.
In the framework of the Interkosmos Program, Polonia joined the research of the cosmic space on soviet satellites and, in 1978, the Polar pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second inter-monual after Vladimír Remek.
The suspension of the law on social work is not the solution.
Last week the constitutional judge suspended the social worker law.
The resolution undertake a closed discussion in society.
It will then be interesting to consider existing problems from a broader point of view.
Free economic systems in the EU, as well as in the globalized world, are based on the principle of more economic and less regulatory competence.
Therefore, this means that the various economic forms and national economic systems are in permanent conflict between themselves.
The cause is found in the principle of free trade and free movement and private capital, together with the weak financial speculation.
The effect of major differences in the labour cost (of wages) produces economic tensions.
On the basis of this concept, it is necessary to understand the situation where the manufacturer, with the import of barned goods, trys to secure distances and therefore "provide a lower" of the price of the competitor with the goal of being made with the majority of the market and thus increases its benefit margin.
At a large level, the majority of enterprises means to transfer the production to the foreigners, to buy more barried or disappeared there. The result is a higher unemployment in the countries where the price of the work is, compared to other economies, is higher.
Because the private capital has no social responsibilities and, with this, it is not responsible for the unemployment that this phenomenon generates, the social expenditure of the state is necessary.
All this situation is useful for the total desire of enterprises to pay taxes and compensate economic and social damage that have caused their own benefits.
The situation is universally so known that specific statistics are not required to present specific statistical data.
Nearly explicit practices of private capital create situations in certain economies in which Governments of those countries are obligation to comply with the objective of artificially reduce the social level of the own population and, in this way, to bring foreign capital to the country.
In the same way, Governments are private capital to provide their own population without taking into account the social decline.
This is particularly patent in changes of vigent laws.
The goal is to the population to accept the discipline of the private capital, especially in relation to the wages.
This is, on the one hand, through the economic commitment system in the case of long-term unemployment; otherwise, through the restricted right of employees with regard to employees' rights.
The result is a growing poverty together with the increased differences between poor and rich.
Since a number of years ago, there are food delivery points in Germany for poor people who cannot be kept with their own work.
The number of people who receive this type of help is already reaching a million.
In the context of the increase in the competitiveness of the German economy, a very frequent case is produced: persons employed with a lower wage under which the State must pay the rest to reach the minimum imprisonable to survive.
The situation of the assistant employees of the German Federal Parliament was publicly made a scene of this type related to the situation.
Measures of practice all the southern EU states lead, without doubt, to the same situation. People, presumed by a abistal declive of their social level, are obliged to migrate as in the XIX century or to misvive with a penal wage at the limit of the society, with hope that any day it comes to the private capital country.
Do you need to ask where he comes?
In the case of other EU countries, the poverty passes from a country to another or never comes, since Chinese, Indians, Brazilians, Turkish, Morocco, Egypt or Africans is still working in an infime part of a European wage.
This also affects all Latin America.
Free theories and communication media state that the state should not bring capital to the economy, which directs the economy to their fracture.
The private capital depends on feedings and disasters that the state should not be involved in the economy in control.
As a result, it is necessary to ask whether the private capital does not affect its egoism in political course and, in the whole state.
In this case, the response is clearly confirmable.
The test is the existence of lobbys, in the very powerful practice and every present, in all states.
The result is an unwaitful situation that is marked in corruption, in mutual favours, in a legislation which is practical in all parties but is not punishable.
In Germany, the situation is as follows: State departments, unless financial means, are responsible for the formulation of law projects to private legal enterprises, which are often linked to industry.
This type of law projects are adopted after the Federal Day, the German Parliament.
Thus, the whole power is not emitted from the people, as it is declared in the constitutions of Western Democracy, but from the strong financial groups representing their own interests.
It is obvious that democracies with a liberal orientation are seen quickly in a situation as the Appianas described in his work The crisis of the Roman republic in times of César and Pompeya: "The state had time to deteriore and the administrations were occupied to the force."
In terms of soups, favours received illegally and assistance to finance stones or swords.
Sovereign and corruption were extended without prevention, and people attended the urines with the apaid vote of beforeman... "It had no people with nature to appoint a position in the administration, so once, because of this disorganization, the state was eight months without consent"... "He had to speak seriously that the only remedie for such a serious situation was the autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energic man"... Although Appianaos thought in Pompeya, Crisus under the power and transformed the democracy for ever in autocracy.
The conclusion, as well as in an antigua, is that the current society is based on unconsidered preferences of individual benefit without taking into account the common interests.
The private capital is not capable of understanding and recalling the benefits of all society.
The result is the same as then, a decade of the unprecedented election, without being made a effort to reform it in deepity.
The causes of the increase in fascistic and communist regimes should therefore be searched in the lack of liberalization of economic systems in the XIX and XX century.
In respect of the current situation, these systems may be considered to be disappeared in favour of a liberal type democracy, as a defined pause, at the expectation of the next attack.
The fact is that the current election is not completely ignored of the loss of hundreds of thousands of life, social and humanitarian catastrophes we have been witnessed, as well as the crimes against humanity, as we know them in the former history and the most recent history.
The suspension of the Law on Public Prosecutions is not the solution; at least not a long period.
Lower pressure of economic competence, both at international and within the EU, the Government of the Czech Republic will be obligation to continue to seek other ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systhematic.
The solution passes by concrete sociopolitical reforms, which increase both the participation of the capital of the State and the influence of citizens in the government, and deficient the position of private capital in the society in the benefit of the state.

After the last olive violence olives between Israel and Gaza, different reactions have been overcome, as always.
One, from the side of Israel, arguments for the right of self-defence and encourages the Palestinians in the role of terrorists. The other supports Palestinians and aggression by the state of Israel, the genocide of the Palestinian Arabs and the duty of Israel of terrorist state.
I don't want to concentrate on whom the murmuring of regularly repairs and who is the victim. To the end and finally, the citizens of Israel today, including self-employed territories, were born within the current political situation and did not live the starts of violence.
My intention is to offer the readers a look behind the tank, a look to discover who's earned out of the tensions that are moved since 95 years ago (coaled from the Balfour declaration in November 1917) on a small surface of the Middle East.
Some of my considerations are based on historical facts, others in conclusions which I have come on on the basis of my own way to understand the matter, who or what group of people is the main impulsor of the events of the modern history.
In the history of humanity, the story of power fight is in the first line.
Every time we can find an Alejandro Magno or a Napoleon.
But what is not so obvious is if these persons were always those who direct their steps in auto-other way or if after his throne had somebody who directed their action to a certain goal.
We must accept that we live in a time that concentrates the richness of the world in the hands of a few individuals and that this concentration of money and the power that involves it has not been able to reach one generation.
Of these astronomicly rich families notes one that might be considered the most prominent ( if there is still someone behind, I don't know, but I don't know it): Rothschild.
Not much is written near them.
Naturally.
In the 1990s of the XIX century, they bought the first news agency (Reuters) to leave their name in partnership with great serious acts. The power and richness, or both, would cut them the backs, which always means strengthening.
There are an important participation in almost all the central banks of the world and in those countries in which they are not represented, or have been made a war: before the attack on Afghanistan, seven countries were after Iraq's attack, it was 5 after driving Gadafi was only four, but the Russian interviewer had submitted the central bank to the Russian government.
Everyone who tried to oppose this family has died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the state of the Central Bank of America of Rothschild, started during the Section War to print money and was killed in 1865.
JFK began to print money and wanted to suspend the Federal Reserve System (FED) and was killed in 1963; the Louis Mc Fadden Congress was led to 1936 after he wanted to ask the FED for declined the great economic crisis in 1929.
Your world power suffers them during the years 1859 - 1871 to take a plan with three global wars, designed by the mass of Albert Pike, conceived to 33 degrees.
The first war was marked as a goal to eliminate the large monarch States throughout Europe; the second wished to remove the colonial topmaster, particularly from Britain, and the third would be proposed to reduce the land population between middle million and thousands of people (subsequent amounts of slaves for their well-being and lowerness and would not consume many resources), but the creation of a universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than an anti-project for this solution) and the final adoption of absolute powers.
The method that operates the group of the richest families, together with the Rothschild, continues the dynamic of the crisis decade and the post-off of a solution (order ab cao - order from the caos).
These solutions, however, are erroneous, and they always comply with the situation. If not, remember that the FED was created so that a crisis should not be re-encompised as the 1907 year.
So, after the success of the murder of heritage to the South-Houngro throne, France Fernando, in Sarajevo, and after that, after the success of the death of the heir, the first World War, they destroyed Russian with the beginning of the bochevic revolution.
The First World War of Justice has concluded a sudden and unjustified from the military and economic point, Germany’s capitalization (the wars to end with the Russian Russian was already inevitably) and the success of the detection of the great power of Central Europe, the austro-Hungar Army.
To prepare the ground of the Second World War, bankers and politicians allowed them to create a conflicted situation on the part of the huge imposed war reforms in Germany, with the best conditions for the radiization of the overwhelmed mass. Afterward, he founded them to serve the Germans the solution of the Five, which was sufficiently strong and simply and revealed to the faultful, and to build after a Checoslovaquia composed by several nationalities with a strong German minority that had to be represented and so well represented the fifth column, which took it and proved the war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds emphasized the foundation of the sionist movement, a ransom which attracted the training of a Jewish state, preferably in the ancient Jewish region with Jerusalem as a capital.
The Balfour declaration mentioned previously seized the bases for the massacre immigration of Jews to Palestinian and began the first conflict with the Arab population of the place.
Terrorist attacks were made on both sides.
It has set the Second World War: it is difficult to know whether Hitler had been too much out of the memory of which international bankers had been attacked in a principle or whether everything he did form a plan, but the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration fields created the best conditions for acceptance of the Jewish state in the world society.
Israel was officially funded in 1948, and, similarly as the war repairs imposed to Germany moved the way towards the Second World War, with the proclaimation of the state of Israel, the focus was for a third war.
If international bankers would continue to launch it, the Jewish nation, as in the Second World War, would become victims of the first line of combating, now together with the Arab population or, generally, musulman of the Middle East.
Israel is an immense laboratory, a solidarity machine, not only within the framework of its country, but also on international level. Let us take an example how they are divided the symptoms and detractors of Israel.
Who is the victim in the Palestinian and Israeli conflict? Where is the injustice generated in an inspirable violence, if at the beginning of all it was the code of some individuals and his Afhan by the world force?
On this point, it is necessary to distinguish between the inhabitants of Israel and its mandatees, because, as it happens in our country, international bankers only submit their candidates in the elections.
The current President of Israel B. Netanyahu is the typical example of the fascist political, which lies to international bankers, which makes all the way possible to declare war to Iran and, considering that Iran is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), would threaten to become a global conflict and, if we understand that Iran is controling the stretch of Ormut, where 20% of all the world's petroleum (the navigation correlator is only two thousands of width), would lead to the destruction of the world economy.
Under the light that the words that David Rockefeller said in 1994: "The only one we need is a general crisis and people will be agreed with a new world order."
The new world order in his imagination is a world of gentlemen and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the population serves to a punch of people who are part of the well-friendly financial aristocracy.
A world in which each new person is imposed by a chip to the birth that controls all its being.
"And must all, small and large, rich and poor, free and slaves, having a mark in the right hand or in the face, not to buy or sell, unless they leave the name of this monster or the numbers of his name.
It is necessary to understand: who has two fingers in front, takes the numbers of this monster.
The number to the person and this number is six hundred sixty and six."
Pelical Argo: If you are cross, call to Hollywood
In November 1979, a group of the demonstration of islamist students took the American embarrassment in Teheran and took 52 diplomats as rehenses.
His liberty would be to change the sponsored Shah Mohamed Resza Páhlevi, which after revolution fled to the U.S., a country that had sponsored its regime for decades.
For the American administration, the situation had not offered a positive perspective: throw the shah on the edge could not be allowed, since, if it had done, it was in danger that trust of his fellows in other countries.
But the liberty of rehenses in Iran, where the revolution was deployed in the establishment of the technical regime, was not at its extent.
It was a bit to the prestigious of the United States, which later increased further with the tentativeness of delivering the rehenses from the force.
Diplomatics incarceled were released 444 days after the negotiatory intervention of the Government of Algeria.
In the United States, his destination caused solidarity and encouragement against Iran.
The fracase in Iran was decisively contributed to the decline of Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidency elections.
The "Argo" film of the director and actor Ben Exleck subjects a episode of this story, which made a little success for America.
It's little before we're busy, if they've escaped six employees from the building.
After a complex periply, they ended in the residence of the Canadian embajed.
CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, helped them out of Iran to help an extravagant point: they went out with Canadian passports, such as members of the cinematographic team that examined the localization in the country for the road of a superproduction of science.
Gender combination
The plan that the expert brought in "exfiltration" Toni Mendez would require for Hollywood's collaboration.
To ensure that the lie is true, the cinematographic project was written in specialized magazines, the press conferences were organized, the physical production society had even a real delay.
Operation details have been secreted for a long time, the film has been done from the memories of Tony Mendez.
Empleck film is a unique combination of several genders.
On one side, a realistic political thriller; on the other, a "caper movie", the history of a episode who went well, a lie (e.g. the Ocean's Eleven series) may be.
The film combines the states of anim. We found a well-documented sequence of Teheran. In the sequence of credits, emblemmatic photographs of the time of events, which were plasmed in the film, there are no differences in this regard.
On the other hand, typical scenes of Hollywood are a lot more livian, marked by irony and a lover exageration.
Furthermore, scenes from the CIA centre and other institutions: men brought to analyze the situation in the negotiations table, in the pasts of the office, by telephone...
Ben Exleck has successed to restart your road in an excellent way.
The actor, who had been bottled, has become a respectable director and its way to act has left to be the white of ironic comments.
Argo is its third long-term, after "Please, Adas" (2007) and the thriller "The Town. City of Ladrones" (2010).
At the same time, it is the first film of Speleck in which the action has not been placed in the city of Boston, where it was cryed.
Furthermore, the sensitivity to catch the atmosphere of the place was a characteristic that was situated in the former film directors on the top of Hollywood standards.
And Exleck shows it in Argo, where Teheran is "ried" in Canada.
The best scenes of the film have place on the streets, in reconstruction of the verily events. The entrance sequence of the toma of the embraced is impressive by their symptotic capacity that, at the same time, transmit the emotion of the disagreement and the lack of preview when, in some way, the history gives a step forward.
Appleck and its partners have a similar effect on the physical scenes (the taxator in the Teheran bacer).
Decade of action in too many places
The director had to accept the fact that a explained story does not provide much in the cinematographic sense of the most intensive scenes.
And it's very good. Sometimes he adds something to the reality: here's not so elegant (the scene where the crisis has reached in the Teheran airport, the divorce of a call to America and the search that is disappeared after its track becomes a loud.)
Argo's flood is the discontrol of the need to show delayed action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman have a very grateful role as Hollywood partners, although their persons are mixed more space and are not, or at least, the only ones in this film.
For these reasons, the Empleck movie is a little dramatic trace, but it is a movie that can continue with a moderate interest, appreciate your performance and style back from a thriller that evaporates the 70s.
But it's gonna be difficult.
As an evocation of a real story and as a evidence of the exaggerate that can be the notions of alliance and alliance of secret services, it is sufficient.
Rules for the inflation of balls, bananas andcirconscripts
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which each year provides a survey on the most absurd bank rates, has now decided to announce the Council on “the regulation or the most absurd ideas of the EU workshop”.
"After the last event, the EU has planned to approve a 40 percent of women in leading positions in the major European enterprises," explained Právo Patrik Nacher, the investigator.
For example, the recent decision of the European Court to unify the ability of insurance between men and women.
To now, women had benefited better prices in life insurance because they were objectively representing a smaller risk.
"And other incredible ideas of the EU workshop can be proposed by people until the end of this year."
The election will be held at the end of February 2013," informed Nacher.
For example, the EU-converted rules is the obligatory addendum of biocomponents to the fuel, which, as a result, affects the environment; other prohibition is the use of mercury terms of all life only because they contain a small amount of dangerous substance or the direction to shape the size of gallins, which has contributed to the significant increase in the price of the eggs.
The factical prohibition of use of the expression "increased" or the restraint of the classic bottle of trade was critic.
A quality plate must have a length of 14 centimeters.
The Union's device takes this type of decisions often under pressure of one or other marketing lobby or industrial lobby, whose requests in Brussels are usually protected by any state or group of states (Tzech Republic, including veto threat, reduces the requirements of its banks).
The interests of a lobby were behind the request, for example, that higher quality platforms should have a length in the EU at least 14 centimeters and could not present "normal curvations".
The European Commission was defended that it was only seeking to harmonize non-homogeneous national standards until the date, which only complicated its marketing.
The standards referring to fruits and vegetables in the EU, despite the opposition of some states, have been stressed on the basis of the existing Directive to be a disagreement of competitive.
The candidate to gain the survey could be the prescription of the EU of the past year, according to the infringable globals that are marketed, it is obligation to warn that children less than 8 years are not authorized to inflate them without supervision of adult.
The EU was referring to a American study in accordance with the terms of players, the main cause of child death by afixia.
It is also a similar restriction applicable to the use of mates by children from up to 14 years.
Fair curious events are also born in our country
Also absurdly is the regulation relating to European officials: any one who has any official function in the EU cannot use Macedonia's name. For not harm Greece's sensitivity, FYROM (Form Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) must be spoken.
The Bankovnípoplatky.com server, in collaboration with the association of free economicists Lassez Faire, mentioned in the survey, among some absurd proposals mentioned above, the prescription of the Union on the volume of food provisions in the territory of a Member State.
The EU has defined the maximum amounts of food provisions that can be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the same day of our entry to the EU.
Then, the Czech Republic, for example, override the volume established for seats in conservation, which undermined the threat of many substances.
The survey organizations also interested the opportunity of paying countries that do not have access to the sea and the idea of providing a subventions request.
This kind of ideas came not to Brussels, but in Prague.
"We're in disagreement because we don't have a sea.
We requested a compensation to the European Union in October 2004," stated the Jaroslav Agricultural Minister in Jaroslav Palas.
He argued it with the fact that our country would be produced much cereal and, as a result of the calls for intervention buy, the state had full stores and had to be exported.
According to Palace, since the Czech Republic is far from the maritime ports, the EU should pay us hundreds of million euros.
Finally, the European Commission was prepared to help the Czech Republic and organized a public concours for buying the cereal of countries that have no access to the sea.
The subvention to receive a subvention was proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development, directed by Minister Pavel Nímec (US-DEU). Consequently, it is intended to formulate subventions requests from Brussels.
EU: Rare requirements are an exception
The guidelines of the Member States are often white of criticism, EU's efforts in regulation and, as well, more effective functioning and development in the whole of the Union are more estimated, according to several experts, our recognition.
According to experts, the most serious problem is, for example, the EU subventions covered by projects that have nothing to see with the depth of European integration, but that Member States have achieved budget negotiations.
The Cheks also touches the sensitive fiber like other countries of the Union, the fight against the right to the name of origin of their traditional products, although our country has not always gone out of these fights.
The cheques, after six years of discussions with German and austriatics, successfully defended the name of origin of Olomouc's claim, but had to change the name to the national ron, whose tradition was referring to our 19th century, and continued to be called "tuzemák".
Only products developed from sugar destillate can be called ron but not those from sugar relocation.
In the official list of protected origins from the EU, together with the feta and gorgonzola known chests around the world, the German city Lübeck or the Parma japon, for example, are found the carts of Karlovy Vary, the pohoelic card and Tíeboć, and, even, the variety of lupows of 周atec.
As protected brands from the EU, you may be orgogs of the Pardubice's pearl and Hockey's Hodkrone's boats.
People want to save the republic, but I'm an assumptioned, says Okamura
Senator, how did you have been presented to the elections for the President?
It is not a Senator or President.
If our country was all right, then I would not present my candidate.
But I can't be able to see how the last twenty years in our country is, how the ladders are immunished, increase taxes and age of jubilation.
I had no ambitions to be political.
When I see something I don't like, I'm trying to give a solution to change it.
And as I have forty years and my candidate is independent, the only opportunity I have to change things is to present me as Senator or President.
The Senate has already arrived, but a little later it has been moved towards the presidency.
Do you not give the back to those people who voted?
I always said that my candidacy to the presidency depends on the results in the seat elections.
Later, I said that if I had been elected Senator, I would present my candidate to the Presidency.
But my goal is not the role; the role is the tool with which I can do my own ideas.
Therefore I need the most possible influence and the strongest mandate.
The problem is not only that we are a nation that we criticize in the bar or in the television, but that we're going to be somebody who wants to start a change.
In this regard, the means of communication, which depressive you and confusion the freedom of expression with the freedom of mentality.
I'm saying I've been paid to periodists, or I've been adviser of Jihai Paroubek.
We'll talk about your ideas.
The presidential fight with the financial and criminal responsibilities of political and the declaration of property by over twenty million is presented.
For this, the law should be changed.
As President does not have this competence and only the seat in its whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve it?
As a citizen, I have formed part of a pressure group to recognize the Guide Office as a self-employment, and we achieve it.
The problem is in politics: if someone comes with a good proposal, it is already right or left, it is rejected in order and that affects citizens.
As an independent candidate, I have a greater potential to support all parliamentary groups.
No shots or dogs, I have the ability to choose something from each party that is better for our country and to apply it.
Is a man of right or left?
From the Checo point, I have the impression that people think me more than the left.
For me, it's not important, it's a little left or a little right.
Whatever I'm interesting is we're going out.
I don't care if someone's right or left, I want to join people.
I'll always support openly any good solution, independently if the proposal comes from KSELLM or ODS and, in the same way, will be against the bad ideas.
He's been broke when you're telling you that he's a peoplety.
But you're not showing it with what he says?
When a business plan is created, you also have certain and ideal objectives.
And you're trying to come near to them.
There will be one who calls the peoplesm, but all the proposals I have already spoken in the world or known experts are talking about them.
But without the support of the parliament it is only marked.
And with this, it cannot survive in long-term policy.
Or do you believe that if people lead and talk with them, you will, for example, get a criminal and financial responsibility?
I don't have any other option.
To agree to political, journalists and civil society and to try to put them out of my part to get it.
If President was elected, there would be no problem to organize directly by television on which the leaders of the parliamentary parties would request the criminal and financial responsibilities for political, officials, judges and fiscals of the State.
And, ultimately, they should have to communicate why they don't want it.
If there is a strong person that points the disputes, pressure can be made on the political scene.
We take the direct election of the President, which has been a achievement of the public pressure.
At the same time I confirm that I am just an employee, I am neither a genius nor a intellectual.
For my opinions and ideals I'm trying to find friends.
I started the policy and try to get the most possible support for my programme.
I'm trying to get out of the things after me, but if it's not good, I will leave it within six years and I will return to the private sector.
It sounds like if Okamura was to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a salvator.
I know that with a person I don't do anything, therefore I have visited a series of known personalities, so if they were best encouraged to present their candidate to the sister.
I went to see Radim Jančura, but he refused because he had a lot of work.
For my part, at least I supported the investigation periodist Jana Lorencová, who has led to light fraudes with light heat oil.
I introduced me from the basis that people are really unsatisfactory, now I'm in the balance.
The sixty percent of the population did not accuse the urines, and those who did it voted to the representatives of the establishment.
In the senate we are two of the independent sector.
People chose the senate so that it will be complicated to achieve changes.
However, I will defend my own ideas, such as the direct election of alcalds or governants.
Are you considering forming your own game?
I have not yet considered it because I have no time for that, to check the past intact of each of the potentials of the game, and I have no money.
I don't have money or the campaign to the presidency, in my transparent account there are only $20,000 crowns.
He doesn't have money?
He speaks of property declarations, how is your own?
I was my private property in about 60 million.
In Prague I have a valued ground in 25 million, a valued pool ten million, another basket in eight million, a collection of art work with a value of ten million, a Aston Martin of about 3,5 million and a Superb valued in a million, and I have a couple of millions.
In fact, I have a Aston Martin because he was my dream of youth. I always liked James Bond, who led this car, was galliant with women, and at the same time he fighted iniquity and injustice.
Like a Aston Martin, is your property valued in 60 million and has no money for the campaign?
You say you want to change the republic but you don't want to put too much money from your side.
It's not very convinced.
I have 15 million for the campaign.
Do I have to deal with me?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that you don't have any sponsor show that there is no too interest in my program.
And I don't have the obligation to pay the campaign with my bag's money.
The costs of the campaign are covered in the absence of what I will receive in the concept of senator salary.
But I couldn't live about it. For example, I couldn't pay my son the English school, which is about 30,000 monthly crowns.
If I just want to win money, then I wouldn't present me as a candidate.
So will you continue with its business to can live?
Did you not say before I was going to leave this activity?
This doesn't have anything to see with a greater gun.
As I promised, partly I left my activities.
For example, the representative of my train office will be my substitute in the spring.
People would want to be the samaritian who saves her republic.
But I also need to live of something.
How much do you touch to win a monthly businesser?
It's between 200,000 and 400,000, I'm still winning.
If he was President, I would then leave business.

The MVRDV architecture study shows that the real avventures are not only in the head - in the example of the Spixense library and the recovery completed "Book Month" - 2 photos
"I think the building is nice, has a future aspect, and there's something interesting to see", says Lisette Verhaig, a crossing that passes through the street.
And Stefan Spermon, TI technology in a large company located near the library, at the point: "The building is good."
But I wonder why we need a library today.
All have Internet, tablets and e-books.
Nobody comes in sweet in these model libraries, isn't it?
Specificly, a sleeping city located at Rhoterdam's gates, which at least approximately harms a visit, holds the doubt honor to have been set up with a record to forget.
The population of 80,000 inhabitants represents the lower rate of alphabetization in the Netherlands.
In order to oppose this situation, some years ago, it was decided to contribute to general culture and to copy the seven physical pounds represented in the euro bills in the form of decorated armed warming miniatures.
The success of educational offensive was limited.
And it was like political licensees that there was only an opportunity to improve statistics: it had to build a library!
Winy Maas, the Dutch architectur studie of MVRDV, all a teacher in the art of bar diagrams and responsible for buildings divorced to the countryside, was taken the subject with its usual belief and compared to the presentation of the concert in 2003 with five books under the arm and a sound on the face.
And while the jury looked at her around and shot himself, Maas tried to play the books on size by forming a piramide and concluded his short talk with the following words:
Here you hold it, my proposal for the mountain of Spixenisse' books called 'Boekenberg'.
Nothing years later, the mountain of EUR 30 million is risen on the place planned.
This is part of the revitalization project, which is completed with a subterranean appointment, a supermercado, a post office and a pair of housing and homebuildings.
At the beginning of November, the mountain of books was galarized with the second premium "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is also appointed to "Dutch National Wood Award 2012".
In this way, the small charming city of history, which until the date had nothing more than offering a posmoderna posmoderna peatal area and an incrediblely fenced accommodation after which a white splew would intuition a center of skills, now containing a contemporary architecture work.
But mostly, Speekenze now has the first public cultural building of his history.
The long path to the book
The first impression is that it is a paradise of books under a pencil.
It's true that there's a trainer who just transports us to the center of this mountain mass, but the true lovers of space and reading don't use it, but they prefer to be founded with their topgraphy at each step of its scale.
The fully acristaled internal is light and easy to boil with the view, the land of recognized slider and the farmal elegants support inequivocal the public condition of the library.
The urban environment is perfect.
On the top of the view, you can see the park banks, dogs and children and girls playing the futbol.
And on every side books, books and more books.
"Otherwise bookings are prepared by the latter and in the center open a great dark room which, in general, will be something inconsistent and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
What we have done is to put the classic space configuration and to remove the internal reading area.
The mountain interior is very well used: the offices, the Internet library, the watering club, the environmental education centre and the maintenance room are located in the middle of the mountain.
Special indication is estimated by the futures of black revealing functions at the same time.
Look, taste and oil are strangers.
Even architects and civil engineers have more than daily crashed the head when they hear about this unknown material.
"We wanted to work with reciclated materials", explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project in the city of Spijkenisse.
And this is like one day, in a fresh agricultural operation, we've met with the appropriate subproduction from the agricultural farm.
Since many years ago, in the winters and in the Netherlands a plastic teeth of miles of spears is used as a basis for the submission of culture races.
It is a barried and efficient material.
This teeth until a hard two stations and then goes away.
For the library, this teeth was the first time in such amounts, until reaching four centimeters of spensor plans.
With warming and pressure, the named agricultural plastic change (KLP) is changed and becomes a dark, homogeneous and resistent material that flees to a new car mixture and sports sample.
After 105 tickets it reaches the top of the mountain.
At the end of this street continued by almost 500 meters around the mountain, we will have the reward: from the coffeery it is not only a fantastic view of the city, but it can also enjoy some Dutch croques and its ficus planted in great macetes.
These create a nice environment to keep the appropriate atmosphere humidity for this mountain of literature.
Donations for a new soul
"When it is worthy of believeing that has given its large asylum surfaces, this building is an example of ecological project," said Trouborst.
Calefaction and friction required are obtained from geothermic energy.
Although the mountain of books is located under a huge cristal pirámide, even in the sunest days only lights for a few hours inside.
The huge tree cells located in transversal sense to the painting of cristal serve to give shadow and absorb the majority of the races of the sun.
This creates a comfortable internal climate.
The rest is something of the automatic persians.
Stefan Spermon, the expectic worker of the information technology sector, has already been forced to lay his foot in the new library.
Lisette Verhaig has also been there.
Library of Chinese traditional medicine Cynthia Bogarde has also visited the library. It calculates the "Boekenberg" as the "alma afternoon" of Spijkense.
The reason is that, because of the inauguration that had been placed a couple of weeks ago, all the inhabitants of the city were invited to give a book of their private collection.
In this way it is intended to fill the optical eggs of a library that is not yet accounting for your complete file; it is currently 70,000 examples.
The concept is warm.
The stories are filled.
"It's nothing worse than an average library," said the Winy Maas architect.
"I think thanks to our initiative now all inhabitants have a real link to this building.
All know that their book is part of the library.
Although you're just there to worship.
In this way, MVRDV study has achieved a success in that king's religion that the specialized argument is known as "creation of an identity".
The city of Spijkenisse wrote a piece of the history of literature.
Independent of the young and inculte that can be.
To end a game point to comply with its identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a more protagonist role"
Germany has been held in the Palestinian adoption vote.
According to Stephen Szabo, expert in the EEA relations of the U.S.-Europe, this sees Berlin in a very painful diplomatic position.
German Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany understood that it would vote against the proposal to grant Palestinian territories the status of observer State of the United Nations.
But finally Berlín was absent.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israeli have done in Gaza.
However, because of the special relationship that a country with Israel must be careful.
But at the same time, I think I don't support the north American posture.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence without being too critical with Israel.
During the resurrection held in Libya in March 2011, Germany was also held when it was to establish a flight prohibition zone.
This has finally been declared by OTAN.
Is it difficult to Germany to take a clear post when they are at internationally important topics?
Yeah, that's it.
This must be reoriented at this time by ensuring a leading policy, thus by the United States and focusing on a German external policy.
And what is still more difficult is that Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
Therefore, the Germans are in a surrounding.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not accompanied to do so.
I think they're still twice what their role will be, but they have already started the way towards an "normal".
An external policy similar to countries such as France or Britain.
What specifically means a "normal" external policy from the German point of view?
It is a policy that, when it is national interests, is prepared to defend different positions from the United States and its European partners.
I think the German external policy is a strong motivation in economic policy, i.e. in exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The German economic interests are even different to other major powers and therefore Germany must protect their interests.
Have these economic interests affected the position taken on conflict in the Middle East and the United Nations vote?
On one side, Germany takes account of large markets in the Middle East, especially in the Golf.
For this reason, it should be careful and not be disappeared from the Arab public opinion, nor from the Arab elections.
This is of course important.
But I would not give it so much because it is not a totally unilateral relationship.
However, they play a fundamental role in the German considerations.
Did Germany understood its relationship with the EE.U. when he detentioned to vote in important decisions such as the Palestinian vote?
I think that in Europe, and even in the United States, the German posture is happy of a huge understanding.
For this reason, I don't think that a drastic rupture has been produced as well as in the case of Libya.
Maybe Germany has achieved a certain respect.
At the end and at the end, all this has not been done but shown that it is a country to take seriously as an international actor and whose interests must be taken into account.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative.
In fact, the U.S. has been clearly shown for a vessel.
Are you disparity of views between the United States and many European nations?
These disparities have always existed because of the United States internal policy.
I think the Governance of Obama shows a great understanding towards European position.
But because of the political situation that lives here, it is obvious that the Government cannot defend this post in public.
I think the real disappointment of views does not actually have the boundary that it is admitted.
If we analyze the relations between Obama and the President of Israeli Netanyahu, we see that Obama is not enthusished with the policy which is developed.
Is Germany difficult to convene the close relationships with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the post of its main partners in the EU, on the other hand?
I think that's exactly what does that makes so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there would be a coherent and homogeneous European policy, but it is not the case.
So they do not have the possibility of forming part of an upper entity, but that the things must improving from their own position.
That is exactly what you are doing now with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will be a leading role at the time to bond Europe to take a European post.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, it is a simple relationship with Israel.
This has always been a painting theme.
But I think the Germans have clearly to play the independent role.
Does Germany seem to himself in the role of an important international actor? Do you really want Germany to assess a protagonist role?
Or may it continue to be difficult to accept that leadership?
Germany has not yet been accompanied, it has always been something inconsistent and, of course, the country is still costing to play a more important role.
If we observe the euro crisis, for example, see that Germany is always set as a main actor, some feelings are disappeared.
This is not easy for Germans.
This is an old problem, and no one wants to be rolled from the enemy countries.
In view of this, Germany is in a very harder position than the United States.
There should be a receptional attitude towards the different neighbours and views, and that is not easy.
The impact of the U.S. is always reduced in the European policy, but the EU does not cover this vacuum, who then remains?
The Germans will not remain more average than a more protagonist role.
Even if you don't like them, if they are disgraceable, or if you become them into a people even more impulsive, it's life!

"Market protection" in China: When Puma and Armani are turned in Chinese brands
Armani is a globally known mark and Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what's Armani Polo?
After this name, an officially registered name is hidden in China but he has nothing to see with original companies.
However, it is glad about protection while true epoonses do not present a question.
And then it's not clear that you're going to give them the reason.
"A foreigners it is always more difficult to protect their brands in China", says Thomas Pattloch, Bufete Taylor Wessing lawyer specialized in protection rights violations in the External East.
Every week there's a new case at my table every week.
The followers simply add a pair of letters to register their brands.
In this way, Gucci becomes in Lu-Gucci and in place of Prada is registered Prada-Kny.
The German enterprises also are legally copied in the same way, as and as it has occurred to the manufacturer of Pumaporatives.
Pattloch opens a archiver in which keeps seats of the Pekín Marks Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company wanted to record Zegna DF Puma, a artistic name that also served from the Ermenegildo Zegna.
The chines are global campaigns in this way to copy and violate intellectual property rights is a known sovereignty.
In large cities there are large savings of several plants dedicated exclusively to the sale of falsifications.
However, the cases of Pattloch are different. By caring his customers, he fights the fact that the mark office is officially granted to Chinese enterprises the right to get out of a name already registered in another place.
The Chineses called "Bang Ming Pai" or "Bang Ming Pai".
The word has its origin in the term "Bang Dakuan"
that refers to women who have "covered" to a rich man.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty
"It's prejudice for business, you need to fight against it," calls Pattloch.
"The brand does waters, the monopolistic position disappears and the damage that the image suffers is great."
The financial losses and the processal costs of the concerned sectors are billions, especially in the case of emblemmatic products.
According to the CLSA market analysis company, a volume of EUR 15,000 per year in China is, in dimension, the third leather market and the growing increased rhythm.
However, it is complicated and also puts a lot of money in the registration of marks.
Process can be extended to nine years and the result is incertain.
Pattloch speaks of cases in which the court denied a question because he had been overcome as long as the name of the subject of the application has already been converted in "the reality of the market."
"If the applicant has bad luck, it may also have to pay money to the plastic because the process has damaged the mark of it in China," says Pattloch.
This is the law of the wild.
Some of the most known cases have to see with graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler-Benz lost a flood against the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company who has been absorbed a few years ago by the German producer of Putzmeister horming bombs.
That's why today the chines can continue using a very similar emblem with Mercedes' star.
The Volvo buyer, Geely, used a white and blue logotype that remembered greatly BMW; the case was addressed in the courts and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste robe manufacturer lost in China against followers coming from Hong Kong and Singapur whose logotype represented a cocodrical in view of the original direction.
The Chinese authorities do not feel guilty.
The CTMO Marking Office in Pekín recognizes that in 2010 there were difficulties because of the lack of equipation and staff salary.
The past year, however, "the working emergency situation has returned to normality."
In this way, the amount of unlimited reclamation processes was reduced to 22 per cent.
Case 57,000 of these cases were solved, 75% more than the previous year.
However, 81.500 claims are still delayed by resolution.
Play against this costs a lot of money
As it seems to be normal in China, the numbers are surprised.
Last year, the CTMO registered more than 1.4 million applications for brand protection, almost one third than in 2010.
It would be a new record, and means that China would submit the list of new registrations throughout the world, as indicated by the Marks Office.
It seems that this also happens with the number of valid logs, which is estimated to 5,5 million in total.
In 2011 1,800 million Yuans would have been embarked in the concept of rights.
In another way, this means that in average each registration costs 1.280 Yuan or 160 euros.
Playing against this causes much money, as well as shows the case of German family שמחnberg.
Since more than seven years the battle group in the courts against a Chinese follower.
Although the Germans have been able to detain the illegal manufacture of self-employment vehicles,
The follower has been able to secure Chinese rights on the joynberg mark.
"We ourselves have caused this situation because the appointments are not protected in Germany", says Hanno Wentzler, President and Council Delegate of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO brand office also described the resource of the municipios.
In the following two instances, you have given the reason to joynberg, but the contrary part continues to strike today.
There's a lot of care.
The case has now reached the doors of the Supreme Court of Justice, where it is still a resolution.
Wentzler trusted in the power of addressing the question and endorsing the professionality of the courts.
However, it also states that "the procedure is extremely costly, both in money and time".
It is difficult to appreciate internal costs; the business file has had to be revised from up to a hundred years of anti-hourhood to be able to provide tests.
Five years ago, joynberg offered to the contrary a "sum of six in euros" with the aim of reaching a friendly agreement, but he didn't have success.
"I'm showing how much we care", says Wentzler.
The dangers in the External East are even threatening Europe,
specifically if the followers are ensuring the rights on non-protected marks.
So a Chinese manufacturer tried to register in Germany the joynberg name for sacktes and pig products.
Since the group left this trade area, however, has achieved prevention of the registration.
"There must have much care," said Wentzler.
As well as the Pattloch lawyer recommend German enterprises that are extremely prudent at the time to do business with China.
Not enough to trust international brand rights law, but whatever we need to do is "register in China all that may be possible to protect", such as Wentzler's point.
In contrast, the subject may be much more car than a simple record.
In fact, in the case of joynberg would lose the last stage of his particular battle, then it should be necessary to pay the contrary part of license rights for its own name, such as and as Wentzler explains.
This or in the concerned segment would take us out of the market.
World day of fight against AIDS: bailar, crying, help
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi core and Suaziland are glad by the AIDS orphans
The history of a link can be over 8,733 km of distance.
The first starts by the bathroom: cowboy boats, bathrooms, tacton sappats and mocasins are looking for the kitchen on the parking floor, and they find it quickly.
One, two, three, four.
Only then the voices of the songs are slowly high (which, lower, tenor and above), arremolining, turning down and following each other.
And Fite Hopf, the director of 29 years, threatens to come nearly from his cases by trying to order with its energy and swimming managers.
It's lunch after the late and in the music room of the Heidelberg Medical Psychology Institute the Imbongi Coro sends a new song.
The cinty singers, from 23 to 69 years, from human genestian to house love have been reached.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each core's voice has a different text and also in a very known foreign language: the sulu, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botsuana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some areas of Suziland.
Autoassistent assistance
According to UNSIDA's estimation, the United Nations programme for AIDS is about 34 million infected by HIV virus in the world.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
The SIDA has 245,000 orphans in Suziland.
More than 40% of the population is already seropositive.
The Voices Association for Africa has been found in Germany for the 180 orphans of the SIDA of the people of Estonia.
Seventeen of them attend the secondary school.
A child can be paid for 15 or 20 euros per month.
This advertisement will cover the school matricule, the uniform and will ensure you a warm food every day in the Gogo Center.
Immungi means in sulu "narrator of Historys" or "panegirist".
In this room nobody knows to speak with a flowing tongue, but they can't sing themselves.
Since ten years ago this enthusiastic core in this beautiful foreign language that in occasions it enjoys transport them to its original place: South Africa.
A 8.733 km of direct distance from Heidelberg, in the northest of the Kingdom of Suziland, there is a people called Esitäi who depends on the voices of this German core.
The 40 percent is infected
Approximately 2,000 people live there, some still in simple barrier and paja, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 have no fathers because they have paid the AIDS.
Esitsidei is a small example of what affects Suaziland: the highest SIDA infection rate and the lowerest hopes of life from the world, according to Unicef.
People do not see the circumstance with good eyes, a practice that has been demonstrated reduced half the containment risk.
More than 40% of the inhabitants of Sweden are the immunodeficiency virus, and to die with something more than thirty years has become something usual.
During a joint trip to Africa at the spring of 2005, the core discovered this renovated population, but all the things they saw were many children on the streets that were not only about the protection of their fathers, but the main: food, robes and training.
Untitled to school, the possibilities in a poor country are more than weak.
In a principle, it was only the particular commitment of a few things that could have made a child out of the college and enjoyed a warm food every day.
However, one year later, the core founded the "Voices for Africa" association, which has been professionally occupied by the AIDS orphans in Esitäi.
Acts on sexual transmission infection
What are the main sex-transmission diseases?
The ETS of bacterian origins are syfilis, clomide and gonorrea.
The ETS of most usual video origins are the SIDA, the virus of human papaloma, genetic herpes or hepatitis.
The ladles and sauna are found between the ETS transmitted by parasits.
What are the main groups of affected?
Sifilis and honorre is more often given in men who keep sexual relations with other men.
The Robert Koch Institute is part of the basis that at least four of each of the five cases of synthesis registered in Germany have their origin in a sexual contact between men.
In the case of eterosexual adults, the most usual sexual transmission diseases are the infections by clomide, tricomonas, the virus of human Papiloma, candidiasis (hongo) and the gonorrea.
The container of HIV among the country ' s erosexual adults is relatively low; however, approximately 20% of the new HIV infections are recorded in this group.
Young infections are much more usual than in other population groups.
According to European investigations, three quarters of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
In our country, the virus of human papaloma is also added to the most usual diseases between youth.
How has the number of infections evoluted?
Not all sexual transmission diseases are subject to obligatory declaration.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of synthesis infections has decreased its number of 1.697 cases in 2001 to 3.698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections remains down since 2007.
In 2011 approximately 2.700 cases were registered.
It is a tenth part less than in the previous year.
What are the symptoms shown that this is a venearly disease?
Infect diseases may cause glucose in the genital area, molestians to orinar, stream, abdominal pain, as well as ampolles or drugs.
Often they do not cause pain or cause other symptoms and therefore they do not be detected.
How can one protect?
Conservation may reduce the risk of containing, but they do not provide protection for hundreds.
Some patologic agents of sexual transmission diseases may also be transmitted through suscience and physical contact.
For this reason, experts recommend regularly subject medical reviews, especially if sexually changed.
If they are diagnosed early, most of the ETS can be healed and it is possible to avoid any later consequences.
Through cooperation, donations and, at last, not less important, the honoraries who cover the core for their actions in all Germany are reaching enough money.
"We totally sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," said the fiery Annette Lennartz, President of the Association.
In the own people Zodwa Dlamini a safe woman itself and with leading points manage the money sent from Germany.
Orfans will find a good accommodation, for example, with one of the grandfathers.
The "gogos", as named the elder women in Zulu, are the pillars of the people.
Some of them have up to 14 orphans at their charge, offer a tea where to live and take care of children to school every day and clothes with their uniforms.
Those who do not have anybody remain under the protection of Khanysyl, a solemne woman, which, as well as the two kitchens that are charged to cook every day for more than 200 hungry children, have a salary of association.
Furthermore, "English of Africa" has made a coast school, has built two galliners and, in collaboration with the United States Health Organization, has achieved that many of the people inhabitants have undertaken HIV test.
This is not an obvious thing, because, despite the patent that this disease is in all the country, it will not be spoken openly about it.
A King with 14 wifes
"The SIDA is an absolute tab," said Annette Lennartz, "for she must see with sexuality."
Something foreign in a country where the king is officially 14 wives.
The last absolute monastery of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known by its opulent life style and excess.
Poligamia instead of democracy.
This form of life not officially accepted is mostly responsible for the proliferation so fast that has experimented HIV virus in the last decades.
But it must also be given to the innumerable time returning the country on the other side and bringing him where they go.
According to Annette Lennartz, "in any kitchen you can get free conservatives, but they are still used.
It's another culture, here only accepts hair contact against hair."
In order to promote cultural exchange, the core Imbongi travels every two or three years in the south Africa by crying songs of melancolia, fighting spirit, hope and confidence in the black race, the songs that many in the southern continent still remember the time of apartity.
A full white bush that sing songs in a black language; so recognition is not only bringing an excellent environment and great joy, but has also reached a couple of laughs to somebody as another rare border soldier.
The trip brings them to Esitjeni, where cantors visit the apadrined children.
Although this small population is still appeared in the maps, in the Ezulweni River valley is very well known.
"Go to Esitjeni, there lights the light," said the people of the place.
And after reaching 8733 km on line right back to Heidelberg to the trial rooms of the Bergheimer street full of cantors marking the step, one is recognized that you can also see its light from there.
Messenger: NASA discovered glass in Mercurio
The sonda Messenger has found evidence of the ice existence in Mercurio.
The ice box probably has a mirror of up to 20 metres.
NASA, the North American Space Agency, has produced tests of the existence of ice in Mercurio.
Despite being treated by the nearest planet, there is also heat water, such as it is released from three studies published by Thursday in the specialized "Science" magazine.
The sond Messenger would have found evidence that in the planet area, which is permanently located in the shadow, has been formed a glass box.
It seems that it has at least 30 centimeters and probably even up to 20 meters of spessor.
Water is preumbly of comtes or, with great probability, asteroids that in his day stripped against Mercurio.
Nobody mentions the ice foundation with the possibility of living in the planet, confirms the researcher head of the song Messenger, Sean Solomon.
The temperature in Mercurio can reach up to 426 centimeters.
However, the findings could help to tell how water and other living components have arrived in other areas of the sun system.
It is completely inverted to the inhabitants of the Earth, songs, telescopes and small robots such as Phoenix are dedicated to study the depths of the universe.

This section of an infrared image taken by the telescopio Spitzer shows a "famy triite" in which infinite generations of stars appear: the oldest stars are shown as a blue points, although the hardest to recognize is the red color of the stars "received".
This star training region, named by the W5 scientists, was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the Casiopea constellation, at a 6,500-year distance.

The image published by the European Observatory of Australia shows the Nebulous Trifida situated at several thousands of light years in the design of Sagitario.
The Trifida name is the Latin term "trifidus" (divised in three), since one of the dark powder lines divide the heart of this outer training area in three lobbles.

In this galaxie's so brilliant with a small black hair yet there is no powder, only gas.
Researchers suggest that it was little formed after the great fear, when in the universe could be found over all hydrogen.
Our window to the universe: the most important telescopes
It seems that the telescope was found by Hans Lipperhey in 1608, before Galilei uses him a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the views of the optical telescopes have not stopped growing and the images that offer us have always more deep.
During 30 years, particularly from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope located in the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest world.
His speed, on the image, had a diameter of five metres.
In Arizona, the U.S. Large Binocular Telescope is raised.
This allows the cosm to observe through two speeds, each with a diameter of 8,4 metres.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias located in La Palma is large - only the speed has a diameter of 10,4 metres.
The Southern African Large Telescope spectrum in South Africa is settled for costs.
Unfortunately, reach a diameter approximately once metres.
The inconvenent of this more economic construction is that the telescope has a fixed highness angle, so its mobility is limited.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Tejas also has a fixed highlight.
Its speciality is its huge capacity to gather light.
Although it is a diameter of spectrum comparatively smaller, this capacity is balanced to the world's larger telescopes.
With the help of the Arecibo radiotelecopium (Puerto Rico) researchers can investigate the universe in search for extraterrestreal life signs.
The radioscopy has a diameter of 305 metres.
In the "Building of Extraterrestre Intelligence" (ESTI by its English styles) you can help any person who has a computer with a processing capacity.
View of the Australian European Observatory (ESO) located in the Chinese Andes.
Here the Very Large Telescope is raised, a telescope that honors its name.
With a total of four species, this telescope can also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.
The ESO will also join the named E-ELT (European Extremely Large Telescope or European Telescope extremely large).
Its primary spectrum will cover 42 metres and will be composed of a total of 1.000 reflecting elements.
Until 2018 you don't expect to get images.
Before 2007, the two telescopes Keck situated in the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the most larger in the world.
These are two speeds, each of them with a diameter of 10 metres.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which is nearly studying the sky with the support of the Sub-Subaru and IRTTF.
In Mauna Kea is planned to build a new telescope of large proportions and with a diameter of thirty metres.
This is a picture of how it would be.
However, the most important information of the cosmos arrives on us from the hand of the Hubble space telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he sent images from far-related worlds.
Since March 2009 the Space Telescope Kepler is looking for extrasolar planetes, mainly those living.
On 2 February 2011, NASA announced that 1,235 planet candidates had been placed since the start of its mission.
The image is seen the latest preparations before launching the space telescope Kepler.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) telescope will not be launched at the space of a Ariane cohete 5 to 2018.
The primary spectrum of this space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the functions of this telescope will find the light of the first stars and galaxies formed after the big smoke.
Researchers are based on the south pool of Mercurio also has ice.
However, there are no feasibility tests because the sond Messenger turns around the planet in a lot more closer than the north pool.
Since ten years the radar measurements look at the existence of ice in Mercurio.
Thanks to the sonda Messenger (2004), the first orbiting towards Mercurio, the scientists now have the certainty that it is.

The landscape from the Talish mountain region could be calculated by red and romantic salvation.
The Minibús advanced with a great strike through the green road passing on the side of forest hills, the rivers of the big caudal and the swimming houses of the local herds.
Everything is green and juice, one might even think that he is in the Black Selva.
However, we met in the southern area of Azerbaijan; from here the border with Iran is just a few kilometers.
Here are the "talyshi", a people who don't know so much, except they are perfectly dominant with the pers and the azerism and are very long.
Our final destination is Lerik.
This small city presumption of a architectur may be too small designed in the soviet era and that it doesn't seem to be caught in a so painting mountain countryside.
The European tourists are still coming to this place, since the way from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is too weak.
To recover the 323 km separated both urban numbers, eight hours are needed because the road is only one sense.
The rich amusement of which the country enjoys thanks to the Caspio sea petroleum has not yet arrived in this renovated region.
However, Pilata Falatayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has something to have to become a tourist attraction.
"Baku was known in May because of the festival of the Euroviation Festival and the next year we will celebrate the Festival of the most older people in the world", says Fassayeva.
This is the director of the Longeviity Museum, perhaps the only one that exists in the world.
Here is the eight-12-day life of Talyshis of the place they have over 100 years old. Falassayeva indicates a white and black image.
This is my grandmother who lived 120 years.
His son died 136 years old.
However, the insufficient star of the museum is the Seral sheep pastor of Muslümov, which seems to have lived 168 years.
However, there is no birth game that certifies it.
And if we realize that the man of older age had lived 122 years, it seems that the age of Mussolmov is quite suspected.
"He was born in the region in 1805, and died in 1973," the Fassayeva explains us.
The man was married in three occasions and had 23 children. It appeared that he was still time to conceal a daughter more than 136 years old.
Did you then mistake Serali Mussolmov in your age in a couple of tens?
However, Rembrandt Schoolz, geolog in the Max Planck Institute of Rostock, has also heard talk about the advanced age of this inhabitant of Central Asia.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza valley in Pakistan also lives very advanced persons," says Schoolz, "including Clara there are many larger men."
Since the lack of documentation, it is impossible to provide scientific tests about age; maximum if there is no civil registration.
All the days full of dishwasher swimming pocket
It is a fact that, often often frequently, the inhabitants of the region situated in Lerik is still reaching a Bible age.
There are now 20 persons who are over 100 years old.
Why are people living here in the south, a lot of advanced ages?
The azerí tourist leader Farid Mugimzadeh explains that this is the special genes of the Talyshis.
The director of the museum, Mrs Fassayeva, believes in a change that the cause is in food.
However, from a nutritional point of view, it is not logical that exactly the ric food in calorities of the Talyshi, which worship the flesh, bread and all milk products, and many of which also drink a daily disappeared vessel, may be so healthable.
Or may it be the form of natural life that keeps young people? In Collegiran, a small apartment not far from the city of Lerik lives Rubaba Mizayeva.
At its 97 years, youth is relatively young for those latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who states having 143 descendants, lives in a simple tree house of typical trees throughout the Caucaso region.
Sitting on the ground, it moves in lovefully a huge manna.
Eight people live under a teeth, among them one of the children and a daughter of Mirzayeva, both became a grandfather ago.
They also spend on the other two little children.
In the kitchen, the tea is prepared for inviteds, a tea served in a typical vessel with a bombed form.
Mirzayeva's depths are white and are perfectly aligned and under the nickel hides two lengths of dark red hair that his son discoveres us fiery.
I always washed my hair with milk, so he never fell down and kept his colour.
"I never used a campus," said Mirzayeva.
Pension is enough to live
It was always eating only what he produced in his own grandfather: tomats, patates and guests.
In all my life, I've never gone to buy a supermercador.
Then he talked to us about his husband, who was in the army.
The worse time was after the Second World War.
However, everything returned to his caution when the "request father," Heydar Aliyew took the situation control.
This kind of propaganda sounds rarely in the mouth of a greater woman.
However, in Azerbaijan the worship of the fatherly figure of the nation, which leads its country as a dictator, does not know limits.
This remained in power until 2003, a moment in which the Witness to his son Eliham was moved.
At least the elderly people in Azerbaijan do not know what the poverty is.
Mirzayeva cobra 230 manat (approximately the same amount in euros) in a monthly pension concept, a amount with which you can live well taking into account the situation here.
And perhaps the son of Mirzayeva has reason: "In our culture the elders are very respected."
They live in a great family, are loved, they receive all the needed care and are happy.
As if this was not enough reason to keep life for many years...
The Constitution lacks the expression " Human Rights"
The revolution returned to Cairo.
Manifestations for each other in the Cairo are marked by the three-party where the country is summoned.
The future constitution, with sharry as a basis, is very contravertised.
The President of Egypt did not escape in patetismo.
"We should over the transition.
And that is my responsibility to the people and God," he confirmed in public television.
His discussion was directed to all the people, especially to Christian clothes, liberals, musulmans, and seculars.
All of them, who are absent until now in a shame opposition, have fear.
Fearing a theocracy at Nilo oranges for the grace of the mighty Muslim community.
As Mohammed Mursi explains, almost asking for forgiveness, has had to be informed temporaryly the competences of the Constitutional Court and extended its "for the possibility of save the revolution".
However, neither Egypt nor the whole world know what this engineer of 61 years has a title of doctorized by the South California University will really save.
Do you take privilege of his power to the Judicial?
In fact, the articles 234 whose approval has been established by a representative meeting, which has been made by 100 members predominantly islamists at a night meeting of 15 hours of sustainment, are really concerned.
As in previous constitutions, the borrower also says that jurisprudence is based on the " Principles of Islamic Law".
But what does that mean of "Princes"?
This was and remained open to interpretation and it seems that islamists will use this vague formulation, as well as the margin of legal manager that appears, to impose a more close interpretation of the sharp.
This is at least what we suggest a new article added: in all issues relating to the sharri is obligation to consult Al-Ashar University, the most important Islamic institution of the country with a great power throughout the sunism.
It doesn't have to be so, but this may mean that the clerus would control legislation, something that - actually - would have as a result of the incapacity of the jurisdiction.
Most part of the removal of the constitution is open to interpretation
What also results in the problem is that it seeks to maintain military jurisdiction.
During Mubarak's dictatorship, these courts served to exercise a hard repression on the opposition.
After the decree to 11.000 civilians were detained in military prisons.
As the borrower states, the State must protect "the true existence of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its moral and values".
It is so imprecible in legal terms that the State institutions could also control the contents of cinemagraphy and literature with this article.
I'm clear that it's nothing else than censure.
Actually, no article provides explicit equality between men and women.
In change, another proceeds to offer or oppress the prophecy Mohammed and its licenses.
However, there is no clear what is an offence and how to be sanctified.
Another doubt is the formulation which prevents the "protection of people"
Is it enough to load a president or a kit on a reader?
Question of interpretation, as many other things in the removal which has been submitted to Mursi for its signing and that, according to its words, "My soon" will be submitted to the Egyptians to be submitted to referendum.
"Revolution has returned"
Vor weeks the opposition is closed to the top of the islamists.
10 thousand people gathered together in an unusual armony afternoon in the Cayrir plate and swore to break the Act before they could enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will end over," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who takes the third place on the lists to the presidency elections.
The Nobel of the Peace and Ex-director of the International Agency for Atomic Energy, Mohamed El-Baradei, declared that the borrower of the constitution should be "in the cube of the ground of the history."
By Twitter, he accused Mursi's followers that he wanted to lead a "style of state against democracy".
"When I convey the referendum we'll go to his palace and we'll throw it," the Emperor Jasser Said said.
"And we are not stolen, the blood of our brothers has not yet been expensed," said Egyptians, "the political opositor Caled Ali.
And several judges declared that they wouldn't want to oversee the referendum, so that it would not be considered valid.
"The Coran is our constitution."
For its part, the Muslim community had well organized an appeal to celebrate contra-mantifiation; for if he was not at Tahrir place, but after prayer on the other side of Nilo, to the University of the Cairo.
Many women covered with a vessel and participation of the Salapists took part in the same cry of "The people requires the application of God's law."
They demanded Mursi "removing the country," at the same time they proclaimed: "The Coran is our constitution."
A fight for the sovereignty of the symbolic plate Tahrir, where everything began, would cause similar situation to a civil war.
It is clear that the Mursi Chairpersons didn't want to wake up that something would happen like this.
Muslim brothers stated that both those who were opposed the restore of the constitution and the parties of the same would express their high and clear views.
Now it would have been the time to let the people decide in the urines which the country should follow.
In this respect, it seems that the removal of islamists has guaranteed most.
"The expression 'Society Rights' doesn't even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angerous with this strengthened constitutional process that should actually have been long until February and have included all social forces.
This 48-year-old specialized lawyer on human rights and President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) defended musulman brothers when they were retained in prison or had to be sentenced during Mubarak dictatorship.
Not because it shares his ideology, but because human rights are invisible for him.
For this reason, it was condemned and encountered.
"And now the expression " Human Rights" does not even appear in the new constitution," he lamented in a conversation with the "Welt am Sunday".
The extension of Mursi's competence to the three powers of the State made that the lawyer would be renumbered.
The measures taken are flagrant violations of the regulations of the democratic game and will be brought to Egypt to a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, what the President has done is to abolish it," said Saeda.
However, democracy cannot work without civil society organizations.
Saeda is also abandoned by the international community, which observes the ideological fight that is located at Nilo's horns with a curiosity and tension mixture.
This could be back on your face.
A manifestist on the Tahrir plate warns: "You're a monster that you can't control."
The Norway Rafisk: the worst fish in the world?
The five million people in Norway enjoy one of the highest levels of life, not only from Europe but from the world.
Is it possible that the success of the country should keep some relationship with its appearance by a very bad fishery?
Take a series of extremely cured cells.
Collecte them in the middle of a swift and thumbnail mount.
Let him a week there.
Then you can oil the paralizant aroma of the racfisk, one of Norway's exquisite.
I find me in the small city of Fagernes, about three hours in Oslo.
The landscape is spectacular and that oil, always present, flowing in the air.
Rafisk is a rrafphisk in salon that leaves to ferment in water during, depending on the badly you'll prefy it up to a year.
As he cares and is going to do more fresh, the Norwegians take up tropal to a festival that is celebrated here in Fagernes, dedicated to this manager more than that, therefore, to say that, a prisoner.
"It's like a crowd and then drinks a trago waterwide," says Havard Halvarsen, a bomber of the city, which is also known as the "General of Rakfisk", who is responsible for organizing the festival.
All sides we see people eating this fishing fish that is watching in small cubes and drinking of an important traffic of drinking.
"On some people like the watervit more than the racfisk," said Havard.
The drink can kill oil.
I'll try some troops.
If you can avoid it near the narz, it's not bad; it's not very different to a portion of theirs that has recovered a few kilometres in autobus.
Rafisk is a product that comes from a very different epoca, in which Norwegian poverty had shot and, before he was refrigered, the fishermen was stored during the water and salt in hermic barriers.
Later, in full winter, when it is well fermented, it is cut and, apparently with the inactive senses because of alcohol, it is eaten.
Before a generation, thousands of Norways have been seen to leave their country in search for work, and they have primarily emigrated to the United States.
Currently, the population is fast increased; more than 13% are immigrants, accompanied by the abundance of jobs, high wages and a full social services system.
A court of residents in Sweden, the old rival and even not too rich than Norway, comes to this country to work.
Rafisk is considered something important, a essential part, even though quite bad, from the past of Norway.
It is located between the most sweet plates that can be bought.
But, actually, it's lovely. A brain kit or a sandwich cut you 10€ ($14) everybody.
Norway is not likely to appear in the agenda of international news and the majority of Norways like it.
Here people are still little ready to proclaim the name of Anders Brevik, the extreme right racist who wrote to the thresholds and killed 77 people, including men, women and children.
Instead, the tiroteo refers to "the success of 22 July".
The Norways are very concerned to believe that one of the ones of the ones were able to make such cruel and murder.
After many of the current riches in Norway, growth is found since the 70s, of one of the largest petroleum and gas industrys in the world.
"But we're not the only reason why we're going so good," said Anna, our camara, while we're going through rafisk bands and that, with its long milk milk and sore eyes, it represents the image of the Norway welfare.
"We are, as you said, prudent people."
His English, as the majority of people in this country, is imposable.
"We don't like watching, we don't like the attention."
Norway has managed its oil with a great career, but only a small percentage of money from this industry has been made in a special fund for future generations.
While everyone missed money that hadn't had over the years before the financial crisis around the world, Norway had well closed the bill.
"We can smoke in winter and senderism in summer, we're content", says Anna.
"Y eat racfisk," adds with a disgusting card.
I'm in the snow to eat something; I've already had enough raffixk.
Now a hamburguese of olives is unfortunately something different and quite sad that to know.
But at night, this bad fish returns.
The hotel in which I live is one of the many places in which a racfisk dinner is celebrated in which the comments vote the best fish, or perhaps the most wearing feeds.
A television has been connected directly with a pajaritar who takes and is red of rafisk plates.
It looks like the Euroviation Concours.
"What are your points for the best fish there on the mountains, Thor-Jurgen?"
"There's our pointing, Havard."
There's weeping and pleasure.
A man falls out of the scene, perhaps winning through the waterway.
Or may be the vapores of all that fish.
Mexico: Enrique Peña Nieto is equipped with a hard start
While the President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Neo, is prepared to take possession of its charge, the respondent of the BBC, Will Grant, will analyse the challenges that the new President and the various expectations of its population will be affected.
Trade in Mexico is now particularly bad.
In a city that, in the best circumstances, has already been congestioned, has been installed a stair pocket that shorts several of the main roads that lead to the city and causes a huge pit on the roads.
The objective, however, was not to prevent the workers to reach their work place, but to avoid demonstrators to reach the parliament.
On the Sabbath, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Neo, will receive the presidency band and assume the country management.
It is compliant to a complicated task.
Mexico has reached good economic results during the outcoming government of Felipe Calderon, but the country is enriched in a war against narcotrate that has already been covered by about 60,000 lives in six years.
"My Government has a great commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Mr. Peña Neo explained at the beginning of this week to the President of the United States, Barack Obama, in the Oval Dispacho.
"I will propose a new security strategy that will allow us to achieve this goal."
Before coded with the President of the United States, Mr. Peña was the previous political experience of his birth state, Mexico.
A very populous state and with a fast growth, which runs the capital; views on the new leader are divided in this territory where he would be moved.
A sincere man
In the Bravo Valley city, for example, it is remembered with love.
His residents admit to him the merit of the growth of tourism in the place and the construction of infrastructures.
To come to the city, one of the new ways of Mr. Peña Neo can be conducted by Mr. Neo, which offers a huge improvement compared with the agricultural and full of baths rehabilitated.
It can also be seen places with your name in the entry of a modern polydeport and an interactive museum on climate change.
"We believe that he is able to make a real and long-term change," said his friend and friend of political Gabriel Olvera Hernández, deputy of Mr. Peña Neo, the PRI.
"Particularly, as regards security and economy, we hope the interesting and true change that our country is so needed."
After an interrupted period of 81 years in power, the PRI was released by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Deputy Olvera admits that, after 12 years outside the presidency of Los Pinos, there are many expectations in the party concerning Enrique Peña Nieto.
It also refuses the calculation that the opposition lacks the new President.
"It's a very sincere, very depressed man and with an excellent vision of the country.
He's a fantastic man of state, and, above all, is a person who knows listening."
However, on the other side of the state that is not the impression that he has many people about his old ruler.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as city Neza, the contrast with the polluted roads of Bravo Valley could not be greater.
In many senses, a suburb of the Mexican city is hidden under high self-pest trays.
And the problems of the municipality are also hard and urban.
At the beginning of this year, military intervention was requested to help combat drug bands operating in barriers and violence against women is particularly serious.
In a desertic trip, located near a basket, only in the past two years, the bodys of 12 murdered women have been left.
More than 1.000 women were murdered in the Mexico state, while Mr. Peña Neo was the Governor, a higher rate than the city of Juárez, unfortunately recognized by their violence and a place that is synonym of murder of innocent women.
Mr Peña Nieto's criticians say, in best cases, that I didn't want to address the problem of feminine while he was in charge.
The most critical accused of their administration to make a red view.
In an hormigon house, a kind of barried deterioration, Irina Buendia needs to make efforts to contain the laughters while she shows me photographs of her falling daughter, Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the facts, Mariana had been pursued in 2010.
However, her family believes that her couple killed her.
"When I came to her house, it seemed like if they had cleaned him the body," remembers Ms. Buendia.
"There had signs that he had been slain and the rigor had already appeared."
When his mother tells the story, a photograph of Maryna observes from the walls, close to a cross in which one word is read: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family says.
"The state authorities have treated me as if it was an old chismose, a chessy, a chessy.
What they want is that one simply accepts what they say and calls for."
"But this can't be like that when they have been so much irregularity and so density," he states.
The presidency that President Peña Neo will receive the sabbath will come with a great responsibility.
Decades of thousands of families have been affected by violent crimes in Mexico over the past six years, and the new President has promised to give them priority during its mandate.
"I hope it is the same man who was the president when he was manager," said the Olympic Olympic PRI in Bravo Valle.
However, this is just what the families of the victims of the Nezza city are more afraid.
Bradley Manning did not denied bad treatments according to the taxes
The fiscals are trying to address Bradley Manning's complaints during their stay in prison
The judgment focuses on the period of Manning in the military prison of Quantico in Virginia
Defense wants the case to be deemed based on maning's incarcelation was severe.
The army soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidence documents.
The fiscals tried to demonstrate the Friday that Bradley Manning soldier, accused of the greatest confidence filtering in the history of the United States, lost many opportunities to declare the bad treaties that had now been suffered while he was found under military detention.
During the questionnaire that the fiscality made Manning in a view before the judgment in Ft. Meade, Maryland, the fiscal Commander Ashden Fein confirmed that the registers of the week visits of the Unity's officers received for nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia did not show any statement on the treaty.
The questionnaire, who was carried out during a view carried out by the request of the defence request that the case was dismissed, had been hard and that it had already been sufficient punishment, came a day after Manning had tested that he had thought to be murdered while he was detained.
The military intelligence analysis, arrested in June 2010, is accused of run thousands of confidence documents while he was in Iraq.
Later, WikiLeaks published the material in the Internet.
WikiLeaks never confirmed maning outside the source of information.
In view of the Friday, Fein revised the formulariors that the officers had filled after visits to Manning during his arrest in the Military prison of Quantico, where he was entailed in a maximum republication regime from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials would have made questions to Manning and announced their responses.
When the Saturday Fein asked about the formulators, Manning recognized that he had calculated the treatment that the clusters gave him as "except" and the treatment received in the installations in general as "My professional".
Formulators do not show any complaints of bad treatment, although the officials asked Manning directly about the treatment he received, Fein confirmed.
Maning said that he had expressed concern about some issues and that the officers who had visited him had spoken of these problems and had indicated him that they would be treated, but they did not leave these matters in the register.
"There wrote without implications" (although they had spoken about the problems) but it does not necessarily mean that I hadn't mentioned any problem," said Manning.
The judge, Coronel of the Army Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he didn't declare the treatment he had received during the meeting held in January 2011 with a Council responsible for considering the intentions of the suicidio expressed in a form before.
Maning said that during that meeting it was the reduction of the "prevention of lessons" regime under which it was found.
The military stated that it had been placed under that restrictive regime, which is a level of monitoring for possible suicide to ensure their protection and security of others.
"I wanted the greatest state to know that I was well and (I want) to leave under prevention of lessons... to enjoy what, from my point of view, is a better life quality," said Manning.
Maning testified the Thursday of his arrest in Iraq and its transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for almost two months before being transferred to the military prison on the basis of the marines in Quantico, Virginia, July 2010.
He said he was considering suicide in Kuwait and at a time he lost knowledge because of warming.
He said that the fact that you wouldn't allow you to know what was going on or what happened in the outer world was very angive.
"My world was just going to the campsite Arafjon, at that jaula," said Manning the Thursday.
"I thought I would die in that jacket."
Maning said that once transferred to Quantico, most days in a small cell, at least 21 hours and often, without company.
Manning said it would only be allowed to have a colon, a slope, a chanker, something of clothes and his legs.
He explained that he tried to move all the time, since he was prohibited to sleep or even to touch on the day.
Maning confirmed that he always had a light coming out of there, looking at his eyes while he sleeped.
He said that if the clusters couldn't see the face when he turned back over the night, they deployed him in order to turn back.
Maning lawyer introduced a formal claim on the treatment received by Manning in January 2011.
Maning was transferred to the military prison of Fort Leavenworth in Kansas in April 2011.
On Thursday, the judge asked Manning about a complaint that had been made in the Thursday declaration, which, after being bound by a night to sleep in his quarter cell, it was obliged to stay dismissed in front of the cells and other prisoners.
Manning had tested that never had been given him the opportunity to cover him during the receipt.
During the judge's questionnaire on Saturday, Manning said he left him for the order he gave him the clothes that he had to put the clothes to fall with which he could have been covered, but he recognized that nobody had commanded him to fall.
Maning testified the Thursday that he had ought to sleep the previous night because of an attempt to demonstrate a officer that he would not have a danger for himself.
Manning confirmed that she had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his internal clothes or songs to self-elected but that he didn't have done it.
Maning tested that that night they had taken away from his cell's internal clothes, her chankers and her legs.
Your lawyers have hope that the judge will at least take into account the experiences in which it has been held during his stay in prison and will drought its sentence in case of being condemned in the war Council, which is intended to start at the beginning of the year coming.
The defence confirmed that Manning had been planned to make a fault of minor crimes and to defend other accuses considered too extremely.
The view is expected to resume this week end and expected taxes argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
Pentagon has stressed that Manning was kept in accordance with the application rules for any detention found under maximum custodian in Quantico.
Maning charges include cooperation with the enemy, illegally provocing the publication of information on the Internet, the filtering of information of national defence and the maintenance and public registry.
If the accused of all charges is declared, it could be infringed to a perpetual chain.
My Mexican identity crisis
Acknowledged that many were obligation to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities.
Mexicans have to criticize those who were going; says they remember the mexicans of those difficult times.
Navarrette comments that the Mexican-Estado USA are attracted between two worlds.
In a recent trip to Mexico, he was fallen by the explained and came to the immigration transmission zone and had already been totally confused.
One card showed the way towards two balls: one for "Mexicanos" and one for "Externals".
I stayed there a few seconds without be sure to where I had to go.
When I grew up in Central California, my whole life called me "mexican".
It is an ethnic taquigraphy, as my friends of Boston relate to themselves as "Irish" or my friends of New York are calming themselves "italians".
I've decided by "mexicano-estadoidens".
But this was Mexico.
And, in my grandmother's father, taquigraphy or guides were not necessary.
It was simplely American.
I'm Spanish, it's well enough to manage me during an interview in this language.
But I don't have the vocabulary level of a birth and I can't leave my hundred of American.
So I took my United States passport and put me into the school of foreigners.
I thought at that moment of this week in which the elector President of Mexico, Enrique Peña Neo, visited the White House to meet the President Obama.
At the agenda, as the leaders of these two countries were gathered, it was: immigration, drugs and trade.
Peña Neo was wishing to speak also about the growth of the Mexico economy, one of the reasons why it is so likely that a Mexico remains in Mexico as it comes to go to the United States.
It wants to be connected with the United States and Canada and to create a commercial block in North America to the style of the European Union.
Moreover, Peña Neo promised to continue to fight the drug cartels in Mexico, although he didn’t give details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and is full of recruitment.
The majority of the United States has probably never been remembered that in 1848 the United States had invaded Mexico and forced their leaders to cease half of their territory at guns.
But for the mexicans, who think in centuries, not in minutes, the elements that are remembered are everywhere.
So, at the time that a United States official says everything that congratulates the least critical to Mexico, you start to hear plains, both in the press, and between the Mexican election, on how the United States are using the sovereignty of their neighbours.
And the children of Moctzuma stand war.
And even so, for Mexico, the relationship that actually suggests all a challenge is that they have with the more than 35 million Mexico and the United States living in the United States.
Did we get back?
There's a lot.
In Mexico there are winners and losers, people for which the country provides opportunities and others for which it is not so.
The only reason why there are many people of mexican venue living in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is that, in some point of our genealogy tree, there was a person, the father or mother or one of the grandma, which was closed the door of the opportunities in Mexico and had to go toward the north.
And most of the times that person was caught in a certain profile: dark hair, a level of underlying studies, coming from a poor people, etc.
We're their seeds and we're the loyal.
Not to Mexico.
And, although we might have lived now the American dream, when we went to good schools and had good work, we can never lose see what we live is, the American dream, and not the mexican.
It is possible that sometimes our identity is not clear, but our loyalty itself is.
It's for the United States.
Furthermore, we are aware that many of the mexicans belonging to the election of the leading class we do not like them.
The feeling is mutual.
You look at us as a memory of a humble throat and look at us on the top of the hot as if we were from a lower category that is not sufficiently mexican.
Our Spanish will never be enough good and our sides with Mexico will never be sufficiently strong.
In his way to see, our existence is synonym of fracase.
If our families hadn't hurt in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And now we wouldn't be attrayed after this sedy corner, living well in the United States but, still, as usual souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara, came legally to the United States when he was a girl, remember that there is a rock between the Mexico and the Mexicon-Stadian Americans, because the first ones know with more solidity they are and at the seconds this mourns them.
Although it is a citizen of the United States, it is part of the two countries.
While soon, many mexican-estounidens I know feel that they are not part of any of the two.
We like to listen to the Mexican group Les Tigre del North, but also to Bruce Springsteen.
You have the best of each country, but you're not kicked to no one of them.
In Mexico, we're in the United States.
And in the United States we are considered mexicans.
Now, to complicate even more things, so I learned during my trip, some mexican leaders and some intelligents want to connect again with the diaspore.
They want mexican-Stadian Americans to work as an unprovised "ambassadors" of Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We would say to our United States partners the fantastic thing that is to visit this country and we would press the political leaders to strengthen them with Mexico.
Yeah, it's clear.
That's not going to happen.
There's too much relax.
And, with the desiguality of salaries, galopant corruption and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that it is an fantastic country.
I'm afraid you're gonna stay alone with this idea, friends.
It's right.
If some Mexicans are not yet prepared to forgive the United States for the way they treated to Mexico a half and a century ago, then they need to accept the fact that some Mexico-Stadian Americans are still reconsented by how they have been treated to their families a lot of time ago.
Hmmmm.
Maybe we were more "mexics" than I thought.
Visa battles, New Middle East
The high fire between Israel and Hamas could well be a little likely basis for peace
Can there be a long peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood destruction seems to indicate that any hope is in vain.
In the middle of the inusual and usual discussions on whom first began, the mountains of buildings have remained reduced to schools; more than 140 Palestinians, most of their civilians, and six Israelites have been killed and, firstly, the missionaries from Gaza have falled near Tel Aviv, the metropolis of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, despite Israeli and Palestinians, they seem to be bound in their former conflict, as well as rode is changed in the Middle East.
The Arab primary spring left it all painful facts, whether not, Palestinians and Israelians have remained attracted in the regional alboroto.
Maybe this makes your fight more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons for thinking that the dead point could be discovered.
A war that doesn't be paid nor winned
At first, optimism seems to be very difficult to justify.
Even if the high fire agreed on 21 November, the confusions of this week have been strengthened in both bands.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has gone by Gaza since 2007, will confirm the Israelites have been bound to remove, although Gaza has received a good Palestinian.
And although he had killed some of his leaders and put on pressure at 1,7 million in Gaza in one of the most misfortunate and populary rinonces of the planet, Israel has not been able to end with Hamas.
Actually, Hamas has a land in Cisjordania, the other part of Palestinian currently ruled by its implacable rivals of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian faction.
Furthermore, the leaders of Hamas could reach the conclusion that time plays for their favour.
Since the islamists have gone over the Arab world, Hamas has made rich and powerful friendships.
Turkey, a renaissance of the regional power which had been the most closer musulman friend of Israel, has opened the cause of Hamas. It also did Qatar, one of the rich and dynamic states in the Golf.
The joyful members of Hamas say that the average islamist month is around Israel, from Lebanon to the north, where the Hizbula Military Partie, passed through Syria, where the rebels of a more Islamist tension could move to Bashar Assad, until they come to Jordan, where Hamas's neighbourhood is threatening the king.
In particular in the southern flow of Israel, the growth of the muscle brothers directed by President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the Lake Delivery who ruled in Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had no longer time for Hamas.
Instead, the Muslim brothers are the first brothers of Hamas and their leaders depending on the popular opinion.
In future diplomatic actions, Hamas may be overcome as a protagonist that cannot be excluded, not even Israel and the United States.
During many times, Israel’s hard wing will bring the contrary conclusion.
As regards the military question, they have put Hamas on his place.
The Israel ' s Anti-military Society System has demonstrated its effectiveness and many of Hamas' missions have been destroyed.
The Israelites will sleep quiet for some time.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States are more strong than ever; many European countries also have caused Hamas to have started the last olive of violence.
First of all, Israel has prospered. Specially under the government of Benjamín Netanyahu, a first minister who has noted the peace process widely.
Although the disappeared cohetes from Gaza have ended with the lives of about 30 Israel since 2004, Israel has not had too many suicided terrorists, partly from the barrier that Cisjordia runs, the main legend of a territory to become Palestinian, and protect the Jewish destinations that continue to increase, despite that, according to international legislation, they are illegal.
Mr Netanyahu, whose game Likud has joined a group of a line even more hard leaded by Avigdor Lieberman during the period prior to elections on 22 January, is in a good position.
Why are these Palestinian returned by giving them a own state?
If they really rule in Cisjordania, wouldn't they disappear coats and how their partners have done in Gaza?
It's better to have them after that wall and to give them a good strike if they rise up your head.
Maybe the hard wing may be put, although the Arab primary could change its calculations.
Although the islamists who take the power in Egypt and in other places do not have too much appreciation to Israel, their priority will be addressing internal difficulties.
Israel ' s Defence budget is greater than its four Arab neighbours together.
Starting war with the superpotence of the area will hardly help new Arab governments to improve their economy.
That the pragmatic Mr. Morsi has been working with Barack Obama to get the high fire is a good surrounding and could mark the start of something.
The Israelites should also think long-term.
With the rest of the Arab world, turning more democracy, the Palestinians of their right to self-determination proposed a dust that one day will operate in the occupied territorys of Israel, in the same way that this week has spent a bus in Tel Aviv.
The repression is already threatening democracy in the Jewish state and demography implies the situation as far as the Arab population grows.
The missions against Gaza every two or three years to reject Hamas will pay an increasing diplomatic worst.
Both bands need an impoverition of people for the conflict.
The solution continues to be the fact that the feelings of both bands, most of the outer world and this period: two states and territorial cesion by Israel for security reasons.
The hope, small at a short time, is that the high fire gives a little more impuls to the foreign people who are fighting for this cause.
Egypt, which must begin to strike in the entrance of weapons in Gaza, together with Turkey and Qatar, is found in an unprecedented situation to convince Hamas that it accepts the idea of a Jewish state based on the borders of 1967, with land exchange and a shared Jerusalem.
Arabs also should press Hamas and Fatah to join them.
This would contribute to the creation of a Palestinian state than the imminent attempt to obtain a virtual status category in the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has an important role in bringing Israel to the negotiation table.
During his first mandate, he killed to present his own plan for peace.
Again, in the White House, it seems like heavy to dedicate his attention.
This approach offers a deployable vision of future.
A Middle East is vital interest for the United States.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and Palestinian.
The general tabaking law enters into force in Australia
Warnings on the risks of fuming and the parts of the body with diseases lighting a green color hazard, which are the same for all tabak marks
Australian Law on Tobacco and Generic Law in the world, pioneer, enters into force and replaces the logs and the colours of the marks by an enlightenment of a green oil disappearing, an explosive image of the body's parts with diseases and children and sick childs by being children of smoking parents.
Except the different images and health warnings, the only difference between the chalets, binding from the sabbath day, are the names of the brands, all of them printed in a small source.
It is the most stretch regime of the world applianced to the tabac acquired.
The Federal Government of Australia claims that the goal is to move youths to smoke through the elimination of races that make this housing a glamour.
He trusted in studies showing that if a person has never started fuming before 26 years, there is a 99% of opportunities that never do.
"You can see that children, even from very early age, understand the message that the tabacal company is trying to sell through their brand," said the Federal Health Service, Tanya Mehrberse, circled studies that they showed, for example, how girls related to the logo of a crown with the idea of being a prinses.
Although Australia is taking into account one of the lower smoke rates in the world and that these changes will not be too affected by the benefits of the multinationals, other countries are considered to take similar measures.
Tobacco industry has earned a huge pressure against law.
Tobacco firms stated that the law would promote the black tobacco market, where the cigarettes would be more barried and accessible.
"The legislation will cause serious involuntary consequences," said Scott McIntyre, from British American Tobacco, Australia.
It will increase the amount of tabaks that will bring the false certificates from China and Indonesia to sell it on the streets of Australia.
Others say that their business has been benefited after the adoption of the law.
Sandra Ha, from Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, confirmed that the demand of silver platforms and clothes to cut off the disagradable images of the cartels had been cut off almost two months ago, when British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco lost the law in the Supreme Court of Australia.
Mrs. She stated that Zico had sold up to 6,000 units to major institutions and had been waiting for more existing.
"For us, it's a good business."
According to experts, the possible obstacle is the popularity of social networks between the demographic sector directed by the plan.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting the publicity in the television and sport carriage and the majority of vendors to not put them on view, the tabaco marketing has been done online.
Australia has prohibited publicity to local enterprises and sites, but you can't restrict it on foreign pages.
"If you're selling tobacco and just stay this little window to promote your products, the online space is the most convinced place in which to be", said Becky Freeman, public health researcher of Sydney University.
Freeman observed an increased comments on brands from "piece civilians" published on social network pages such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
It may be wondered whether it is just a private citizen who really loves Marlboro cigarettes and has been taken the molestian to perform a video or whether any marketing company is beyond all this.
The British American Tobacco stated that the industry focused more on the meaning of new rules than marketing.
The industry has even been paying for Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic resolved the new rules; these countries are claiming to the World Trade Organization that the trade is unfairly restricted, although no of these countries have a significant trade volume with Australia.
The WHO is likely to say a resolution average 2013.
Moreberse stated that the Government had held discussions with other countries who consider the application of similar laws on tabaking.
In 2001, Canada became the first country in the obligation to include images into the chalets.
Currently, more than 40 countries are obligations, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
In Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India is considered to apply more hard laws.
Many fuels are disagreemented in Australia.
"The photographs do not affect me.
I don't just do them."
"Count the cigarette and keep the package," says Victor El Hage while buying a package with the image of a tumor in the mouth.
"Of course, there is only a reason why I would leave fuming: for my daughter."
James Yu, the King King of the Pack center of Sydney, indicates that uniform chalets make it more complex in the future.
"Otherwise he later a hour to send a delivery; now four later," said Yu.
"The government should have totally prohibited the tab, and then, it's already, it's done, and we've closed the tent," said while lifting your hands up.
In a constantly connected world, it's not so bad to burn a bit
During the Thanks Day of this year, I had to take five hours in a airport because the aircraft on which we flighted had a mechanical problem and we had to wait for another aircraft.
So I had a lot of time to think about burning.
I'm not gonna lie to you.
Past a half day in a airport waiting to get a flight is quite burned, even if you have means to be contained, such as books, reviews or iPhones, without forgeting us of duty-free tents.
But there are always more academic and child development experts that elogge the goodness of the fuel.
According to them, it's good that, both we and our children, we're going to burn us once.
Absurrection is obliged to the cerebro to find interesting options and may strengthen creativity.
Since the most of us are connected to this or that screen, we do not experience the benefits that offer burning.
So, would we accept the burning?
Yeah.
And no.
But, we'll now talk about that further.
First of all, as many people, it was suggested that, now that we have more time for the ocean, the burning would be relatively recent.
But as Peter Toohey said, Cathedral of Greek History and Roman University of Calgary, in Canada, and author of the book "Boredom: A Lively History" ("The abuse, an animated story") published by Yale University Press, it is not that.
"Actually, the story of the fuel is very extensive," said he.
In Pompeya's walls there are graphics in Latin about the fuel of the I.C.
We also need to plan how to define the burning.
"The problem is that it has already been defined and discussed in very different ways," said John D. Eastwood, professor of psychology of the University of York in Ontario, Canada.
After examining public research and planning the idea of a 100 people's discussion group, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues defined the burning experience as "desear, but not able to participate in a activities that you are full".
The difference between burning and apathy is that the person doesn't do anything but wants to do it.
She notes that with the apathy there is no desire to do something.
The main experience of the fuel, stated, is "change of the attention process, linked to a low state of mind and a sense that the time is slowly passed."
Aggression can sound terriblely similar to depression.
However, professor Eastwood said that, although they can be related, people who are offended have to see the problem as a issue of environment or the world, while people who are deprived believe that the problem has them.
Sometimes we think we are burned, when what happens to us is that we have problems to concentrate.
In its study "The Unngaged Mind: Definition Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in the edition of the Perspective revised on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and its colleagues were sent to a previous experiment in which the participants heard a peak of a person who readed the article of a magazine.
Some groups listed in the room contained a television program to any volume that did not keep any relationship, others listed it with the lower volume, so that it was not possible, while the third group did not listen to the audio at any time.
The group who heard the programme with the volume showed more combustion than the other two groups; costed them to concentrate, but they were not sure why and they assigned it to the burning.
"When you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or interesting task, the change of attention may lead to abusive," said Mark J. Fenske, professor of Guelph University Neurocience in Ontario, and one of the authors of the study.
"Other side, when you're doing something smooth, as to detect defective pieces in a manufacturing line, a music that will spread you can help to not hurt you."
"Actually, we know that move or make garbages, actions that are often interpreted as a sign of burning, can actually help fighting it, because this person is physically more warning."
"The research shows that those children who are allowed to be moved to learn more and provide more information than those who are obliged to be quiet," said Professor Fenske.
We all know what to be burned at a time: a aircraft, a monoton orthoon, a particularly burned film.
But some people have more tendance to burn than others.
To help meditize it, some researchers developed a "style of fuel tension" in the 1980s.
The scale includes issues such as "multe things I have to do are repeating and monotone" and "I have so many things that are interesting me that I have no time to do all."
Stephen Vodanovich, Psychology professor of West Florida University, states that, using these scales, researchers have discovered that boys have more trend to burn more often than girls, and specifically they need more external and more different stimulation.
But, in general, youths are a group type of groups that are very easy.
In 1991, Reed Larson, professor of Human Development and Community University of Illinois, conducted a experiment in contact with 400 adolescents and their parents between seven and eight times daily by searching.
He discovered that 32 percent of adolescents said he would be burning while he was at school or doing the needs, while 23 percent said he would be burning when he was not in school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents said they would be burned.
Professor Larson said that he didn't know if the percentages of current combustion, 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he said that what he knew was that " youth is a period in which the burning raises its highest cats," because both children and adolescents are not given a great control on what they want to do.
So, back to my question of the principle: Are you good to burn?
Sometimes it is not, since we have moved to the extreme, can make us exhibition to absorpted physical risks, such as to make objects or fall in the consumption of substances as a method to fight it, such as and how the investigations shown.
On the other hand, many philosophes and writers speak of the connection between burning and creativity, according to professor Vodanovich, who has been studied this issue for more than two decades.
"The burning is how you have the brain to tell you that you should be doing another thing", says Gary Marcus, professor of psychology of the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what it is the most appropriate.
If you're burned and using that energy to touch the guitar or kitchen, it'll be satisfied.
But if you see the television, it's possible to satisfy you shortly, but not a long time.
"So, if your son is burned and gives a iPad, it's likely that it's no longer burning, but it's not going to learn to intertain himself or to dose," says Professor Fenske.
And "this capacity to dose is applied to other situations," he notes.
Your son is not just learning to intertain himself alone, but to learn to control better in other areas.
I don't think we really want to love the burning.
But we should not be too critical with him.
Our goal should be, moreover, to feel comfortable members of the constant rumor of activities and technologies.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"In our way to see, we need to burn more, but burning is a too exciting and worried desire as to relate to him with something that mixes the pen," says he.
See what people really seek a way to disconnect and enjoy a dead time.
"In a surrounding environment we are constantly superstimulated," said, "It's difficult to find ways to focus our attention when the voice stops."
Colored: No book of instructions for the new Law on Marhuana consumer
Anthony Orozco, student of 19 years in a Community and erolistist in Colorado suddenist Institute, is opposed to a criminal process for something that will soon be legal in all the state: the possession of a marihuana stone and a pipe used to fum it.
Orozco says that a September, he and some friends leaded by Lamar, in the nearby the border of Kansas, when he parked to them.
The police found the marihuana in the car and a time after Orozco received a judicial citation for drug ownership and related articles (such less than 100 US dollars) in which it was reported on the date of the judgment.
"We are treated as a criminal", says Orozco.
And what are they?
In the weeks of uncertainty following the vote in Colorado for the legalization of the tension of small marihuana for recreational use, the response in hundreds of drug-related causes is less than the law than the location.
A hundreds of less crimes for marihuana ownership are shrinking as well as in Washington state, where a similar measure was adopted.
Police departments have left to submit charges to the age of 21 years for small property, which will be legally adopted once the law has entered into force in the next weeks.
But the most conservative district taxes in Colorado have been committed to follow with the open cases for marihuana ownership and are still cited to people.
At the same time, several cities, from Denver's suburbs to the Western mountains, are voted to prevent the opening of marihuana tents recently authorized in their communities.
"All this is changed so fast that I don't know what will be next," said Daniel J. Oates, police head in Aurora, just on the east of Denver.
Whos are undertaken in Washington State regulations are also turning back to the matter.
And they are still seeking advice to establish a system of production, manufacturing, distribution and sale; all this before reaching the limit date on 1 December 2013.
They say that, for good or bad, Colorado goes before most of the states in relation to the regulation of marihuana, first with therapeutical purposes and now for recreational use.
"Could has a more regulated market, so it will be a good guide," said Brian E. Smith, ported by the Washington Alcohol Control Commission.
But Mr Smith admits that any place or system can only make suggestions on what could be done.
"There isn't a real previous one that serves us in a model," says he.
Washington's law, named I-502, enters into force on 6 December, which also leaves a year during which two waters will be disappeared, since the licensing system in that state will not yet exist, but the ownership will be legal.
Furthermore, there are some delicated mechanical issues that should be solved during that period, such as the way to maintain a balance between the requirement of the state to provide an appropriate "accessor" to the authorized marihuana and their prohibition to perform cannabis business in a radio under 300 meters of schools, parks, child play zones or child centres.
"In no way there will be more difficult to place an authorized cannabis business than in the urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," says Ben Livingston, a group of research created recently.
On 21 November, Oates, the police officer of Aurora, sent an e-mail to his police officers in which she informed that the town fiscal would leave to interfere judicial actions for lower disobedience of marihuana to more than 21 years and that the police would leave charges against those crimes "with immediate effect".
The Chief of Police Oates said they would be in charge to comply with the legislation of the city regulating the marihuana culture with therapeutical purposes and to follow trafics and drug sales.
In the area of Weld, in the north of Colorado, the district fiscal, Ken Buck, represents a more stretch vision.
After the vote, he assured that his office would continue to pursue the cases of marihuana, mainly in order to press consumers and decide to receive treatment.
At the same time, 119 persons are involved in charges for the possession of 56 fats or less of marihuana, although many of them have other charges.
"Our office has an obligation to interfere judicial actions against those lacks at the time that they have been made crime," said Mr. Buck in a statement.
The response has also been complicated in places such as the Middle Agency, where the voters refused the legalization initiative.
The Great Junction Police, the largest city of the coast, is no longer affected adults for their ownership of small amounts.
Pete Holzinger, the tax of the district, supported this decision, but also decided to not deeming any of the cases depending on the possession.
"I don't think you're losing the time by keeping the law until it changes," he confirmed.
Although 55 percent of the voters supported the measure, it was never considered to take marihuana consumption for recreational use to the government and the judicial system to be easy.
The contradictory reactions surrounding throughout the state make a marked ambiguity among officials concerning the great educational experiment in this state.
"There is a cultural barrier with the district taxes," said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer representing the accused by marihuana ownership and that it is a local office of the National Organization for the Reform of the Law on Marhua.
"They have been very long bringing people to the courts who, in fact, can't accept legally," he confirmed.
Being the first states considering small marihuana amounts in the same way as if alcohol, Colorado and Washington are prepared to become in national test cases regarding drug legalization.
While lawyers and lawyers of the State have accounted for a new border of legal sales, they also look for careful to receive indications from the Federal Government, which still provides the consideration of the sale and the culture of marihuana as federal crimes.
The marihuana legalization defenders have hope that the Department of Justice bears.
Although some major arrests of patients and marihuana sales have been made for therapeutical purposes, the Federal Government has allowed most of them that marihuana sales business with these purposes in Colorado, Washington and 16 more States.
"Although it is likely that antidrog agents do not go down the doors to confid a small drug bottle, it probably will be shown reaxes to allow the functioning of tents regulated by the state for the sale of marihuana for recreative use allowed in the new law," Kevin A. Sabet, an anti-drogue policy exassor of Obama's administration.
A number of cities in Colorado are not expecting to act the federal authorities.
Even before the day of the elections, some local governments adopted moratories on any new marhuana tent, although it will pass around one year before any of them could open.
The past week, the Western city of Montrose adopted an prohibition of six months and it is likely to approve the week coming.
"We don't want to put us into a situation in which we authorize someone and then have a serious problem at federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the meeting.
"Our community voted against this amendment.
We are studying for what the community voted in favour of what the state voted."
There are many questions about this.
Peternella Wyatt: "Shot me up until I get Oxford to be a Tory."
Unlike universities are not attacked by their views only now
I don't remember any moment in my life there was no dreaming to get a place at Oxford University.
My father and my elder brother were in which I suggested was the best place in the world to learn, a Greek symbol of the contemporary was which fostered the two pillars of civilization: free thought and tolerance.
However, in the two weeks to take my place in the Worcester College at the end of the 1980s to curse the History route, it had already done the badnesses, which was the first screw of my life.
My father turned out and laughed.
My friends were uncertain.
The Evening Standard confirmed that I had left because I did not tolerate that some university partners had sexual relations in the room on the side.
The writer A. N. Wilson announced that I had gone because they ought to drink in disappeared cups.
The truth was less fun.
I've been out of there.
Yeah, I've been, because he had been subjected to a acous and intimidation system.
Not due to my name, nor to the fact that I came from a private school.
They assembled me for one reason, that in the corner of the proposed illustration was something intolerant and bárbaro: my father, the deputy Woodrow Wyatt, was a wonderful adviser of Margaret Thatcher and I supported the conservator party.
Maybe you may ask what this happens now.
Well, several reports indicate that a new generation of right students is suffering a similar persecution.
Instituted and growing hatred to students of the conservatory party in Oxford that a group of them recalled the same level of rights of homosexual rights, disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Members of the JCR (Grace students group) of the Corpus of Christ College claim that they are "really serious, personally attacked and treated as non-grate persons" for their political ideas.
They wish to create a position in the Equality Committee on its University Counselship to ensure that it can express their opinions freely.
Its situation was not favoured by a recent documentary of the BBC2 called "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" (The Paragraph: Youth, light and right) on the students' policy and presenting the Tories as excentric and neonazis.
He showed the posgrade student Joe Cooke, the representative of the Oxford School Game Association (OUCA), in a Rolls-Royce Royce Royce, playing a plate tray and a base with the plate sample.
In other universities, conservatory students say they are treated as a "turk cabs" for the introduction of higher matrical rates.
Luke Black, 20 years old and Vice-President of the Association of the Food Party of the University of Nottingham, declared in a Dominican journal that " exists a growing left trend in universities.
People feel that we're like the Bullingdon Club without so much to know us."
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old history student in Corpus of Christ, who presented the motion for a greater protection, states that this environment is "importable", while Stephanie Cherill, 19 and elected OUCA president, confirmed that the attitude of members of JCR to those who are from the right centre has been engaged.
"I propose a threat to the environment of intellectual discussion, as well as for the welfare of the members," said he.
During my first weeks in Oxford, I was alone than one.
I entered to the University in September 1986, was a 18-year-old terrified youth.
The hate towards the Conservator Party was at its highest point.
In the previous year, the university had voted to refuse Margaret Thatcher, an aluminium title "honoris caused" after the funding of upper education.
The environment would have made a smoke of any stalinist.
For the first days of the week of welcome to the new university students, when new students are known and known to the Cathedrals, I received an exhibition from the warrants I was waiting for.
I discovered that the Cathedralians would not only make the gorgeous view to the mop that had been made by the conservator university, but they participated in a good gain.
The policy of the mixture policy, privatization and opposition of the government to sanctions against the apartheid in South Africa has reached the trees of the seminar.
The first time I had to translate the French texts of the XVIII century, and I was not prepared for what followed.
"Madam Wyatt," said Harry Pitt, "the Catholic Harry Pitt (the missed), " please trad the first paragraph."
Not one.
Pitt, a man fell with a face that seemed to be a weak mass, he well knew how to throw out bad ability.
"Is that the chechers refuse to learn French, or is it that they are tons?" asked.
The other universities laughed.
I burned the eyes of the laughings that I tried to contain.
"I suggest you to go to French classs in their free time, always and when you're not too busy people knowing", said Pitt.
I turned back to my room as a soul in pena.
At night I sat alone at the dinner at the university's hour; then I felt a swimming blow on the back.
He was a second English student named James who was presented as a member of the OUCA.
"It's who you're," she's kindly told me.
"I'm afraid that it's like it's going to do.
It's with anyone who is suspected of being Tory.
For me it's very complicated, but you know your father's close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Many tours have come to appear to be laborists."
Furthermore, in a local pub, I tried coherently to disimulate.
I insisted that I wasn't agreed with all that Mrs. Thatcher said.
This truck has resulted in use.
A first-year-old Philosophia, political and economic student who had paradically studied in Eton, said, "You're a daughter of a fascist pop.
You're polluted."
Other students took that song.
I've turned me into the perverted suck.
"How do they have sexual relations?" one asked.
"If you give one gun to each other, don't you?"
I felt in the same way that the homosexuals should be sensitive before the liberal law of the 60s.
Can I take a normal life in Oxford one day?
Will you see me to stay with people who think like I just after evening?
Do you think I'd have to make a worker and repair my natural trends?
The three years of waiting for me were presented as a purgatory of antitracm and island.
Tory was the only catalogue openly Norman Stone, Professor of History Contemporary for my university college.
They hated him not only from the Conservative Party, but also of the adviser of Thatcher in external policy and one of the persons who wrote it.
It was still there.
He described the place he considered a province and insignificant and his accession to the marxist-determinist vision of the history.
In 1997, a Catédra was adopted at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"If you're not gonna be happy here," she said to me.
I started moving me daily from Oxford to my fathers' house in London, finding refugees in my families and friends of metropolitane mentality more open.
I told my father I hated Oxford, and why.
He didn't believe me.
When he studied there in the 40 years, all the political points were accepted.
"But if it's the best place of the world," he said with tristeness.
"They would never do that, not there between my shoes of dogs.
Before my communist friends had always been an impassed attitude."
His painful eyes began naked.
"Don't have another opportunity.
I'm sure they've just done it to broke.
"It would leave my heart if you let him go."
A lot of travels to London, my emotional resistence was scared.
My friend, who also supported the Conservatory Party, was subject to pressure and revoked his faith.
The next week, during a seminary in which another Catholic of History had been inspired, speaking totally seriously, that I was a "related of the people," I decided to do the same.
Inside, I admitted that my fathers had "laid the brain" and called them "early dreamed."
The treasury was a little time.
It was my father who put the last slaughter in my university cart in Oxford.
For that time, my father would write two weekly pillars on Murdoch's pressure.
My door was closed with the key.
I was in fear-shake, and over five minutes, my persecutors disappeared.
When I was doing the malte and I took the first train in London.
I never came back.
Maybe you're calling me deep laugh.
But no person of 18 years should be subject to that level of intimidation and hostility in an educational institution.
What is even more tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only formed 14 first ministers of the Conservatory Party but that, at this time, nothing is hidden after a mere reputation of equality and freedom of thinking.
"Valentin prefers election to notoriality"
For the sample "Valentino: Master de Costure", which has been inaugurated this week in London, ABC speaks with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian designer
Somerset House, an old residence of Isabel I de England, is the only place in the British capital worthy to find an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The designer recognized him during the inauguration of "Valentin: Master de la Costure", a backperspective apotheosic gathering more than 130 high cost clothes created by his "maison" for the last 50 years.
"I appreciate this palace," says it with its inconsistent Italian.
This demonstration is the colony of a story whose only protagonist is "the Lord" Garavani, but that could not have been written without its different customers.
Valentine always has a sense of exciting and disgraceful world of nobleness.
In the first room of this exhibition, opening up to the next 3 March, there are private letters and photos with the signing of the most grade of the aristocracy, from the Prince Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through the Prince Marie-Chantal of Greece and the Margarita in England.
Valentino teaches these personal memories as trofes of its social ascension: a modest humble humble of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, to the "jet-set" international.
Early loved reality has nothing bad.
"Of less they don't throw their skins on your magic alfombra as they do some beautiful celebrations of the pop music," says Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60 and 70 years, we both lived in the Alpes and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectrum and intertain with generosity and election.
"All of us loved to be invited to your chalet in Gstaad," explains the exmuter of "Heini" Thyssen, the end of beautifuls forgotten like Marella Agnelli or Eugenia Niarchos.
Valentine always prefers the election to notoriality.
And so, it's a star.
Valeria Mazza, winning a Valentine
The argentin model Valeria Mazza does not forget the carism of the modest.
There's been many years ago, after a disfile in Piazza di Spain, in Rome, we were going to dinner his pool.
We were twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
In each detail of the pool, the decoration, the food, the music, he saw and felt his spirit.
"Other one of the invitations made us feel important and dear," remembers the "top model", which began to work with him during the High Costa Sea of Paris, in 1995.
"It's never a mode, because your designs are art works," repairs.
Alcuni file
Garvani's life is not a story of obsessions, but of well-comprehensive loves.
He loves people with good education and better titles, and they love him.
One of the gallerys of Somerset House has been transformed in a long past of sixty meters that offers a change of roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and has to disappear through the past to see a "audience" of a "audit" of Valentin's master works, such as the clothe which Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage with Aristóteles Onassis, the visual used by Monica Vitti in "La Notte", or an opening of lana and pile who had been held by the Emperaterzah Far Diba.
In this public, the names of the Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, Bulgaria, or the Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and Modern, in 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentine is like the first love, "I can't forget".
I remember it perfectly.
He was a screen, a bedroom, a chalet "gilet" and a every one of the Otom-eight collection 1971-1972.
"Do a gift that he made me," says Naty Abascal, one of the mosques of the designer.
"I prefer it to him for his femaleness, for his great love to women, because it makes our beauty," adds the former duke of Feria.
I appreciate the colours that use, have great light and they are "donantes" in the face.
The percentages are perfect.
The prince and writer of the Mothership of the Jovampaol d'Arenbergtampoco can forget the first time he saw a Valentine.
When he was adolescent and lived in Italy, I dreamed to be aged and time to use one of his night tracks...
Finally it came to the end of the 1990s.
I got my first clothes of Valentino to use in a party in my first castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red rock, with flower fall, "corsage" draped and choosing the word of honor.
"Fresh a real dream," says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is infringent to the mode, its obsession is the timely," explains this Italian aristhetic that lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg watchs its feast clothings with "the maximum care... because a clothing is not only a clothing, it is also the whole of memories he enjoyed."
The "rey" of the mode
The great end of the exhibition of Somerset House is the marriage trail of Marie-Chantal Miller in her marriage with Paul of Greece in 1995.
Four months of work were needed and 25 "ragazze" (such as the mode to its coasts) to develop this marfil color tray with perles includements, twelve different types of clothes and a four metres and average cubit.
According to the Suzy Menkes journalist, the larger authority of the specialized press, that clothing represents a hit of the high cost of the ends of the XX century, "the return of the customers of the high society".
Obsoleted for years with the "being" of the election, now Valentino is your best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the distinction of higher rango in Italy), Labor Cavaliere, Commander of the Order des Arts and Lestres, agreed with the Honor Legion, Garavani assignes both honors as one of his husbands.
"He always called me your refinancement, his calm, his clean and perfect look", recognises D'Arenberg.
The last time I saw it a month ago in a gala dinner at Orsay Museum.
He was at the Jacqueline condecree of Ribes, a great friend of my friend.
"It was imposable, the time is not going to him."

The world's hardest office: the human mulls of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, Indian volcano carriers are playing life and health loading 70 kilometres of sugar through stone startings
There are people for whom their work is an infection, and others who literally work in the infection.
It is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who gain life with a sugar of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indian island of Java.
For this reason, it must be low every day to the foundation of its crowd, where the sugar gas that evaporates from the earth's entrance is solidized when entering into contact with the air.
After shooting large sugar rocks, which are totally arrived at about 70 kilometres, it cut them in two bambu cells that lay on their holes through stone shoes.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which is high to 2.386 meters of height, but the expenses of the carriers are late over 40 minutes to go up to the step of torture, watching the balance and measuring their steps to not disappear and fall through the precipitation.
They know that any transfer could cost them life, as happened to a French tourist who was released years ago by Kawah Ijen's rises.
Cawah Ijen win 5 euro cents for every kilo of sugar
Once above, there are past between the tourists that photographed them as if they were a currency monos and, fatly loading the canastic weights, falling three kilometres to the balance that a miner company has located a little more beneath, at 1,850 meters of height.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates since 1960 and never better said to his workers, which pays 662 in India (5 euro centers) for each kilo of sugar.
Then sales it for 10,000 rupes (83 euro centers) to the petrocal industry, since this mineral is generalized in the daily life and is used to manufactur cells, artificial fires, cosmetics, dynamics and to black sugar.
"How normal is loading 70 kilometres, we get out about 46,000 rupes (3,8 euros) every journey," Anto explains us, who wishes to perform three daily doors.
Three hours every one and ended, but they allow you to meet 138.000 rupes (11.5 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a fault for such inhuman efforts, it is the triple of what I would win in the field.
"The borrow of miners is very high here, where the coffee collection is paid to 15.000 Russians (1.2 euros) the day and the average monthly wage is of two million rupes (167 euros) ", explain the carrier, which previously worked as a bathroom in the Bali island tourism.
There, its lower was 75.000 rupes (6.2 euros) in the day and the cup was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a people near to the volcano, because of a reason of weight that, in Indonesia, results so converting as sugar: "I caught with a young Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought it to Java to turn to Islam."
Anto has asma, respirate with difficulty, touch constantly and wear the eyes by the toxic gas
At his 27-year-old, Anto takes three playing the hair in the Kawah Ijen, whose sugar has already started to overcome the fashion to cover the face with a morecara and special donations.
You have asma, respirate with difficulty, touch constantly and wear the eyes from the toxic gas that disappears the volcano.
It's the price you must pay to get your dream.
"I'll work two years more because I want to open a tension or study Spanish or French," promise in a English more acceptable.
Castied for life, this young sympathetic and intelligent youth could be tourist, camer or receipt of a hotel, but instead of that makes a mule work.
Sharing a immense wood cake with other carriers, it is risen every day to the two of the madrugad because the sugar doesn't leave to handle night when its smooth color returns blue and lights in the middle of darkness.
Storming the shapes, Anto down to the crowd with a small linen attached to his box, which he himself bought with his money.
One 400 carriers load the sugar cells on their balls from the square fund
Despite its painting benefits, the mine company has not mixed the extraction of sugar to ensure costs or to provide any equipation to the carriers, which work through their account and so weight.
In fact, it is not even part of the 300,000 rupes (2.5 euros) of the camera that, next to the entry of 15.000 Russians (1.2 euros), the watch of this natural park covers the tourists who are looking for photographing the volcan and their human mules.
"This work is for the animals and not for the people," protests Madrusin, a 42-year-old supplier who brings in Kawah Iyen three decades, since he left the college.
It's ability to rise up to 110 kilometres, make sure he'll be able to work "to everything you can" because he needs money to educate three children from 18 to 10 years.
I won't jump, I'll die here because the volcano was all my life.
Although the sugar kiss the garden and listens the eyes when the wind changes of improving and takes the miners in the shapes that come out of the flower, they are so hard that no one desires to suffer serious diseases... more clearly is, of their usual respiratory problems, artrosis, pain in rocks and lacks in the beds, which have been misformed by the weight of the pits.
Blooking your back swimming, Oneinik can only load 50 kilometres for its 53 years.
Every day, he and his fellows are 15 tons of sugar to the volcano, three trains move to Tamansari's store, 18 kilometers from distance by a path of caps between malice.
"I won't jump, I'll die here because the volcano has been all my life," says Oneinik, opening the mouth, where several deals are missing.
Of his five children, the elderly, 30 years old, also working black.
The time passes, but the famine continues to generate one of the hardest offices of the world: that makes the human mulls of Kawah Ijen.
Singapur seeks children to save the economy
Singapores have offended chariots, stress and costs of property and education because they have no children.
"The population of Singapur needs to grow up."
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic wife, we turn to our civil debt and we believe life!
It may seem inverosimil that these stuffs are part of an announcement of menta pasts, but despite that - or perhaps because of that - the video became viral in YouTube at the beginning of this year.
The phrases are part of a rap that uses local references as "We're going to put a boo (boo) in the horn" to rise from the birth rate of Singapur.
The publicity company that made the video, BBH, hosts the hope that with the announcement it calls attention to the problem of a fun way.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that I would like to use the music power to make people comply with "the national debtor".
This is something pure of the Internet, so we had to make it fun and fun.
It's the greatest problem in this country.
We are the worst of the world in playing themselves, so we feel that this was a subject we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried a lot of things, such as launching perfumes with feromons or organizing fast citations (speed-dating).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they did not necessarily work.
So we think, why are we not doing the most creative way to solve this problem, which is to combine a rape?
1,2 sons.
He who doesn't take it to the liver is the government of Singapore.
US$1,300 per year in policy to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for marriages and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, exempt maternity licenses and retain tax benefits.
But all this has had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-Technology city in the southern Asian, known also by the conservation of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore's birth rate, in accordance with its national population division, is currently 1,2 women children.
The last time I was over 2 - known as reposition rate- was in 1976.
So why do the Singaporens no more kids?
So Wei Ming, Chief of Employment Policy and Family of the National Population Division, says that it is due to a "more education" and "a larger gamme of road opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have a wide range of options in terms of life and priorities, more than marriage and family," explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in solemnity, and to defend marriage and birth, which results in a decrease of birth rate in Singapore.
However, a immigration policy points to increase drastically immigration to face the decrease of the population has created a resentment between the local population.
In Singapore there are websites where xenofobia is quite dispersed against many new immigrants, particularly Chineses, which critical to maintain lower and not to be integrated.
Increased immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the Singapur Government party has experienced its worse electoral result from independence.
Since the elections, it has been an attempt to correct the problem, with the higher contributions and dimensions for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall in the birth rate has an impact on the economic growth of a nation, tax income, health costs and immigration policy, the example of Singapore also has some unexpected consequences.
The Government tries not to build so many small houses.
For example, he started affecting the real estate sector.
The urban development authority has been controlled the number of small apartments known as "sackbox", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have 46 square meters and have had much success of sales.
However, there is an concern that they can promote a lifestyle and encourage developers who want to build large, family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, General Director of the Immobiliary Employment EL Developers, says that their "spat chains" are sell more faster than the larger units.
They are more popular, in the sense that units are expensive days, even weeks, faster than the greater size units.
This makes it much better for our cart flow.
However, it admits that the new standards provide clearer guidelines for developers, which would be taken before if they wish to offer small units in a project.
Easy demassed
Singapur is a city.
Although these new rules can be a step towards the increase in national naturality rate, speaking with the synthesis working in the centre's financial district, it is likely that they will not have much effect.
"The people are very excited, homes are faces and also is education, so many people are put it," says a young executive.
Others can have children.
"But for me it's important to tell my own money and time," says another young one of about 20 years.
Humans and women mention their chariot, stress and cost of property and education, such as the reasons that they impede to have children.
So, because the Government is trying to engage his citizens to have children when it is trying to make children, the synagogues are those who have the last word.
Private off line is private on line
Privacy.
According to the Real Academy Real Academy, it is the private quality or "the sector of private life which has the right to protect any introduction."
What's private for a 16-year-old?
How does this definition apply in their daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers that it is exposed by winning in the Internet situations that it would certainly not share outline?
He interviewed five young children between ten and 15 years, the network of frequent users.
In four of the cases, they assembled the term to "heaten my" in the personal level, and "in the key and name of the user," when they applied it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets wouldn't submit them to a post," says Jorge, 10 years old, when you try to explain the private significance in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where you have accounts for two years ago.
"You're very secret, my mom can know them, but not all."
In FB submit goods or games.
I'm also intertaining with my known ones.
"I wouldn't share a photo that doesn't be mine, or someone who's doing the riddle," says.
The child recognizes that it is bad to publish obscene photographs, naked persons, crimes or writing humble or violent comments.
Jorge is sure to meet the 35 friends who have in FB and its nine followers in Twitter.
Most parents.
Mother is included, has the key of one of the accounts.
Open Twitter to express me and write two interesting times.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just going on," adds.
"The social networks are undertaken, I can speak with long parents or with my friends quickly," says he.
There is no doubt in response that it would never accept a request of an unknown person.
Nothing would make anybody recommending a stranger.
The case of José, of 14 years, is different.
The adolescent has open accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, in this last admission you don't know 20 of the people added to your friends list.
"Don't be afraid, because we have something in common, music, for example," indicates.
According to the boy, no one has been signed up or asked for your home or phone number.
"If they've been presidenciated, or I'm just out of my account's sacks," he recognis.
Joseph became as a ask follower, then reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy isn't foreigning the experiences of what today is known as ciberbullying.
One of my friends knew it in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded him money.
"I never knew who he was," sure.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close the account.
"Solo put him privacy."
Then explains a series of steps to set the account securely.
On the difference of Jorge, this boy would submit photos of known in incognised or embarrassed situations.
Yeah, I'd do it, if I'm bad or I'm gonna win him.
"If I know it's cyberbullying," he said.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, English teacher and licensed in education and education, considers that children and adolescents should understand that the purpose of social networks is to be informed.
"Internet came as a means to search information, but with the appearance of these sites, they changed the game rules," mentioned.
Porras notes that the Marc Pressky Academic, more than in Pedagogie by the University of Yale and the author of the National Work and Digital Immigrants, has added these terms to explain Phoenomen.
The digital births are they, the children and young people born with technology.
"We're the digital immigrants we have to teach them when we are still learning", says he.
It feels that the subject is complex, "for we ask them to have a defined criteria for what it agrees or not to spread, publish or say to a age that maturity does not give for this."
"And they are selective when whatever they matter is to be popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach what is private to children and adolescents is through questions that make them reflect.
"Don't do it," adds.
Next, Porras lists some options: There are things you wouldn't tell a foreigner, why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or, would you like you to publish a photo of you as you published a friend?
You know what the others publish about you?
When feast photo tags, did you like to allow the other people to label them?
And another, are they all needed to know what you're doing every moment?
Another point is to make them see that they must act on line as they do it offline.
They're the same rules.
"A internet outside acts with respect, morality and other principles, must be equal in social networks."
Slaughter
The Guardia, University Cathedral, teacher of primary and educational consultor, emphasises that it is essential that family parents read the policies of social networks.
When understanding each of them, they have strong foundations to discuss with their children on the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
"Before the age and what you're allowed to share or publish," says.
According to Guardia, it is key to remember children the selection of "not with stranges".
Final Summit of the Unsur without publication of the Lima Declaration
The VIth Summit of the South American Union (Unasur) concluded today in Peru without the Lima Declaration, previously declared and the formerly signed by the seven assistant mandatees.
Efe tried to have recent opportunities to access the document signed in the VI Ordinary Meeting of State and Government Chiefs of Unsur, but the sources of Cancillery and the Presidency noted that it would be delivered after the closure, but then confirmed that at some time it would be published on the website of the Peruan Government.
As consulted by the text, they noted that the content was expressed by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, during a short statement to the press.
The access of journalists to the Summit was limited at all times.
During the jorned, only the video was transmitted in the press room without sound of the presidency meeting with the message "private session, restricted audio".
The few information that he circled between reporters was delivered by the press ports of some of the Governments of the Unsur assistants at the citation, although not the Peruan.
The only reported document was the list of assistants presidents, which had resulted in the lack of hundreds of periodists of various national and international media requesting more data.
In addition, the Peru Presidency sent an e-mail to the means with the "finan declaration" of the summit, but it is the statement of Humala, and not the official document which closed the summit.
In October last, Peru was the anfitrion of the South-Arabian American Summit (ASPA), and in that case, although it was urgently requested by the press, the Lima Declaration was not also distributed which had previously declared.
The ASPA's Official Web site can be certified that the document was published on Tuesday.
In both international citeds, the Peruan authorities were endeavoured in which the transmission systems had been secured for all journalists but have limited the maximum receipt of information.
The summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru of accepting a fault of the Court of La Haya to establish a cross-border difference between both countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastian Piñera, met together during the regional quota and ratify that the decision of the (CIJ), which begins the moon in La Haya to listen to both parties, in the process which Lima presented against Santiago.
"We'll take and execute the judgment defining the differences that today we're taking to this international court," Humala, near his chile couple.
"Chile has been, it is and will continue to be a respectable country of international law, peaceful solution of disputes, treaties and international courts," he added Piñera, and greeted by hands to Humala, together with the bands of the two countries.
The confirmation of both Presidents that CIJ would be undertaken has occurred after Colombia would declare the Bogotá Covenant that had accepted to be subject to the injuries of that international court, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua who had considered seriously erroneous.
The summit was implemented with the insecurties of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff; Venezuela, Hugo Chávez; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended by Onesur since 2011 after the destitution of his former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the quote.
The Anfitrion President, Ollanta Humala, was responsible for opening the debate on the morning and close the summit, a little after the middle of Lima.
The mandate read the final document informed that 16 agreements were adopted and the action lines for 31 projects between the South Americas were set for a total of $17 million in investment.
Among the adopted agreements said that UNASUR countries will give " important steps towards the goal of a South American citizen to extend the residence agreements."
It informed that actions are emphasized to improving "the cooperation in combating civil insecurity and transnational organized crime, actions to make more accessible medicines, Internet access to lower prices in all regions of South America, and coherent and effective risks of natural disappearances".
With a crisis Europe, "Economic consolidation (the Latin America) must not be a triunfast matrix but served to expand productive matrix and to visualize a better future for our peoples," added Humala.
"We decided to privilege a group of 31 emblemmatic projects that will improve the connection of South America spaces, especially in rural and border areas... joining our countries and generating new economic circuits," said the Peruian President in a ready message.
Among these projects, he reported that five are corresponding to Peru, and they are localized in the cross-border eggs of their territory, from the coast to Brazil, and two are focused on a greater connection with Ecuador, although he did not give more details.
The final document also mentioned the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country serves for its reincorporation to the South American Union" of which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain as a region of prosperity and peace, integrated, and of good relationships between neighbourings, was another of the matters underlined by the summit.
In this regard, the President of Colombia, John Manuel Santos, said before the starting of his participation in the regional citation he was waiting to meet his park of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the Saturday in Mexico, to treat the seaily divorce after a fall of the CIJ, questioned by Bogotá.
"The morning (sack) may be meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
"We're going to review all these ways, not exclusive, including the treaty with Nicaragua will require a conversation with Nicaragua," she subrayed.
" With the President of Ortega, I hope we can tell you that we keep this in the most civilized and more respectable manner," added Santos.
Saints and Ortega would have been found on the Sabbath in Mexico where they were planned to attend the new President of that country, Enrique Peña Neo.
In addition, as part of the summit, the Block Defence Ministers were convened previously to adopt the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and the defence consensus in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay integrated UNASUR, although the last country is understood.
Peru has the presidency for the regional block.
"Sierrarica must learn from Europe to integrate citizenship: Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, stated today that the creation of a common citizen is a goal in which "Surameric, in this case, must learn from Europe."
Correa, who participated in the 7th Summit of the United Nations South American Summit (Unasur), held in Lima, declared the state of Peru that Europeans were killed in the Second World War and in other conflicts, "but now they are practically a patria".
In that respect, he defended the draft establishment of South American citizenship that shared the Member States of the Unsur.
"They have to obtain free movement of citizens and workers for any South American country, as it already happens to the integrators of the Andinan Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return to us," he warned.
The Ecuador President was also shown in favour of the recombination of the American States Organization (OEA) under the premises to reduce the impact of the English states and taking into account those signed by San José’s Convention on Human Rights.
Those catedras are never compromised to nothing, and we are, on the other hand, signing it all.
"It is incomprehensive that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the financing of the United States," he assigned the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the WikiLeaks funder, Julian Assange.
Core ensured that he is not repented of that decision because it has not acted with its principles, but that he has respected its "deep democratic values and human rights".
He argued that at its time, "against the suspects founded that Assange was extraded to a third country and did not respect its process."
He also cried to the Swedish justice by requesting him to be subjected to the questionnaire by a prerequisite sex crime when "the Swiss legislation allows it through video conference, which could be done from Ecuador's embarrassement in London."
Core confirmed that there was a risk of deterioration of the physical and mental health of Assange.
"I didn't talk to him since he's in our embryo, but the embarrassing told me that he had a little pulmonary problem, nothing serious," said the Ecuador.
Whatever is the danger that your physical and mental health is deteriorated by being ensuring in a small space without able to carry out the free air.
"This complicates any person's health," added.
Correa noted that the solution to asylum designed to Assange since June in the ecuatorian embajy in London through the concessing of a conservation allowed to travel to Ecuador is in the hands of the British Britain, Sweden and the European legal authorities and underlined that it had been discussions with London in search for a solution to the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate human rights, but we do not use it in this case but have been permanent discussions.
"The solution of this problem is in hand of the British, Sweden and the European Legal authorities because the Assange lawyer, Balthazar Garzón, is making a series of procedures in different European institutions," said he.
And she thought, "If Britain's tomorrow, this was done."
And if Sweden, as perfectly allows his legislation and how it has done in other cases, ask Mr Assange in the Ecuador's embarrassment in London or the question of Skype tomorrow has been completed this problem.
Correa tried to reaffirm himself as a defender of the freedom of press, and killed that what does not tolerate is "the environment, the evil faith and the lie, which turn the freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of the liberty of press are not the evil and perverse politicals, but the evil periodists in the role of gain, crowd and extortion," said he.
In that respect, it was congratulated that these periodists are no bankers nor heroic countries dominant to Ecuador, and added that they would "profund in the revolution to continue the path and the right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto to Paraguay in Paraguay at least to its next elections, argued that the body "he must be firm and not tolerate the opportunism and the revested golpsis of legality" because in fact "effectived the legitimacy of paraguay democracy".
Furthermore, the Ecuador President considered "effectively relevant" the desire of its Colombian homolog, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate now with Nicaragua, the marriage limits between both countries after the fall of the International Court of Justice of La Haya, which had benefited to the Nicaragua Sea marine sovereignty.
At the moment that fault wasn't done.
It is a problem between a South America and a central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but must be overcome by the will of walking together.
We need to process them in a wide manner to overcome them and go forward.
He also trusted in a good conclusion of the lits by maritime limits to keep in the same court of Peru and Chile and believed that "the right for Latin America seeking international instances if the two countries are committed to accept unfairly if it is."
With regard to the possibility presented as a candidate in the next presidency elections in Ecuador to seek a third consequent mandate, he pointed out that "with much optimism and joy, sometimes it is very hard."
Core assured that if he requested the February 2013 starts, public life would be removed.
In the personal, he has never interested the power, but in both injust situations such as the Ecuador's socioeconomic poverty only can be corrected from political power.
"My folly movement believed that I was who guaranteed that likely victory, because we need to accept that reaction," said he.
It would be my last period in the presidency and then we went out of public life.
We're losing the same.
"It's a decision," confirmed.
Correa was also revealed to the new health treatment of the Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I was talking to the Vice-President Nicolas Maduro, and he told me he traveled to a treatment that was already planned by rutin, which was expected to pass the campaign to return to Cuba.
"There does not mean a receipt in the state of the President Chávez," he commented.
The Chief of Ecuador State has participated today in Lima in the Summit VI of State Heads and Government of the South American Union (Unasur) which concluded with calls for a greater regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
Mords for AIDS today are causes of late detection
Fabrizio had 21 years old when they confirmed the result of the test: positive SIDA.
"It's like if it falls a bomb," means remembering the moment of announcement, that the doctor was trying to do "n't hurt," without success.
The boy hided him to his family.
He decided to be charged only for his disease and began to inform her; with such an emphasis that had been celebrated his 43th anniversary.
It is certainly one of the oldest patients of the HIV civil hospital of Guadalajara, who came after several battlees in 1994.
Fabricity lives with human immunodeficiency virus (VIH) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 90s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stress.
Then, until the director of a IMSS clinic, he refused to disappear him "for he brought a cortade."
So, having sida was an absent of death.
Now it is possible to survive this syndrome and to do with quality of life.
However, unrecognized of their disease, many people still come when virus has already caused extracts, "good" its immunological system and are victims of opportunist infection.
At 31 years of the appearance of the site in the world, at least the first cases reported, "the great achievement means that the survival of a patient which begins timely and the overlife of general population is exactly equal," said the Chief of HIVH of the HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva, after reporting that this information was valid in April this year in a pre-president scientific publication.
Infectologus and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanuva commented that since 2008, scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a fair sentence, but the years of survival and the quality of life dependent on the level of affection to the immunological system that represent patients when starting the diagnostic, with best expectation for those who were not drug users: from up to 30 years with an account of 200 CD4 and 50 years, when reporting 500 CD4.
In simple words, the previous means that who receives positive HIV diagnostics for the age of 25, under these terms "more keeps control can live without problems until 75 years," the interviewer explained.
To dimension this progress, you can remember that the hope of life of Mexico today is of 76 years in average.
While mortality has significantly disappeared in the last years in Mexico, the number of people died from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (NSIDA annual report) is also true that 60 percent of patients in the national database has failed.
Only in Jalico 255 people falled in 2011, and from 187 deaths to May this year; however, there are universal access to antiretroviral factors since 2005.
- Why are they still dead?
- I think the problem is not to access to treatment.
So the visuality has occurred to us in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we have not had a medicine the problem is that patients have arrived very advanced because they have not known their infection status or, in pasts of disease.
God has a contingent date: "New of each ten patients come when they already present some opportunist infection what you have to do to have a greater impact on global mortality, it is to make diagnostics more early and, therefore, must be offered tests of massive detection, to all people who need it."
In its proposal, specialists and officials of the State Council of Prevention of the Site in Jalisco (Coesida), also the own patients, such as Fabrizio, who assigned the test of a particular laboratory, just motivated because he had done it a friend and, despite his short age, had already been sitting and even paid a sarcoma of Caposi, a cancer tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you know you're sitting.
Some think they're going to die and they don't want to know anything.
"If I'm gonna die, I'll better be three times in the week," they said not in my case.
The change was to improve, me well food, I'm doing, I take the medicines.
At the time, his parents just know that he paid a cancer.
I lived a normal life, like everybody.
"Take, I have many activities, trip, I have an active sexual life, but corresponsable, worried about me and the other person," he endorsed Fabrizio, who agreed to share their intimity with MILENIO JALISCO to motivate his witness to those today, in the framework of the World AIDS Day, have feared.
The test will be made, if they have been risked, that, interimly soon, they know whether they are positive HIV, it is better and if they have diagnostic, that they may learn that they can live as any person who is responsible.
Its message resumes the battle lame at AIDS this 2012.
Submits after the displayer
Big are the eggs between health programmes and the common citizen, subsequent Ricardo Salazar, journalist tapaty who has ceased the cause to HIV.
And the greatest is in prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task "effectively increased the distribution of condones, before they give us from one or two, now give us a hundred packages from, and that's very good but it's very good that there are still ones today still have no access to a condensation", said.
The most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
"Why do you want?" is a common question, with a dream and judges of social workers, school leaders, health workers and employees, which do not want to explain adolescents, the Communicator.
I proposed to reorient this repared inefficiency; that the condones are not only after the showers and that hundreds are found in public bathrooms from young people.
It is not to motivate the promise.
It is neither to pay them cells and motors, as Emilio González answered, asking him whether he would be retained of conservation in his administration.
"That is not sexuality, the best is to approach the convictions to those who already practice sexual activity," he pointed.

There are 13.435 cases acumulated (12.158 of AIDS and 1.317 of HIV).
The state is fourth national places in new and acumulated cases of AIDS and 13th of HIV.
92% of the contagios corresponds to sexual path, 6% of the blood path and 2% of the pernatal path.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV because for a case registered there are 4 to 5 persons who do not know it.
A sentence not known to the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro Lograde Group was a trade concourse in Mexico, the scenario puts a pre-agained time for any national enterprises with reforms in the neighbouring country that had problems of solution.
It would therefore be said that the survival procedures of the signatures allowing mexican laws are not valid in the country of bars and stars, in contrast to international conventions.
In the practical field, the slaughter to the sentence issued on 15 June by the judge Harlin Hale of the court of Bancarrota for the north district of Texas, leaves the Mexican signs to the possibility of exchange of its own properties in the Bravo.
However, the resolution opens the door to the main glass producer in Mexico to approve the Supreme Court of the United States, endorsing three inconsistents.
In entering, while the court of the cause notes that the creditors must be ruled by the United States Law of Quiebras, the court of Appealments of the Fifth, in New Orleans, said that the main procedure is the commercial consequence delivered to Mexico.
The first point would involve the ignore of international processing cooperation in cases of nonsolvency of enterprises with transnational profile.
To that end, the United Nations Modern Act for the Uniformity of International Mercantil Law was created, with the American Law Institute.
Secondly, the sentence states that without the inter-companied vote, the critical mass of the trade concourses, the debts that had with its mother the daughters of Vitro had not been achieved in the majority required to approve the restructuring.
However, the possibility is recognized by the Mexican laws.
In fact, the Vitro was not the first case when the scene is accepted.
There are the average 12 examples, including Agremex and Mexico Trade, whose inter-company debts the Federal Institute of Mercantral Concourses.
Furthermore, it is that, remaining the votes of the filials, the creditors of Vitro who strived against it in the United Courts of the United States, which is the "buite" funds as Capital Aurelios, Convergence Aurelios, International Elliot and Liverpool Limited, will not be achieved most.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37.
The date was the Court of Appeals.
Since another angle, this fault of Vitro's difficult situation, which was affected since 2008 by the serious economic crisis that had affected the United States by drugs to the country.
Successfully, the signing of the family of González Sada will submit a reply to the court of appeals to which the vote comes to the full of it, i.e. the five judges, as they only voted.
To not proceed this will be recalled to the remedie of Circar who requires the revision of the process by a higher institution, in this case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The serious case is that the court undertake a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the form of friends of the Court ("Amy of the Court of Justice") in which the procedure followed by Vitro under the Law on Mercing Contracts, noting that it was rejected by the conventions signed by both countries to initiate it in Chapter 15 of the United States Banking Law.
Furthermore, it is noted that the country has undertaken the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border cases of non-solvency, which guarantee equity for debtors and creditors.
Two band cards: knock him to Vitro and throw him into the country.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "The Balonest has been my life."
Hector "Hetin" Reyes was more than 60 years associated with the sport of the table box and, thanks to him, he traveled the whole world.
A few people in Puerto Rico has a mental collection of the story of the local balonest so large as the Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
And it is that before a cerebral disappearing it in 2008, Reyes was incarcerated in the sport for over 60 years, was a player of younger categories, a player of the National Balonice Supreme Balonice, assisted and manager in the BSN with the Bayamón Vaqueries or President of the Balonest Federation.
"I have put many shadows in my life through the Balony, including several in the same time, as when I was BSN Chairman, National Team Manager and Federal Chairman, for the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a visit of First Time to his home in Bayamón, where he stayed with Isabel, his faithful wife over 50 years.
"The Balonest was my life."
Reyes are not exalted by doing that warning.
The walls of your house, almost all decorations with photos and memorys that notice their wide trajector, so they test it.
Bayammon in the heart
Of all, those who request more emotion are those who remember their steps by the Vaquers from the middle of the 50s as a player up to 1982, when he took 15 years to operate as coapodered or acquired of franquity.
"There were my best years, which I enjoyed more because I had the opportunity to be part of eight campaigns of the Vaquers since 1967, already was as an assholed, cooped or leading.
There were many years of satisfactory, including the five corrigent campaigns from 1971 to 1975.
And then I dismissed with one in 1981, Jerome Mincy's debut year in the BSN.
From there it was charged "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great manager," said Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who was directed here and was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a strong player of 6"7" of the station.
You want it?"
And this was the principle of Mincy, one of the best players who had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was born and was one of our best tutors.
Remember that he said that if Mincy had given him a campeon to Bayamon, Gausse would help bring another.
The Vaqueros campaign with Gausse was glad, but already on the distance, for 1988, he was already formed of federal mandates.
For that time, it was preferable to enjoy their executives and missions in the National Team.
I remember when we win for the first time to the United States in Mexico in 1989.
Then came the World of 1990, where we arrived in the fourth place and had to have been sweet to be not through that Canadian Arbitre who made us repeat the final player for the second time, said the Kings.
The 1990 World Group is the best National Team you have seen?
It's between the best, like those who gained the Dream Team in the Olympics of 2004.
But my favour was the Pantonians in Cuba in 1991, when we gained gold and gave him a hair to the United States team, which was quite similar to us in the world.
The team was not only repealed to Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), but also had (Javier) "Toñito" Colon and James Carter young brothers, Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, which could not be in 90 because of a lection on the rodilla.
A team that might not be the best in staff terms but gave us a gold medal and a great joy was the Preolimist of 1995 in Neuquen, Argentina.
With a role player like "Canito" Nieves, Paul Alice and a young Rolando Houreditiner are replaced by the Pan American Lion of the Plateau, we gain gold against all prognostics.
What was the best player of Puerto Rico?
Unfortunately, that was the Piculin Ortiz.
The numbers of international tours are impresionants.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated that level as Piculin did.
And that's without telling your trajector in the different leathers he played.
Who was the best borrow leader?
That's very difficult.
We had a very good bedroom including Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armanito Torres.
Of young people, I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think your greatest achievement in the Federation?
It was part of the most glorious war of the National Team between 1988 and 1995 and that BSN had up to 17 teams in a timely time.
What did you have to do?
There were things that I would wish to implement, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, the Ponce boys will only play in their area and only equipped with teams of other in the island's rincon in the national playoffs.
Now the children are traveling and playing too unnecessary.
At least I see the fruit of compulsory certifications and course for managers, table officers and artists.
That's funny.
What are you doing now?
Most than I do is listen to music, see my echo music videos, enjoy my necks and then when you go to baloncast games.
And clearly, enjoy my wife's company, Isabel, who has always been with me.
Shit the actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Wordh (Texas), was globally known by its central role as John Ross Ewing, more known as "J.R.", in the "Dallas" television series in which he encountered a man of business without scratch, malicious and manipulator.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the great petrol depredator J.R. Ewing in the "Dallas" television series became a symbol of aboriginess in 1980, is dead.
I was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new time of "Dallas", died saturday in the afternoon because of cancer complications, in accordance with a communication of the family provided to The Associated Press by Warner Bros.
"Larry was back in his lovely birth city of Dallas, once again representing the icosical role that he likes," said the family.
Larry's family and his closer friends were with him in Dallas for the feast of the Joint Action Day.
Linda Gray, who interpreted the role of his wife in the original series and in the course, was with Hagman when he fell in a hospital of Dallas, said the publicist of her, Jeffrey Lane.
He was glad to all he knew.
It was creative, generous, fun, fun, lovely and talentous, and I'll extraordinary.
"It was an original person and lived the maximum life," said Grey in a communication.
Hagman diagnosed the hepatic cirrhosis in 1992 and recognized that he had been drunk for many years.
In 1995, he found a bad tumor in the hitte and was subject to a transplant.
Years before "Dallas", Hagman became known in the television as a decent type in the I Dream of Jeannie "I Dream of Jeannie", distributed by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
In it, he interpreted the Captain Tony Nelson, a astronaute whose life is changed when he found an attractive genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and led her to live with him in his house.
It was also a protagonist of two commissions that were a little time at the air, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the kitchen included the roles well received by the critique in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his master interpretation of the enthusiastic detective J.R. who brought Hagman to its highest star.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and other persons in its order was at the air of April 1978 to May 1991.
The promotional phrase "Who shot J.R.?", thought to generate an attractive expectation to a full emotions episode where Hagman’s person is almost killed, generated an international speculation and millions of dollars arrayed in houses.
He also helped give him a record of audience at that time.
When the response was discovered in a November 1980 chapter, a average of 41 million televisors have synthesized it and became "Dallas" in the second retail programme of history, after the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million spectators.
It was J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who dismissed her.
J.R. married her and then brought her with a prostitute cup, unless others had reasons to attack him.
Hagman interpreted Ewing as an insufficient corrupt with a carismic dream: a tramping businesser and an infidel husband who tried to make his wife alcoolical, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), an internal.
"I know what I want in J.R.," said Hagman in 1988.
I should say, "It's the honest citizen here J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business that he lost.
Victoria Principal, coprotagonist of the original series, remembered the Friday to Hagman as someone "inside and outside the screen".
It's inolvidable, and unpopular, for millions of wonderers in the world, and in the hearts of each of us, that we had the luck to know and love him.
10 episodes of the new "Dallas" edition were transmitted for months ago with great success for the TNT channel.
It was already completed the recording of five of the chapters for the second time and a sixth was in process, informed the chapter.
There was no warner or TNT declaration immediately about how Hagman's loss will manage.
Fort Wordh, Texas, was a son of the actor and sing Mary Martin, who triggered classic works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a adolescent when he had him in 1931 during his marriage with the Ben Hagman lawyer.
He successfully tried in the theatre scenarios of New York at the beginning of the 1950s, and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
When he was there, he met the young Swiss designer Maj Axelsson, and he fell down with her.
The couple had two sons, Preston and Heidi, and lived for a long time in the Malawi city of Malayo, where many celebrations lived.
In 2001 he entitled his memories "Hello Darlin: Tall (and mostly True) Tales about My Life."
"I couldn't put anything there I think I was going to lay somebody or touch them in any way," said Princess Association at that time.
After heat transplantation, he became a promotion of the donation of organs and worked as a voluntary in a hospital to attend fearful patients.
"I'm inconsistent, I give them value, I'm meeting them when they come for their cirugies, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to offer something of consumer, like "no fear, it's a little inconsistent for a short time, but you're gonna be good."
He was also active against the housing of fuming and participated in several campaigns.
Starting course to study the "Finn of the world"
Every week, students are studying apocalistic issues such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and genes, and global calendation.
This semester, when professor at the religious religion Stuart Charme decided to learn a course on the end of the world, he knew that he contained with an irregularity: The end of the "great return account" of the calendar Maya on 21 December, which many people have been brought as a evidence that the end of the world comes.
But Charmé had no idea of what he was waiting for in the following months: the Uracán Catholic cataclism, a fiscal precipitation that some have called "deudarmagedon" and a growing conflict that involves Israel, the place where Christian theories at the end of the time believe that the Apocalypse will be started.
"I don't understand that this would be the most apocalistic semester that has been," Charmé said to the Students of the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If one analyzes what happened in the world today as if we had been 30 days and talking, this has been a really good period.
And remember that evil is good for those of apocalistic mentality.
And he is not the only teacher who offers courses on the "the end of the world" this semester, in theory the last history.
In Temple, the adjoint professor Barry Vacker is learning the course "Medios, culture and the end of the world".
Every week, students are studying apocalistic issues such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and genes, and global calendation.
"Let us consider why these ideas spread with time," said, "and how they offer hypothetic scenarios that leaded some human behaviour.
If nuclear material falls in hands of terrorists, for example, a war could be established.
This month students analyzed films with apocalistic topics and studied how they were compared with real life examples.
"I tried to inform students about whatever it is possible, probably believed and impossible," said Vacker.
In the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, professor of History of Latino America Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjoint professor of History of Art and Anthropology, has made a team to learn a course only titled "The end of the world".
"We don't add '2012' to tell you always with the option of learning the course of again, if the world doesn't end," said Restall.
Despite the "intensive damage", students must study, generate projects and take final reviews.
In Penn State, the final review will be taken as awaiting the Apocalipsis, which does not leave students another option than to "the same night when the world is concluded," said Restall.
The courses were quite popular.
"He was filled in two hours," Restall said on his course for average students, who filled 35 students.
We received e-mail messages for weeks and weeks before the start of the half, of those who asked whether there was still a place.
Students, on their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"I am exciting to see what people are doing to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a train student in religion and Sociology of 23 years of Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden.
And it is that the apocalistic, secular or religious mentality is only the issue of the consumer or the absence of the same.
Will Wekesa, an student of the psychology and Enfermery, 25 years old, said to have seen all the apocalistic films.
"I never heard about a class that could teach it," he said.
It's fun.
But no student interviewed - and much less than a teacher - said to believe in the fall date of 21 December.
"Our first project discussed the Master Profession and certainly we decreed it," said Julie Zeglen, a student of last year in Temple, 21 and West Chester.
The masters never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
But he recognized that there is an apocalistic concern in the Western culture, which is referring to a number of centuries, in which people react to changes around them by preaching the end of the world.
Internet has caused an increase of these speculations.
"In other parts, people don't think about that," said he.
Most in English speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of the University's religion The Salle that learns courses in the Philippines this year, quickly answered the question of whether he knew about some course on the "the end of the world" there.
"The Philippines don't participate in the end of the world," he wrote, ending an exception of a higher authority.
We have a stuff of Daddy's Daddy.
Restall noted that many days of the final judgment had been spoken, and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, people will start thinking immediately at the next date" or philosopher that on 21 December is the beginning of a seven-year period in which the world will end.
Students and teachers are taking the date easy.
Many said they're thinking to go to the feast "of the end of the world."
"If I may call some friends to weeping together," said Samira Ford, a Communications Student for 20 years.
