Scientists found a way to discover parent stars
Astrophics from the University of Californian in Santa Cross have learned the concern and its impact on the chemical unity in star copys.
It is expected that the opening of specialists will be able to search among parent stars, that is one class.
The results of their researchers were published in the Nature magazine, and soon they can be informed on the website of the University.
The cause of the unique chemical composition of nearest stars is the pre-extension of the light of the gas.
Even if the star is born then left a star class, it is possible to determine the place of its birth and the star education region.
Earlier scientists doubts that the evolution of stars outer class could lead to the differences in its chemical content from such a parent in the classer.
The results of the modelling of astrofics show that such differences should not appear.
In their research, the specialists with the super-computer have shared two flows of inter-related gas, which together formed clouds.
This object for several million years is transformed to a class that begins to be educated.
Scientists added rock-metics to initial gas streams and set out that, through the fast careful displacement in the cloud, the high stage of chemical unity was reached.
As astrophysis, their research shows that stars can be searched for chemical composition as well as to determine possible regions of education of such objects.

It was very American idea that work rights were human rights.
The Congressmans, Kit Ellison and John Luis, proposed a draft law which protected the prosecutors as a civil law.
"Where is the work of the middle class", said Ellieson, a democracy of Minnesotes, who is Co-Chairman of the Congress of the Progress Federation.
That's why I am fiercely presenting the Act on enlargement of the rights of workers together with a symbol of movement for civil rights by John Luis.
This newsletter legislation will provide the same legal opportunities with the discrimination of the prosecutors, which is also with other forms of discrimination by ceasing the forces of opposite prosecutors
Change the Labour Regular Act so that the employees involved with discrimination to participate in the prosecution organization, seek justice in civil courts and compensation of damage and payment is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is unfortunately not the radio initiative, at least in the United States standards.
In fact, the best way to be discovered in the proposed by Elison, Luis and the draft lawyers, to remember the very American thought.
Despite the attacks undertaken by prosecutions in the past years, in Visconne, Michigan and other states throughout the country, Americans once supported the country of the world to enlarge, enlarge and respect for labour rights.
It was time that millions of Americans still remember when this country had defended the democracy, the freedom of word, the freedom of printing and the right to organization.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, Dung McArtur General and his assistants helped the country to adopt the Constitution established so to ensure that the military warmed Hidsy Automation was replaced by democracy.
As acknowledged that workers and their professionals play a role in forming a New Japan, they included the text directly recognized that "right workers to organization and negotiations and collective actions are guaranteed."
When the United States were occupied by Germany after the Second World War, Dweitt, and his assistants helped the Germans to write the Constitution, which guaranteed that the Fashism Adolph Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.
As acknowledged that workers should be organized and listed in a new State, Germans included an open article: " The right to educate associations in order to protect and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each person and every professional or area.
Agreements which restrict or attempt to harm it will not have legal force; measures aimed at these objectives will be recognized against laws.
When the former Chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which was formed by the World Declaration on Human Rights in 1948, adopted by the Organization of the Joint Nations as a universal agreement, Roosevelt and the Composers included the guarantee that " any person has the right to organize and enter into the prosecution for their interests."
The generations of the Americans have been based on the human rights of workers.
When the country has consulted other countries about how to create civil and democratic societys, the Americans explained that the right to the prosecution and that the prosecution should be protected as an equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government institutions.
Now, when these rights are attacked in America, wisely, to return to the American idea that people working should have the right to organization and that their votes are heard in free and open society.
As the favorite Martin Luther King said 50 years ago,
History is a great teacher.
Everyone now knows that the proselytical movement has not been driving the power of the nations, but has increased them.
The highest degree of millions, the prosecutors wonderfully created markets for industriality and highlighted the nationality at an unrealised production level.
Those who attack prophesy forget these simple truths, but the story will remember them.
History will remember how to do.
Official recognition of workers as human rights and enhance civil rights to prevent discrimination against the organization of prosecutors has been long ago.
Kit Ellison and John Luis renew the ideas that have storyly expanded America and promised democracy to reality.
The court is timely blocking the law that could close all craft clips in Louisian
In the United States, the Federal Court of Justice had temporarily blocked the introduction of the law of Louise, which his parties said that he would, moreover, close all five arbitral clinics in the state.
According to this way, which was signed to the execution of the Governor Louisisan Bobbie Janedle in June and had to be entered into force on 1 September, the doctors who do abortion were obligation to have the full acceptance of patients in the hospital in a radio of 30 miles from their practices.
Nevertheless, the decision of the judge means that the doctors can continue to do legal acts, continually looking for such powers.
"The persons will be allowed to work legally, continuing the ability of enforcement," wrote the judge John de Greewalz in his decision.
The hearing will be appointed for a month in which the judge shall make a more constant decision in accordance with this law.
The right to an attorney had met with gladness this decision, the latest decision against similar measures, saying that it will give the doctors more time to obtain hospital powers.
"The present decision ensures that women of Louise will be protected from a criminal law that seeks to leave their health and rights," said Nancy Nortap, President and manager of the Reproductive Rights Center, which had the ground of the ceiling of the law from three of the five clients of the State.
It was not immediately clear if the decision was to be taken to doctors from two clinics that did not speak to the case and also made a comprehensive acceptance statement.
Louisa entered into 11 States who have adopted such laws and the courts recently recognized such non-constitutional measures in Alabama and the Mission.
The key parts of the Taimark Act, which would close most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked federal judges in Friday.
The barriers for the right to anatr together with the American acquirers college and Genokolavs and the American Medical Association said that the laws on acceptance laws are imposed to doctors unnecessary medicines.
The lawyers expressed that such measures are aimed at the protection of women ' s health, although some also noted their positive effect in the clitorial closure.
Only one doctor who makes anarts in Louisian has a complainant in the hospital, reported the Reproductive Rights Centre.
If all the remaining doctors in the state are forced to stop implementing the procedure, the doctor, fearing its security, had stopped implementing this procedure, reported the group.
Critically, the officers of Louise said that they would not punish doctors who do abortion until their complaints were expected to decide.
What is the introduction of cotton to domestic products
Nevertheless, half of the products in the field of trade networks should be Russian production, the Deputy of the Hospital Russian Fraction Oleg Nilo.
The parliamenter has prepared a draft legislation aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers.
The document will still be detailed to avoid the possible disclosure for buyers.
This is about goods that are not produced in Russia, and on the other groups of products produced in Russia, the Ritter must provide less than half of its posts to the own producers," reported Nile.
However, amended in article 10 per cent of the implementation of products made in Russia is the draft law, which amended the National Code of NGOs to be degraded by 10 per cent.
The idea of putting 50 per cent of trade networks into the package of promoting measures for Russian producers.
There are several times more personal products.
However, the initiative may have a positive and negative effect, the experts say.
According to the lawyer of the Logician company, a member of the independent expert centre of Lithuania ' s Opinion' Sergey, for Russian economy, as well as for the natural agricultural and food sector, will be a positive nature and will lead to growth.
The farmers, farmers, small stores are in the area.
They can sell more, and that means the winner grows.
Furthermore, they will have the right to deal with the ritleer’s conditions and prices, as they will have to buy their goods.
Russian producers will increase their activities and sales, which will lead to higher wages than before.
This will increase income, establishing new workplaces, which are starting to increase, which is faster, will be increased to growth in HIV.
The independence of Russia from foreign food is declined in a few times, indeed, not immediately," notes the expert.
The previous Russian enterprises could not frequently be tried to shelter local stores because of high competition from foreign analogies.
Now, after the introduction of the Embargo, the poverty was free and can be easy.
But it should not be forgotten that after all necessary agreements and sanitary checks on the Russian market, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia have been made.
In other words, now it was the "moment of sweet," when the old players have gone away and the news haven't come.
The first Vice-President of the General Public Organization of the Russian Financial Club of Directors said that it was almost a month after that, as well as the growth of the prices for the preparation of the production, it has been said to AF.ru.
Indeed, the idea of selling in each category as at least 50 per cent of the Russian food products will be able to strengthen the sector for local producers.
In that case, they will comply with each other, not with the goods that are subject to the other State are delayed.
In other words, the purchasing fight is divided between the companies working under the single laws of the sale.
On the other hand, Caciano notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the internal needs of consumers far from all articles.
And in this situation, trade networks will take place from the share of Russian goods to half assets.
In this regard, the risks are increased that the borrows have been made.
It may be added to an expert under the form of Russia's foreign products with overwhelmed ethics.
The negative effect of the introduction of cows feel large trade networks, particularly those that are intended to cooperate with importers.
Loyal that foreign providers are also at the same time, since their product request is declined.
Lithuania does not exclude that the law on cowboats on parental goods may also be reflected on consumers.
The fact is that some Russian production products can arise on the quality of import similars, while stores can increase prices to the second, such as deficits.
On the forgotten ideas of the import of economics in the beginning of the year of the year, reiterated in February of that year because of the pollution of rock was not stopped.
At the background of the Western ' s shorter relations is now more active.
The law is invited to binding rituals in the form of orders to provide providers to be considered with certain producers.
Then we'll go through the way to import, and the production planning system will be created in a shorter time," says the Deputy Oleg Nilo.
A particularly effective contribution mechanism will be for agricultural sectors, where the capacity is particularly high, for example, in the molecule where 25 per cent of import is imported.
Our farmers are really capable of covering Russian shops.
Furthermore, the powerful impuls can obtain local production.
As known, the maximum amount of imports remains from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.
It is about 65-70 per cent to Russian production."
The experts are viewed that the invoice of cotton for domestic products is able to facilitate the import and can accelerate the process.
However, this initiative will not bring its own initiative, since it is necessary to comply with measures, Lithuania.
In any case, 50 per cent of the products sold in accordance with this initiative may be brought from the border, and it means that the full import will not happen, but significant steps in this direction will be made.
In addition, the cows should still be configured in the country of production of domestic products to implement these cows.
The data of the cows as a time such guarantees and are provided by the experts.
The timely set diagnosis and lack of access to optimism treatment means that nuclear cancers in rural areas are more killing
Angela Joley and her brother James have published videos of their peaceful mother who died from the brain cancer in 2007.
Women who live in the agriculture of Australia have a higher risk of death than the driving cancer than those in the city.
Researchers analyzed the disease cards more than 1100 Australian women with the "krobols" diagnosis in 2005, found that 35 per cent had continued five years after the diagnosis.
The leading researcher Suezen Jordan from the QIMR Berghofer medical research Institute reported that the possibility of die during research at 20 per cent above those living in regions and distant places than those in urban areas.
NEBOUR ISSLIEDORATION: New medicines can decrease the cancer of light and nuclear cancers
Researchers followed the medical way of women for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of women at the time of the diagnosis decision, the cancer cancer of nuclears, the present diseases and social status also affected the probability of survival.
Women's older age and those in the later stage at the time of the diagnosis decision had the lowest survival rate.
For those who lived in regions or distant places, the probability of die during research was 20 per cent above than those living in urban areas.
Although research was not designed to determine why women living outside the towns, more likely to die from the nuclear cancer cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that the timely set diagnosis and the absence of access to optimistic treatment were possible factors.
"The disease is better to be treated by chirurgics specialised on hynological ecology, and they are mainly in large cities," she said.
In spite of improvement of the quality of the steredic services to reduce the impact of the distance, it suggested that increased number of travel services allowing specialists to be treated closer to the home and support programmes for people who govern from their home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that, independently from geographical provision, the research found that a long-term life expectancy between women with nuclear road was rare, underlined the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
Research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer is published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, 33 years old, a young mother with the Gold Coast Elish Nive said that she had an aggressive cancer form.

The inflation went out of the release.
Whether Russian growth of prices feels
As a result of the override sanctions of RF and Western inflation in Russia will be accelerated and not included in the prognosis of the authorities convinced by the BTB Capital Analysis.
According to the view of experts, the effects of anticipation will lead to the inflation shoe in the first quarter of 2015, RBC Daily.
According to the past planning of Minnesome Development, the inflation in 2014 was 6.5-7.5 per cent, in the next year and less than 6.5 per cent.
However, according to the newspaper "Commersant!" this week, the smaller but principles should be adjusted to macroeconomic progress until 2017.
According to the publication, the state may reduce inflation assessment for 2015, which allows to eliminate the expectation of the growth of the population.
It was expected that the food sanctions of RF operate a year until August 2015.
How could such a high inflation have been made?
The current situation provides a small shock, but the decrease of inflation will not be changed," said the source of the newspaper in Minnesone.
The ITB Capital economy does not share the financial and economic expectations of Government ' s inflation and forbidden the growth of prices in 2014 at 8 per cent.
The main effect of product prohibitions will be together with the possible introduction in the RF regions of sales (NSP) in 2015.
The 9 per cent of the inflation peak will be at February, and then the price growth rates will be overcome, experts will be paid.
But last week, Rossst gave first inflation events after the RF had introduced "aquarium sanctions".
AF.ru requested experts and explained their inflation expectations.
Artem Dev, Chief of the Analytic Department of FC AForex:
The growth of the price is already observed by the main segments of goods.
Furthermore, when social significant products have been affected, the Government was forced to start the system monitoring of price stability in order to prevent the risks of unnecessed price increase in a short-term perspective.
Prosecutors and rituals are already marked daily before regulatory bodies so that the authorities may know exactly who, if and for what reason it initiates increased prices.
The key factors of growth of consumer prices have continued to remain in the position of the capital rate, the exchange refinance of the bank sector from the Russian Megargular, the internal conversion on the cause of population's run to foreign currency, and the embargo for the transport of food products from countries related to sanctions against Russia.
If inflation pressure remains under control, the value of the minimum product set would not be 12 per cent to one quarter.
The import of food products has facilitated the shock of proposals on the internal market and has made a logical increase in the cost.
Since the current phase we are not fully launching import mechanisms, and also enhance the sustainability of the Russian market through internal production, the sanctions continue to have the risk of growth of the inflation combined.
If there are still physical reasons that have been added to the absence of confidence to the national currency, as well as degraded economic growth, the inflation is fully exceeding 8 per cent of this year.
Alexander Scientist, Director of Alpery's Analytic Department
In the 1990s, inflation has sometimes reached 20-30 per cent in the month, and in the past it was also above the current level, the other case, which then has increased fast economic growth.
I think that inflation is 8,8,5 per cent during the year.
Platon Maguta, UNHCR 'Fond Maguta'
The external factor related to sanctions against Russia until it is successful, but if the pressure is further improved, especially in the financial sector, it may lead to certain difficulties and increase inflation expectations that usually are traditionally produced in the buys of a single ball to enhance their conservation.
It may be suggested that the Government, the CFC and the Financial Ministry are trying to reduce the flavouring of rocks, as well as market methods and public regulation.
But the growth of the price begins traditionally after the end of the age and it may be more sensitive.
The aim level of consumer inflation in Russia was 7.5 per cent, moreover, as RF provides further financial coverages.
The centres are decreased by the decrease of the households
Thus, a result of the exclusive reduction of the number of households at least 35 years, may lead to the fact that the garden centres start to lose tens of millions per year when the current youth consumers had reached the "based age of garden" in accordance with HTA investigation reported by financial Times.
According to this report, the persons who disbursed the housing are deemed to the average of 55 per cent of the amount that owners of their own homes are paid to the garden.
It is mentioned that the increase in the number of people living in high-urbanized areas, the popularity of the palaces in front of the house for park and the reduction of the garden size as other factors that have damage to grow, the annual sales amount of which, according to the assessment, is £5 billion.
In Great London, where the number of households fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in the age, the lowerest rate of trace for gardens for households.
HTA and the Kingdom Guarantee Society reported that the apartment of housing and absence of space for garden was not meaning that people could not grow up.
Gay Barter, the Main Guarantee Council at RHS, said: "The growth in containers, for example, in particular popular to actors who can transport growth with themselves when they move."
The HTA report has defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "soft autum" trade of goods for the garden resulting in increased numbers of households and economic prosperity from the end of 1980 to the middle of 1990.
It also suggests that the markets will improve in this year by a better metal after unrepensed conditions in March and April of the past year.

Nevertheless, half of food products in trade networks should be Russian production, the Hosдум Deputys consider.
They have developed a draft legislation on this subject.
This is to bring changes to page 8 of the CF on the basis of public trade regulation in RF and the National Code.
The goal of the document is to introduce protection measures against the Russian food producers.
It is important to clarify, in accordance with the law, at least 50 per cent of the store production products must be according to the goods.

The first day of the wedding is marked by mockets and wind conditions in the airport of Adelida
The EU has prepared a cold sorcery in southern Australia, bringing flood rain and strong winds that flew on the fields of the Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain came into the city to the evening 9, after 6.6 mm that came out in the evening night.
The last rain had previously been a couple of short olive oils with a patent wind, including a rain that started up to 8 evening and grew approximately 4 mm for 10 minutes.
Following the early wedding in the past week, the temperature fell again to the maximum of 15.8C in the city.

Evaluation of building objects in RF will happen in new
The prices, the building regulation and the challenges of linking the Federal Anti-Party Service are particularly monitored.
The EFSA has established an expert Council for the development of the competition in a constructive area.
At its meeting, the Chapter of Control of WCH, construction and natural resources, FAS Woodwim, said that "the annual calculation of the estimates of construction objects is absolutely unrealised."
The standard base makes the price of non-transparent and may lead to an unnecessed construction price in the AFC.
The cost of the construction of hospitality objects at the projecting stage is proposed to define on the basis of the market prices of constructive decisions, instead of the estimated standards and unit estimates for Technology Operations.
These proposals are included in the "Hot Card" and are now in the ministry.
"The replacement of traditional documentation in the construction of constructive elements should lead to less corruption in the field, explaining the "RGB" of the WHO.
It is now smooth every bottle and gay, and it is not always likely to be checked, so the time in documentation of unlimited construction companys can be copied "pleasant traders".
In a ministry, the FAS agrees.
"Increased transition costs for constructive elements are already: it is developed methods for calculation of prices to constructive decisions, the target of the indicators, – said the "RGB" head of the Department of the Graduate Training and Architecture of Elena Jucuy.
As a pile chosen area of road construction.
However, experts believe that the problem is more serious.
As the "RGB" chapter of the construction company "Profession" Anatolai Demaniaco said, the sharp standards have been deployed long, but another business mechanism has not yet been proposed.
"What is about the proposed building element calculations, it is difficult to realize, since in the building of the building, different technologies are usually used," he believes.
It is not a secret that the carrier is developed in a lot thanks to the guest.
According to the President of the NGO Governance of the Experience Community of Professional Professional Trainings, Ecatherine of Lezyan today is the State the most expert prosecutor.
The Ingenieure Director of the Rosatam Armymond Malahov Capital building centre noted that the markets today were divided on a company which had access to the contract port, and the companys who have monopolies and unlimited competences on this field.
He believes that the establishment of a transparent market may only be provided in the condition that access to contracts will be limited to any manager impact.
The expert Board was proposed to establish the system of the guest so that the same executive was not right to receive more than 1 billion EUR or more contracts for more than 1 billion.
The ministry believes that this approach should be assessed with the impact of business and the effective management of construction.
As Elena Juck explained, there would be a complaint to the executive functions, which would lead to increase the number of chargers and budgetary expenditures on its content.
In this regard, the experts should have knowledge that allows to assess the quality of implemented undertakings, as well as their security.
In the case of such disasters, it will be necessary to determine who will respond to the security of the object in general.
Furthermore, this approach may cause high-qualified guest parties to the uninterest in the receipt of a State order for unpleasant work and a small contract amount.
The complaint of the Institute of Alexand Evashesks' advised that the Hospital Procedure has now been converted in a business game to the holder's career.
And he made this example: "Party at the completion of a claim should indicate "concluding indicators" without an indication: "or equivalent," "because," "before", "more"," "anolog", "and not above," "not allowed" and "not below".
Thus, the prosecutors often abuse their right to impose the requirements of the application provided by subordinate organizations.
Another problem of the 44-FS was considered by the European opinion that it was necessary to assess further at the stage of the claim for quality of work through the proposal of the party.
In explanation of the application of the Party, the applicant can only assess the qualification of the applicant but not the quality of the work to which it has not yet come, it is the expert.
The quality of work can only be evaluated when they accept.
The expert Council was also proposed to transfer the marginal income from the top to the lower ecleon to disappear interim perpetrators.
The Chairman of the expert Council, Articles Secretariat, Deputy Covenant of the United Kingdom, considers that it is not important to do so, since the complaint of the mandate should be granted by the Chief.
Anyway, the known representation of Ryan "Atel" is: "What's the powders of the claim?"
Israeli children return to school after war in the Gaza Sector
Every Israeli children in the territory, near the Gaza Sector, went again to school on Monday after the season in the bomb, when roads and mines were caught on their visits during a 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza sector remained closed while the territory was restored after wars.
The beginning of school employment has been a feeling of gladness and concerns of those suffering from the railways of South Israel, but the follow-up of battle actions remained green.
In the south city Ashdod, the child garden ' s officers of Pashsh, in which rocked the railway, took the follow-ups from the wall and the children’s guests before the coming of the students.
"We're a little afraid, but with glad viewing the future," said Ronnit Bart, the inhabitant of Kiboc Saad, and the teacher of English in his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to the greatest life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shenny Bart, said that once again to go to school, "a little strange."
"It was a difficult time, and we didn't go out of our houses," she said.
The President Reuven Rivlin visited the kiburs that were located away from Gaza to express its support.
Before the fire ceasing agreement has stopped war last week, thousands of border seats, such as Sad, have not gone out on the street or left their homes, have gone away more secure areas from the Gaza sector to save rail and minimised fire.
Many of the inhabitants of Nahall Oz, away from Gaza, where the Palestinian mine was killed four years old, are sure they must return.
The Ministry of Education reported that approximately 1nd families have not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at this time.
The Prime Minister Benyamin Nathanyahu visited the school in Sdertot, a city of the border of Gaza, which was strongly dismissed from the Palestinian fire.
He encouraged the children to learn hardly and said: "We will do everything that is possible to give you knowledge and to secure your security."
Israel and Hamas agreed to be irremised in the past Sunday.
The fire ceasing agreement immediately put an end to battle, however, the unlimited issues remained key, for example, the Hamas ' s demand for the abolition of the Egyptian and Israeli block of Gaza and the opening of airports and marine ports in the Gaza sector.
Israel wants to make Hamas arms to return the body of two Israeli soldiers died in war.
It is expected that the new stage of non-direct negotiations will begin later in Egypt in the month.
In war, more than 2100 Palestinians died, between three four were peaceful citizens and at least 494 children, according to the evaluation of the Palestinian and the United Nations.
Israel summarises these figures and states that at least the half of the slaughter were slaughters, but he did not provide significant evidence that it was approved.
For Israel, 66 soldiers and six peacekeeping people died, including one secret worker.
During the war of Hammas and other Gaza fighters, 4591 Rail and mines for Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
Israel’s army, at the time, conducted more than 50,000 aircrafts and other assets.
As a result, the Israeli attacks were detruyed and destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza sector, and 25,00,000 were found a survival at more than 100 schools that were transformed in vacants.
Since the tens of thousands have still been in hospitals and fears continued, officials who have responded to education have retained the beginning of a year of education.
"I hope that school is soon opened that we can complete our education as children of the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammed Amara, a 13-year boy who lives in one of the Gazi school.
According to the popular criteria, prices for non-mobility have shown the maximum winter growth for seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Housing index for the housing price in Australian table increased by 1,1 per cent in August, reported the RP data on the afternoon.
The growth has resulted in June, July and August 4,2 per cent, the largest increase in winter from 2007.
Annual growth was 10.9 per cent, more than two months higher than 12 months to August 2013, but an increase was not equally distributed in the country.
The Research Director of the RP Data Tim Loules reported that Sidon and Melbourne were conducting two-quarter markets.
The RP Data figures show that the living prices in Sindi have increased 16.1 per cent in the past year, while 11.7 per cent in Melbourne.
The following markets were Adelida, Britain and Darwin, where the prices in average increased from five to six per cent.
On the other end of the scope, Canberra had resulted in the Government ' s reduction costs, where prices were increased by 1,4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lowleis said that now when the spring started, an increase in the number of non-mobility designed for the sale will be observed during the following months that will be "suased test" for the market.
"Assuring the current high level of airline speed, the total high speed of sales and the current conditions with a low percentage rate, it is likely that living value is still increased in the following three months," he said.
How people live in the old house of Uphs
In the former Gold Industrial House of Edokim and his son Iwan Damide on the street of the Watch Tower Revolution 57/1 (leaving the Great Cazayan) 18 apartments.
The XVIII - century house has not been changed if it does not consider gladness.
Related people are here as an excursion, and people are more happy than their privileges are the right to live in an old Uphymic house, whose walls are remembered by the captain of Alexander Suvorve.
The dates of the household’s construction are indirectly shown on two dates 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, the building is received without a little 300 years.
An old court, always opened the door, crying the boat.
The doors in the apartment are close to each other, the walls were shot, and the roads are seen in the light of the road.
It seems that it's all right to say.
And the inhabitants believe, "You don't think it is."
Living in the 16th century’s 16th - says Tatjan Lukavan, inhabitant of the apartment No. 3.
The object is on the hospital, but the money for its content is not decaded by ten years, and we feel museum exempts of which authorities have just forgotten.
The last revolution was 40 years ago.
The stars are still bad, but the foundation has all been prevailed.
Many inhabitants are still in the street, and praying at a week in the public bathroom.
How can you be free in such conditions?
The road walks directly under the windows, not even a peak zone.
The mother moves the news.
Now it appears that it was just heard: under the windows there is a flow of cars.
See, the scene is constantly drunk, the windows can't open, and the noise is high.
But a man belongs to all things, to good and evil.
Our apartment is still educated, thanks to the husband, his hands are golden.
Furthermore, we're two rooms, we live with a son.
In other families, a lot of worse, at the second stage, there are less than half meters of higher.
The Territorian Contract proposes to go to the neighbourhood of the apartment No. 6 Humans of the Old.
A pleasant hospital woman from the time proposes a coffee cup and tells:
We have a unique apartment, 14.5 m2 for four persons, so we live with a husband and a daughter with a kid.
I've never been here since the birthday, the other housing was never, the man's eyes of the room: the antitreols, two wondered letters "g"; one of them was contained with a bottle.
It's very close and little different from the usual parent interface: only slides of beautiful, "historic".
But with the plot, the water supply system is not needed anywhere.
Humans are talking about his apartment at home and wonderfully on the same time as the Italian house where the Roman roads stand.
So there is a very old and recent, daily and legend one:
Produced approximately 40 years ago during the last revolution.
Then they made us a small kitchen in a cocket and a tunnel from the former Cholana.
We live in the second stage where Damide was home with the family, in the second stage of the servants.
Our apartment hasn't been arrested, right?
The Office of Inmobilities said that the Privacy has no value.
Yet, we can't accept only one-party, we can't make any more.
Four months ago, they promised to distribute us, but the promise has not gone.
I wasn't obliged to smile and I'm not.
In this apartment, my grandmother and my dad and my dad, my dad and my dad and my dad, I lived with my husband and my daughter.
Everything was for that time.
For example, healthy crises flew into the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the film, they're a meter thickness!
They say the ship was delayed in the eggs, so it's keeping so long.
The house is basically designed, thanks to the Damide!
It is likely that only so until no one had killed those who had slaughtered the slaughter or their own.
Only the building is slowly died in our eyes: the teeth and the lie house hurts, the balls are unremovable, we've had the cement, but it's not useful, but it's not useful.
They say, there's under our hidden lace and move to the River White, which has done specially some time here old to be hidden from the danger, in any case.
They have been persecuted.
The old man tells how some story came to them, he asked to start in the apartment of the discovery.
And then I urged to give them a job to exchange herself at October.
History said:
Where are we in one Thursday?
And here there's some crazy hope that will give a living more space.
We agree to exchange, we wouldn't have gained anymore.
Nevertheless, the family of the Olds did not win.
The greatest dream of man's dreams to distribute them, and the daughter of the 16-year-old girl gave a single room.
Thus, there are two families who have a two-commerce apartment instead of the greatest roads in which two generations are now living.
The symbolic, ministry girl Olessa Carsak from the apartment No. 11 and 12 shows the second stage of the house.
There are two close rooms of the general area of 23 m2, named apartments.
We have seven people, two kids.
You see what circumstances.
The steel is disappeared by tails like windows, walls on the kitchen and rooms.
The water in the last round year is only cold.
Following the ancient home of Ufa, it is possible to make sure that more lucked by Laurentiv's marriage from the apartment No. 4.
They take the first stage space rooms.
You're right, a lot of place!
The location in 75 square square, written three people.
We live as once in the rooms where Suvors remained during their stay in Ufe, says the head of Alexander Dmitrivich Lavern's family.
The pools are high, slow.
One bad -- all around the shoes, disappeared, is broken.
Sossedi must have already been told!
Most hurts we have with half: the trees shot out, the land was literally gone out of the feet.
I put a shot, a climb, nothing else in the room, and in the other room, we walk like we're looking at the kitchens, so much of the stuff.
On the house of Edokim Damidus Alexander Dmitrivich, it is better for any excursion.
The golden industrialist relates to a family, speaking of him with exquisition.
Actually, personality was unrealised: the Kagin and Usians had built a house, disappeared the roads and the collar, holded the Urial guards.
The heirs of the purchasing non-modality are angry, but they don't want to live under one crowd with a story.
I've been here a kid, in the 40th century, says Alexander Dmitrivich.
Then there were wooden buildings for cards, horses and card buildings, afterwards made.
In 1968, they wanted to take our house, but something was missed...
History was repeated in 2014: a new resident was again launched.
We, as a team, gathered all documents, gained the needed institutions and immediately found that the transfer to the apartment was transferred to 2015 or 2016.
Something don't believe in all this...
Two years ago, Laurenians went to the Ministry of Cultural Republic of Bascorton to know about the courts of home.
The chiefs were not taken.
We sent from one table to another, and then, as in the laugh, they put a bottle without signing and printing: "The Master of Cultural is not oppressed against the disappearance of the inhabitants."
I even got this feeling that our house had no longer been in the city plan, since first he was under the 57, and then it became 57 A, and now 57/1.
Like it was already in the 70s.
The Russian Planet turned to the informed information-analytic management sector for the land resources of the Ufs of Virmira Barbara.
The Occ.b. Revolution 57/1 was included in the Full Wood Division Programme.
I can't respond to the workers of the 70-year-old, I know only that there was a plan to compare all old homes, despite historical value.
Successfully, this has not happened, and the decision of the modern authorities is to resume all the old houses on the Occident Revolution, representing the architectural value, successfully implemented.
Inhabitants are soon planned to be divided in new apartments.
According to Barbarash, the house of Demidi will be Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
It is now in Italy a architectural binary, and the "Star Uf" project presents there, including others.
I hope that all the old Caza Street will be arrested by 2016, says the leader.
The house will be accepted by the one that was before three centurys ago.
Damiday's house will be a museum open to all those who want.
Furthermore, the Government has decided to make a road during the outcoming days of peak.
Unfortunately, there will be too large loading in the town.
In 2015, it was promised to raise people from the future museum of Armymond.
Nevertheless, they will remain free: their new apartments will be the same area as the present.
Only the other episode.
A forest fire began in the Empire because of the cruelness of the forest.
The smoke became the cause of the forest railing in the territory of the Holocaust Forest Zone of the Primor Area.
The group of forces and resources is enhanced.
According to the KHSBU 'S Premor Aviabaza' guide, the air forces created on the place of the rail conditions require the accession of air forces.
Vivilius Mediterraneus, Vice-President of Aviabazi:
A fire in a difficult place was discovered by a busy aircraft in the 3-ector area.
The rest of the tree on the old garden.
The powerful disappearance of the territory and the smoke of more than 45 degrees, the absence of an opportunity to diamonds of fire-flowing areas create significant complexities in the tunnel.
We need analytic Mi-8.
The allocation of the powers of the aircraft by Mi-2 aircraft and the An-2 aircraft is very weak.
Four flowers have been operating after discovering warming on the place of the smoke.
The main task of specialists is the detection of warmth and the preparation of the area to provide additional forces and resources of warming.
In the area of dinners, the Ohotokia heat was additionally added to 3 decades of fire.
Only if the aircraft plane is prepared, the specialists will be moved to the spot place, it is reported on the Prior Bank Administration.
My dad never understood me.
I never said, "I love you"
Henry was one of the seventh children born in the family of immigrants from Jamaica in Dadley in Middens in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, was working on the factory, and their relations were limited.
Henry repairs the "Radi's Radial Platin" which is partly based on the imaged discussions with his father and grew up from the series of transmissions to the radio 4.
Sundtruk is a rigs and a ripa, and the melods are lives.
However, Henry had to take some difficult memories of childhood.
After his mother's death, he was a new treatment, but Henry is often talking about relations with his father.
He was very unable.
You've never seen his face, you've just heard his voice, "Stop up.
Get away from the sister.
Let's go!
I want to look out crying.
My older brothers, Simor and Gilton, who were adult when I was a child, went to the pop and talked about such things as the form of a drinking stack, the beauty of the crystal.
I never talked to him so.
He was such an unlawful guy in an angle who readed a large part of my life.
Hey, recently, opened a Literature Master in Dadley, and although the conditions became better than in the days of his father, he was able to look at what should be his life.
There's a little bit better, but they're dark, smoke, dark labirin's labirin's labirin's oversight with the fire and the damage and the swimming powder.
My father fell in the bathroom and just laughed there, and you heard how he slowly began to cry about yourself because he wanted to get away from the lithic master.
When I came there, I understood what he did these years and years to work for us to triumph, and I began to appreciate him more.
However, Henry went out of the child of the nursed parents' love.
My dad never understood, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom became bad at the end of her life, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Frank, allowed him to share the love that he had not lacked in childhood.
Can you stop it "I love you?"
Just stop climbing me!
Dad, I'm 22!
Don Frank.
Why don't I get to marry her?
She's a great mother.
They're still good friends with Frank who was married for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why don't I get a wife with Don?
She's a great mother.
Henry's mother had a demon.
He was one of the things he killed her.
So, when I'm very, I've really corrected and I've got the symptoms of the diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.
Then I started a serious job of Physsis, and I also had to sit on a close child to escape the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And that's funny.
Nobody eats marty.

His television carrier started in the middle of the seventy: "I was the only black/comic of television."
He learned the work.
I was not only supposed to grow up in the public, but I had to learn to be an effective shopping car between 1975 and 1985, being a star, television work, and it was very hard.
Lennie in New Persons in 1975
Since his manager had the right to the "Bright and white show of mines," a easy deployment program in which people "which themselves," Henry found it for five years.
My family did not like it.
I mean, I wouldn't want that to never be with me, but I'm not sorry I did it.
Although it was a strange, worthy of a conviction, I worked in the large areas and learned to work with a throat.
But what was the "learn reward of a easy deployment class for the British Television year and year" was and the "grote paddy to black people."
As a result of the culture of black coasts in the United Kingdom, Henry worked in an alternative project in the eighteenth.
The first scene of Shaw Lenny Henry was translated in 1984, and in the ninth year he was known, among the others, he was head of the Great Blok of the Commised Chaff.
Related roles, documentary films, televisions and roles in the movie took the next ten years of his life, but after his series of BBC in 2008 "LennyHenry.tv", he said, "What are you going to do further, Len, because it seems a lot that you're going to take time or to hurt the side."
There was a series of documentary transfers to Radio 4, named "What's good to...?"
The first was Shakespeare.
I had a real alergy to Shexpira.
You can't tell me that at school, and I thought it's, in many cases, prejudice white people from the middle class with colleagues and captain down.
So I was very afraid of him.
All of whom we took an interview for transfer, Peter Hall, Trevor Nan, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You must try.
Don't hurt it until you don't know what you're talking about.
Listen to some of these words, and you know why we're all like Shakespeare.
Henry's 20 rows from the last monology of Welllo for documentary transfer, and it was shot.
I felt a feeling that I can.
Whatever I've been going to do is my head.
"What this is, this is a serious case, in turn to this serious, endeavouring its text, a small study.
So, the repair process was hard, and I read this pizza months and months before we set it.
And she had success.
It seemed they were waiting for the catastrophes, and she didn't happen.
Soon we started "The Communication of Errors."
Soon I was in the National Theater, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
It was one moment I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
The technical disorder came, and Henry institutively felt that his business was to get public.
"The voice inside me said, "You'll have to work 10 minutes until they're making a computer."
Instead of that recorder, the assistant declared that the presentation would be renewed when the problem would be resolved.
I went away from the wall and said, "Oh, glory of God."
It's not my responsibility.
I can allow someone else to disappear.
"You're playing a pizza, stay in the role."
Henri's in the "Back" theatre of Daces
Teaching the text for the 'Backet' was difficult.
The patient's quite useful, it strengthens the muscle.
She also took good, so it was a sign above that he said, "Whatever you have to do?"
He says this, of course, by the vote.
So I'll keep it.
I really love it.
I like to be in the repair hall.
However, Henry's still thinking of the comic is the whole way of our conversation overlooking his humor when he starts, then it's finished to be born.
I just decided not to work in the walldape, because this thing with the get of an immediate reward from the full room of the strangers, I think it's quite dangerous.
If you're trying to do that all the time, it can bring it to a bitch.
I'm sometimes working in the "Apol" Emirate," when I want, but, mostly, I don't get such pleasure as before.
I'm asking if he's gonna give the tour again.
It's glad to sit in a location with a reciproc who helps to bring the form of the start, the middle and the end of the way, I don't think I't want to never to disappear.
So this is his new power?
I think so.
I like to be a acter.
It's a nice murder.
You're always telling a story and here a great place for this.
I love history.
People love history.
Katie registers public officials to identify "invisible workers"
Katie started the biometric registration of all public officials attempt to remove "invisible workers" from the payment of the Government.
In the Government declaration, the employers who are not registered during the next two weeks will not be paid.
The Government is understood that thousands of people continue to receive payment after they have left the public service.
The President of Uuru Kenyata promised to reduce the corruption in public structures after coming to the authorities in 2013.
The audio audit has discovered at least $1 million ($700000) in the month by payment of " unvided workers" and other financial violations.
The Government understood that the payments continue to be paid on bank accounts, even after a person died or released the public service, reports the BBC reporter of the Chebusiari table, Nairobi.
All public officers should appear during the next two weeks in the identification centres to ensure that their data will be collected through the biometric registration procedure, the Government declaration is reported.
Any who does not make it without a respecting reason will be exempted from the payment status shall be reported to it.
"The procedure has significantly facilitated the rationalization of the public service, defining the actual multitude of public officials, and will also be used to facilitate payment status at both levels of Government, so it will put the end of the problem of "insecurity workers", said Ann Viguur, Secretary of the Office of Ministers of Planning and Structuration.
Decade of Turkish police arrests against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey for suspicion in the " Government Trade" reported local information agencies.
The representatives of the police had not immediately commented this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high officials reported by Hurriet David Newz.
Some of them, last December, participated in corruption identifying activities aimed at verifying Government officials, including four Government Ministers.
In July, a number of Turkish police were arrested by suspecting the establishment of a organized criminal group and the hearing of the phone.
The Turkish President Regipe Taip Erdogan (which was the Prime Minister) has defined their action as part of the measures taken against him and others, the islamic clire by Fethullah Hulen.
Not all the children returned to Ukrainian school
The schools in most of Ukrainian opened their doors on Sunday (1 September) after birth Canniul.
This day, traditionally, is a great event for families, and, as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, the Prime Minister of Arsjech gave her daughter to school.
There he said to the journalists that not all schools were opened again, but that he would be able to protect the country for future generations:
In the first September, the ceremonium was not going to every school.
There is no peaceful heaven over every part of Ukraine.
We have to fight for the peaceful heaven.
The whole Ukraine, the huge Ukrainian nation front, must fight for the peaceful heaven.
Alex Pastuch, the school director in Slovakia, who went to the daughter of Jazekia, spoke to Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their lives.
The first day of training notes traditionally that children hope high-level roads, holding the air balls and give the colours to their teachers.
In the face of Ronne Firhed BBC, it may have found such an impressive manager that she needs.
It follows the loyalty of the bank business, the SME and the internal tours of the Tori party.
In fact, she has a own experience of work in the guidelines.
Its carrier started in a concerting company on the Bain and Co, and continued in Morgan Stanley, Bombadler, ICI and Pearsons worldwide.
She was the Chief Finance Times for seven years, and went to the rescue when the high post in the Pearson's main company took a swimming colleague.
They say her job is approximately $1 million.
Its political audit is also gone.
She recommended that David Cameron Lord Braun, the former head of BP, when he tried to bring specialists from the private sector to Whithold: she became a Minister Officer.
It's his husband, the former Consequent Tori.
Previously, I called the Chairman of a compared cup in May.
BBC is not only a huge and complex organization in public life, but there is an internal paradox.
The Council has two directions: inside as the highest level of management of the BBC, but I am run as a voice of public concern and concern when something is wrong.
This is almost an insufficient dupole, which requires full radial reform.
However, what new Chairman would be risking to come, detected and destroyed Institute as complex as the Chinese dinosacy if he remains working in this process.
It's a difficult solution.
It would be not so difficult, many will be happy to see how BBC will reduce, after reviewing its power, financial and status.
As the competitors run around and new technologies put out awareness of old customs, the unemployed license value negotiations represent special danger for BBC.
For the humidity of $145.50 in the year, the Britains are defined by the greatest medical business in the world.
BBC tells a good story: it states that the results of its work are covered by 96 per cent of households and each of them every 40p per day.
Furthermore, obviously, Beeb grows: 53 per cent supports it today against 31 per cent of 10 years ago.
BBC's view and use models have changed. Now I'm getting new names on the mobile phone and I'm looking for iPlayer's programs.
But it remains a very popular and comprehensive institution.
He needs a speaker -- I hope it found him.
The Perry from Texas says that the decrease tea was written to somebody's pilot.
Trait from the confirmed actor of the Republic of Rica Perry, the Democratic Prosecutor of the Democrates, which is in the centre of criminal prosecution for the abuse of power.
The train was later removed, and he followed another of the Perry acquired that record was described.
It's just that from my achat's been published a ticket that was written by somebody on a bilateral.
"I don't appreciate this cart, and I took it," she reports later.
Perry assistants did not immediately respond to the communications requested to discuss.
Although the records were loaded from the confirmed actor of Perry, it was not clear who actually performed publication in this area.
Further early, Trevis Lemberg had contained a carrier for the surrounding prosecutor of Travis Lemberg, who had recognized the fault in April 2013.
Perry made an prohibition for the financing of its state when she refused to go to the delay, which brought the great jurisdiction to Ostan in this month against Perry, which was a potential candidate to the President at the election of 2016.
"I don't always smoke a car in the air condition, three times higher the valid alcool level, but when I do, I'm going to be accused by the Governor Perry because he's talking about it."
I'm the biggest democracy in Texas.
The Lamberg Division did not investigate a major jury against Perry.
They were engaged by Michael McKruam, the Special Prosecutor of San Antonio, who was appointed a Representative Judge.
Perry had not recognized himself abused and called the accused of political complaints.
Its powerful legal team requested a judge who was conducting this case to reject the accused act, acknowledged that the law used to pursue the Governor who fulfils his responsibilities more than all of the history of Texas has been contrary to the Constitution.
Perry stopped funding for $7.5 million from the State State Control Division, which is based on the Travis area and is pursuant to the corruption in the Texas public sector, when Lemberg was refused to leave the rescue.
The total complaint has been granted by the public control group with the left views.
The lens of the confirmed actor of Perry is often updated, and sometimes it is a sign.
In 2012, when the Fifth Party was a party to Aiya during his presidency campaign, Perry answered that he could go out of the game and published a thirst with a photo that runs close to the axe, and saying, "We, the South Carl!"

Exclusive breakfast from the new Roan Howard Jakebson on love and the J letter which calls for the crystals
They're growing, better to say so, they gradually disappeared as a card that left under the rain.
The woman sometimes told him that he was too serious, hard in the society, closed, and may be a little anger.
And then she had his hand with her.
He saw anger in himself.
He was an egg, yeah.
The last victim of this curiosity was a small roman, of which he was waiting for more than usually, exemption from a single and miserable life and may even be satisfied.
Elenan Solomonz was a triple of beauty with smoothed hairs and a dry heart from the northern island village, a more desolable and severely than Port Roybe.
She came to the south with an elderly one himself, which Keirr considered her tea, and then the last received heritage in a series, but like a paradise in a valley called the Riya Valley.
Nobody lived in the house a few years.
The thumbs, in the baths, were sitting the powders, left their waves on all windows that are sure that the house belongs to them; the garden is crowned with the skins like the hyganic cows.
It was like a kitchen of a child book, a smooth and shot, with a full secret garden.
Consideration of the author: Howard Jakebson, whose Roman "J" was included in the Book Prize in 2014.
The Chamber will be announced next week
Keirn and Elena sitting in hands, in the slopes of the high grass, awaiting an unexpectedly warm birthday; they were both dissounded with the deep console that had bound the country of the immovable music and encouraging news when he looked at her created corn feet, he remembered the old song of a long-lasting child executive, who loved his father to listen to the house.
You have too big feet.
According to the aggression of them, the songs of such a console have no longer been played.
They were not prohibited -- nothing own was prohibited -- they just didn't go over.
They helped them to become Archive as the word "Arachy".
The general stuff did what would never be able to achieve orders and prescriptions, and as among the books, they chose a memours of disasters who were grown in poverty, culinary books and love roads, from all music they chose a balance.
At the end of this day, Keirn was played at the imaginated forepin and a huge comic voice to make the feet of Elenena.
Ellen didn't understand.
"It was a popular song of a peanist, whose name was Fates Waller," he said to her, he was a car kicked to his two fingers.
So he always did his father to stop the "J" letter before she was going out of his mouth.
It started from the game they played when he was a little.
His father played her with his father as he told him.
Start the word with "J", forget to put two fingers to the rock, and it's going to get you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew that he's waiting for it, here's all.
He was supposed to explain what it was.
Ellen never heard him.
Jazz was not played, although he was not openly prohibited.
Immigration came out of the mode.
In life, there was only one self-shake.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it ends.
The same thing, with the smoothness.
His unprecedented acts on nervous.
It was a dragon expressed by the music.
Although he had reached 10 years old, he had never heard about Sammy Davis Malch, Keir knew about the dad of the parental compact collection.
But even though he didn't have to tell Ailene that Fates Waller was black.
When her age was aged, she remembered the time when the popular brain was not black.
Otherwise, no law or pressure.
The community was listened, and this means that each seminar agreed with thanks to those who were assigned to the judge, with the principle of a group proposal.
The people of African Caribbean origin on the temperature and physical characteristics were well done for the area of disappearance and sports, and they pitched and fled.
The outcome from Indonistan, as if a talent in all the electricity concerned, was taken that no family remains without an electronic phone.
What remained from the Polyn Diaster was seen technical work; what remained from the Greek, the turtleks.
The outcome from the Persian forest and Levita, whose children have not been sought to leave the country when THO, CHOR, PROROCT, the EU PROROBLE ROBLES have occurred, in fear that they were accused of flowing, in fear, to say that the flow would be the following, retained with the labs and the Chalians, and were not exposed and pushed from the unfair.
Everybody can.
Since she had heard only balloons, Elien had been difficult to understand how abusive words she had just missed Kevern could have been put on music.
Music is the expression of love.
"They are really not anxious," said Kever.
Maybe it's for people who have great feet.
My dad never hurt anybody, but he missed this song.
He said too much, but the launched garden gave him a security illusion.
No word could result from the sound of hyganic lyrics like capsules.
Ellen didn't understand anyway.
How could your father love such?
He wanted to say that it's a shock, but he didn't want to add her to two fingers again.
She was so strange.
"He seemed to be a fool," he said instead of it.
She had shown her head unbelievablely, closed Quever's review.
In the whole world there was nothing but the cops of her blue hair.
Nothing what he wanted to look at.
"Well, if you're saying that," she said, staying at her view.
But it doesn't even explain why you're going to me.
It seemed that she was really disappeared.
Have I got too big feet?
He looked at them again.
You can't say, no.
Lodge, maybe, a little bit...
And you're saying you hate me because my tastes are too sweet?
Do I hate you?
Of course, I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too early.
"You like that because you've got a taste of tastes," he tried to say it instead of it.
I have such a disaster.
That was wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts often have brought it in a smooth situation, because, as his father, he was not aware of the encouraging disappointment that could smell the cruelness that could be swallowed into the shocks.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted Keirn.
Despite good eyes.
Elenan Solomon's wine was drunk and lifted up from the chain, shot the console and drunk the wine that they drunk.
The wine from the business could not be justified.
In her concern, she seemed to be dragged as the palm letters in the Urugan.
"And you like that because you're crazy head," she said...
You don't like it.
He was sorry to her and because of the worst hurt of his words, and because of the fear that she had appeared in her view when she had given it.
Did she think he was gonna hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in the northern cold archipelago where she was grown, but he wasn't sure that she was like a thing.
The same widespread glacial ocean has disappeared them both.
The same fighting men, even more sensitive and cataprised after the OTHO, the PROGRAMME, the EU FOR THE PROGRAMME, than their prejudices, counterbars and disagrees, shot in the pop's furniture that were ready to lift up the hand on any woman to give them or to doubt them.
A crazy head?
They would have shown her a fucking kick, if she wasn't careful!
At the beginning, it was the most ordinary expression of an erotic anger between men and women; the opposite against the pretty balances that removed the console, starting to curse it, and then to be wounded.
The latter explication, according to Kevern, because you were angry for yourself was already angry.
Elenan Solomon's corps showed him to leave.
He went up from the scene as an old man.
She felt a painful hardness, but the weight of his womb was surprised.
It was not the end of the light.
They couldn't know each other.
She looked as he went, and from the top window she looked out as he was going, her wife--- the man who had seen the gun on herself.
Adam, who left the garden, thought she.
She felt a school of compassion to him and men, some of them lifted up her hand.
The man who turned away from her, with a congressed back, warmed, all the ability to fight him left him -- why she seemed she knew that it was so good if she could not remember any event until the day that she had seen?
One Elena Solomon looked at his feet again.
Over twenty years prior to the above events or nearly Esma Nosbaum, a comprehensive and powerful 32-year-old researcher who worked in Ophnau, the informal control service for the Common System, prepared a small report on the conservation of a low and medium-sized violence in the most parts of the country where it was expected to reduce, if it was not completely stopped, taking into account the resources and forces that had been made on his elimination.
“Much was done, and many things were done,” she wrote, “to smile the damage of aggression of people who were wars in thousands of wars and won most of them, particularly among those falling slaughters and slaughter disparities of the place where, despite those of the benefits of the church, the disappearance of human wellness was strictly felt for the whole history.
However, some qualitys are not eliminated.
It would seem to be lower the loss that he's lower.
The seat has smelled over sensitive balances, the story of the overwhelming challenges and declares its dust of faith in the well-being of marriage and family life, but not only an elderly wounds its strong deficit in rural communities, as well as in urban settlements, but also have data of the fact that new and bad disappearance in houses, workplaces, on roads and even on games.
"You have a valuable way to write too much," said her scientist manager, reading a report by all.
I think you have to read less romans.
Esma Nosbaum left her head.
I should also ask you, you're ateist?
"I think I don't have to answer," answered Esma Nosbaum.
You're a bossy?
Esther reiterated his right to private life and silence.
Feminist?
Rear silence.
"I ask", said Luther Rabinski, "n't because I'm against the atheism, forestity or physicians.
We don't have any warnings here.
We are the servants of society without warning.
But some kinds of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and praise themselves, sometimes can find results, for example, what you have shown to me.
It appears that you're warned against the church, and that you're calling "sack" and "blood," others would interpret as an expression of natural life and energy.
Continue to need on the TOM, THE PROPOSITION, ECONAL OF THE PROGRAMME, as if it happened, yesterday, means to leave the country of its vital force necessary.
Esma Nosbaum looked at the sides before Rabinins were talking.
After his heads, like flamingo, the light-dyod letters repeated the advice that Ophnau gave the country to the last fourth or more.
Love your neighbour, look at your neighbour, listen to the balloons, go to the music, talk to the phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, excuse.
The talk is better to silence, the word is better than the word written, but nothing is better for love.
"I'm fully understanding what you're going to say," said Esma Nosbaum quietly, when she trusted that her scientist manager ended to say, "and I don't want to say anything, except that we haven't betrayed as effective as we believe.
I was concerned that if we are not ready, we will find that we will reiterate the mistakes that have resulted significantly to the OMS, the PRODOS, the EU FOR PROGRAMME.
Only this time we put out our wrath and unbelieving on others.
Further Rabinez connected the fingers of the fingers in the peak.
This hardness should be meaning an endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "whiching the "sounds" actions that did or didn't do our children.
You're going too far, and when you're talking about they've thrown out their "never" and "incredible" on the others.
In your place, man should not need a reminder of that, understanding the past, it's actually protecting, we're not talking about "Nos" and "thes".
There was no "sa", and there was no others.
It's been the time of unordinate, that's all we know.
"For which, if being honest with itself, he waved to put Esma, no part of the society can be fairly justified.
I don't accuse anybody.
Whether it was bad or good - what's done, it's been done.
Then it was.
Nothing needs to say that we're agreed here.
And as we don't have to accuse anybody, don't have to justify if it was reasonable or if something could be corrected.
But why's the past if not to learn --
The past exists to forget him.
If I can add one word to this --
The Premide Luther Rabinit disappeared.
"I'll consider your report," said he, leaveing her.
On the next day, on the way to work, it shot the motorcycle who went out to the trip, as described the rain, "in an evil wrath."
Consents are connected.

In view of the fact that the impulses of growth is in the main industrial engineer, Germany, as well as Spain and the Netherlands, it does not add confidence," Mr. Dobson said.
The reduction of industriales, most likely, is still infringing oil to an analytics expected to introduce an additional monetary or budgetary stimulation.
An positive news was from Ireland, where PMI increased to 57.3, its highest level from the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the main economicist of IHS Global Insight, said: "The best you can say about the August research index of the productive sector of Europe's business activity, that it shows that the sector still grows."
He added: "The European producers obviously have a very difficult life at the present moment, since the current increased geopolitic tension - especially related to Russia/Ukrainian - adds uncertainty to still comprehensive circumstances in many countries.
This increased tension apparently affected business and particularly on the confidence of consumers, and probably indicates that some orders are detained or even rejected, particularly important orders.
He said, "All more like it," that the ECB, of course, must be conducted a variety of quantity measurements, "when we know it's gonna be limited."
The inhabitants of Maryopol make a living street against the volcanoes
In Maryopol, before the past week, there was no one wanted to organize the Population Republic of Mary, a city on the Asian Sea, to work.
Now the inhabitants with fear wait for the arrival of the "Folls".
According to the version of the politics, the seminars were scattered to Mariupol to go to the Asian Sea, recently took the city of Newweazowk, which was not even in the composition of self-prolifered republics.
The Russians decided that the Ukraine Army would be protected, but it had little forces against the great armed representatives of the DNA-LND, and were gathered to help military.
They're making oaks, build blocks and strengthening.
On the evening of the Sabbath, some thousands of people came to the eastern border of the town and took up there into a living street distributed by the Ukrainian geniness.
They're going to do the same in the case of the offence.
Foreigners are gathering and resuming driving and products, collecting medicines, reporting the newspaper.
The city is gradually closed, ceasing banks and banks.
10 years of water for the Beslan: ten years from a hot school as children who have been found in it have been suffering.
10 years ago, there were more than a thousand people in Czech batteries in the school in Besselan, South Russia.
More than 330 people who were more than half of whom children were killed during this three-day trial, which had disappeared the world
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who deceived death during the animal at school
It was about ten years after the terrible disappearance of the Unit, 334 people died, including 186 children, who were heroicly overlooked have warned the evening of a new atmosphere in Ukraine.
When terrorists, the Islamic phenicians, were stolen and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of the new fourth, it seemed to be the least possible worst.
The tragedy joined the east and the west in a distortion, which then arose in action and hope for the future in the pretty heavy circumstances.
10 years later, we returned to Beslan to South Russia to find some of the victims who deceived death during the school.
We found a wonderful young people who opposed evil, although the memories of terrorism will live with them forever.
They're the greatest hope?
What war that now suffers from Ukraine, in which the same children are as they die, will now be stopped.
The girl who is trying to take back in a relaxed sports hall
It was stored at the scene of the known Russian photograph of Dmitria Beauty when in one cup he tried to take back into a smooth sporting hall after the extinction of mines.
In the distress of Aida, she had sought for her mother, Laris, which now has been 40.
There were dangers that they both died, but they actually survive.
"The woman said to escape from all the forces, but I couldn't," she said then.
My feet were covered with blood.
I got up and came back inside to find my mom.
The soldier welcomed her and led to a secure place.
After the operations, she thought it was completely rescued, but yesterday she said, "Tree months ago pain came back.
I'm afraid I can need more operations.
A few stars remained in my tribe.
Its goal is to become a dancer, help people as well as they helped the doctors.
"The tragedy changed my life, but she, of course, didn't shot her," she said with a call.
"It has happened to me, and you can't change this fact.
One time a year I'm always going to this sports hall to remember all those who stay there.
My friends and I are trying to not talk about this in other days.
It's too strong.
My best friend who had to be my sister, Derra Hapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and we dreamed to go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I can't end the training and start working.
I'm thinking about the family later.
She says she's still hiding her, although the memories are a little thorough every year.
I'm glad that many people in the world are still remembering our disasters, and we are so thanks for the assistance we received from Britain and from everywhere.
When I see a photo where I'm leaving in school window, I think many people will see it first, know about our tragedy and do so that it's no longer happening.
The boy who fled through the green pool, thinking that his mother's mother's dead
It was his first day in school ( Russians starting schools in 7 years) and survive three days of disappearance with his mother Tamar.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mam said to me to lie, if it be explosed, and to keep her on the hand."
After one of the explosives, he thought she died.
She said to him, "Beautiful."
Besides that she was dead, he fled and saw a little laughing, took the child on his hand and fled through the green pool.
His father, the Herody, who took the son of her neighbor, said, "Dordy told me that his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save it."
In fact, Tamara was elected to freedom and was in hospital with wounds on feet, thinking her son was dead.
After their assemblement, she said, "I'm weeping for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He fled and took me.
Afterwards, Damira was brought to London (not a disagreement newspaper of the World), where it was rewarded as the Child Protector from the Barnardo's Primeer Tony Blair and his wife Sheri.
"It's a horror coming to you every day, but I'd like to stop remembering him," he said yesterday.
I can say that I have a memory, he's crazy.
I remember how soon I throwed out all my played weapons.
But now I can play the computer games with the shield, and it's not a problem for me.
"I don't fear to return to that sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the children with whom I played in the palace that did not be eligible.
We're never saying they're killed or dead.
We're saying they're still in the sports hall.
I remember my trip to London so good, especially a playing store, where I'm allowed to choose everything I want and travel to the open upper car.
But now he fears such a place as Ukrainian, where wars bring to such an affliction that he and his friends survive.
This earthquake comes back to you every day, but I would like that I can stop remembering him.
"I'm so sorry to all those who suffer from these horrors," said David who had been working for a voluntary work in the female monaster last week.
I want to help.
I want to serve the police once and I hope that I'll be numbered in a training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48 years old, said, "37 kids were killed in our quarter, can you imagine yourself?
I remember the waiting stilling right after the disappearing, there were only children that would cry and run around, and this silence continued a lot of months.
She'll just remember her trip with Damory to London.
People in London wept when I told our story.
I understood how people at the other end of the earth can understand our feelings, can help.
She was thanked to Sherry Blair and her fund for the benefit and the opportunity to go to London in August 2004.
I'd like to call Sheri and just tell her that 10 years ago, but I'm still remembering her and her husband in London and how they helped Damar and me.
I remember when David wanted to eat a boat, they called all the Russian local restaurants.
I remember he played with the officers in the restaurant, Daward shot them out of his water pill, and they fled and played with him.
And the whole month he went after our kitchen then.
I was surprised that Britishs were so ready to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I all think that this world hasn't been better than these 10 years.
Now in Ukraine, people die daily, and I think many children were killed and will be killed.
It's just like our kids.
I think for many people of war is a new report that they listen when they're sad or when they're busy anything else.
I just know that these people feel, terriblely.
And I can't stop feeling him.
Nothing changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so painful.
Damide grew up and became a very slow and quiet boy, he is not aggressive and not bad.
He is not looking for a place, for example, he is not involved in this past cashmar.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six fellows, and they're going to a sports hall from time, and they're driving the cows there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it -- I remember he was laying on a garden, turning away from us at times.
No sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw all his arms and other military players now 17, he's over me, a sympatic, smart and healthy.
I'm hard to believe that a few hours I was so sure he was dead and I never see him any more.
When I was able to turn away from the pit and rose up to the feet, I looked, and I saw me around when parts of the body were laid around.
I was absolutely sure it was impossible that my little boy could live in this.
"I remember that I cried to him, 'Domir, flee, flee," but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and fled.
That's the life for us, otherwise than those others.
Georgie Ilin, 17 Years
A child whose shopping photo after the disappearance was defined for the tragedy in Belarus
Spacious: Beslan Georgy Ilin and his mother Fiamma after the invasion in 2004 and the case of Georgie today
On his discovered face, there was a speech of fear when he was saved from death when the Czech terrorists spread his uncles.
His photography was one of the most shocking symbols of rebelliness in Besselan.
His mother Fitima, 54 years old, led him to school on the first day of school before taking the old son of Virmira to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists fled to the house, so my little boy stayed alone for three days of cosmeat," she remembered.
Not only one, there were our family of our parents, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgie was able to survive.
How close to this date, it's more difficult to think and talk about it.
No one day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been long, I think it happened yesterday, some walls of those days have all the time before me.
Nobody will ever forget, I promise you.
The photo of Georgia (left) was one of the most shots of attacks and was encountered in sculture (to right)
I remember Georgy wanted to go to school on the day that he said he wanted to talk about the teacher.
I just knew he was alive when I saw him on the television.
And now there's also a culture of a weeping Georgy in San Marino.
Georgy doesn't like to look at this photo, and she's hidden in a book box in our house.
I understand, but I also think that through this photograph people from the world feel our pain.
Georgie now says, "It's supposed to never happen anymore.
"I'm sure we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedy and never know the truth.
Now they'll investigate that Boing's crime in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what she was called?
This world goes to something very bad.
"I can't understand how it happens, because if I ask people, no one wants war, so what's going on?
10 years are nothing for such a pain.
We need to last ten years to forget her.
She has affected my health, and I still feel her.
It's just three or four years old that I've shot my kiss because of the shoes, but now it's better.
I returned to school later in 2004, I was very afraid every day.
I thought about my friends and fellows who were killed.
That's why I continue to go to this sports hall before each September.
I want to give my memory to my old boyfriends.
I'm hard to go into the sports hall, but I have to do this.
I don't feel a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget about it, but I'm not trying to misfortunate myself.
My life continues.
I have completed school this year and made medical university at Worcia.
I'll learn to become the cardiacrog.
My first choice was to go to the army.
I wanted to be a military, but I didn't let me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't happen.
Georgie Farniv, 20 years
A little who survive, although he was found at the foot of terrorism
Incredible: Georgy Farniv was at the feet of terrorism during the slaughter, but he was able to survive.
During the disappearance, he was photographed in a sporting hall sitting close to a bomb at a terrorist killer feet.
Actually, it's a wonder that he wasn't killed.
"We think it was even yesterday," said Georgy, who wanted to learn at the FBI's investigation office, but couldn't be harmed by the damage caused by his health during the detention.
That's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm the elder now, and they say that the children are easy to work with bad events, I have to say that it's wrong.
"I worked with psychology in 2006, and I felt a little bit better after that, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the next year was the first and the last time I entered into this sports hall again.
I lost awareness.
I'd never go back there and, please, don't ask me to show me where I sat on this known photo.
Heavy: Georgy Forniv today, with open photographs on the notes of the photographer in the hospital after the extinction
My pain is hurt, and I'm leaving her with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or to discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
With regard to physical status, I'm healthy.
I have to be careful with the tribe that was override, but now I'm gonna go fine.
But yet health hasn't allowed me to go to the FBI academy in San Peterburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical arrests, and they answered that it was impossible.
My second impression was animals, so I went to a veterinary institution.
I learned there two years.
He learned to treat all the animals from the kitchen to the crowns.
He said, "I know that I will never tell my children about my experience.
That's not what the kids should know, and of course not that they should survive.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, "These pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul worse when the birth is close.
I'm going and I'll attend the ceremonies that will be carried out to note it.
I know Georgie won't go.
She should be stronger for him because he was there, and I don't.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God that he's back to me, and he's in Beslam's Beautisk there is everybody.
He's staying with us.
Georgy is now growing, but this bus is still with him.
It's hard to take when something is so terriblely wrong, it's happening to you.
He's a boy, he loves sport, but he can't take them out of the tribe.
He had a few operations, he could go, but he can't be a sport.
I'd say he's 50% overwhelmed this box, but it's impossible to overcome and forget it.
This hard experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the shot, and it only makes my sickness.
I lost a lot of people I knew well, and that was my ways.
My son with me, and this is the best gift that God could make me, but my heart is painful for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know and widows that have never been married anymore.
I was going to accept that life continues, even if you don't want.
I'll never forget how the heart tried out of my breast at the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what happens in the world, wars in different regions.
Why are these people fighting?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I'm working on it.
We were a friendly country in the past, how did we get to fight now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children have been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If you could've been able to take all the stairs and get out-- so far as possible.
Alan Ccaewa, 10 years
The young man who triggeredly brought into a secure place of the speciality
Successful: Allen Ccaewa takes a secure place of the Russian side special (left).
She is now 10 (to right) and she will not fully remember the wonderful crime
Peace was stopped in 2004 when the small Alan had led to the Russian Police in Belarus.
Terrorists left her, but hardly left her mother 30-year-old, Christian sister and Mahara's brother in the sporting school.
The Mahar, who was then three years old, was saved, but Alanians' mother and sisters died in a dead battle.
Her father Rwanda had been married again, and his new wife and a small daughter he called the Christian memory of the daughter he lost.
Alan, whose ten, now, will not remember anything of the breath and divorced in an intelligent and vital girl, speak to the neighbourhood.
"They are a great happy family now, and Allena and Mahar are both beautiful children," said the close friend.
Rosland is a great father and wants to keep them away from all recalls when the tenth anniversary is noted.
You can understand why.
The Sindsy Cagava, who returned from the Manchester Yenedid, noted that he was noted with urgency when he was able to go back to the field in the German club.
In his words, this transfer is a joyful event in the carrier.
Of course, I'm very glad that I'm gonna play the Bosnia's picture of the word of Cagava.
I feel very good.
Polyon of positive emotions and not attempt when I can go back to the Bourusia form.
Recommended that Kagava was passed to "MU" from Burussia in 2012 to 16 million euros.
However, he was not able to strengthen the English club, conducting a two-session of 38 mothers in the kitchen of England, killed six small and gave 8 resulting transfers.
Women is accused to a girl in the Pelican Movement to Fife
A 78-year-old man will be sent to the court for a trip to a three-year-old road movement to Fife.
Hardon Stuart made a girl to Pittentin's transition to Istan New York.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stuart had put the Audi Q3 without an appropriate attention and attention to the girl, as a result of heritage.
Stuart, 78 years old, from the Advocate, rejected his fault in the Trial Court of Donada.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the Queen lawyer, appointed the date of the court in January.
Obama, Merkel and Olland will not return to the East
The Duty Free Aviation Airport has made a table prohibiting buy in this store of a number of world political leaders.
Don't disappear them with spirits, waters, and horses.
The administration of the store decided that the President of the United States, Baker of Bukha Obama, the Consorter of Mercekel, President of France Olland, Vital Clickko, Julia Timochenco, the Prime Minister of Japan and a few other known fellowships will not be able to disappear water, horses and spirits in their store.
And she broke the door for the table.
Earlier Obama received a denial in the other types of detention service for the Dictionary Task Force, which reported the website of the survey.
If the American dream President had ever been asked in the diagnostic table in Russia, it is not known, but the prohibition authors are obvious to themselves.
Is there a corner after the Embargo: Mededves gave the advice to aggression?
The President, the Russian Minister, Dmitriy Mededves, considers that in the terms of the Russian Agricultures, new technologies should be made to set up the emissions of shopping carriers.
The Council was attended during the visits of the Upptyprom company "Agromplex".
The Chapter of the Government also granted the advice to recent to the Russian meat, whose quality is at the post-level level.
An annual embargo for food import was introduced in Russia since 7 August.
The chief manager of the Russian Society of Valentin Massacks is of the results of the tourist DecaNation.
According to the specialist, the third place is a good result, taking into account the lack of targeted training to orders.
Our sports have made up at its level, it's the Massica's say.
Third place is the reaffirm of our high team level.
It is pleasing that the privilege of French and even Americans over us is minimum.
We must notice that we haven't been prepared for these warnings.
The season ended, and we were not engaged in our leaders to participate in the mother DecaNation.
In the past few years, we became a second tour, but in this season we have updated the congregation.
France, at the same time, made a batteries team included 13 kippens of Europe.
They didn't hide their intention to overcome this year of which they were publicly announced.
But even such a compound of warrants could not resist Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have acted at such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some kinds were at the below order than the Brilliant Line.
The session is complete.
In fact, the sporters are not so important, but more in orders of the command level.
The main place was here.
As a result, it was agreed, when 1500 m men were so tactical kitchens, which showed the result below the middle level of female refugees.
4 Shows how to make better quality of sub-country photos and videos
If you want to photo or remove videos under the water, you will have a whole number of applet options before you.
The lowest option is the "sweet" water, for example, Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an exchanger, for example, Gopro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which are sold by approximately $300.
I've made these samples at the family feast with a number of photographs, all about $350.
Depending on what equipment you use, several rules should be observed to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you've got water-protected camera, make sure that the camera and other offices are closed.
Furthermore, configure your camera for that type of photo or video that you'll take away.
Some photos and videocams have grounds or object types that optimize the exhibition for an exposed condition.
And before you come into the water, get out how deep your apartment can leave.
Some cameras are calculated at 5 feet, other 50 or 60 feet.
See our leadership and digital camera records as well as the traditional and water models.
Take a few staffs, because many of them will not get.
There's a kid's JCD that help you to put your skills, while they're not usually in the exchan-camer.
Even if you have JCD, it'll be difficult to look under water, and the staff company will be an accidental process.
So do a few staffs.
Even if your camera has a series scene mode, which makes a number of staffs with a few different exposition installations, use them.
Stay on the surface.
The number of lights are significantly declined as soon as you can black under the water.
If you can stay on the surface when you get a baceine, a river or the ocean.
This also allows you to translate more colours on the photos, and more deeply you will go, less you can see.
Increase the smoke objects.
This is a great council for smoke, but it is still more important in water because of the deep light conditions.
Specificly important, if you get the exchange-camera: this apartment is often established by a fixed, wide line, which means that you're going to be close to the sample objects if you want to fill the frame.
The 2012 Olympic Spieler of 2012 on the free fight of Bill Mahaw can go to Greek-Rimic fight.
This reported the chief manager of the Dagetan congregation for the free fight of Sajid Sajid.
The Specialist did not exclude the participation of the sports to the peacekeeping kitchen in September 2014.
At the present time, Bill Mahaw is on the classic Command - the "R-Sport" words of Sajida Sajida.
In fact, on the adolescents, Bill spoke both in both styles.
At the first part of the world, 2005, he became a slaughter of libertors and third prisoner in Greek-Rymian furniture and decided to concentrate on free fight.
It's been a long timely talk that the new stage of his carrier will be in Greek-Remic fight.
I'll say more: Mahaw can go to the peace kitchen in Tachkent, if it's winning a kitchen.
But it's always a decision for a trigger chapter in the head of Gog Couhashwili.
Andrew Lowson was such a person whose personality might be able to enhance all around, even in a hygiganic organization such as the National Health Service.
Ascertain Agencyology, he sanctified his carrier to deliver patients from suffering disease and treatment.
Among those who referred to him, remembered his wife, was the officer of II-6, which had to live with a destructive consequences of torture.
Lowson understood that, until the doctor had been involved by diagnosms and diseases, those who had a treatment mostly worried about something else.
One time in 2007, however, he was found to suffering.
"I didn't feel as usually," he wrote in my past year.
I was hard to find strength in myself.
He discovered that he's angerously preventing his wife, Julieet.
"I want to happen faster than later," he said.
When Juliet went for week, Lowson discovered that he was inadequate and unwise why he was disappeared.
Something was wrong.
He asked the colleague to make a retention of a kitchen cell.
It was two weeks ago he caught on the lakes in the French Alpaha.
The results of the retention came.
It was a mezotom, unlike cancer that affects the pillar, or a blue clothes.
For most cancers it is easy to explain the accurate reason.
Although some smoke smokers suffer light cancers, for example, not all the sick cancers of light smoke.
But with a metolic otherwise.
In all cases, it is a contact with the staff, a localist, who has ever been called a "sound" but who, as well as now known, had been deadly stopped.
For most of us is the disease that can't take attention.
The office is finally the material from the past.
The most dangerous type of staff is not used to Britain from the 1960s when the recommended industrial debt has entered into force.
Even when it was used, only individuals of specific sectors worked closely with him: tubers, builders, carriers and dog workers, for example.
The industrial toxine from another episode, whether it is a reason for concern today.
But it's wrong.
Great Britain is present today on the pocket of the myolic epidemic.
This is more than any other country on the planet.
In an annual mortality, about 2500 people died more than two times more than that disease than the result of car abuse.
Annual death of metolics from 1980 and an advanced number of deaths in the future in Britain
The cause for which we feel dead consequences now is that, although the use of the staff has been lawfully used for many years (all the types of staff were finally prohibited by the Act in 1999), to the development of the mezoons are usually decades.
It is not limited to the winners of industrial construction specialities.
The office was, and in many cases, it's still staying home where we live, offices where we're working, school where we learn, and stores where we're going to buy.
As a result, the mezotom does not take attention to the class, additive, professional or age.
The Baseon elections, from modern London universities to private schools, have not been saved.
The building of the parliament was lower.
Even hospitals designed to treat us have been found by the reservoirs of this mortal concert.
Andrew Lowson was not old.
He wasn't a trumpeter.
In fact, he had to think where he could contact the officer.
Then he made it.
"It seems to be a lot of persons in the Gaya hospital where I've been six years on the stage," he wrote.
All students, sisters, doctors and carriers were used to use these tunnels.
I'm interesting how many of my stores are weak the same sick?
It was a question to which he was unfortunately able to give part of the answer.
"Our four doctors who were in the hospital of Gaya and afterwards disappeared myolics in the last five years," he noted in writing in 2010, "I stayed in lives."
How many of us hurt this disease?
Andrew Lowson was put to the diagnosis of the "socium" when he was 48 years old.
When he died, 17 February, he was 55.
Living so long is inadequate.
Fifty per cent of patients are dead after eight months after the diagnosis sentence.
She's always dead.
So now we can just repeat the question of Lowson: "How many of us suffer the same disease?"
According to the leading expert in the United Kingdom, professor Julian Pito, the most likely suggest that between 1970 and 2050, when an epidemic in Britain must live, about 90,000 persons would die.
Most of them are not present that they would die in this way.

The short review of reports from the court hall, where the suffering persons are often compensated, shows how far the mixture has been extended.
In this July, for example, Marks & Spencer recognized that, in the absence, James Elena had been contacted with a person.
She worked in the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, with the manager of clothing offices on two objects, one of which was the main store at Oxford Street.
Ms. Elena was 18 years old when she began to work in M.S.
Now she's two kids older than 20 years.
'Before it happened,' she said, 'I never heard about the muscle, I had a little knowledge of the individual.
I couldn't come in my head, and I couldn't do it.
Many people really know about personality.
In fact, the office is not one substance, but a group of six miners.
They received their name from the word "sabisisform", which means the bulletinist structure that tells them the pureness and delusion.
Of these six, three often used in construction.
Christian, widely known as a white officer, is most often more than others in buildings today.
It was used in bloody balls, pillars, the terrorisming of the trumpets, shoes, even in car shoes.
It is less dead than other forms of person, but yet recognized the European Union and the World Health Organization, “the serious health damage to death” that can lead to death.
But more dangerous is, however, the core (amosit) and the blue asbesto (Crociduat).
Britain was ever the largest importer of the coreist officer in the world, and experts consider that there are some vessels, although they are cooling reasons to believe that this is the fundamental reason for a high number of patients with a mezclame [Brittany].
Marks & Spencer operating has affected the principal company company at Oxford Street, London Alamy
Justy Elena may not have thought of himself as a typical victim of myocratics, but the work of Julian Pito allows it to imagine that her story is not inadequate.
He studied patients that suggested that "the percentage of the inhabitants, when there was no known effect on work or home, were more likely affected by the environmental staff."
The majority of this impact, he said, is "profit by normal use and the impact of the погод" on our buildings.
Nobody seems to be sure he is secure.
The report of Goddard Consulting, which was considered by the Westmenster Duke, shows that people, even in the government centre, could have been unrecognized.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the technical shocks and tube for the location of parliamentary committees were strucked by the murder cells that could be moved as an unnecessary as the " forced air streams".
Members of the parliament often accused that they pursued their own interests, but in this case it seems that it is right back.
Although the Parliament ' s Technical Service Division had received a " clean sanitary witness" now it recognized that it was needed to work at 1 billion for the reconstruction of the Parliament, improved the electricity and removed the persons and that after the general elections of 2015, members of the parliament could be attended in the QE2 conference, and not in the green places of the Westminister.
The report Goddard noted that “the situation with the office has not been managed in accordance with the various rules”.
Unable to know whether this management error will be living.
All you can do now is waiting for.
One of those who couldn't find their contact with a person is Mrs. Abbott, a common doctor.
Like Andrew Lowson, Abbott, 50 years old, he suspects that he was affected by a person when he worked in hospitals.
"I worked in the hospital who had successfully been advised by the person," he said, "but I can't prove that in my case.
It's so difficult to remember all the places where he worked and dates.
What he will remember clearly, this day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was expressed something like a ball.
He was 45, and he was on the middle of the afternoon.
Soon, I've got to hurt.
That started very fast.
I felt scary.
I thought I couldn't go through the way home.
As a doctor, Abbot knew that he was sick from the pillars, the neighbors around light.
However, as Janis Elena, he was not just a reason to suspicion with the melody.
Finally, he couldn't work a month.
Independent doctors made the retinencing cells and made pillar catalogues to produce easy and send it to the analysis.
Yet, his state remained without diagnosis.
Immediately his health status has improved and returned to work.
But from time to time the same symptoms were returned, often after he was dealing with sports and hardly dreamed.
In 2011, one of the patients of Abbott came to him in receipt with similar symptoms, and he was later put in the "Mozome diagnosis".
However, even then Abbot did not link it to his own case.
Finally, his patient was over ten years old and worked directly with the office.
The link was clear in this case.
In September 2011, the status of Abboth was disappeared again, and his doctor had shown his results of the CT and the reentess group of specialists.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbot began to feel bad, a damager who was equipped with the camera was put into the pool between the kitchen of his cell's cell's cell and the swimming of his easy.
I'm an optimist.
I'm usually going forward," he said.
I wasn't too survive about it, honestly to say.
But Rachel, my wife, survive.
The result of Biopsy was a week between Birth and New Year: "I'm saying that it's myolics."
Mr. Abbott: Dignity Mezotom
Soon Abbot met in meeting the sisters of Macmillan, one of which suggested him to connect to the turist.
In the same time he recognized the scale of epidemic.
"The office has been used widely, especially in large public buildings, where it was quite frequently the tube terroristization," he said.
People who have affected individuals in these buildings are now affected by this disease.
Thus, the mezotom now affects younger people with non-Picical Professions.
The most dangerous hazardous tube were in hospitals, so it is little likely to lose patients.
But many persons who were walking on pearls to fall from one building in the other (as Andrew Lowson) or eat in the double tables (such as Gram Abbott did) are almost really affected to the toxic substances.
During a few decades after war, hospitals were placed where patients had saved life, but the places that were threatened to the doctors who were treated.
He's still removed today.
The schoolmen set their Bunzen's bunzen hotels on the officers.
And they're not just hospitals.
The office was often used in offices, stores, libraries and marines because of their surprised isolation and fire characteristics.
Schools too.
In fact, many more than first have been affected by individuals in the class.
In the whole country, the chimical schools set up their bunzen's guests on personal training.
Web sites focused on personal problems in schools.
At the same time, in our homes, such as the filament or the crowds of the sahares were usually contained.
"It's an industrial weapon set in a large number of our buildings," said Andrew Morgan, a turist who represented Andrew Lowson in the case of the Gaya hospital.
In one case, the only contact that was able to remember a sick woman was a garden of the 1970s.
So be careful, dreams of the garden.
The effect of diagnosis when you know that illness is inevitable, drugs.
"On to know that, it's gone quite a long time," said Mrs. Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I know I couldn't focus on what I do.
I've been in the chirurgic two weeks.
Then I understood that I should go and get disappearing with me.
Well, I won't meet Christmas.
One of the most hardest things was transferred from the doctor to the situation of the patient.
As a comprehensive number of patients to him, he remembers how the quantity of the information was to be accepted.
"It was easy to understand everything," he said.
"I asked my doctor, "What time have I?"
They gave me approximately 12 months.
I remember how I thought, "What, I'm not going to meet Christmas.
That's all."
The mezoline is particularly dangerous, as the mechanical is how we support life - the act of disappointment -- calls the cancer that kills.
Most cases have a contact with a person.
The office consists of brain vessels.
When the office is disappeared and the clothed, they can steal in the pool, the light bulb.
The bulldoers are angering the pillar and may cause cell-smokings.
"The Worker's inspiration of ill-lawsletters," professor Tom Trager, Cardiotoric chirurg who came to the Gaya hospital in 2001.
The same person and the hospital, where he understood Andrew Lowson, has been affected by the staff, now, on the irony of the judge who leads the center of the mezotom treatment.
Trager knew Lowson and treated some others who probably have been affected in the hospital.
When the axes fall into the ticket of lights, Trageer said, "They are driving them on the pearl where the thumb is.
This is actually an invasitive process from the beginning.
The usual options of the treatment of other forms of cancer are far less effective in the mixture.
The effectiveness of chirurgic interaction, for example, causes bitter disputes.
Some think it's supposed to try.
The driver is not agreed.
"It can't cut the pillar," he said.
It can't be around with a foot.
Nevertheless, this cancer is "n't very well subtracting chemotherapie," which is "activing", but does not affect.
"That's from time to time the sick who lives for a long time," said Tregger.
But finally, they're all dead.
Successfully, some patients live a lot longer than waiting.
Stephen J. Gould died after 20 years after the diagnosis was set.
Two after the diagnosis sentence, Mrs. Abbot continues to fight.
After he suffered the melodical, Abbott met Andrew Lowson, who, four years after the decision of diagnosis, was uniquely converted to the Office of support and consultations for the same sick people.
"Allo, the Central Raccount," he said vitally when they called.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He made a diagnosis four years ago, and he's still energetic.
At the beginning, Abbott proposed six chemical cycles that would take four months and extend life every month.
"I'm in mind," he said.
I wanted to go.
But Lowson, however, "I've been angry to bring some more positive area."
In meeting with several specialists, Abbot decided to continue treatment with professor Loic Lanj-Lauzunski, professor of Toraque chirurgia in the Gaya hospital.
"We had the privilege that I didn't need a direction, I just called them, and they took me," recognized Gram.
The Mediterranean patient would have to get the direction and approval for funding.
Days play a decisive role for patients with metotom to get the best of the available types of treatment.
However, when such treatment is finally ineffective, many diseases are still affected by one financial aspect of concern about the future of their families.
And then they go to the court for compensation.
Andrew Lowson joined Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It was aware that the applicant is due to health since 1898," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it happened that even very small numbers could cause health risks.
It was then discussed about the dismissibility of the company.
Andrew Lowson and the hospital Gaya finally regulated the case, but it was not a "pleasing value" according to Morgan, since Lowson could not only prove that his logomen was a result of contact with the hospital in Gaya.
After the investigation of his death, the representative of the Gaya hospital confirmed, however, that "a dual locations on which it was spoken was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lowson.
How to Delete Applet
In fact, to connect a common contact to one company or place of work, usually in decades after that, there was a great problem for the patients with the mechanism needing compensation.
Many of their former workers changed or closed.
The fearful archives could be lost.
And those who are protected from the steel know that there's no time at their side.
In response that year, there were serious new legislative acts that facilitate the hospitals with the mixed compensation process, even if their former employees could not be followed.
In accordance with this law, a 350 million funding fund funded by the insurance industry was established for those who had been set a diagnosis after July 2012 and who could provide contact, but no one to be judged.
In such cases, diseases will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court would normally condemn the compensation case of approximately 120000.
Over 300 successful figures on this scheme are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan, as many who work with the sick with the melotics, believes that $350 million represents a "related job" for the insurance industry.
"It's a deal written by the insurance carriers," said he, notably, that the amount is four of the fact that the insuranceers should be paid, if it had not been imposed by the timely rental and sickness with the containers would be able to pursue the company and to make the usual way.
Even Michael Penning, previous minister of work and pension, recognized that the law was " perfect".
But Penning and Morgan recognize that, when seven persons die every day, rapid action was necessary.
"The people are so strong, and they need help today," said Penning during the second reading of Bill on the merchant in December last year.
At that time, Mr. Abbott was in the hand of professor Luke Lanj-Lawski 19 months.
After the initial consultations of Lanj-Lassounk, he recommended a chirurgic interaction, which, along with Tom Trager, is considered effective.
Thirdly, the radiotherapie and the chemioterapia followed, where Lange-Lauzunk may be covered by 40 per cent of the diseases over five years.
Abbot felt a lot of forces.
"It's, of course, one of the most important things," says Abbot.
You see it in patients all the time.
There's some strength that supports you.
When you're going, the state can be very fast.
Mrs. Abbott reads on the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he ended the last six cycles of chemicals.
The following scannings did not show and follow diseases.
Then they made me scanning in March [2014].
There was a few five [which] in my cell cell.
I've got to get out of 50 times.
It's not a threat to life.
It's the end of life.
And again Abbot went through six chemical cycles.
Now not the follow-up.
However, this process is physical and emotionally difficult.
You can think of practical things, when I die, for example, or what a woman needs to show how a turtle works for battery.
When you get bad news, you're gonna be unforgiving.
I need to look forward.
Like Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Temzin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's difficult for the parents," he said.
It was a lot to understand what to say, and how much to say.
When the first time I made a diagnosis, I told girls I've got a disease, which means I'm not going to live up to the old.
They reacted very differently.
Theme is very common and energy.
She told all our friends, and we were very fast calling many.
Ellie was more careful.
She didn't say a lot.
Those conversations are something that should be touched by all the diseased cancer.
But such discussions with the metody are not enlarged, even in the trial possibility of surviving.
This sickness has been defined (although, finally, for Steven J. Gould) is a drug definition.
As said Andrew Morgan, "The Empire is not a threat to life.
The body of Pharaoh's embarrassed persons are in particular tissue.
The cut staff are used to strengthen the castrel and improve warmness.
The old man describes the officer.
Now it's found a tax that's not paid.

Contemporary commercial use begins in Italy, where it is used for the production of papers (such as bankings) and tissue.
The road officers are opened in Canada and South Africa and later in America, Italy and Russia.
This is an ideal television engineer for park motors and Turkey of the Industrial Revolution.

The statistics from the Prudential show the pre-related mortality of those who work with the person and have been rejected by the insurance of life.

Dr. Wilhelm Kuck states that parts of the persons in her easy, "we were, without any doubts, the main cause of death."
It's the first case of this kind.

The Appeal Court reaffirms the first successful approach for health resulting in contact with the office in Britain.
Peaceful production is increased more than 4213000 tonnes per year.
Britain imports 139,000 tonnes.
The Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety in Britain requires that all employees who work with the office receive licence.

China refused to give Hong Kong the right to choose managers; Protestants swear to notice
The Chairman of China decided on Sunday to allow the electoral of Hong Kong to move candidates to the election of 2017, despite the increased requirements of democratic reform.
This movement will, rather than in all, be started a long promised protests in the Hongkong Business quarter, as the activeists started planning and mobilizing at the time after that statement.
The decision of the United Kingdom of Popular Representatives, as a matter, allows the Communist leaders to select all candidates that are not low to Beijin.
"It's not deceived our expectations, but it's still anger," said Emily Law, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Pickin promised.
They deceived Hong Kong people.
And clearly we have a case with the authorised mode.
The pursuant decision of China, Li Fay, Vice-Secretary-General of the Permanent Committee of the United Nations Meeting, said that it would allow the natural movement to the election of the Governor of Hong Kong to be too chap.
Since 1997, when Great Britain had transmitted a review on Hong Kong to China, Peking promised that the people of the region should choose by vote by the head of the Government from 2017.
The Chinese leaders have presented the decision as a democracy step forward, as it gives the prosecutors the right to vote, but it also makes clear that the Chinese leaders continue to hold closely the process in their hands with the assistance of the candidates' commission to move.
And, according to the new article, only candidates that "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be delivered.
The decision was taken after a year when one of the largest and largest protests had been made in Hong Kong for many years.
For the major part of the democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, organisms who have threatened to oversee the financial area of Hong Kong, if Peking does not guarantee the present general electoral rights.
On Tuesday evening, a few hours after the statement, hundreds of the Occupy Central Party were gathered to rain before the Headquarter of the Government of Hong Kong.
The organizations stated that their movement was moved to the new stage of civil innocentity and that they would arise on protests in the next weeks.
Nevertheless, they did not report details, obviously, attempt to avoid issues with public bodies.
In online-declaration, the organizations reported that the movement had been " thinked that the centre area was only as an exclusive measures, which can only be taken if all the possibilities of the dialogue were exposed and no other choice.
We have greatly regretted that all the possibilities of dialogue will be unfortunately disappeared and covered by the central area.
The State bodies in Hong Kong were prepared for a few days and the Sunday of the Government's Chamber were strengthened security measures with the adoption of police and barriqued.
In the context of unordinates, many in Hong Kong feel that they have slowly lost control on their own town.
The inhabitants of the material increase the competition in the field of goods and services.
The fear is also enhanced that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and the freedom of words, starts to be debounded under a growing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that his demonstrations have been risked by the business source of a living force of Hong Kong.
"The proof of which they say may lead to a large economic damage depending on how long the person would be involved and how long," said the Regimentary Ip, which criticizes the movement for a long time.
We don't want to make concern that Hong Kong is under control.
This is a presentation that is contrary to investments.
The Chinese State MEs also provided reports in the last days in which the Guarantee Assetists of Democratic Movement had been shown by differentiants sent by Western Powers.
In these years, the activeists organized the informal referendum on the electoral law, which brought 780,000 participants to more than one fifth of the Hong Kong electoral.
And in July, thousands were decade to one of the largest promocratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The United States Cultural Cultural Life has reached university: the Prime Carriers proposed to reach personal aircraft
We are pleased to respond to this question, led the first trip service in Britain, for the current students.
To leave a clear impression from arrival to university, the company also proposes transport options such as personal aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stuart also stated that the Servis had thought of security.
This service is an ideal alternative to students who usually have to take things through all the country in dangerous cars.
In comparison with our new options for the VIF, we are waiting for how to help students this year to reach the university with the minimum efforts and the maximum rossum.
The representative of the company reported that, as the service was only launched, the orders did not yet, but added that "studors start to order this service in the next few weeks."
The company also stated that although students needed to pay for the education of £9000 per year, it was hoped to find a market for this service.
The current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectation and hope: more important than ever, to make great first impression, and VIF is what it needs.
Nevertheless, the National Student Union expressed that service as a result of reality.
Megan Dann, the Vice-President of the NSS at the higher education, said: " This project is incrediblely affected by most students.
Many students who start university education in this month have focused on the crises of the cost of life when available financial support in the form of credit and grants does not ensure the slight growth costs of basic needs until they can start to think about the expenditure of thousands of funds for a simple arrival in the community.
Faminists address the question of racial behaviour and police behaviour after Ferguson
Unarmed adolescent was killed by the police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, previously in this month.
The ones who come up arise their hands, and they say, "Arise up, don't shoot!" until they look before the tombs.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri related to the murder of the unarmed adolescent Michael Braun, the Blogger Miriam Zola Priss noted the internet conversation between white feminists.
At its experience, the white pheminists left commented have been a gentleman above racial belonging, when the matter was undertaken to promoting reproductive rights and non-equality of income.
However, as a role of tension in the Middle East and a national attention had been given, the responses of white women focused on racial belonging to 100 per cent.
As compared to the reaction of black women, shortly after the murder of 9 August, personal communities with such titles, such as Ferguson's thoughts of the face of the white woman, and the Phéminism is not only about the damage of women.
But for Transs, they demonstrated an important move.
"I don't think there are many people who speak about white hair and privileges at this high level," she said.
People felt a need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolically for the crisis we met, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so linked to racial property, they felt that it should be indicated.
For the English professor at the University of Ogayo Core Mitchel Ferguson, he discovered the problems of the black Americans every day, but that are not being women 's cultural problems.
"I can write something funny in Facebook about what's happening with me and my partner, and I'll take 150 lobbys everywhere," says Michelle.
When I write something about how the colors are attacked in their own country, the silence deceives.
"Why are women quite publicly talking about relations, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women, such as Mitchell, who have studied race, gener and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no diotomy between racial belonging and gener.
From its view, the black women are in the position to clearly divide these problems; they are complicated with a complex reality every day.
While white women are now involved in racial behaviour and gener in the Physician manager, Engeilla Hattery, professor of Women and Gender Research at the University of George Mayson, said that their pre-deployment did.
"In 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men, and the basis of this is almost always the violence of white woman," said the Kathry.
She needed a white woman that confirmed the terms to define the license.
At the point of view, the break between the white and black women occurred when white sulphurists, for example, Susan B. Ettony studied the situation at the end of the 1800s and saw that the fight for the electoral right would be effective only for one of the groups: women or black.
"They have decided to put all an oxen into the thumb of the voice for women, and the right of the voice to the black ones should be later," said the Ettery.
Considering such things, we are clearly presenting why color - women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped the black women to protect their husbands and children.
Even after the right of vote in 1920, the white women had been joined to the Association of Southern Women for preventing licensed.
This group occurred almost 40 years after the black women first asked for help, said Michelle.
With the view of Mitchell, the reactions of white pheminists on the problems raised in Ferguson - the act of police, racial discrimination - reflects the time when the white feminists had been " exploring the problems with which the nipples were conducted in several generations.
"Is it would be great if the assets with [traditional] ideals would be seriously affected to the right to educate the child, how are they regarding the right to contract?", asked Michelle.
The second threats that carriers have committed to combat reproductive rights and access to contracts are now understood what it means.
The well-known white activist of the Gloria Stayne, two weeks after the murder of Michael Braun, was used to Faisbun and published a clear article of the Guardian Rebekki Carrel Columbia, which needed the white Americans to take more participation in racism issues.
"I hope that women with a second, but likely to understand the danger of the body, and the racial problems that are significantly different in public issues, will be in the head of change," wrote Stan.
Although Stane is handed by a more overwhelming pheminisme, which includes the problems of racial appartenance, and the gener, its commentary on race in America, are still surprised by some.
She said that young men in the United States, especially the colorful young people, are more vulnerable than their sisters, but the notes of the State on Ferguson are contrary to the criteria that she had previously expressed.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, my brother, to help the vulnerable black and spanish young people, then the anger of many feminists, including Gloria Stayne.
The police relations with the black community is not the only problem moved to the traditional feminist.
Since the United States border service has arrested approximately 63,000 children without coherence to the south-west border in that year, the immigration reform was again on the surface as a problem of women.
Andrew Merkado, Vice-Chairman We Belong Together, who mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that it was only to share the history of immigrant women.
"They say themselves for themselves," said Mary.
When the majority of the workers [immigrants] are deleted, women who arrive with them are in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"There's history's answer to female organizations," she said.
The Ipsy's sweet house is sold
The photography of the house for sales in Saphtholke was removed by non-mobility agents when there was a large wine reflected in the guest.
The sale of $120000, individual house with one room is on the private road to Ipsych.
The detailed description was a photograph of the guests of the household, which was reflected from the head, shot on the garden.
Connell's Inmobility Office reported that the dogs on the photo is a homemare of the owner of the household.
"Otherwise, the photograph was placed by error and was already removed," reported the representative of the company.
In detailed description of the house, Connells described the former house of meetings as "one individual house with one room."
Although the Agency has removed the photograph from its website, it is still stored in an advertising material.
The sale of the house has been interested in social networks where some asked whether oil was sold together with the house.
The Russian Tennisist Mary Sharapoa, in the fourth round of the US Open Circle, believes that she does not have stability.
According to the sports, she wished to complete the year worthy and to try to go to a new level, transmitted from New York of the OISP.
How do you totally assess your results on the Great School's tourists this year?
Of course, I'm glad I could win for Rolan Harros.
With regard to the three other tourists, I had no stability, especially in the end of some mothers.
Now, of course, I'm disappeared.
I couldn't even come to the fourth.
What tasks do you have to do before the end of the season?
Following both of the plague, I have a huge motivation to go to the new level.
I have to work, and I'm gonna do all the possible to end the year.

Remember that 12 sub-agents of Russia will start implementing from 1 September on their territory of HTO.
I also invited the schools that had sat down the HTO to give a borrow in the mouths, he noted Baals.
For example, they can add a little bit to the EEA.
There are also proposals to provide additional company workers that have been conducted the data of sporting tests.

Mine-Competition wants to accelerate the growth of the electricity market
At this week, the Mine-Economic Development will be introduced in the Government a comprehensive environmental clean transport plan to Russia, reported by the Department of Auditors on the round table, which had held "Woodness" in Moscow Airline 2014.
The plan is for the Government, one of the main objectives of the reduction of port gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September to begin October, said the suppliers, proposed electrical and hybrids, which are already present in Russia.
The plan (copy is in the Budgets) calculated for 2014-2017 gg.
The criteria for electric and hybrid transport should be developed and decided to stimulate the use and production of environmental clean vehicles.
The report to the Government in which the logic and customary support measures will be described to December 2014; the plan of the low-country and milk liquidation scheme will appear until April 2015; and the proposals for the reduction of the vehicles, the stimulation of the localization and the creation of a solid infrastructure will be developed until October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is expected to change the regulatory and legal acts to facilitate the conditions for the construction of furniture infrastructures (in parks, auto-related stations and others).
Furthermore, federal officers intend to formulate for regional authorities to stimulate the use of environmental clean transport, in the form of delivery of benefits in movement and park, for example, and to February 2016, and proposals for enhancing the hosts of such transport.
Finally, the Mine-Economic Development has already been reported to October 2014 to a list of indicators of evaluation of the regional bodies of criteria that reflect the effectiveness of supporting the production of clean transport, the development of warning infrastructure.
The ratio of the electricity in Russia has only been formed, in 2013, 100 electricals were sold in the whole country.
At the beginning of 2014, the import journey was made to the electrical, therefore, sellings were about 500 points, the principal executive director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia of Aarын Parks.
However, the five-year growth does not make e-mails a few notices: in Russia, according to the Association of Europe's business, sold 2.78 million easy and easy commercial cars.
Only Mitsubishi Motors are imported until Russia.
The first time Renault is prepared to initiate corporative clients, says the Strategic Planning and Renault Partnership in Russia of Nicola Remis.
The majority of other electric transport producers took place with regard to Russia's expectative position.
The electricity development is also in Russian producers, "HOOW, "", but the exit of a migrant.
For example, in January 2014, as reported by the ASM-Coldenga, the AutoVAZ has emitted 30 electricals.
The question of non-electronic electricity is acknowledged by the Director "AutoW Za" for the engineering of Sergey Aman, without the masters of the screen will not be...
The development of the Russian electric fuel market, besides the roadway vehicles (electronics sold in Russia, in the middle of the roads of similars with internal smoothing) holds the non-dividual development of the infrastructure (electronics) in the middle of Russia.

Nobody said that mydy would be better, I didn't promise it to you, it's a new Palm browser.
It is formal to recognize that it is true, but the mind and the desire remains unprecedented.
We're talking to Belargie, we're talking about the moments, we're talking about "Midies" - we understand "Belgia".
Repositors are deeply delighting that the success of the job depends on three factors: this is the location, location and again the location.
There's such places that are not good, even fine, but something unfortunate.
King at the Palm table, I remembered that there was some time the Café "Goddow" (in honor of the same television), then "Odess-mam", and the restaurant "Godle" and the drinking "Drobb".
Now it's again drunk, but it's not a nanoalogic and sovereign, but a belgic.
Over the earth, only the top of the isberg: a bar stage and a pair of columns, the rest of the space is even hidden in the sun.
It's glad here, like in the child room: red, white and green walls, different red slides, instead of the window of televisions where girls flood.
Belarus charges in Peterburg haven't been in a newspaper, so it's a comparison.
Here are eight species of different drink (260-300 rubbers for 0.5 l) and the innumerable multiplicity of the bulletin (170-1550 rubles).
The Communist-Positive Officer has a pleasure presentation of the menu, reporting that the "midys - the grand families" and should be noted: the Servis, despite the individual disasters, is the most positive side of Palm.
We are waiting for the containing, but it is very unexpected to carry out.
For example, those who have been advised, for example, have been advised that the local roller with the Vallonic black (280 rubles) is actually carpatic, which is so deep that the primary paper is incompatible with him.
I feel like some stuff it can be just if you're smoothed together.
The case with the Sales is worse.
The classic league (260) would be recognized by the crime against the Belgian people: a huge isberg which has ever been disappeared by a long-term card of the Kyinian Fasul, unrealised chips from the boundary of a marine bottle.
You don't want to meet anybody with such a leather's saal!
The establishment of the belgian salt was partly another, but the impression was not also different.
If in the unsearching quarters of shoes or smoking smoke could still be closed, why the mydy look like as if their life had been a couple of times smoking and disappearing!
I know, there's all the normal white-modes here!
They're drawn into the "subs to your selection" (490-560 rubbers for 0.5 km).
Alongside the south, the one who was white wine, farmer and marriage has not been discovered.
It's eating, and the aeromatics haven't been, if there was wine, so there was a secret.
The good ones of the Frist and the Major Major.
It's a cushion beverage here, not the shock, and it's so much that you can decide, the first or the second scene before you, just a nice spot.
It was stated that the kitchen of the local pump was prepared in a drunken sugar, and nothing was spoken of the dismant.
The situation was diametricly opposed to the situation: the dismarine has deployed everything.
The impression was that the cell in life had been cut off exclusively dismanted cuts, because the flesh had so uncomfortable aircraft.
But at that time the ring was added a wonderful -- no, just a negative juice in the crochet corner.
Baths in Palm are proposed not only sweet, but also seeds with hover, smoke or bicony and symbour (220-280).
The Clin Suss has been outer waterists, and the waffles were hidden.
But the manager was very informally interested by daily impressions.
So we need to come again.
The wagon of the USD was higher than 37 rubbers on the West's new sanctions against Russia.
It's a new historical record.
"Tomorrow" to 10:29 mk rose at 26.9 copies and was 37.02 rubber, euro currency was up to 30 copies - to 48.73 rubbers, show data of the Moscow cell.
The bivalet core rose at 28 copies to the level of the previous closure and was 42.28 rubbers.

At the night, on August 29, the White House reported that the President of the United States Bakak Obama and the Concerter of Germany had discussed the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.
The road elimination is long-term, and in the couple of euros, and in the pair with the dollar.
The long-term prognosis presented this note, says the elderly Alpery's Anna Bodrova.
What is related to Ukraine or otherwise will be reflected in courses.
As long as it continues, the investors will react.
Today, the hearings of the military investigation have not been confirmed by any side, but the market was very emotional.
All conversations of the fact that he was sustainable to such news were disrupted yesterday.
The week, on the provision of the specialist, is closed at $36.90 and 37.05.
The overall period ended, the prices of weaknesses, policies, sanctions, the problem of the gas through the Ukraine, all of these are on one street.
The inflation spread is also pronounced: the current prices per cent are increased from 5 to 10 per cent.
Soon, the seasonal fruits and fruits are completed, and there is no wakuum until the network is transferred to other providers.
"Dallar came to the note in 37 rubbers, passed back and returned back, there was no powerful isterics -- commented the Chief of the Market Analysis Open Broker's Constantine Bushov.
They will still look at whether the promised sanctions will be entered on the Sabbath, as NATO will be settled.
Robbl, by his words, was a smoke after the end of the logic season, then the news to Ukraine, and the CBB for the past week stated that to the end of the year it was completely moved to the flooding course and rejected from any valued interviews.
If you look at a daily collection, it was nothing different from the previous month, all feared 37 rubbers, continued analytics.
Yes, there was nothing that could be done in the plan of defence.
The worse time for the currency was recalled when the overall demand was noted at the end of January and the third March when the CBC was recurred.
In the UFS IC, it is a positive part of the rock relaxation.
First of all, this is a growth of the revenue budget from export operations, and an increase in competitive competitiveness of domestic producers through import health, says the main analysis of UFS IC Alex Koslov.
The travel of import goods and services may be reduced at a negative moment.
The Russian collections have significantly reduced investment in the Russian economy, increased in inflation pressure and, as a result, causes the health of money decrease, which, in its terms, affects the growth of the country's economy.
If it speaks of the market of actions, the road deterioration of a few roads declines the decline of the prices to the action expressed in the rocks.
For example, the MMB index has declined to 1,67 per cent, and the RTS index lost 3,27 per cent.
The significant difference of the relative decline of the index is explained by the decrease of the rock during the day more than 1.5 per cent.
The elimination of the wheel is emotional and is explained by the massive intention of buy the bullet.
The practice shows that the gradually emotions are not, and the cotture of the rubber partly or fully restore lost positions.
"We believe we can soon see the comparison of $36, 36 rubbers for $" - notes Alex Coslov.

Rogers said that when she was 13 after a few operations to release the drugs and leaving the pockets, she looked at the medical card when her doctor went out of the room, and there was written that she had AF.
"I felt guilty because it was a nest where I should not be, and so I didn't tell no one, but I came home, I found information about this state in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received information in response, I was troubled and tried to the worst pair that could only be able.
I thought I was going to be in the 18-year-old clothes and I'll die before I'm going to be 25, and I'm gradually losing all my ability in this area.
I went through this one, and I planned my own bulls.
She said that until 17 she had been completed, she understood that her ability to walk wasn't hurt as much as she thought, and she asked her doctor about it.
He just rose up, took me up and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this sickness, because you would have already been in a disabilities."
I think you have something that represents a very little threat to life.
After several genetic surveys, the SMT was found.
"When he explained what's the SMT, I thought it had been a happy ticket," she said.
The welcome SMET organisation announced a month of information on SME to try to take attention to that disease.

The communications in the area, Maryland and Virginia have been paid to $27,6 billion in the terms and at the local financial level in 2013, 3,8 per cent of more than $26.6 billion in 2012.
In the past year, the cost of State and local business has increased by 4,3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared to $3.9 per cent, and the third undertaking of the year after the other years, in 2009 and 2010.
The insigned state was increased faster, 4.3 per cent than local loans, 3.9 per cent, according to the research of a professional services, Ernst & Young and the State Defence Centre, the Labour Policy Group.
More than half of the surrounding income, the 56 per cent of the enterprises have been lower, while the 36 per cent of the income of Maryland is in firms.
Furniture, with 28 per cent, provides at least the lowest income, proportionally, from undertakings.
In addition to three years, the cost of the company's incertainability has continued to rise, researchers said that incertainability has increased 3,7 per cent in this year after growth was less than 1 per cent.
Although the larger share of these income is in greater states, such as California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same is happening in Washington Zone.
The communications in the area, Maryland and Virginia have been paid to $10 billion for non-mobility in the past year, at $9.6 million more than in 2012, with 4,2 per cent compared to the previous year.
However, the recurrence of non-mobility value has no similar effect on the growth of the state and at the local level in Mauritius, where non-mobility boundaries exceed one of the fifth payment accounts.
Virginia and Colombia have paid approximately half of the State and locally in the form of non-mobility taxes.
"What happens in Maryland is that the greater part of their non-mobility, particularly the base around the Occurg Colombia, belongs to the Government or the non-Competitive organization that don't pay in-smoking taxes," said Dull Lindholm, executive Director of the State Defence Centre.
So, Maryland is much more needed, for example, to pay the same service in other states.
The recent growth of the income from undertakings cannot be completely explained to the recovery of the non-mobile market.
The enterprises also appear to be amended according to this.
The computers in the region declared a corporative undertaking level of $2.3 billion, at $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland has collected $1 billion corporative benefits in the underlying neighbourhood, mostly in the region.
Although trends are directed to one direction, the local enterprises' burden is not increased with the same speed in all three places.
The growth level in Ocrugua Colombia was at the same level that the average country was 4,3 per cent, while the growth in Mauritania was significantly fast, 4,9 per cent.
Only, Virginia had observed the allocation of loans below the average, 4.1 per cent.
In Virginia, the lower corporate soil of three jurisdictions (in each of which the single corporative allocation) was 6 per cent.
In Mauritius, the corporative allocation is 8.25 per cent, while in the area it is relative to 9.975 per cent.
The research of the United States Palestinians previously showed that Virginia's underlyings for undertakings under the State and local level and, in general, a pleasant climate in relation to taxes than in Maryland.
The environment has not been evaluated in this study.
Despite its privileges, Virginia tested the competitive pressure from its neighbour from south.
The North Korean has recently signed a legal act that reduces corporative rates from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, as well as in Virginia, and the allocation was 5 per cent in the next year.
If the State continues to achieve logging objectives in the next year, this law could provide the cost of the tax for businessers even to 3 per cent of 2017.
At the same time, a small business in Washington zone is likely to feel better and therefore pay more income at the State and local level, according to recent research.
A transitional structure in which the majority of small firms in Columbia, Mauritil and Virginia has increased 20 per cent in the past year to $2.4 billion, with a greater growth speed than the portals in general.
Researchers said that the trends and increased wages for business over the whole country are more than in that year, in the steadfast of trafficking in state and local levels of 6.2 per cent of the first three quarters in 2014 compared to the same period of the past year.
However, the Washington Zone may remain, since the decrease of federal expenditure is on the market of work in the region.
Russian Deputy - Eighth
The home of the world pursuant to the dreams of Russia has provided two silver and seven brown rewards.
As a result, Russians were only the main factory of the Japan collection.
Turkey in Chelibinsk began on Sunday, and the first day the Russian team brought the silver meal.
Its owner became Beslan Mudron, who was in Category to 60 kg.
In the same end of combating the Boldbatar Ghanbatat from Mongolia, the rest of a comment received by the Russian.
And this is the second day the tour became the most successful for the collection of Russians -- in the Sunday three medles were immediately revealed.
In the manners of categories to 66 kilometres of silver, Mikail Pulaev and Bronza Camula Han-Magmeed.
In the final pound of the Russians, the japone of Massy Ebinam had come to the world, 2011 and 2013.
Han-Magomedi, at the fourth stage of a soldier who had lost a victory, gained a comfortable tour and became a bourgeois owner.
In the female tournament, 52 kilometres were also reached by Natal Kuzazin.
In the popyle, she had lost the active cheps of the world, Michael Kelmandy from Kosovo, who had been speaking under the flago of the International Federation of Dzdo and had successfully protected the title.
In the controversy of the Kuzabenin's breasts, Ma Ann from China gained, but after the end of the tour was recognized that the third place was not exactly what she had calculated.
And again, the russy roads to the gold became Kelmendy, a victory Cuban's previously in the kispeone of Europe.
On the third day, the tour in Chelibink Burnsk in the collection copy of Russia placed Mus Mouscheks in the category to 73 kilometres.
The fourth of his complaint was the former representative of Moldova Victor Scorns who now speaks for the OA Team.
However, the russian gained two complaints and became the owner of the reward.
The moods were addressed to the home cheps of the colony, which he planned to take on the nearest time, so he would take the pouze in the smoke.
With regard to the ex-Muldannian Swords, he and the Turkey arrived in the brown meal.
It is interested that the other composer of the OAE civilianship, Iwan Remerco, with a brown, concluded the statement to the categories of 100 kg.
On the fourth day, the Russians also offered a brown to 81 kilometres in the category.
In the hard fight of a small female, he settled French Alana Shimitt.
In Friday, three skills were thrown up, but Russians have limited one browser to a man’s tournament to 90 kg.
Her owner, Kiril Questions, was guaranteed by the collection of Russians: his comfortable partner was a composer of Kiril Denis.
However, it was not the most appeal: The questionnaire couldn't come to the damage from the grain.
The male bulb was renewed by the hosts and on the sixth day of the sponsorship - she was in the collection copy of Renath Said, which argued over 100 kilometres.
In the comfortable football, he had a pure gain on the Brazilian David Moor.
This has been the individual part of the world's primacy.
The last day of the tour in Chelibinsk, on Sunday, was designed by the calls of the world in command warnings.
Both Russian collectors and male women were one of the main claims for the benefit, but, as in individual provisions, the representatives of the gentle sex did not succeed - they did not be able.
And this is the Russian Dussodoists got a command money.
In the decision-making state, they have joined the main features of the Japan ' s team.
The Russian collection was 2-0 after the clean winner of Han-Magomedova and Law Daniels Yarzeva (to 73 kg).
However, in harder pregnancy categories with their Japanese fellows were not able to conduct Murat Haviiyers (81), Magomed Magomed (90) and Aslan Kambie (100).
The scenario has also developed a bunch of female tower, where the Russian collection, conducting 2-0, took place to Japan 2-3.
In the commands of Chelibinsk, President of Russia Armymond Puntin, who welcomed the male collection with the silver after the end of the tour.
"The second place is very clear, but I mean it's been shown that you could be a kitchen," said Puntin, the word which brings the RIA "News".
Play the Japanese, the grandfather of the drove is nothing here.
But I'm sure you can have them and play them.
The collection of Russia on the home of the world has made a lot better than a year ago at such a level passed to Rio de Janeiro.
Then the Russian team was only three meals, one silver and two bulbs.
The current tours have been lost the olympic Chepens of Arsen Galstian and Mansur Isab.
We're all, of course, great maximums.
Yeah, you want gold meals.
But let's remember that if a person in the olympic cycle is eight-way stronger, it's the potential Olympiade winner.
More in the form of sports than the duke, the tourist RF Vitaly Mutco, made the word the Press Service of Chepenion.
The collection of Japan was expected to become better in Chelibinsk, which was 11 meal of different dignity, five of which were made gold.
The next peak of the world will take place in the future year in Astán.
To meet other materials, news and statistics on the page of a age of sports.
Joan Riverz family hopes the best
Joan Riverz is without aware of the arrival to the hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-year-old athletic attorney would be disappeared.
"Thank you for your permanent love and support," said Meliss Riverz in a statement today.
We hope the best.
Her mother came to the Maunt Sinay hospital in Thursday after the extinct call that her heart stopped at the top Stock Side, Yorkville Endoscope, reporting sources.
The teachers are intended to hold it under drugs and under close monitoring until they are not satisfied with the state that remains "fair."
The answer was wide, including numerous web support from such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Kings will be able.
In the sale of a delicate album group of Royal Blood, the new hope of the British Year, which has produced a rock-doet out of the clubs directly on the stadion.
Royal Blood's duty all year at the scene, but it already has an active nomination to the BBC musical premium, a disagreement tour to Arctic Monkeys and will visit the New York Concert from the Jim Paige.
Their delicate album has received 100 tickets before the religion, and the contract on its exit is located in the portfolio of the Major-Label Warner Music.
In view of the current weeping situation on the musical market, the situation from a number of outcoming outside is not a new Lane Del Rey or a regular vote of the new R'nB, and the drugs of the Britain playing the highest level and intensity that was the last time in the mode of a couple of ten years ago.
In general, the trading to the first album in connection with all the above-mentioned circumstances was particularly high and have been completely justified.
It was not a bad name on which it was possible to swear that it was totally disappeared with the hair metallics, and the blood of the kings, as they seem to have in their homes, is also understood.
This is, of course, mostly about the heroes of the past level Led Zeppellin: as the great quarter, Royal Blood is the aim of engaged in the blood of the British Royal, bringing it to a new height.
Provision is about the success of this business, unfortunately, but something to say it is possible.
The thirty-minutes of a small-minute song are not so much the demonstration of the phonomic gift of the composer, how much the confidence and powerful declaration of the intentions.
Some dignities of individual numbers are understood, not able to refuse: we say, the pill synthetic "Out Of The Black" is characterised by the memory of not melody line, but by the batterian party.
The musicians say that this song is really easier to hurt than drink.
It is also expected to select the powerful "Little Monster" and the closure of the "Better Strangers" composition from the sexy quota in the board.
However, it is true that each song of these songs will be a great sound at the festival of the lovers of a hard year, but when they are playing, they will fall into more or less one-year-old tax.
And this isn't really bad, even to fight.
Royal Blood is that they don't claim new Lanon and McKartni's labs, but have brought many rocks out of the hotel Indian clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, was created for stadions, in a location calculated less than a couple of thousands of people, is clearly close.
The White Stripes is part of the chief use of the bath, replaced by the hydrauter in the usual format, which is in the start of the Negative The White Stripes.
Nevertheless, the case is not only in tools but also in the same approach to the concealing of the song.
The heroes were elected by the postmodernist paradigma, with a huge disappearance course to recognize themselves not just epigones but self - creative unions.
The Royal Blod is now sounding so powerful, and it is likely that this attraction is successfully drugs some secondary and solidity of music material.
Well, at the end, who said that the rock should be wise?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed that he reported information on Tuesday: Online-Partz and Video Producer, and another hundreds of other materials bought the Twitch video performance service for $1.04 million ($970 million).
This news was surprised not because nobody was waiting for Twitch's savings, but because many expected to be a buyer of YouTube.
Three months ago, the Twitch Videoserver of Google for a good billion looked fully ready, and such a comparison seemed natural.
Twitch, based on all three years ago as Justin.tv, has been the aim to be a flood of the general character -- the YouTube version in real time.
Instead, he quickly turned a platform, where the genmers had transferred their inside play moments; "You to play in real time," according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And the "let's play", the genre of videos, which are totally famous (in general, old) of processing graphics, such as the National Theater, are already popular in YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when the Twitch described, so the news that Youtube has received Twitch was met without special interest, the classic example of the technological company that is equipped with a potential competition.
This is a secret why the discussion with Youtube was overcome, taking into account that, according to the information, he was ready to pay less than Amazon.
All that we have at this time is a statement from the executive Director of Twitch Emma Shira: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they divide our values and long-term objectives, and they want to help us to reach them faster."
Another secret, honestly, is an unbelievable success of Twitch.
It's so much that I'm telling that it's better to do a sport than to look at it, it's hard to understand the attractiveness of seeing the game instead of take up the joist hands.
One thing is to look through a plot of a friend at 3:00 when she's prolonged through the Resident Evil, and it's the other -- see how some legal person gets 20 flags in the head of Call of Duty.
All the games you could look right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular plays today are calculated for one person, therefore viewing their ground, without control of self-control, may be the receipt of the main pain that is worth Do It right.
I agree that the rapid births in which Rogery Banisters of our electronic world are completed all games in recurrent times.
But if it's not about the virtuous game or the humor, it's a little sure his Twitch channel will be interesting.
But what do the sceptes know like me?
Twitch has 55 million visitors per month, and this is the fourth source of the physical internet trafic.
How do Amazon do it do?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch's turning to Amazon Instant Video as you can just kick the Twitch.
However, Twitch would enjoy any company: the numbers of young men who dreamed advertisers.
As said Chapter Twitch Sheir, Amazon and Twitch, "There believe in the future game," and this canal does not give signs of advertisement, even e, as a huge kind of sport.
Consequently, more than 330 people died in 2004, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were killed.
We've been in Bessana for a few days.
We have talked to the survivors - almost all students, with the dead parents, with the angels City, Ramon Caspoulat, head of the "Mathie Bessana" of the Susan Duke, who took part in the MSP office, tells the Corporate of the Office of Employment, Elizabeth Anton, who worked on the project.
As they returned to Moscow, they met Elasabik Alachán, who had been adviser for the President of the North Caucast and negotiated terrorists as well as the officer of the "BB FSB Russia by Vieh Bochlorus".
That's what I've been particularly surprised for this topic's work is that in Beslam as if there were no decades.
This subject is extremely sick for all who have any relationship with her, people with difficulty agree to speak about what happened.
Return impressions are very hard.
But it's not possible to forget Beslan, and I hope we've done with our tasks," said Anton.
The project is prepared by the Challenge Rambler & Co, which is working in the company since the spring of this year.
The previous projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15-year residence of the Army Putin authority.
The CNUDD has implemented the launch of a small railway
The North Korean launched a small railway in the Japon Sea acquator, reporting "Renhap".
It was launched approximately 10:30 a.m. from the province of Chagando situated on the border of North Korea and China.
The Ratio fell in the Japanese Sea, a 220 km flood, made a statement to the Joint Committee of Heads of South Korea.
Deputys proposed to accelerate the entry into force of the Personal Data Law
In the event of successful initiative, the data of the Russians will not be stored on servers from 1 January 2015
In Hosmond, a draft law, which provides the transfer of the date of entry into force of the law on the personal data of Russians from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is placed in the basis of the legislative activities of the Palestine below.
Its authors were deputates by the Hospital Dayin, Iroewal Niols (LDD), the Federal Evasions, the United Russian Army of Parhain, and Alexander Juezko (CDP).
Such change, on view of initiative authors, will contribute to more operational and effective rights of citizens of RF to maintain personal data and to respect the secret list of information and communication networks.
The law, entering into force by the parliamentary, is obligated to keep the personal data on the RF territory of Russians processed through the Internet.
It also makes obligatory accounts, systemization, stocking, stocking, clearing and expansion of personal data of RF citizens in the Russian territory, as well as information on the location of such databases.
Furthermore, the law hopes that the Russian Surveillance is the right based on the decision of the Court to limit access to information processed by violation of the RF personal data legislation.
The law also proposes the creation of such "which lists" sites, a automaticly automatised information system of the Office of Personal Data Rights.
The law was adopted by the Hospital Year.
The draft law authors were submitted by the authors of the Legislative of Lugo and Wodam Day of LDD and Alexander Juezk from the CRF.
The Day and Juridiction are also one of the authors of the present draft law on the transfer of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
The data of the FF data should be paid for the apartment.
The commentary made today in the Hosдум's first draft law of the Pension Committee on Information Policy, Leonyd Levin stated that he had no problem to move the date into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
In his words, the company that will not have their own personal data in the RF territory will be able to restore them, for example, "in "Rustleco", which was unrepaidly said that they were ready to provide their servers to the apartment and already provide their servers at Mail Group, in Western companies that are now provided to their servers."
"Therefore there are several independent data centres prepared to cooperate in this area," he added.
"If the company has decided to do the law and continue to work on the RF territory, I don't see the problems -- they will receive technical opportunities for location," said Levin.
Consumer legislation
At the same time after the publication of the draft law of the Russian electronic communications, the Russian Association was concerned that, in the case of the adoption of the legislation, the Russians would not be able to benefit from many global servers.
In particular, it is about aircraft and aircraft services.
As a view of the Association, “the draft law leaves personal data actors - the citizens of the Russian Federation's right to be distributed by their own in operational data that their accounts, systemization and etc should be provided only in the databases set out in the Russian Federation”.
The GREC statement stressed that more effective measures would be to create a user information mechanism where the record is carried out, to systematize its personal data.
In that case, you can choose what territory the actions will be made.
In addition, the adoption of such projects on "lockization" personal data in other countries has resulted in the income of global services and significant economic losses.
The part of the testing road of the iron water exposed hotness
Isabel Roberts from Britain cried so when she had thrown a milk water on her head, which had disappointed the coat structure of the person.
This test of the iron water hasn't seen to pain.
Women was hospitalized after she cried so in the testing of the milk water that drew the honor.
Isabel Roberts cried so heavy when she had thrown out a milk water that had disappeared the structure of the face.
"It was so cold that I cried, but when I did it, my honor was starting to swear," she said The Mirror.
The water is 20-year-old.
Isabel Roberts for seconds before the unfortunate connection
I tried to close the mouth, but he didn't close, he's stolen, and then it came to me to understand that something is wrong.
Then my mother and sister had the same understanding and they were starting to desire, but I had to take urgently to the office of an urgent assistance.
An 20-year-old woman from Britain was brought to hospital to manage honor after participating in the popular interview in Friday.
The client became an Internet Sensation and has been issued thousands of times in Facebook and Twitter.
The soldiers delivered the Ukrainian military over 400 captive
In the New Stress Army, the Ukrainian Soviet 27 claims that the oppressor has violated the agreement of the cease of fire
The volcanoes at 10:00. 1 September were transferred to the Ukrainian side 402 prisoners, 72 of which were wounded and 35 soldiers died.
This reported the Interfax Representative of the Premier Office of the New Rossy.
He added that "laws of the WHO in the Mickey population area of the Su-27 aircraft which violated the cease ceasing agreement."
According to the contact of the Agency, the Ukrainian stakeholder of the Law Airport adopted by the prohibited international cosmetic batteries Conventions.
The representative of the pre-service noted that the complaints in the night could affect two U.S. paids to one of the field airports, and destroy two browserports and two composed of ware.
" The loss in the living force of the adversary - to a hundred people killed and wounded 13 persons were in captivity," said the representative.
The Interfax does not have the confirmation of this information from the Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed “National Republics” of Donbass claimed the transfer of the Ukraine party to comply with the ceasure regime of 223 prisoners and soldiers of the Ukrainian National Guardia.
At the same time, the DNA Army stated in the Newrossian Army, “the attempt of the Nazidians to violate the previously achieved agreements to bring a hard technology out of the environment.”
Then the volcanoes reported the destruction of two tanks and two ICPs, cut six tanks and 198 military disarmament.
According to this chapter, the general loss of the adversary on all directions (Dans, Lugan, Maripool) was made five tanks, eight-blocked cars, more than 120 people killed and begun.
At the end of the past week, the large group of Ukraine military military was held in the area of the Ilovakia area.
The President of Russia Armymond Putin requested the manager of the "National republics" to leave Ukrainen military officers from the environment.
The DNA agreed to take it in terms of ensuring weapons and armed wars.
The first tens of military officials began to leave the environments on the Sabbath on the morning.
According to the Commander of the Ukrainian territorial defence of Dunbos, Senam Seminchenco, on summer 14 people came out from the "Cat" night.
In his Federation, Seminchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounds are "in full of 137 p.m. 32 p. RF. and 9 tanks of RF" where they are well addressed.
Inter alia, IID and the Russians announced the reports of the Ukrainen military and NATO on the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
IAD RF: Russia will take response measures in the case of introducing new sanctions of the EU
Russia has the right to take response measures aimed at protecting their legal interests in the introduction of new anti-ross sanctions, reported IRF.
The report of the Russian external diplomatic state state said that the European Council of 30 August demonstrated the inability of Member States of the EU to continue the integration of the backward support for the Kypro authorities.
Brussels continued to stress that Russia is part of the situation in the East of Ukraine, attaining " absolutely unprofitable approvals of the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of this country," says the state.
IAD RF regrets that Europe, in contrast to the interests of their Member States, is affected by countries concerned in enhance the conflict with Russia.
Members of Europe should call for a peaceful settlement of conflict in the East of Ukraine, as well as to ensure the full "display between opposite parties", the state.
It also notes that no objective humanitarian assessments of the situation in Donbassa have been disrupted, where the full humanitarian catastrophe has been increased, as well as the number of victims of peaceful people.
Remember that the next seventh anniversaries in the European Union is planned to develop specific proposals on sanctions against RF.
The EU representatives are closely cooperating with American officials.
It is proposed that they will correct intravenant measures for the period of action and the dimension of hardness.
The new sanctions of Europe may affect energy and financial sectors.
The Australian Government also announced enlargement of sanctions for Russia ' s defence, financial and non-Fetate industry.
Heavy ways to connect university teachers
The cost of university students for many students exceed $1,000 per year, Matt Sherider, who will soon overcome the second course, has made a low way to reduce expenditure.
He developed a system of how to take a book of projects in the senior officers, proposing them a nominal compensation to make them lost their sales.
"My Mathematic Analysis, which usually costs $180, I got a seminar for $10 and the "Chick-fil-A", says Sherider, 19-year-old in Georgia.
He said that the necessary literature for the past seminar would be $430, and he said.
He's lost $120.
According to the Council of the colleagues, the average student will pay more than $1200 per year to teachers and training, but students have a number of options for reducing these costs.
The students are often electing the Internet Training and creative ideas such as Sherider systems.
The books are more popular, allowing students to use books during the seminar, and often are significantly decades than their buyer.
The Nebo Incorporyid company, which belongs to more than 250 university books, reports that the percate books increased two times since 2011.
Research shows that approximately four books in university books during the past marriage seminar have been brought a procucutor, see the Nibo President, Trevor Mayer.
More than half of all books are acquired in university books, according to the "National Association of University stores".
This is the introduction course in the best ways to make an advantageful debate.
Account in Internet Training
Sometimes, if you go to the Internet, the price of the new book may put one third from what you see in a university book store.
The nine exhibition of the Mathematical Analysis of Ron Larson, Brisa Edwards and Robert Hostketler stands at $290, but a new exhibition can be acquired for $239,99,99 on the Chegg.com website, which is special to sell books.
Building of the detention
If you're not against foreign notes or disasters, the manuscriptors are a good option.
"Mathematic analysis" is sold for $93.49 in the maintenance of Chegg.com.
Matt Caseda, 25-year-old student from Brigame Yang University, says that he paid for Amazon.com 42 cost for the maintenance of the Leader 'Strategic decisions: the understanding of the business of the advertising business'.
The book was sold for $48 new.
The students, for example, Ingryd Brisey, director "Claud without wall" at the University of Massachusets in Hamherst, proposed students to abstain their professors, whether it is not possible to use previous publications.
Sometimes updates are insufficient for employment.
In such cases, old publications are often found for the very small value of the last publication.
Besides Chegg and Amazon websites, Hallf.com, who belongs to "eBay Inc"., is a popular alternative for buying books.
Protocol
You should think if you're gonna be good with them, don't forget back and don't want to leave them after the course is finished.
You can connect more than 80% of the value of the new book.
For example, one student could take the Mathematical Analysis project for $20.
Find the rules of the store where you take books, including any steps that can write to you in the notes, emphasis and disappearance.
If you're taking a book on a profile, remember that if you don't return the book, the triffs may even exceed the value of the new example.
Email Books
Electronic books instead of traditional books are another option.
Sometimes such own books are collected by e-mail license for a certain period in the distributors, for example, Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Mathematical Analysis Protocol on the Chegg.com website for six months is about $61.
Bricy says that students who study literature often can find the most benefits, since many classic statements can now be free, while the literature of natural and engineering sciences may be very dear.
Despite nothing, look at it.
Jo Golt, 29 years old, which is going to start school in the Legal School of Pepperdin, recommends to be used by the ISBN number to explain prices on book, as it ensures that you are looking for the exactly necessary text.
Before doing orders in the Internet, he says, you need to check whether the book is actually on the composition.
It was not easy to give him this lection.
The addendum of the book that he obtained was lodged for four weeks and finally paid the full price in the University Book store.
The Pentiny declared the full inefficiency of the Developing East fund
The President of Russia, Virgin Puntin, held a meeting on the budgetary projects on the country ' s priority investment and territory in the East, reported the Interfax budgetary Investment for the Dalland East, which had been established two years ago.
"15 billion rocks so and remained lay on depositories," said the President.
During the meeting of the Chapter of the State, he urged the approval of the list of the territory of disagreed development in Darm East.
He recalled that the draft law required to establish the TRs should be exacerbated to the Hospital of the August.
The Federal Meeting noted the Chairman, until 1 July, and did not approve the list of the territory of driving development in the eastern East, and their criteria.
The Potterin Army also has established the main tasks for the development of the Developing East.
In the middle of them, enhance the availability of the region, removal of infrastructure restrictions, both on the internal market and for export development.
Nevertheless, there is a need to create references to accession to the region of additional investments, as well as to establish a territory of disagreement development that should be competitive to the key business centres of the ATA.
Remember, previously, it was reported that the territory of disastered development could replace OEC.
Why "Strace of Galactics" couldn't you save the Cass collections.
Sylvester Stalone has returned less than $30 million from its $90 million in the United States, while "The Lord of sins: the woman for whom it is to be killed" returned only $12 million from its $70 million.
"Home video" from Cameron Diaz was only $14.6 million in the first outcome, while child films, such as "Come make Dragon 2" are also deployed.
The article on the Telegraphy Robby Collin shows that when child films are talking about, the case may be bad as the same films.
Collin called the "style" year 2014 in the whole history of the child films, and called "Come to lead Dragon 2" to the "functional" duration of the finance.
However, when the films governed to hearing a few older age, it seems that the problem does not need to be the same films.
In July Entertainment Weekly compared the average series of CineaScore and Metacritic of each film above the year, at least 2000 copies between the Memory Day in May and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results that take into account the views of the film and the film crystals are allowed to imagine that the films of this year are similar to the calibration with past-year-old heats.
Some commentaries consider that the case may be changed in the changed greenhouse aspects and increased popularity of flood Internet servers, such as Netflix.
Register John Favro, who now works on the prototype of the disputy film, said the website of Hollywood Reporter, "I think time is changed."
We should recognize that and not try to worry about what was before.

As a result of 2015, several potential cosmetics are expected, including "Mistals: Ere Altrono", the Minnion and the South Park, other film industry representatives are more optimistic.
The "Ladies X" Simon Kinberg recently called the fall of the Cass collections just "ciclinic," he said, "The winter will be the most cassive year in history, and no one will survive this."
Product sanctions do not have the owners of the cowboy and average Asian dinners, but for the restaurants of the European and Japanese Russian cuisine, the Russian providers are a terrible dream.
And generally, it is preferable to allow for prohibited imports from Russia, as well as from Latin America, Israel and China.
"The best is a littleer than a bad Mossel," a shot of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Marianano Valleyo's quality of the shirts that offers him to replace Italians.

For a couple of months, a parish must have been missing.
What are you doing?
Go to Russian?
In 2005, I was on the Peamond Market.
Mariana Valério does the eyes that it is clear: the sweet memories will not leave it until now.
The mood was on the roads of all over 30 centimeters from the pool!
There's a kitchen!
Crisis!
Then I said we'll never buy anything for the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe there's all changed.
But for the days, I was brought to the fish of the Dalland East.
That's what she was funny!
I said I don't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Balerio is surprised that many standards for Italy are made for the Russian producer in the wildwink.
A few years ago, I was supposed to buy the Russian guest.
In Italy, the meat is 10 days in the temperature of 1-2 grades in the cold camera.

Nevertheless, Reyes becomes more emotional when it speaks of Russian providers: "Wright Captain 200 rubles!
I'm asking, "Why's the reason that it's so worth?"
I'm saying, "Well, we need to work."
But this captain must not stand about 80 rubles!
We're buying a weight, but they're alive 15-20 years, imagining how much is their master?
It's worth that it's supervisory.
It seems that Russian providers are one of the main sources of foreign prostitutes.
The standard story: "The last three months all was good, then the quality has falled down."
Main claims: Russian providers cannot extract statistical calibrates and quality.
Many restaurants of the European cuisine do not know that it will be with them when the stock is finished

Now and so unlikely to take the prices, says Rack.
By statistics, the growth of the general currency for the second quarter of 2014 is 1.8 per cent.
It's the smallest indicator after 2010.
The different prices will be growing further, it recognizes, but unlikely how fast: As long as most restaurants have been reserved products in the nearest two months in hope to overcome the excursions of cowboy prices.

"Oro for restaurants you can be replaced by another loose fish from the Dalland East," says the owner of the fishermen of his people "Sins people" Philip Galkin.
We've got a ring, a kete, a clothe, a hot, a crack, a cheese, a crowd bowl.
Yes, they're not so green as the Norvegian forest, because it's a wild fish.
Norwegian bowl is the same acabaculation.
You're taking him in his hands, he's not even shot.
And our don't keep our forests in the hands.
Only complaints without special claims to replace the Italian model of the sponsory
In the spring of his tent, the Magadan's tickets are laid with a trick, a throat, a muscle, a musxon, a middle with Crime, a Greek with the Dutch East.
Galkin is sure for a long time to go to fish from the Dutch East.
As a statistics, fish outcome to Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tonnes, a significant part of fish is going to Japan, Korea and even in the United States.
Fisheries imports in 2013 - approximately 800 tonnes.
His people worked since 2012, sold fish through Internet-garsin, until the sanctions have served another half of the restaurants, for example, the simple things.
There are still 15 restaurants to Galikan.
The same soft can be done from our fish, and he's warming.
We've tried, we've tried different recipes.
Now we're selling through the Internet wallet for millions of rocks a month.
Our fish is a couple of times, and the addment is a maximum of 15 kilometres in the kilogram.
In the confirmation of the Galaxian team, I am prepared for the Philadelphia Party with the kitt.

The Galaxian explains that the wages of leaving new receipts from the Middle East Fishe.
"The Russian fish providers have not yet proposed us," he explains the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitri Eve.
The same situation and other products: Russian producers could take the low, but it does not happen.
According to the Foundation Lavka Lavka's draft Lavka Boris Akimav, you can now speak about the location of imports from Europe and America by China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations where the powerful logistics and larger amounts are.
They are able to make an prohibited import to our farmers quickly.
So it's an prohibition that the large producers of other countries are first played," says Akim.
However, in the last month, the retained race has received and more worse signals than product sanctions.
The outcome of the Massive Inspective Testing of Rossus Weather was timely stopped by the three businesses of McDonalds in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Steelropol and Ecatherinburg.
"We are studying the proposed claims to define the actions necessary for the rapid opening of reservations for visitors," said the "Damm" at the McDonald Press office.
Actually, nobody knows what will be going on.
If all are limited by product sanctions, it is one option that can be overcome, it is said in the conditions of an anonymity of the company engaged in a reservated consolidation.
But if you start closeing McDonalds throughout the country, the scenario will be very different.
Europrotocol instead of HIVD
Coco's payment can be received without HIVD, so the CBC intends to stimulate the integration in Russia 'Europrotokola'.
The Russian Bank has developed a project of indications, which from 1 September of the year to receive a coco-smoking carrier could be provided without HIVD assisting.
That is true, only the cases when the aircraft was formed by the European Protocol without the participation of the police.
Thus, if only two cars were involved, there is no physically affected persons that do not exceed the fixed limage and both drivers have reached a consent to the person who is a criminal.
From 2 August the payment of the Europrotocol is 50, EUR, and from 1 October in Moscow, San Peterburg, as well as in Moscow and Lenngrad Area, it will be higher to 400 rubbers.
The situation is that even in the unbelievable damages in the situation where the TCP can be formed by the European Protocol, the drivers who have falled in the airport are calling to DP.
It was impossible when the coco police had been available without HIVD assisting.
Options written in the project of indication as time and time it is called to enhance it on the way of establishing the Europrotocol in Russia.
According to them, the maximum expenditure for coco on the DTP, formed without HIV staff, should not be lower than the Europrotocol.
However, it cannot be above the limite set out in the Coco insurance treaty.
The idea is, of course, useful and theory to develop both DPC staff and roads.
But most likely, it's not going to be in the neighborhood nor carriers.
The latter now speaks of the serious threat of the growth of minorities to which new rules can be introduced by the coco's payment.
As regards waterers, it is difficult to imagine what work the need to be done to overcome the imperial Russian conservation.
In most cases, the investor will be at times waiting for a small abortion, because it is the hope.
And yet not known that it will be easier to win the mechanics or to convince the watermen in the hope of the Europrotocol.
The conservation certificate shall be made namely and unreserved
The minor wants to impose subregional certificates to the predecessor and will allow banks to make them similarly.
It will prepare a draft law, which will prohibite pollution certificates to the predecessor.
Lastly, this tool is capable of popularity, as it has been led here above than bank contributions.
The fact that the prevention certificates of the claimant do not fall into the assurance system and the bank are deeply concerned because they do not need to be assigned to the Fund of the Contribution Service (ASA).
The impact of the situation is that the step is planned to take from small and medium-sized banks distributing such certificates, and the SBBBK and the Moscow Bank, which control 98 per cent of the profile market.
The Bank of Moscow, according to the Agency, is approximately 3,5 per cent.
The problem is explaining in the ACS that the small bank clients buying such a certificate are attempt to obtain money to the ASB.
Some containers who have no sufficient financial software and purchases of pollution certificates to the predecessor may suggest that their attachment is stored.
The absence of insurance payment for these certificates in the case of the license to the bank may lead to disappointment and social tension.
In practice, the agency was cased when the predecessors had tried to seek an insurance reimbursement through the court," said the ASB.
There's a problem, of course.
No one will pay the purchasers of certificates, since they have no right to reimbursement from the State.
If it was that the instrument was not enriched in the ASB, it would also be prohibited with the metal accounts that were used for citizens in one of the four metals of gold, silver, plates and petrols.
These accounts are not also in the assurance of contributions, but there are no one before it is tried.
It is, above all, that the certificates of the predecessor are a very valuable bummon that can actually speak in the quaxidenge role.
In this case, their movement is practically uncontrolled: any bank client can buy a certificate, transfer to any citizen, and before the recovery of such certificate can change the multitude of the households.
Unlikely, the draft law is prescribed that the conservation certificate must be an accurately precious bummy that should be kept in the depository.
In order to submit the pile to banks, such certificates are allowed to be released without the right of an emergency.
This is the analogy of an impressive contribution that the bankers dreamed for many years.
NATO Summit: First Protestants in Newport and Cardiff

The views of the FDG living on the shipment of Iraqi weapons were divided.
Some believe that it can only be stopped by the Islamic States, others are concerned that the weapons could finally fall into terrorists.
The soldiers shot the Ukrainian patrulled coat in the Asian Sea
The Norways have shot the Ukrainian pattery in the Asian Sea, reported the 31th August ITAR-TASS.
According to this, this has occurred in the Taiwan Wald near the populations of Shirokino and Unemy (10 to 20 km east from Mariupol).

Two Unions met
The above-level negotiations in Minsk did not decide the problems for which were known, but have made a new format: the first persons of the European Union met the first persons of the future European
Let the EU leaders and the Foreign Union have first discussed a number of “related problems” in the context of the Ukrainian situation.
This structure is special to work effectively without understanding, but it is clear that he has taken flowers from this self-employment.
Questions have been issued on the evening on 26 August when the Belaruss followed them and the other Europeans have seen in the televisions of the new President Lukasco.
The Belarus leader appeared an example of decisive intelligence, that was the behaviour of a person who just drew the geek-pot and planned a decent age in the highest society.
Like Midan Lukachenko helped
The arrival to Minsk immediately of three major European Commissioners (EU ministry) who met Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing of their name, not just the legitimation of the President of the 20-year-old.
This is a complaint to the Minsk plenary Agency of the European Policy and the main Mediterranean crisis.
The old analysis of the Belarus Strategic Research Institute, Daniel Malians, is sure that Brussels can no longer speak to the Mine's same tonne as before.
"What Catherine Ensen met the Teat-A-T with Lucakezco, it gives the reason to believe that the relationship with the EU will be deployed further," he said, "Hoola."
This is a hidden part: the preparation for the breaking of the Belarus authorities started a long time before the Norbour Midian in Kyove in 2013.
"When results were achieved and with the EU, these are successful negotiations on the improvement of visa and rehabilitation, the modernization dialogues, and the burning partner, and the United States have been conducted on international security negotiations.
The States have even disappeared some sanctions.
With regard to Ukrainian events, they had only understood the process.
On the one hand, it was possible to keep the relationship with Ukraine enough warm so that it could not be lost in mutual trade, and the President of Pousso could come to Belize to negotiations.
The other Belarus leader, who had not recognized Crime to Russia and urged to punish the prostitutes in Donbuss, with all courageousness, to Moscow.
The Minsk did not come from the Foreign Union, nor from the ODC, but the Russian Arabia was placed in the Russian Arabia.
Brissel and Washington noted the balanced position of Minsk on Ukraine and assessed it, certain Belgium experts.
As a result of successful movement of Lucasco to political diversification, it will be seen as often in the nearest time of Minsk to take meetings in the EU+TS format.
The High Representative of the EU on External Policy and Diplomation of Catherine Ethen could not operationally respond to the questions that Brissel is expected from relations in a new format.
The Chairman of Evan Maya Costanchi said only " Honigk" that, on the basis of the decisions of war and peace, this topic was not a priority.
It was so reported that the next meeting of the Ukrainian matter with the participation of the first persons in the new format may become also Kazakhstan.
It was a statement by President Norsultan Nazarbaeva, who recognized that it was personally requested by representatives of Europe.
Nevertheless, at the final briefing of Alexander Lucakzco, he understood that all sides are not contrary to that Minsk remains a central area for meetings as well as in Russia-OBSE-Ukrain, as well as at the level of heads of States and high representatives of Europe.
This means that the last Detective of Europe is the status of a full manager of the European leader who helps solving a global problem.
The best friend of the European farmer
The EU delegation, including the European Trade and Energy, has underlined the conclusion: the main summit is not the tragic situation in Donans, but the economy.
Actually, the recording of future gas supply negotiations and the extension of the dangers of the CT countries on the Ukrainian Association would be more larger than peaceful declarations without specific dates and numbers.
The Commissioner for Trade Carl De Huht, however, said: "The representatives of the EU have come to Minnsk to find a decision of the political crisis, which has economic consequences, not at all."
It seems, however, that in the Ukrainian economy, it is "working" in Belarus.
His consequences, and firstly mutual sanctions of Western and Russia, are given to Minsk, which is still trying to be sanctified, a long-term field for manaver.
According to the Leader of the Science-Student Centre of Mizas, the former candidate in the Chairman of Belarussy Romanchek, the European Investors are actively interested in the possibilities of Belure for Agricultural Production in Crimination.
It is so moved to schemes for which Army Pentin's self-covery of Minks.
"Initiatives of these schemes," said Romanchek "Hoognak" - are not the Belarus Business, but Russian companies.
They have been working long, including Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these models were destroyed.
The Russian Oster Business needs to restore them, even through the middle of the Belarus structures.
Second, it continues to continue experts, it is that many Ukraine companies are not able to set up production from the Ukrainian corners also with the guidance on the Russian market.
In the Ukrainian producers, $4 billion exports to Russia, and the Belarus production schemes can now be extremely encountered."
Romanchek considers that the role of the area for EU negotiations and the Ideal CT for Lukashenko and the development of economic relations with Europe.
He recalled that the loss of the EU sector from the Moscow sanctions is estimated at $5 to 10 billion and that Euro-Ironia has currently proposed only 12.5 million euros to the campaigns.
The Belarus Chairman may propose that Brussels work together to minimize the impacts for European farmers.
This may raise the authority of Lukashenco into the EU to a unfavourable height.
Hospital without initiative
Catherine Evan thanked the Belarus authorities for the Summit initiative.
But Paradox is that the official Minks from its active role in the birth format of TS+EC is strengthened, and the Belarus leader to meet the Ukraine colleague stressed that the new format was initiated and that it became the Kyv.
"It was your proposal to assemble, without any order to discuss, not with boat bars, to decide, after signing the Agreement on the Association with the EU, to dissolute in the situation that was present in Ukraine," he turned before the cameras to the Peacekee.
Nevertheless, observers set it as an attempt to rest Moscow, it was significantly contrary to the mixture of Minsk, which highly increased its political weight.
In the Belarus Diplomatic state, Belarusia highly emphasized that, in the organization of EU and TST, there is no useful objectives, but the final goal of this format is to create in the future of a unique economic space from Lisbon to the East.
"It is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts which are in other areas, in particular in the area of security, moves and moves the direction of our strategic Communities of the Russian Federation," said the Ognek in the IAD Belarusia, the state where they are recently composed of words.
Moscow zones may appear with paying entrance
The Government of Moscow considers the option of introducing a paying entry as a method of combating the central routes on analogic trail with other large cities of the world, with M24.ru's link to the Moscow Transport Forum.
One of the options that successfully recommended is the payment of the entrance.
This is an expert opinion, we need to learn it, see all mines and pigs.
To say that the decision has been taken on this matter until early," he said.
The master emphasized that the capital of the capital was very important for Asian cities that appeared on the structure and loading of Moscow.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is already implemented by the central color card, added the Nicodhuts.
Recently started the Central Color Car building is a certain example of the fact that the whole traffick is not to pass through Moscow.
If there were sufficient infrastructure for the departure, it should not have had been a transcript in Moscow," he noted the waver.
Max Lyxuth also stated that the introduction of pay parks was significantly laid down the capital roads.
And, in his words, the capital authorities are not planned to stay on the achieved.
Remember that the 26 August, the Russian capital Sergey Sweden began in the ceremony of the building bookmarks of the first start-up of the Moscow Road Road (CCRD).
Smoke Profant
Philm Frank Miller and Robert Rodriges, "The Lord of sins-2: Women for whom you need to kill" did not the revolution that it could be expected.
The first "God of sins" (2005), covered by minimum but symbolic, participation of Quentin Tarantin, made a revolution in relations between the film, the comics and the literature nar.
Sikвел also in its own revolution: it detruises the foundation for the modern thought of the "Tiss anti-Sysite" chapter (if it understands under the theis of the global nar, and the anti-communications cosmos.)
From now on, it should be read, "Thess is anti-hoos."
"The world of sins-2" is haotic and the dramatic, and at the philosophic level: both of them, he's in the stupid meaning of the word.
Yes, some of the heroes known by the first "The God", though, it's called Marv (Mickey Ruk), who has ended the life on the electric style, and there's nothing, only, but it's surrounding -- in the role of this people's woman, from the air of the pit and the other pumps with the students.
But the elders are literally scattered by the newspapers that are likely caught into the city from some other films about the meaning and the storm of which the storms are asking not to worry.
Yes, his story, unfortunately dismissed by authors in the very interesting place, at the superfluous game of Johnny (Jesef Hordon-Lebitt).
He's in the encouragement-frigidial Eva Green and something to her Dueta (Jussh Brolin).
But this journey, in which Duitt, wouldn't differ from Johnny, is more than the persons like the other parts of the body, the persons are involved with an inhuman regularity, not a pain and not even a disagreement.
It's not people, we understand that it's a nar architectur: a rocket that's too sure in itself's player who's pleasing in the "sex detection" sex corrupted by the sensors.
Well, and when the architep runs with the architectur and the architecturm, it's not a film, and you know, an abstractive life.
And to give an abstract life writing questions about the logic of this slaughter, it's just funny.
Furthermore, even in this crazy world there is something constant.
Boods from the first God's "God" continue to hold around the defence from the defendant of their family cards of darkness.
Yes, and the detective of Hartigan's no-net, and he's looking at the bunker, and Bris Williams is always nice to see.
The main problem of the Lord of sins is another.
Frank Miller was a good way that the artist had a talentally connected comics and nar, and as a recorder renewed the presentation of how to move the comics to the screen.
The Commission and the Nar are two aggressively contrary to "reality."
The phenomenon of comics was born at the end of the 1920s, then when the Malawi Society Square (1929), the Malta Summit (1930) and the "State Key" (1931) created a canon nara named by hard-boiled school.
Well, or pulp fiction.
The Communications gave a number of ten heroes from the Pope's season, which gives him rich power, Superman, Bathmen, and the saddle of Dick Trays to Chalka, Tora, Man Pawk and the other "Mans".
But in any film on the motive of the comics, there was something damaged: the qualified personals were constantly desired to grow a screen flesh, remaining in the middle of their real world.
Moreover, they've been left by "Existence".
On the contrary, Noar is the most extremist genre of the world literature.
Following world wars, the traditional roman, with survivals, characters, family scandles and historical background, lost any conviction.
What are the Forsites, which are Tibo and Rugon-Makara, which even the Bolacco and Ross are thinking of after Verden, Osvencim and Hiroshim?

Geneva has been the most universal and functional emotion of humans
The heart of the expression of persons is the biological universal for humanity, and each participating in its establishment of a body and a group of museum is not an additional means of expression and threat, the scientists of Australia and the United States have explained.
On their openings, they have reported in the Evolution and Human Behavior magazine, and shortly on them can be read at the Californian University of Santa Barbar.
The expression of the persons are shocked and left down the browns in the dark lips of the narrows in all cultures, and they do it even blind from the birth of the children never seen, notes Aaron Sell's research author.
In the framework of a large research project related to the nature of an anger, scientists found that this emotion had resulted in effective disputes during the conflict.
The more physical damage of one person can make another, so it is more opportunity to protect his conditions and he brings it to a contact with anger.
Researchers found the confirmation and other hypothetics: physically strong people are more bitter and moved to the manual, believes that they have the right to bind other inadequate conditions for them, as well as to prevent the powerful methods of decision of peaceful conflicts.
While noting that the wrath was mostly the " trade emoticons", the scientists decided that movements of each of the seven museum groups that create a cordial expression of persons should represent the worse indigenous more powerful and dangerous persons in the eyes of the contact, as well as the most possible compliance with the conditions of conflict to avoid conflict.
In order to verify this hypothesis, researchers were sent to the computer where the person was disabled or lacked by each of the seven elements of an irad person and showed their information.
Although the leaved bulbs or outlined in front of the individualship did not make bad persons, those humans were more strongly recognized.
The anger of humans, as well as animals, expresses threat: the extensive demonstration of his own force to agree and undermine.
A man sharps the narrows and smells his mouth with the same purpose that the avenger who is moving or the grandbour who demonstrates his princes.
The 'never' is allowed by the advocacy of the contact to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form that is most effectively demonstrating the opposite side of the consequences of this refusal.
But the most vulnerable - that no one of the anger's components is arbitrary, they all express the same thing," said John Tubby anthropologus.
