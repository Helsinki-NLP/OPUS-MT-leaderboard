Reconciliation to the very American ideal of employment rights as human rights
The Congress Members Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a legislative proposal to implement the organization of companies as a national right.
"As as traders die, the Mediterranean class Jobs died," said Ellison, a democrat of Minnesota and a comprehensive President of the progressive Caucus in the Congress.
Therefore, I am encouraging with the civil law, John Lewis, the law of employer authorisation.
This railway law provides workers the same legal opportunities in discrimination with regard to the organization of enterprises, such as other forms of discrimination, and stops both anti-operated forces.
The complementation of the National Law of Law to create a possibility of employees designed to organize a partnership in order to clude before a civil law - and to receive criminal or criminal initiative - is a significant and necessary initiative.
But there is no radial initiative with security - in any case, not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way and way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their legislation proposed that the connection is back to a very American idea.
Despite the recurrences made by the companys in the past years, in Wisconsin, Michigan and other countries throughout the country have been encouraged to recognize and maintain the rights of work in the world.
There was a time in which millions of Americans were remembered when this country called the democracy, the freedom of speaking, the liberty of press and the right of reconciliation was called.
When the United States appointed after the Second World War of Japan, Douglas Mac Arthur encouraged the country to decide a Constitution to ensure that Hedki Tojo's military Autocracy would be replaced by Democracy.
In full consciousness of the fact that the workers and their workers took a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers are guaranteed on the agreement and common trade and trade."
When the United States appointed after the Second World War of Germany, General Dwight David iceenhower and his steel, the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that the Fascism Adolf Hitlers would replace a strong democracy.
In recognition of the fact that workers should be organized and their voice to the new nation, the Germans added a class that explicitly expressed: "The right to establish agreements to ensure and improve the working and economic conditions.
Accords that impose or dealing with this law are to deal with none and non-related agreements; actions deployed in this law are illegal.
When the previous Lady Eleanor Roosevelt informed the Presidency on the International Human Rights Commission, which was designed by the General Declaration of Human Rights, as she was adopted by the United Nations as a global agreement, the Roosevelt and the other defenders were entitled to a guarantee that "Each person has the right to form or join operations to protect his interests."
Since generations, Americans accept the fundamental princes that human rights are human rights.
When this country is aware of how civil and democratic society can be formed, the Americans explained that the right to create a corporation, and that this company should then be protected in collective negotiations as equal partners with companies and government institutions.
After providing these rights in America, it is in fact very wise to bring the American ideal again, and then the worker has the right to simplify and provide a sound in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King said for fifteen years ago,
The story is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the movement of workers has not limited the strength of the nation but enlarged it.
In addition to the standard of life of millions of people, it has created a market for industry and has increased the entire nation at an unprecedented production level.
Those who take the work forget these simple truths, but the story keeps it.
The story remembers, and we should do this.
The formal recognition of employment rights as human rights - and the extension of the protection of citizens' rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers - is deeply overwhelming.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renewed the ideals that have made America great in the past and solved the promise of democracy.
The judge stops the timely law that all receipt lines in Louisiana could be closed
A US Officer stopped on Sunday before the implementation of a law in Louisiana, who said that it might be able to close all the five lines of the State.
This measure which Bobby Jindal, Louisiana Governor, was raised in June and would have entered into force on the 1st of the seventh, would be doctors to carry away the disbursements, to encourage patient survival rights in a hospital within a radius of 30 miles to acquire their practices.
However, the decision of the judge means that the doctors can continue to carry legal disasters while they call for such a law.
"The complaints can continue to work while they seek to achieve these rights," wrote the Federal Guideman John deGravles in his judgment.
In a month, a hearing shall be established for the judges to make a more sustainable decision for the law.
Delivery respondents welcomed the decision recently in a number of sentences against similar measures and said that the doctors had more time to obtain hospital instruction rights.
"The present decision means that women in Louisiana decided to take their right to their health and rights," said Nancy Northup, President and President of the Centre for Reproduction Rights, which, on behalf of three of the five cores of the State, had denied to keep the law.
It was not directly clear whether the sentence was also exposed to the doctors from the two clips that did not be accompanied and requested the right of instruction.
Louisiana is one of 11 States who have adopted similar laws, which recently explained such measures in Alabama and Mississippi for non-Constitution.
The key establishment of a law in Texas, which would have made the most of the clips remained in the State, was arrested by a Federal Guideline on Friday.
Delivery Defenders and American College of Osterians and Gynecologists, and American Medical Association agreed that doctors require unnecessary restrictions.
Delivery persons consider that measures serve to protect women's health, although some also welcome the impact of climbings.
Only a doctor who carried out in Louisiana disbursements contained patientsâ€™ uniform rights, shared the Center for Reproduction Rights.
If all the other doctors in the State are forced to do no disappearances again, that doctor would not take care of his security to carry the operation, the group said.
In their argumentation against the sentence, the representatives of the State of Louisiana said that they wouldn't affect doctors because of the execution of waste, while their requests would still be dependent on patient rights.
Related diagnostics and lacking access to best treatment possibilities lead to higher deaths by eiertockkrebs in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James have made a video damage for her mother online that was laid on Eierstockkrebs in 2007.
For women in the rural areas Australia, Australia is a higher risk to die in oil crowds than for women in cities.
Researchers analyzed the medical data of more than 1100 Australians, in which 2005 Eierstockkrebs was fixed, and found that only 25 percent of the diagnosis were only five years after the diagnosis.
The Research Chief Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those who lived in rural and displaced regions of the State, the death risk was more than 20 percent during the study.
CLEINE STUDIE: New medicinal products could require Lung and oil clothes
Researchers investigated the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of a woman in the diagnosis, the type of earn crystal, existing diseases, and the social and economic status also affect the survivals.
For older women and those whose cancers had already been extended to the diagnosis point, the lower survival rate was.
For those living in rural and distant regions of the State, the risk of death during the study was about 20 percent higher than those in town areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women who lived outside the city died with higher probability in Eierstockkrebs, Dr. Jordan made an unfortunate diagnosis and the lack of access to the best treatment centres as possible factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological uncoologes, and most of these are to find in larger cities," she said.
Despite the improvement of the telemedical services to address the disappearances, it offered a possible strengthening of the service of imposed doctors in order to provide specialists the possibility to bring women close to their habitation, as well as treatment programs for persons outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, independently from geographical status, had a bad long-term life rate in women in the Eartock Cross and underlined the need for better treatment and care strategies.
The studie financed by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer is today published in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013 Elisha Neave, a young mother of 33 years from the gold coast that she had a aggressive form of eierstockkrebs.

The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society show that living in the middle or small gardens do not mean that people can't be planted.
Guy Barter, chief garden officer for the RHS, said: "Container manufacturers, for example, are very loved at meaters because they can take their plants in a surrounding way."
The HTA Order identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "gold time age" of the garden trade based on increased domestic rates and economic benefits from the 1980s to half of the 90 years.
He also pronounced an improved market situation for this year because of the best weather in terms of uncomfortable weather conditions in March and April last year.

Matthews means: Most time for the great detention
In view of the galaxian technical progress that turns into our cheap homes to high-Technical routes, our columnist Bernd Matthie has been strengthened with an overly relied electronic accessories.
While I write this here, my look at the spring box that links the earlier to the phone, and I think, Boah, how back is that?
But it is a survey: if the cup would not be, in recent times all hearers would be around in the house, and it would be more important back.
Without other things, the electronic (electronic?
No, tip error: electronic sectors the regulation that the world's news of today's today's e-country is buyed.
And for example, who has an elderly person today in the living room, he just says that he is essentially unfair to television.
Why are these discussions?
Because the extents of the Sia at the function tour in this week brings us our absolute competence in the issue of the electricity.
The Laie, who has been earlier washing machine and CD player, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are extended with unfairly former experts before him: "Connected Home, Wearable, Health Care and Urban Technologies" tells us the press office.
Yeah, it's still okay?
What should you talk to people who are voluntarily extending such quarters?
For the reason, it's been about 20 years before all that we've been pleased to take our house.
In order to follow the Joghurt itself to share the brandmelners in the vacants that it burns it in the workroom.
And it wouldn't be wonderful if we'd be out of the climate station on our short arrival ...?
Yes, however, it makes a climate station.
But a dream will be determined to the first: We have our armour, you say, "Sube!" and the powder goes away.
Irre.
Everything is not less than a revolution: "The borders smooth between white and braun goods," a Branchenware, can connect the washing machine with a head earner, the Dampfgarer sends the weather report and the data she shows how long the pizza is still needed, but nothing is protected because we are in the steel.
Moreover, we know from the daily practice: If a new-regular device is really used, the acquis is guaranteed empty.
Another reason is that the Spriralkabel on the telephone will also survive the following functional exhibitions.
The children of Israel return to their schools after war in Gaza
A thousands of Israeli children from the area near the Gaza Street returned to schools after they had stayed the summer in the air protection areas, while rakete and merchant shots in their municipalities during the 50th war between Israel and Hamas, and left schools in Gaza, while the country of the battle was taken.

"They were difficult times, and we were not all out of the house," she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbert near the border in Gaza to provide its support.
Until an arms growth last week, the war stopped thousands of the inhabitants of the borders like Saad in their houses or left their homes to go further away from Gaza in secure areas and to escape the rakete and murder fever.
Many inhabitants of Naal Oz, a municipality near the border of Gaza, where a four-year boy was killed by a Palestinian murderer grade, still returned.
The Ministry of Education was shared, as a decade of families have not yet returned.
Your children were prematurely undertaken in other schools.

He called the children to learn much and said, "There will be careful of your knowledge and of your safety."
Israel and Hamas were connected on the past Sunday to an unlimited weapons.
The arms railed for an immediate end of the battle, but important problems remain unresolved, such as the demand of Hamas after the resurrection of the Israeli Egyptian blocks of Gaza and the recovery of air and seasons in Gaza.
Israel requires a disappearance of the Hamas and the delivery of the bodys of two Israeli soldiers who were killed at the battle.
A new round of indirect conversations will now begin in Egypt in this month.
In the war, more than 2.100 Palestinians were killed, three quarters of them were civilians, and at least 494 children after the estimations of the Palestinians and the United Nations.
Israel provides this information and estimates that it is at least half of the fighters, but there was no concrete objects for this information.

After selection in Sachsen: CDU-Vize Strobl provides an application for NPD bans procedures
In view of the vote loss of NPD in Sachsen, CDU-Bundesvize Thomas Strobl spoke to the end of the current NPD prohibition procedure before the Federal Constitution Guideline.
Berlin - In the terms of CDU Bundesvize Thomas Strobl, the running proceedings against NPD should end before the Federal Constitution Guide.
"The NPD is worse than at the last time," Strobl said, "which also is a CDU loader in Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, the "leipzig peoples period."
This is a pleasure development in the right direction and development that allows me to achieve the result of political combating the NPD and not from the constitutional governing.
The NPD was completely failed to vote on Sunday at the Fifth Percent horde.
A first approach for an prohibition of the legal extreme party was failed in 2003 because the Constitution protection had also been informed in the NPD sections.
In December 2013, the Federal Council had introduced a new request in Karlsrue after the preparation.
The Federal Government and the Federal Day were not concluded.
Harburg: Delivery for new refugees
In the neighbouring countries, refugees are now undertaken in cells.
The Central Research for Refugees in Harburg offers out of all Nights.
Now the internal authority has put up three cells of the red crown.
The circles politicians have been informed shortly before - they have little desperated.
"These Haurcuck Actions continue to preservation of the citizens and give the surrounding politicians no opportunity to participate constructively in the human training of refugees", says Britta Herrmann, President of Greens in the Harbourg Congress.
Its Party calls for the maintenance manager of Harburg to be available at the present time by unnecessed households.
96 refugees can be brought into the three cells.
Most reasons for the completion of the first subsequent are the urge of aid requesting - and the ability that the authorities cannot prepare places in follow-up institutions.
Many refugees will therefore remain longer than the three months regular.
The house prices have experienced the most strongest winter growth in seven years, showed a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for own houses in the Australian capital city increased by 1,1 percent in August, thus the RP data from Monday.
The total increase in June, July and August is at 4,2 per cent, the greatest increase in wintermonates since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than twice higher than the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but increases were not equally distributed over the country.
The Research Leader of RP Data, Tim Lawless, reported that Sydney and Melbourne undertake a secondly shared market.
The numbers of RP Data provide that the house prices in Sydney increased in the past year by 16.1 percent, in Melbourne were 11.7 percent.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, in which the prices are averaged by about five and six percent.
On the other end of the Skala, Canberra, which was hardly affected by the enterprises in State expenditures and where the prices over the year were only 1,4 percent.
Mr Lawless continued to observe an increase in the real estate for the next months, with the printing office, which would be undertaken to the market 'the real test' for the next months.
"When the long-term high rate of the Auction Price, a general speed of sales and the continuous lower rate, it is likely to increase the own home prices in the next three months," he said.
In a opinion to the New Presse, he responds to the conclusions of the Director of the Officer Peer Medau and tests that "as a field master".
The style of high school is not that, in the communication.
Thus, if the Medau family has already been informed "Mine June must be informed about the inside of the high school.
The explanation that the plans have been known before in July are definitively wrong", says PÃ¶tzl.
At the same time, he pointed out that it does not be "properties or other decisions", however, it would be "preference".
The needed construction of the raw road down to the lock is also worried less dramatic than the Medium.
From a nine meters wide road and not the speed.
It's after the current location of 5,50 meters, which is a meter larger than until now", says PÃ¶tzl.
The argument of the Medau drivers that their free and school-based park areas are used in the future only by students of the high school, it will not leave to be patzl.
It will not be divided, because it allows us to solve in the middle of other public parkings.
Think to the residents
The child crystal that is located on the town and would lead the arrival to the parkdeck, in accordance with the High School President, "not affected".
Moreover, he is to think, "It's not only about the children's crystal, but also about the inhabitants of the peaceedrich streets and the 800 teachers of the nearly real school.
It is therefore much more than Mrs Medau's particular interests," says PÃ¶tzl.
Whether the critics of the Children's Party Crimes, with the extension of the road would go to lose a 'the few natural flowers of Coburgs',' can decide the reader itself.
At the beginning of October, PÃ¶tzl wants to inform the city facilities of the construction of the high school to 2020 "and in this regard to the importance of the new conclusion".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the child crystal over the high school plans last week.
After this, the arrival for the new parking parking should not be carried out as far as over the campus and the Friedrich Street Street, but over the Medau-Berg.
The street should be built on about a kilometre length of two-soft length.
According to the high accounts of the Medium, the transport in the park of Schloss Hohenfel would be decades in this way.
From about 2000 vehicles the talk is daily.
From the sides of the city, they didn't want to explane the project.

An emergency and two other attacks were followed.

Some other complaints come to this.
I already noted that I control my head, but my body can't taste," Glandorf said in the interview of the "Handball Time".
For a comeback, he would only be prepared in absolute emergency.
"When all streets go, I'm always ready to say," the family father said to the Fachmagazin.
However, I can tell the years in which I can play a handball on the hand.
I must also say that after my long hospital stay 2012, I have become quite humble to what is about my health.
After my carrier, I want to go at least sometimes.

Heinz LÃ¶lfing Chief Organisator Jos on Huerne and Citizen's Master Televisor Heinz LÃ¶lfing showed great pleasure about the facts of this radsport event.
We are happy and it was a beautiful experience for all participants.
The organization lost without problems, and there was no negative events," Heinz LÃ¶lfing is a positive factor of this event.
Unfortunately, many participants came not as the Institute had tried, some of the bad weather prognoses and tomorrow's rain.
"We'll see us again in 2015 at the public beautiful weather on August 30 or during another week end," the raddlers said to return to the MÃ¼nster country and plan a new pack.
Constantin Weckers unfairly medicators
It is actually more philosophic witness than biography, which Constantin Wecker, Lidermaster, Pacifist, Political Activeist, ex-hoftling, in "MÃ¶nch and war" on 287 pages.
Not chronological, but more thought fashion for thought fees, the MÃ¼ncher born on 1 June 1947 has described its meriters, which each chapter was introduced by a suitable lied text.
And he is without courage: from the Onania like Gymnasiast to the discharge stage and the drug consumption he does not allow human weakness.
In order to discover how he himself learned tolerance in transition with his friends.
The width rooms also take abstract, but because of the more important definitions: love, soul, Iron, his body now, spirituality - all he tries to go to the reason, in very philosophy but also very personal way.
And he also explains his patientism, his society criteria, its political engagement - and, as he did not only the music (the lover is the soul and Rockmusic), but also his detention.
Lastly, the Libemann Constantin Wecker has also brought close to the askertic moon, which has "durch subtraction", as he says, "and then we leave everything inevitable."
Between there are also short anecdoes to the earth: some about slaughters in one of the GIs frequencies local or a smooth car in which he visited a frontal tree.
There he's also without honestness.
Lenny Henry: my dad never took me into the arm.
You never said "I love you"
Henry was one of the seven children of a Jaaikan family immigrant in Dudley in the Middleland in 1958.
His father died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry proceeds for a comedia, Rudy's Rare Records, partly in an impressive conversation with his father and went out of the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of Reggae and Rap, with living melodys.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood modes.
He visited "vile" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is thinking about his relationship to his father.
It was difficult to know him.
You never saw his face, just heard his voice, "Keep up with the skin.
Let your sister quiet.
Move!
I want to look at Cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were uphold when I was a child - went into his knee and talked about things like the form of the bier glass or the beauty of a crystal.
I never had such a talk with him.
A majority of my life was this serious guy in the egg that reads the newspaper.
He recently opened a playery in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in the time of his father, he made a view of how the life had been liked for him.
It's now something more clear, but they're dark, surprised, deep stygian labyrinthe with flamming rocks and rain and a lot of smoke.
My father was so easily put into the pit, and then you could hear him slowly as he began to sing because he could cut off the shit from himself.
When I went around there, I was obvious that he had done the years to bring the food on the table, and my respect was greater before him.
However, Henry grew as a child without love tests of his parents.
My father never bowed me, he never said "I love you."
Before when my mother was bad to the end of her life, we'll like you, "I love you, I love you, I love you"
By his own daughter, Billie, with Dawn French, he could share the love he lost as a child.
Can you stop with the "I love you"?
Stop to hurt me!
Dad, I'm 22!
with Dawn French.
Why don't we have to be friends?
She's a great mother.
It is still happy with French who he was married 25 years.
This is a good man.
Why don't we have to be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was diabetist.
That's going to their death.
So when I was very, very weak and showed diabetes symptoms, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I went through this feeding and also had to make a drastic diagram to turn the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's stretching.
Nobody likes cards.
Henry's carrier change may be shown in his elegant, shortly circumcised bart.
Since he was granted by the criticians for his othello, he was assembled by the theater.
It followed the Com mission of the Irnations and then Fences of August Wilson.
This is another experience than the Sitcoms and Comodias who have filled its employment.
He started with only 16 years when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on the beach when he imited people and wrote to New Faces about him.
His telephone carrier started midst of the seventy-year-old. "I was for a very long time of the only black-known/comedians in the television."
He learned in the professional.
I had to be great not only before the eyes of the public, but also from 1975 to 1985, how I could be a effective Witness Scene machine, while I was a star through the television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager decided the skill right to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a easy conversation program in which the people "swords of black", Henry made his comedy there over five years.
My family was very unrealised.
I wanted somebody that it would never happen, but I don't make sure I did it.
It was an elderly, unnecessary position for me, but I worked with river projects and learned how to move with a great public.
But this "yearly priced preising, easy column of the British television" was also a "grown parody of black people."
The establishment of Figurs, which the British black cultures were shots as well as fed, Henry worked in the actors at an alternative comedykreis.
The first series of Lenny Henry Show went to send in 1984, and in the nineties he was known, among others than the kitchen Gareth Blacklock in the mercury Chapter!
Werbing, documentary films, TV series and film roles were the next decade, but after his BBC series LennyHenry.tv 2008, he thought he said, "What are you doing as next, Len because it feels like that you're just getting the time or take a bit on the place."
Then a documentary series of radio 4 came with the title What's So Great About ...?
The first consequence was about Shakespeare.
On Shakespeare, I was regularly allergic.
I never had learned anything right about him in the school, and overlooked him for a household of the Mediterranean class, white in the flowshoses and a cotton.
So I had great fear.
All we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, "You should try it once.
Don't worse if you don't know what you're talking about.
Take a few of the words into the mouth, and then you'll understand why we all like Shakespeare.
Henry has opened 20 lines from Othello's last talk for the documentary film and he was enthusied.
I felt that I could make it.
It was almost like someone would finally put my head right.
"Why it's going, it's a serious thing, take them serious, learn your text, search a little.
The tests were brutal and I read this piece a month before we made it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to wait for a car accident, and it wasn't easily happening.
And soon he opened in the come of the irrations.
Immediately I was in the National Theater and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you changed."
There was a technical mistake, and Henry felt instinct that he had to interfere the public.
"An little voice said to me, "You have to overcome ten minutes now while they can repair the computer."
Instead, the manager announced that the idea continued as soon as the problem was solved.
I went out of the bottle and something in me said, "Oh, thank God."
I'm not responsible for this.
I can leave someone else.
"You play in a theatre lot, so stay in your role."
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
To learn the text for Phences was aspiratory.
Panik is very good, that strengthens the seeds.
And this came well, so it is like a great shield of the gods that say to me, "This is your order."
He says this, of course, with a DONNING voice.
So I'll stay there.
I really like this.
I like it to be in a proven space.
But Henry still has the head of a Comoian - our conversation has gone through humorous explosions while he is always analyzing people again.
I decided not to make a stand-up commission, because I find that this kind of immediate satisfaction of a Salle of Foreigners is dangerous.
If you're still looking for this, you're going to go over a wall.
I sometimes live in Apollo when I love it, but I do not have so much as before.
I'm asking him if he's gonna make a position-up commandor again.
The pleasure I have in a room with a director who helps this to create a start, a share and the end of a trip -- I don't think I want to repay it ever again.
So this is his new incarnation here?
I think.
I like a player.
It's funny.
You're always telling a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.

Children need wheels and flowers
He was 44 years old in school, 23 as a teacher.
From that time Manfred judges are known by many of the well-known Peters housers and Collbachers from their time as a teacher.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but continued to strive to see people in the student.
The snow coppet is the most famous mountain of the Riesengebirge.
Manfred judge loves the carriage with the Motiv out of his home.
Judge was born in Trautenau/Norwaybemen in 1930, today Trutnov.
He was very interested with 14 years after the teacherâ€™s teachersâ€™ school.
A year later, the South Sudans were deteriored.
In a half hour, the family had to leave her house.
After a few months in a camp in 1946, he went to Bayern in the goodswaggon.
So the judges were disappeared in the upper-friendly sensdorf.
The teachers were found in Bamberg.
Manfred judge six times per week to 10 kilometres to the next train station, with the train to Bamberg, there three kilometres want to go through the whole city to school and afterwards.
After two months Manfred judges in a road-Creuz house in Bamberg was a bedroom: together with 15 students in a bedroom.
In 1951, he made the first and 1954 teachers after three years after the second State review.
Since he had no free teacher place for him, he took himself to Oberbayers and came to the school in Collbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Freein room" was his first "service" in the school.
In 1958 he visited a three-room service in the new teacher house next to the school.
This house bought Manfred Richter 1980 after the school was released in Collbach in 1968.
To that end, there were three classs in Collbach School in Petershausen School and five in Petershausen.
Since the school year 1968/69, these were held in Peters Houses in the present Council House.
When the school was founded Indersdorf, the basic school remained on the place.
To get back in the now small school, the recorder Georg Sigl changed to Karlsfeld - and Manfred judge became his followers.
But Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers were able to take the modern construction that was extended to judges in 1997.
Manfred judge welcomes the uncomplianced majority of the employees of Ludwig GÃ¶tz, who also allowed a workspace at the community costs to build and extension in 1997, although it was not sustainable in accordance with the directives for education.
"Beriger GÃ¶tz was very folk," remembered the judges thankful.
In his entire carrier, Manfred judge never forgotten the term of a government adviser, who answered on a refusal of a school on law and justice: "I never can forget love." Manfred judges set out what he heard as young teachers.
"You must admit to the children of two: wheats and flowers," says this day 84-year-year-olds.
And he had to learn, "It's not always enough." If he's just thinking his own teachers or just his six children, it's not really clear.
In each case, the judges were sometimes unconventionable.
When students were checked, they did not get a penalty from him and were not denied to his seat.
At the costs of the municipality, judges had made two pairs of box hands and allowed the two conflicts to attain one another, even if it had to give a veilchen.
To the good of the school, judges as a director took a good relationship with the citizen Ludwig GÃ¶tz (CSU).
This moved the partlood judges after his pension, at least 1996 as the last on the CSU list for the community Council.
However, judges were elected six and took the CSU.
180 kilometres in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 drive drivers are located in the short park of Bad Salzhausen and Shots Interstups
If Radler make a radler on their tour in bathrooms or shot rast, this is nothing special to himself.
On Friday, however, the number of races impaired: The 700 participants of the Hr4-Radtour together with the Begleittros had a Pause in the lower square park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party under free sky in the Higheburg park.
Under the Moto "Radeln and feasts on newly discovered ways between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants had met on Thursday in Bad Vilbel, and there was a concert of Van Baker & Band.
On Friday, the Radler took the first stage, 60 kilometres over Florststadt to Bad Salzhausen and continued to shots at attack.
In Bad Salzhausen, the sportsmans of the Hans-Peter Seum, who was launched in Bad Vilbel with the carrier, and the leader of the own business Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing DÃ¼ring.
To satisfy the body and the spirit was prepared all good things: the landscapes from Ranstad and low-mockstad were 85 beauty Apfel, Scratch, Stress and cooks that mounted the powerful radlers.
"Solche shoes can only return lands," a participant lodged from Aulendiebach while he commanded another piece.
In the drinking state of the GeiÃŸ-Nidda, cold congratulations could be made.
The "Duo Bravo" provides visitors with known melodys from Operetten and Musicals and felt a pleasure applaus.
The beautiful park's park worked relaxing.
A Master's mass of his partner: "There has gained it, finally he has now reappeared the disappearing carriers."
Therefore, the citizens and the managers were still working: they were in the pool before the pool of reporters Rainer Janke interviewed and used the opportunity to spend on the radio for bathrooms.
Like Tobias Hagen, since the first hr4-Rad tourist 2004, could only be able to get short, but he had to do richly with the technology in place.
His Pickup Trick, which he made three phones and a functional device with his employees and the 15-know-hour motor drive of the police home, wrote and reported, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants is from the Rhein-Main Building," he said, "the same way also from gieÃŸes or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the taxi, and even from numerous cities in Westphalls, railways are acquired.
The number of participants is a few of the oversight capacity available.
In category I, the participants are submitted in hotels, in category II in collection events.
The radlers had a good impression after they had stopped within one hour: "Tish!"
"It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!" they bought for the departure.
After arrival to Schotts, the group had a short decade.
But at evening the Radlers were requested in the idyllic Alteburg park.
The park had received a beautiful fixed environment, and of course it was prepared for flaming flowers with a good chosen feast.
Sister Susanne Schaab, GTS Guest Director Markus HoÃŸfeld and MSC Chairperson Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his function as a predecessary member of the ADAC Hessen Series welcomed the visitors.
The three showed a great pleasure about the "multe operating in shots".
DJ Tobias Hagen then freed the tanks.
The opportunity for smooth movement under free sky was used, despite sports confirmation on the road.
The guests missed increasing citizens who were aware of the good smoke, like the great sharp of radar drivers.
On the second day, for the radars were stationstics of Birstein, Watch and Bad Orb - including a concert with the frequentors - on the program.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of radelns, the sports returned to Bad Vilbel.
Decade of Turkish Policeists against the Government
In total, 33 policemen were arrested in Turkey because of the defence of the "consolidation against the government", local media agency.
The police authorities did not have any direct comment.
At the detention, 14 high-ranged police officers are reported by UrualitÃ© Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption studies against government employees, including four government ministers in the last December.
In July, a number of Turkish policeers was arrested because they had probably founded a organized criminal agreement and had reached telephone numbers.
The Turkish President Recep Taygun Erdogan (the same time was Prime Minister) described its action as part of the activities made by the Islamist spirital Fethulla goods against him and other persons in power.
Not all children in Ukraine return to school
The schools were opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer feasts.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and as thousands of other Ukrainian parents brought his daughter into school, Arsenij Jazenjuk.
It was not possible to protect the country for future generations that he had not yet opened all schools that he was decided to be able to protect the country:
The September feasts were not stopped in each school.
The sky is not all over the Ukrainian.
We need to fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole Ukrainian, a great common Ukrainian peoplefront, must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukhow, school teacher in Slawjansk, who visited the daughter of Jazenjuk, said to Russian.
We hope that the children will finally rule peace here and receive a education that will be useful for them in another life.
The first schoolday of the new school year is traditionally feeding, taking the children's beaten heddens, holding ballons into the hands and clothe their teachers flowers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director she needs.
It comes in with a huge swimming breakfast from the bank world, the media management and the internal environment of the Tory Party.
And she's got your own front experience.
Their carriers began at the world management company Bain and Co., which changed in Morgan Stanley, Bombadler, ICI and Pearsons' media world.
She was seven years ago presidency of the Financial Times and turned back when the top posts of the mother company Pearsons went to a young man colleague.
It was probably approximately 1 million euros.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former president of BP, when she was looking for more private knowledge in Whitehall: she was to the attendance of the Kabinett.
Her husband is a former Tory Council member.
Today in May, I described the task of the Chairman with a missed kitchen.
Not only the BBC is a huge and complex unit in the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in his structure.
Truth operates in two directions: inside the first garden of the management architecture in the BBC, but also outside as a voice of public concern and unruly if things are wrong.
This provides for a almost insufficient duopol that requires complete reform.
But who new coming presidency would risk it to take into consideration and to adopt a institution that is so complex as a Chinese dynamic, while he may bring himself about his work.
It's a difficult task.
And as though it wasn't enough, even many are interested to see the BBC clothes - overcome power, money and status.
While the competitiveness is close and threatens new ancient, secure technologies, the present negotiation of licensing costs for BBC is connected to specific dangers.
For the diversity of the sum of 145.50 EUR per year, the British public sells the world's most common media companies.
The BBC tells a good story: she says she's 96 percent of all households and only 40 pence per day costs every one of them.
And apparently, the BBC grows on the beloved scala again: 53 percent supports it today, compared to 31 percent ago.
The customs and uses for the BBC have changed: I am currently accepting news pages on my phone and see more later changed programs on my iPlayer.
But she remains a very loved and considerable institution.
She needs a comprehensive president -- I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says that there was no authorised
A second from the official user account of the republic Governors of Texas, Rick Perry, on Sunday, includes a remarkable note on the democratic jurisdiction lawyer, which is in the middle of a criminal complaint against him because of the abuse of the official manager.
The second was later removed and replaced by another by Perry's user account, which is deprived.
It's a second of my account that was not authorized by me.
"I don't pay the second and I remove it," said it in the later message.
Perry's employees do not answer in terms of comments.
Although the seconds of Perry's official user account came out, it was not clear who actually attended the feed.
In the previous Section, a unprofitful image of the berks State advocate by Travis County, Rosamary Lehmberg, who was condemned in April 2013 because of the taxity was condemned.
Perry introduced a Veto against financial support for her office when she refused to return what might be an appeal against Perry, the possiblely 2016 presidential skills, before a Great Jury has brought this month to Austin.
The second text says: "I don't always go through the triplely affiliated alcohol level... but if I do it, I add the Governor Perry if he's extracted."
I'm the most furnished democratin in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not awarded to the leadership of the Grand Jury investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor of San Antonio elected by a Republical judge.
Perry planned on unlawful and the complaint called a political trick.
Its high-class team of legal circumstances requested the judge to demonstrate the complaint and argued that the law, with which the official governor in the history of the State Texas, is inconstitutional.
Perry stopped $7.5 million to the Public Integration Unit of State - which is secured in Travis County and determined in cases of State corruption in Texas - as Lehmberg refused to return.
This Veto provided for a public complaint on a left-sided Watchdog group.
Perrys official user account is often updated - and sometimes recognized.
After he concluded at the election meetings in Iowa during his presidencyskandidture 2012 as the fifth, Perry went to speculations that he would stop by putting a series of photos from the Joggen near the sea, with the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley explains the apartment market again for "normal"
One of the prominent construction operators of London argued that the apartment market in Southern England was back to the normal level "returned".
The own homes in the capital were hot and the area of large prices, which the Bank of England was due to a widely widespread fear of a credit bulletin in order to set up in June the upper limits of hypothecs.
Tony Pidgley, Prior and President of the high-class construction company Berkeley said on Monday: "At the beginning of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since the maximum of 2013" and added that this is a "estable operational use".
The real estate market in London was well placed during the departure, since foreign buyers were in the capital.
According to the catasteramt, the prices in the city area are only increased in the past year by 18.5 percent, larger than the average increase in England and Wales in total.
The average sale prices in Berkeley's private, prices and student offers have increased approximately a fifth in the past year and end of April 423,000 EUR.
However, in the last months, some of them have become less attractive in the real estate of real estate in London for foreign buyers - some of them also have been dismissed by the establishment of new real estate taxes and political retoric in order to enable a "multial tax" before the general elections in the next May.
Londraâ€™s real estatemaker Foxtons warned in the past week that the Hypotheken market report for April was presented to the shortest credit provisions in the second year would also lead to small market growth as well as to the sale of the prices.
New data from England from Monday shows a decline at the hypothecs voluntary in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is deleted.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, corrected its precaution for the increase of the real estate prices in London for 2015 to 3 per cent, based on the basis of a already damaging home price.
The transaction volume in the middle of Londons, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has returned average yearly a quarter, so the Macular WA Ellis.
However, the wish for a own home in the city of Berkeley is a blessing, since the accidental amounts for termining sales are over 2.2 billion euros.
Mr Pidgley added: "The requests according to the correct, well planned product remained stability and as a result have also remained termining sales."
In June, the company reported that it was 3,742 new own homes in the year until the end of April, almost a third than the maximum of 2007 before the crisis.
The annual tax result has increased a 40 percent to 280 million, which is 18 per cent of $1.6 billion.
In a Monday's communication before the year's year meeting, Mr Pidgley said that the income for Berkeley in the coming year would be in line with the current market expectations.
The Analysis assessed the annual prejudice result of EUR 450 million.
Berkeley workshops standed on the afternoon day in London trade at 23.96 EUR.

They disappeared, so you could describe it best, they're slowly on like a carton that have left to stand in the rain.
Sometimes a woman told him that he was too serious, stretching, intense, detentioned and may be some harmful.
And then he put his hand on him.
He's noted a lot of time.
He was smooth, like in Igel, yes.
The last sacrifice of this stackness was a just starting campaign, which had been a number of advertisers for a decrease of the single length of his life, and perhaps would have brought him some satisfying.
Ailinn Solomons was a narrowly charming beauty with unemployed hairs and a flat heart from a village on the north island, which even slower and rare than port Reuben.
She came with an elderly guide to South, who held Kevern for her tante, and the foundation in a fire but the Paradise valley had earned with the name of Paradise Valley.
Over several years, no one had lived in the house.
The rocks were white, in the bulls were still springs, shocks had left their legs on all windows and believed that they heard all this, and the garden was grown up with unrealised, which appeared as huge cows.
It was like the house from a child market, both locking and locking, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait by the author: Howard Jacobson, the Roman "J" on the long list for the Man Book price 2014.
The court list is known in the next week.
Kevern had swimed with Ailinâ€™s swimming powders in the high gras and had eating a infinitely warm afternoon. Among them had been connected to the service consoles, which had assured the country with a comfortable music and private news when the view of their cracked brain knee knee was forgotten to a old song of a long time-minded Entertainer, which his father had seen in the locked rolls in the house.
Your feet are too large.
Because of her original aggressiveness, such songs were no longer played on the console.
Not prohibited - nothing was so prohibited - simply not played.
Successfully obsolete the word.
The general disagree created what was never having done, and how the people in books had chosen the Vom-Terbecher-Zum-Melionary Memesers, Cochbooks and Love Romans, so they chose the balloon at the music.
In the euphorie of the day Kevern began to play a imaginative key and to be a large feet in a greb-common Serenade Ailinn.
Ailinn doesn't understand that.
"This was a known song of a Jazzpianist named Fats Waller," he explained her and made her automatically two fingers on his lips.
That his father had always done to stop the letters J before he came out of his mouth.
It was a game between him and his father when he was still small.
His father had played it with his own father, so he told him.
If you start a word with a J, without putting two fingers on your lips, a penny will cost you.
There was no very pleasure game at that time, and it was not very fun now.
He knew that was expected of him, that was all.
It was supposed to explain what Jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard any.
Jazz was, even if he wasn't directly prohibited, don't play.
The improvisation was no longer modern.
It was just a place for one "wenn" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a melody where she would end.
Like the understanding.
His unprecedentedness made people nervous.
And Jazz was a musical understanding.
Although he was ten years old without having heard by Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about Jazz of the half secret collection of his father's old CDs.
But at least he had not to explain Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
In her age, she probably couldnâ€™t remember a time when the pants were not black.
Repeats, no laws or disobediences.
A conform society means that each element of this society was grateful to establish the principle of the group delivery, thankfully as the ones sent by the ship.
People with afro-carbic origin were suitable through the temperature and the construction of the body for conversation and sports, so they can and burned them.
People who originally tried from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by the nature with electronic talent and were assigned to the task to ensure that no family had no service phone.
What else was left from the Poland Community, it was concerned about the canalization; what remained from the Greeks, Teller spread.
Those of the Golf States and the levants whose grandlands hadn't quickly left the country as WAS GESCHEHEN WAR, WENN ES GESCHEHEN WAR came from fear to be tackled because of fire shopping, even because the flames would be proclaimed as the next - had opened Labneh and Shisha-Pfeifen Resortors, were thoughtful and were depressived with the inactivity.
Everyone according to his ability.
Since she had heard the ballot, Ailininn fell hard to understand how the political words Kevern had just before her had been destroyed.
Music was the expression of love.
"They are not really politicians," said Kevern.
Besides people whose feet are too large.
My dad never made a policy for someone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the defended garden gave him the painful feelings of security.
Nothing could overcome the sharp order of the huge collective trees.
Ailinn doesn't understand yet.
Why should your father like this?
He wanted to say that it was a jux, however, to lay two fingers again on their lips.
She thought without anyway that he was something different.
"It seemed ridiculous to him," he said.
She had unbelievablely protected her head and hidden Kevern's look.
There was nothing else to see on the whole world than her unmatched black hair.
There was nothing what he wanted to see otherwise.
"If you're saying it," she's not convinced.
But it doesn't explain why you're taking it to me.
You looked honestly worried.
Is my feet too large?
He looked out again.
Your feet are not so direct.
Maybe your kitchen, a little...
And you're saying you hate me because my knee are crazy?
You hate?
Of course I don't hate you.
That's just the stupid song.
He could say "I love you", but it was too early.
"Your thick knee are exactly the reason why you're pleased me," he tried to take it.
I'm a little deal.
That didn't seem right.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be comic, he often brought himself in difficulties because he did not have his father's aware of the relaxing charm that you need to consider the inherent grausity in Witnesses.
Maybe his father also wanted to be grateful.
Maybe he wanted Kevern, that's it.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomon was red and went up from her lie, the console cut and destroyed the wine that they had drunk.
Thus, Trunity was no excuse for him.
In their endurance, they seemed to be sore, like Palmwedel in the sturm.
"And your dickhead is exactly the reason why I feel aware of you," she said...
Besides that I'm not.
She was sorry to him, both because of the injustice of his words, as well as the fear that she had shown himself in their eyes, when she revealed against him.
She thought he would kill her?
She hadn't told him of life in the northern archipe where she was grown, but he had no doubt that it was like this.
The same river and delicate oceans came like there on the Upper.
The same men, with a disagree hair and disappearing after DEM WAS GESCHEHEN WAR when it was their prejudices as smugglers and roddlers, went from Kneipe to Kneipe, always ready to raise the hand against a woman who refused or shot them.
Dickkopf?
They would have shown her a dick fashion if she didn't fit!
They just knut - the most commonly used word for an erotic relation force between men and women, a contrast to the uncomfortable Loveballs from the Console - they're just kicking and then shot.
In view of Kevern, it was an unnecessary disappearance because the knee itself had a act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through his body.
He grew up from the lie steel like an old man.
She felt also staying, but she was surprised the beauty of her distress.
It was not the end of the world.
You didn't know.
She looked at him as he departed - as well as from a room in the upper floor, her nurse to him - a man, deemed by something he swore himself.
Adam lost the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some of her hands had risen against them.
A man turned away from her, asking her back, disappointed, beats, without fighting - why was it a view to know well if she couldn't remember a only time when she had ever seen something like this day?
When she was alone, he looked at Solomons at her feet.
Some years ago before the precommissions mentioned Esme Nusboum, an intelligent and enthusiasted 32-year researcher at the task of Ofnow, the non-legal supervisional organization for public stimulation, a short proposal on the continued violence at low and medium-year level, in particular the country where they have not been expected to be the first time, in respect of the money and energy invested in the eradication of this violence.
"There has been done a lot, and many still needs to be done," she wrote, "for seen the damage of a people who leaded thousands of wars and winds most of them, especially in the sweet eggs and cattles of the country where the sweet athletes of the sweet human friendship of historically, despite the high demanding carriers between the hairs.
But some characteristics are unusrottable.
The higher of the crysturm, so it seems, so less the suffering he continues to keep.
The population weeps at the hearing of a sensual balloon, wondered about storys about overwhelmed difficulties and affirmed to believe the duties of Heirat and Family Life, but not only keeps the earliestness of the rural communities, as well as our stidical allocations in the hand, but there are also intentions for the establishment of a new and delayed search at home, on the workplace, on the streets and even on the play fields.
"They have an unfortunate trend to overcome," she said, "and when he read the whole report.
I suggest you're less reading Romans.
There's Nasbaum's a sense of her head.
I need to ask, are you atheist?
"I think I don't have to say that," Esme Nusboum answered.
Are you lesbian?
It was again called to her right to private and disappearance.
You're female?
Again.
"I don't ask it," said Luther Rabinowitz finally, "although I would be against Atheism, ready or feminist.
This is an advantageful job.
We serve a free prejudice society.
But some kinds of hypersensitivity that are absolutely acceptable and loyal value may eventually disappear results as you submitted.
They themselves have clearly privileges against the church, and these things you're described as "interessable" and "roh" could be interpreted by others as an expression of natural strength and vitality.
If you're still on the surrounding road, WAS GESCHEHEN IST IST, WEEN ES GESCHEHEN IST, as if it were going tomorrow, it means to take the country its essential life force.
Itme Nasboum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Following his head, a LED litter in Flamingorose reiterated the advice to the country in the past fourth or more.
Slow up your neighbors, valuate your partners, listen to Ballast, visit Musicals, use your phone, speak, explain, listen, excuse.
Speaking is better than weak, the speech's words is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I understand absolutely what you want to leave," said Esme Nusboum with a quiet voice, when she was sure that her princess had spoken at the end, "and I say nothing else than we have not yet been cured so effectively as we made.
My concern is that we were able to find us without warning how we recovered the errors that were first brought to DEM WAS GESCHEHEN IST, ON THE GESCHEHEN IST.
But this time it is not the others in which we leave our wrath and our distress.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a piramide with the hands.
In order to assess an angel suffering.
"It's going too far," he said, " when you're described acts as "related" who may have started our grandchildren or even not.
They're going too far when you'd talk about that these would have left their "shake" and your "fire" to "other".
In fact, it should not be necessary to remember someone in your position that, in the understanding of the past, as to protect the presence, not of the "uns" and others.
There was no "while" and there was no others.
It was an unjust time, that's all we know.
"On the one when we are honestly to us," said Esme to put, "no part of the society can say to be well maintained.
I don't touch anyone.
Whether bad or good was done what happened, it has happened.
It was that time.
There's nothing to be said anymore, we're alone.
And just as there is no fault to be granted, there should be no fault to be dealed, if such punishment would be appropriate and if it would be a way to push them.
But what is the past if we don't learn from this?
The past serves that we forget them.
If I can say something about --
Luther Rabinowitz made his pyramids together.
"I'll think of her report," said he and took her.
On the next day she went as she lived to work, she was overcoming by a motor vehicle, which, as described passengers, went on a kind of "brutaler wut" on the feet.
There are cases.
Leotho military member says that no State Government has been planned; the First Minister remains in South Africa
Official representatives of the military in Leotho have planned a Government's government's government national government reign and said they were going to face politicians to which the weapons of political factors would be made.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled out of the country and reported that the army of the country overseased his office of residence and set up government homes in Maseru in the Maseru city.
The Premier brought his family into the southern Africa after he reported attractions.
The military speaker Major Ntlele Ntoi said that there was no government in fact but that the military reacts the threat by the "political factor" whose arms were prevented by the police.
"What happened tomorrow that the stage of the Defence forces of Leotho acted after receiving several secret reports that the police acted some elements that actually wanted some of the political and particular young factors to bear shortly harmful," he said to the Voice of America.
The South African Government speaker Clayson Monyela said that the military action has made the impression of an overturn.
"And if nobody has defended the Government to be able to enhance violence, all reports are unable to show the activities of Lesotho Defence forces to this day," he said.
Speakers of the military of Lesotho participated on Sunday that the soldiers return to their chambers and the situation in the capital city was quiet.
The Vice-Premier Mothetjoya Metsing takes government management during Thabanes' absence.
The Thabane shared that he believed he was because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, there were great steps in Lesotho after the Chamber of Parliament meetings on the basis of the discussions in his uniform government.
He said that his actions would not have determined the government, otherwise the lacking accused.
Production in the Eurozone at a 13-monats level
The growth of the production in the eurozone was in August at the lowest point of the last 13 months, so a precisely observed study.
The final marketing manager index of the producer species (PMI) fell in August 50,7 in, after a position of 51,8 in July.
A indication of 50 provides extension.
New delays were returned and manufacturings experienced in an increased time between the EU and Russia on Ukraine.
The numbers take place before the meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) on Thursday.
The markets expected a clear plan for the transition of the euro area and the drug deflation in a inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the leader of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could provide further information in the past of this week whether it is a quantitative improvement for the euro zone, according to those taken by Britains and the United States during the financial crisis.
"Although a small growth is not better than growth, the large impact of the growing economic and geo-political uncertainties for the producers has become clearer," said Rob Dobson, leading economic scientists at Markit.
The Fabric PMI for Germany, the largest trade partner of Russia in the EU, fell on the deepest situation in 11 months with 51.4.
During the period of time, the second major economicization of the block, France, the PMI, at 46.9.
France remains an worried child, as well as the disaster of Italy from a solid expansion to the stagnation.
Notice that growth sanitation in the key industry mechanism Germany and Spain and the Netherlands are also not satisfied", said Mr Dobson.
The decline of the industry probably causes the fire of the analysis that wait for other monetary or fiscale anreise.
A positive message came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PYMI increased at 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, Chief Economic expert at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing you can say for the purchase index of the producer farm in the Eurozone from August, is that the sector continues to grow."
He added: "Productors in the euro zone are now clearly difficult because the current geo-political spaces - especially in relation to Russia and Ukraine - insecurity in the remaining difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and the confidence of consumers, and it is likely that some delays are delayed or even damaged, particularly large consequences.
He said it would be "ever likely" that the BCE eventually needs to join a kind of QE, "although we believe that this will be limited."
The tenth year of the survivors of Beslan: 10 years since the foreground settlement of the school has been passed, as the children hidden there today.
10 years ago, more than 1,000 people from Tskish migrants were taken in a school in Beslan in South Switzerland as guests.
More than 330 people, more than half of them, were killed in the thirty-through martyrium that the world had shocked.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had come to death in the classroom.
A decade after the decade of the school of Beslan, 334 people, including 186 children, warned the famous survival night before a new apocalypsis in Ukraine.
As a fantastic islamic terrorism children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of a new school year, taken and killed, it seemed like the worst of the wicked.
The tragedy was cleaned in West and East in Abscheu, and then changed a surprisely in action and hope for the future in the worstest.
10 years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims that had come to death in the classroom.
We found surprised young people who have overcome opposite, although the memory of this terrorist hell will be persecuted forever.
Your greatest hope?
The war that now visits Ukrainian - and in the children as they die - now finds a end.
The girl who has been photographed at the trial to return back to the shopping school sporthalle
She was photographed by the Russian Starfotographer Dimitri Beliakow and famous when she was only trying to return back into the destroyed school sporthold after a mine explosed.
Indeed, Aida sought after her mother Larissa, now 40 years old.
Boths were kept to die, but they survived.
'An woman said to me,' but I couldn't," said Aida at that time.
My legs were blue overwhelmed.
I stood up and shot back to look for my mother.
A soldat brought her secure.
After a number of operations, she took herself completely, but yesterday said: "Tree months ago, the pain returned back.
I'm afraid I need to be covered again.
Some granats are still in my kitchen.
Its goal is now to become a hazardous to help people as you have been doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't destroy me," she said campaignly.
"It's happening to me, and that can't be changed.
One time in the year I'm always going to the sports hall to remember those who stay there.
My friends and I try not to talk about other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future class camera Dzera Gapova was killed there.
We played together when we were small, and we dreamed to go together to school.
"I don't want to get married until I turn my study and start my carriers.
I think to a family later.
She says that the installation will always remain a part of it, although the memory will be weak every year.
I am glad that many people still remember our fears and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in British and everywhere.
When I see the photo of me, how I'm back to school, I think many people see it first and understand our catastrophe and help that something happens not again.
The boy who fled through the shoe, in the view his mother was dead
It was his first schoolday (Russians walking with 7 years to school) and overlooked the three-year-old appointment in the poor of his mother Tamara.
When a seven-year-old he said, "Mother said to me, I must put me on if it be a explosion, and keep her hands."
After an explossion, he thought she would die.
She said to him, "Come up."
Full fear that she could be dead, he fled and looked on the way a little child, took it at the hand and fled through a gun.
His father Wladimir, who closed his son out of the arms, said, "There she told me that his mother was dead.
He said, "I couldn't save her."
In fact, Tamara was arrested outside and injuries in the hospital, on the other hand, in the idea that her son was killed.
After her reconciliation, she said, "I weep for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He fled in here and umzed me.
In addition to London (of the intellect resolved news of the World), he was planned to receive the title of a Barnardo's Children's Champion of the timely Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror follows you every day, but I wanted that I could stop the memory," he said yesterday.
But I can say it's going to be blown in my memory.
I'm still sure I'm going to get all my game pizzas right away.
But now I can play computer games with scenes and that's no problem for me.
"I have no fear to go back to the sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those children I played in the court and who didn't have done it outside.
We never say they were killed or died.
We're saying they're staying in the sports hall.
I very well remember my trip to London, especially the store of playwares, where I could find everything I wanted, and the trip in a top open car.
But now he feared about a place like Ukraine, where wars caused the kind of unfortunate that he and his friends had caused.
This horror follows you every day, but I wanted to stop listening to remember me.
"I'm so sorry to all those who lead among the Greeks," said Damir, the last week, who worked as a voluntary in a closter.
I'd like to help so.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they'll take me to the school academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48, said, "37 children were killed from our neighborhood, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrified styles after the installation, there was just no children who could call and move around, and this style continued for many months.
She lives to remember her trip to London with Damir.
The people in London wept when I told our story.
I understand how people can understand our feelings on the other side of the world and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her funding for the price and the possibility of traveling to London in the spring of 2004.
I wanted to call Cherie and just tell herself that 10 years have been past, but I still remember her and her husband in London, and how Damir and me helped.
I remember how Damir wanted to eat and call all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember how he played with kills in a restaurant. That was shot with his water pizza on them and they fled and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the Brits were so ready to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't become better in these 10 years.
In the Ukrainian, the war continues now, and every day people die, and I think that many children have been killed and are still killed.
That's exactly like our children.
I think that for many of the war is a part of the news they hear when they want or work with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the whole horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed that people want to kill each other and that's so sorrowful.
That was great and is a very sweet and quiet boy, he is not aggressive or hot.
For example, he doesn't seek rache, he is not overwhelmed from the past Greeks.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends out of the class and they're going to the sports hall and we're dragged there.
When he was smaller, he was lying down - I remember how he sometimes put on the sofa, the face from us.
Not sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he continued all his arms and other military games. This is now 17, greater than I, well-known, intelligent and healthy.
I can't believe that I was so sure he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I brought me after the explosion and came on the feet, I looked around and saw the hell around me, with parts of all around.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could have survived in this hell.
"I remember that I left him, 'Damir, let's go,' but I was too sure he didn't listen to me.
But he heard it and he went away.
And so life goes, other than the many others, goes for us.
Georgium, 17
The boy, whose horror image after the appointment was made on the icon of the Greuel of Beslan
Trost: The Beslan surviving Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the denomination 2004, just a picture of Georgia today
His blue overwhelmed face was ashamed when he fled around his life, while the Tschechian terrorists shot his classrooms down.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols for the Barbari of Beslan.
His mother Fatima, 54 doctor, had put him for his first schoolday before she had gone to bring her older son Wladimir to the university.
"I left the court about two minutes before the terrorists crashed him, and so my little boy left there alone for three terrible days," she remembered.
Not only, there was a whole family of fellows from us, but they were all killed.
My Georgia just made it to survive.
To close this date, it's more difficult to think about and talk about it.
There is no one day in which we do not remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's long here, I mean it's happening tomorrow some scenes of these days to follow me.
No one will ever forget that I promise you.
Finally, the image of Georgij (links) was one of the most shocking attract and was defended as a status (right).
I remember Georgia wanted to go to school this day, and he said he wanted to move his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him in the TV.
And now there is even this status of the weeping Georgia in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like to see the picture, and it's hidden in our house in the bookregulation.
I understand this, but I also say that people around the world are feeling our pain.
Georgia says today: "It's important that something that can never happen again.
"I doubt that we never learn the truth.
People are always studying such tragedy and never learning the truth.
And now they investigate the abolition of this boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever learn what has caused him?
This world's going to be something terrible.
"I can't understand how it is possible, for if you ask the people, no one wants a war, so how does it happen?
10 years are nothing for such pain.
We need a dozen years to forget it a little little.
It has attacked my health and I feel it still.
For about three or four years, I had a couple of slaughters because of the appointment, but then it became better.
After that, in 2004, I was back to school and I was afraid every day.
I thought about my friends and class rooms who were killed.
So I'm always going to the sports hall when the 1st September gets close.
I'm going to spend my old childhood friend tribut.
It's difficult for me to go to the sports hall, but I have to do it.
I don't feel as a victim, this story is a part of my past.
I won't forget it, but I don't miss me.
My life goes.
I closed the school this year and searched for a medical high school in Wladikawz.
I'll be a heart surgery.
My first choice was a training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldat, but my health didn't let it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't happen.
Georgij Fanijew, 20
The boy who survive, even though he had been caught at feet of a murder terrorist
A wonder: Georgey Fanijew was taken during the disposal of a murder terrorist, but he made it to survive.
During the appointment, he was arrested in the sports hall and sat down next to the bomb that was situated at the foot of a murder terrorist.
It's really a wonder that he wasn't killed.
"We feel that it was yesterday," said Georgia, who wanted to go as a secret officer to the FSB, but that was not able to do because of his health-related wounds because of the disposal.
It's still with me. It's nothing I left behind.
I'm old now, and people say that children can easily take care of bad experiences -- I have to say that's not true.
"2006 I worked with psychologists and feeling better, but I can't forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 - in the afternoon, it was the only time I went back to the sports hall.
I lost the knowledge.
I'm never gonna return back there and don't ask me to show you where I shot in this famous image.
Overlevel: Georgij Fanijew today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the laptop
My pain is unfair, and I'm taking him every day with me.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or talk about it, and they never asked me after the school.
I'm fine of the body.
I should be careful with my shocked knee, but now I can walk well.
But because of my health, I couldn't study the FSB secret surgery in Sankt Petersburg as I wanted.
I have sent my documents, even the medical and they have responded that it was not possible.
My second suffering was the animals, so I went to the animal Institute.
I've been there two years behind me.
He learns the treatment of all the animals "aftain to cook."
He said, "I knew I would never report my children about my experience.
Children should not know anything, and they should not indeed learn it.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul worse when the year's pretty close.
I'm going to remember the festivals.
I know Georgia won't go.
It's gotta be more strong for him because he was there and I don't.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help.
I'm so grateful to God that he has been sent to me.
It remains in us.
Georgij is now an adult, but this horror is still in him.
It's difficult to accept that if something is going to be so unfair.
He's a boy, he likes sport, but he can't take part of his knee.
He's been covered, he can't run, but no sports.
I'd say he's overlooking the horror to 50%, but you can never overcome and forget it.
This terrible experience will always follow us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed at the campaign and it only strengthens my pain.
I've lost many people I knew well and I've been driving.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift that God could make me, but my heart wept for the beasts.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who have never married again.
It's difficult to accept that life continues, even if you don't want it.
I'm never gonna forget how my heart broke in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what happens in the world -- wars in other regions.
Why are these people fighting?
Why do they kill each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I almost can't believe it.
We were earlier a friendly country, how can we be able to fight now?
Meanwhile and children, I'm sure that many children have been killed in Ukraine and are still killed.
If only we could take all these rebels and cast out - so far as possible.
Tskajewa, 10
The baby, who has been taken so secure by a special set-up command
Geettet: Aljona Tskajewa is carried into security by a Russian special set-up command (links).
She is now ten (right) and doesn't even remember the greenships
The world, in 2004, added the athletes when the baby Aljona was led to the poor of a Russian policeman from the plant of Beslan.
Terrorists left them away, but their 30-year-old mother, the 10-year-old sister Kristina and her brother Makhar in the school sporthale.
Makhar, then three years old, was disappeared, but Aljonas' mother and sister died in the murder metal.
Her father Russian has been married again and her new wife Swetlana called a little girl after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, today's ten years old, doesn't remember the design and is grown up to an intelligent and happy girl, say neighbors.
"You are now a great happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children," says a friend.
Rusland is a Pantatic Father, and I want to spend all the memories that come up with the tenth year day.
You will understand why.

4 Tips for better subwater photos and videos
If you want to make photos or videos under water, there is a selection to devices.
The most precious option is a watering point-and set such as Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action room such as Gopro Hero3+ Silver Edition that are both $300.
I took these photos at a family feast with several cameras that are all available to a price of $350.
Independent of equipment, there are several rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a smooth camera, make sure the battery and other fishermen are closely concluded.
Enter your cameras also on the photos or videos that you want to take.
Some cameras and cameras are available on scene and upgrading modes with which the vision time is optimized for the dawn subwater conditions.
And before you go into, check how long your equipment is functional.
Some cameras are allowed only to 5 feet, others to 50 or 60 feet.
Search our store and the reviews for digital cameras for original and water-wide models.
Make more extensions - because many are not being closed.
Point-and-Sector cameras have a LCD with which you can compose images, action cameras usually not.
Even if you have a LCD, it's difficult to see this under water, and the right image set is a lucky scene.
So you're doing a lot of receipts.
If your camera has a series of screenshots that make a number of acceptances with easily changed documentation settings, use it.
Keep near the surface.
The light is dramaticly worse, continually removed from the surface.
If you can stay close to the surface, if you make accommodations in a pool, a sea or the sea.
So you can also take more colours in your photos; everywhere you go, so much less you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also a good advice in the country, but in water, it is more important because of the bad light relations.
It is very important when you work with an action room: these devices are often available over a fixed wheel line, which means that you need to get close to your objects if these are to fill all the image frames.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the order whose characters changed things, even in a so gigantic organization as the NHS.
As a consultant anÃ¤sthesiat, he admitted his carrier to the hospitalâ€™s agony of the disease as well as the curious treatment.
Among its patients, as his wife remembers, was a MI6 employer who had to live with the damage of consequences.
Lawson knew that the doctors were important to diagnostics and diseases, while the treaties were concerned overly with something else: pain.
But one day in 2007 he was the one of his suffering ways.
"I don't feel," he wrote in May this year.
I had difficulties to get out of me.
While he fighted with the grippe symptoms, he noted that he had made his wife unfair prejudice to Julia.
"I want everything soon as soon as later," he noted.
When Juliet was a week on a business trip, Lawson felt very uncertainly and without reason.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to make a rude investigation of his breast.
The first two weeks ago he was in the French Alpens.
The result of the RÃ¶ntgen investigation was lacked.
He lies on Mesotheliom, an unhealable cancer, which brings the breastfle, so the skin override.
As in most of cancer diseases, the most precise solver is to define.
While some rashers were sick in Lungencrebs, not all the ill-creen diseases were premature rashers.
But Mesotheliom is different.
In almost all cases, the leather is an assumption-related contact with the farmer, which once seemed as "wunderstoff" but was recognized as death.
For most of us, Mesotheliom is a disease that can ignore as easily.
Asbest is finally a product of the past.
The most dangerous asbesto type was not used in Britains since the 1960s when the industry was voluntaryly bound to use it.
Even where it was still used, only people worked in certain sectors directly with the clothes, construction workers, room leaders and advertisers, for example.
As a industrial risk of any other time, it seems to be noticed today.
But this self-satisfactory is unemployed.
Britains, so it seems that today experiences the height of a mesoltheliom epidemic.
There are more death cases by Mesotheliom here than in every other country of the world.
With a total of 2.500 death accidents per year, so many people die in this disease and in accidents of transport.
Annual numbers of the cases of Mesotheliomed cases since 1980 and foreseen to future death accidents in Britain
The reason why we live the death impact now, although Asbest is illegal for years (1999 all the asbestes types have been prohibited), is that a Mesotheliom has been developed only after ten years.
And the grass of the meotheliom is not limited to former workers of the construction sector.
Asbest was, and is still present in the houses in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we learn and the business we buy.
And therefore, myotheliom does not know classic diseases, financial limits, professionals or age.
The privileged foundations, from the elegant purchase houses in London to private schools, are no protection space.
The Parliament's homes are asbest revealed.
In the hospitals in which we must be healed already have been exempt as the outcome of this dead carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a clothes.
In fact, he was hard to imagine where he might have come to contact with Asbest.
Then he found it out.
"It looks like if in the Tunnels in the Guy's Hospital, where I resolved my training for six years, a lot of asbest was available."
All students, hospitals, doctors and feeds - use tunnels.
How many of my aged gentlemen will be led to the same disease?
The question was unfortunately able to answer at least partly.
"On the four doctors who were designed at the Guy's Hospital and who were sick in the last five years in Mesotheliom," he wrote in a letter, "I am the last one who lives."
How many of us will still be sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed in the age of 48 years.
When he died on February 17, he was 55.
It was an un normally long survivor.
Fifteen percent of all the methic leather diseases die within eight months after diagnosis.
The disease is always dead.
So we can only ask Lawsons: "Who are we who are still sick?"
The leading British experts to Mesotheliom, Prof. Julian Peto, considers that between 1870 and 2050, when the aptestpidemic in the Britishs will come to the survival, the total of 90,000 of the diseases will be caught to the victim.
Most of them have no idea that they will die so.

A short view of the acts of the courts that are often addressed by the concerned are shown how far the burden of the meteoliom has already been spread.
In June this year, for example, Marks & Spencer was made to be made as a asbest in Janice Allen.
She worked nine years old for the kitt, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of the flagging manager in the Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 years old when they started M-S.
Now she has two children in the twentieth.
"On this thing," she said, "I never heard about Mesotheliom, I didn't even know anything about Asbest.
I'd never thought it would be with me.
There are only few people who know a lot about asbest.
In fact, the Ashber's judgment is not a substantive but a group of six minerals.
The name includes the word "Asbestiform", a description of the factor structure that makes the substance opposable and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the building.
Chrysotil, even known as a white asbest, is today the most often found asbest in buildings.
It was used for dance plates, football plates, Rohrisolations, Boiler Solutions, even for breasts in cars.
However, it is less damage than other asbest forms, but it is considered by the EU and WHO as a "growd health risk" with possible death results.
But dangerous is the brain asbest (Amosit) and the blue asbest (Crokydolith).
Britains were one of the world's largest importers of braune asbestes, and experts believed that "is clear, but indirectly indicated that this was a main reason for the unique high methodlemirates."
An employer of Marks & Sprencer was made in the Oxford Street, London, asbestes Alamy
Janice Allen may not be seen as a typical methic lime sacrifice, but the work of Julian Peto states that their history is not usually inaccessible.
He presented a study of the concerned that "the important part of the methodleliomes without acknowledging by work or home by asbest contact has probably been caused in the environment."
A majority of these contacts is based on the "normal use and agency" of our building.
It looks like nobody can get out of it to be sure.
A report of Goddard Consulting, which has studied the west ministry, shows how people could also be equipped with the heart of the government.
2009 Goddard reported that the locks and road guides were visited after the Committee Committees of the Parliament with Asbest, whose death factors were able to be made as an ill-seekly as an "style air movements".
Parliament's members are often accused to take care of their own interests, but it looks like the contrast.
While the Parliamentâ€™s Directorate of Working Service has received a "subsequent health production" the Westminster Labour, it is unresolved that 1 billion Â£ workload should be made over several years in order to renew the Parliament to modernize electronic installations and to remove the asylum, and that after the general elections 2015, Member States will be close to the QE2 conference centre as well as to the green boundaries in Westminster.
The Goddard Order also suggests that "the presence of asbestes has not been managed in accordance with the relevant provisions".
No one can know whether this missile life will be exempt.
Whatever you can do is waiting for.
A person who never could exactly define contact with Asbest was a general medicine.
As Andrew Lawson denied the 50-year-old abbot that he was equipped with his work in hospitals.
"I've been working in a hospital, in which the asbestes complaint has been decided positively," he said, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It is so difficult to remember all the places in which you have been working and the data.
He still remembered exactly the day beginning December 2009 in which he obtained such a kind of fieber.
He was 45, and just afterwards made a operation.
Immediately I've been shot.
It was very suddenly.
I felt scary.
I thought I wasn't going to create the trip home again.
As a doctor knew Abbott that the pain of the breastfell had pushed the hair around his lips.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to imagine a Mesopotliom.
He didn't work a month.
A surprised doctors made rare explosions of his breast and put pleurakat case to remove flowness from the lungs and test in the labor.
Yet his complaints remained without diagnosis.
His health improved slowly, and he returned to his workplace.
Since time, however, the symptoms returned back, often after sports confirmation and strong acts.
In 2011 a patient was diagnosed with similar symptoms in his practice and later diagnosed with Mesotheliom.
But now also Abbott this is not in his own case.
Finally, his patient was a few decades old and worked directly with asbest.
The connection in the case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbots was disagreed and his household brought his CT scans and RÃ¶ntgen extensions to a group of experts.
In December 2011, except two years after Abbott felt the first time, a song with a cameraed song was introduced into the hills between the pool and the breast flower.
I'm an optimist.
"I'm doing most easy to further," he said.
Indeed, I didn't have done so much worried about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The result of the bioopsy was in the week between Christmas and New Year ago: "Man told me that it was Mesotheliom."
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis Meotheliom
Immediately Abbott Terms with Macmillan diseases, one of whom one recommended to take a lawyer.
At first, he decided the dimension of the epidemic.
"It was discovered that Asbest was very widely widely widespread, especially in large public buildings, in which Rohre often isolationed with Asbest," he said.
The persons who were set up the assembest in these buildings have been sick now.
And so the Mesotheliom is now younger people who have not worked in the typical professionals.
The most dangerous roads with aperstisolation in hospitals are under the earth, so patients have probably not been excluded to the substance.
But many employees who changed in foot-offs from another building (such as Andrew Lawson) or underird Cantines (such as Graham Abbott did often), came with greater probability in contact with the gifts.
It is shown that over a few decades after the war of patients may have been lived, but in danger for the treated doctors.
He'll still be removed today.
Students put their bunkers on asbest mathemates.
And it's not just a hospital.
Asbest was used in offices, businesses, libraries and town cells because often.
Schools too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first contact in the classroom.
Overall in the country, in thousands of chemists, students have put their bunkers on asbest mathemates.
On websites, the Asbest theme is now frequently speaking in schools.
And why there are such unlawful objects in our houses such as football plates or peak degrees normally asbests.
"It's a industrial journal containing in large parts of our real estates," notes Andrew Morgan, the legal manager, who has represented Andrew Lawson in his process against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, it was the only contact that an affected woman was engaged in the 1970s.
So look at how to disappear your gardens.
The impact of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is inseparable, is immense.
"It's a time to work", says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to further, but I knew that I couldn't focus on what I did.
I was two weeks in the practice.
Then I knew I was going and had to worry about myself.
Well, I won't live any other Christmas feast.
The greatest difficulty was from the position of a doctor to a patient.
How many patients before him he remembers how he was overcoming from all the information with which he had to be right.
"It was very hard to resolve all that," he said.
I asked my doctor, "How long have I?"
And there were about 12 months.
I remember that I thought, "Well, I won't live any other Christmas feast.
It was then."
Mesotheliom is particularly mixture, because it's our life-mechanism â€“ the atmen itself - that causes death cancer.
Most cases of Mesotheliom are caused by asbest contact.
Asbest consists of the smallest factors.
If the asbest is revealed and the fashion is invaded, they can fill around on the bridge, the hair around the lances.
Asbest-fass irritate the breast flow and can solve cell mutations.
"It's a problem with the inhaled nafthrough fass," professor Tom Treasure, a heart-Thorax organisation that changed to the Guy's Hospital in 2001.
The hospital, Andrew Lawson believes that it has set him to the asbesto, is now ironally a leading center in the treatment of Mesotheliom.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated some others who probably also had been equipped during their education in the hospital.
When the asbestes are reaching the laughing weight, Treasure says, "which they press from the skin to the edge where the hair is.
From nature it is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options in other cancer diseases do not work so good in Mesotheliom.
The effectiveness of a operation is, for example, hot circumstances.
Some say she's worth an attempt.
Treasures do not do it.
"You can't extract the flower," he said.
They're not coming with the mess.
Therefore, the cancer "of Chemotherapie does not very well," the "Submiting," but does not marry.
"Machtime there's a long survivor," said Treasure.
But at the end they all die.
Successfully some patients live long, much longer than waiting.
The author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott still fights.
After he had contacted Mesotheliom, Abbott was contacted with Andrew Lawson, four years after his diagnosis, a manner of support and advice was involved in the co-operation office.
"Hallo, cancer center," he made himself gladly at calls.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis four years ago and was still very active.
Originally, Abbotts were offered six Chemotherapiece cycles that would take four months and for example would extend his life only for a month.
"I was unfit," he said.
I wanted to stop.
But Lawson made it "the things in a little more positive light."
After the consultation of several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, the heart-Thorax-spezialist at Guy's.
"We had a benefit that I should not continue to be proclaimed, I just called and got a date," Graham said.
A normal patient would need to receive a transfer and wait for the approval of the treatment.
Business is essential for meotheliom diseases in order to understand the best available therapies.
But when these treatments are finally missing, many concerns of another financial concern are concerned about the future of the families that leave them.
And so they turn to the judges in hope to disappearance.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"There is known since 1898 that Asbest is extremely dangerous for health," Morgan says.
But what was changed in the 1960s is that it was recognized that a very little lack of health risk has been made.
And here the sustainability of the companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital finally put their case, but it was not what Morgan called a "valuable disappearance" because Lawson could not demonstrate absolute security that his Mesotheliom was back to a asylum contact on Guy's.
After the investigation of his death, a speaker of the Guy's confirmed that "the Asbest Fasts were removed in the 1990s."
That was after Andrew Lawson.
How Ashbest can be removed
In fact, it is for meotheliom diseases that seek to disappear, a huge problem to assigne the death contact of a company or a workplace - usually ten years after cases.
Many of its former employers have been sold or closed.
Safety charges can be lost.
And those who oppose their answers know that the time is for them, but they do not surely with the complaints.
As a reaction on this year, there were clear new legislation that makes it easier for the Mesotheliom concerned to complain a disappearance, even if their former employees are no longer found.
The law has provided a fund of 350 million euros for all which have been diagnosed after July 2012 can demonstrate a contact, but no one can resolve.
In these cases, the complaints will receive 80 percent of what a court would have been able to assess them in a normal detrimental process - approximately $120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications at the program are expected for year.
Andrew Morgan thinks how many of the meetheliom concerned that 350 million euros have made a "sigh good work" of the insurance sector.
"This is an event of surveys for surveys," he said, "and states that it's a quarter of a quarter of those who were supposed to pay, if the time was not going to move, and the Mesotheliom disease found the companies and could normally be resolved.
Mike Penning, the minister of Employment and Pension, also said that the law "not perfect" is.
But as well as penning and Morgan added that, in view of seven death sacrifices, it was necessary to be a fast deal daily.
"The people lead so much and need today," said Penning during the second hearing of the Mesotheliom Gessey in December of the past year.
At this time Graham was Abbott in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski.
After its first consultations, the Lazdunski recommended a operation of which he was expected, in contrast to Tom Treasure, a positive effect.
This was accompanied by a radial therapy and a chemotherapiece - a triple treatment, with a long-Lazdunski ratio of survival over five years from up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt strong.
"This is of course with the most important," Abbott says.
It's always seen in patients.
There's something that allows you to do.
If you go on, it's very worse to you.
Graham Abbott was undertaken in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last six of Chemotherapiece cycles.
There were no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer flowers around my breast.
I'm just 50.
That's not a disagreement of life.
That's dead.
Abbott again underlined six Chemotherapiecycles.
Now there is no tumor speed more visible.
But the progress is very physical and psychologically enhanced.
You need to think about practical things - if I am no longer, for example, or my wife shows how the wheat-time institution works.
If you receive bad news, you will be negative.
You need to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it is not always easy.
"To parents, it's hard," he said.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I received my first diagnosis, I told my girls I had a disease with which I wouldn't be old.
They were very different.
Tamsin is very comfortable and unbelievable.
She told her friends, and we got a lot of calls soon.
Ellie was backstanding.
She didn't say a lot.
Those conversations are something that all cancer patients need to make.
But the concerns of the Mesotheliosis have not been held from hope, not from a speech of hope on survival.
The disease (such as finally also for Stephen Jay Gould) brings a huge security.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesotheliom is not detrimental.
The body of unbalanced Pharaons in the asbestes clothing
Asbest factors used for strengthening cotton creatures and for greater competence.
The Plinius of the elderly described Asbest.
It was developed a weight that is not breastable.
I've seen the Serviets in feasts in the camps.
The use of the modern commercial asbest starts in Italy, where it is used to produce paper (e.g. money figures) and substances.
An important asylummins will be opened in Canada and South Africa and shortly in America, Italy and Russia.
It is the ideal isolation material for the dumping machines and tourbines of the industrial revolution.
The global asylum production increases more than 30,000 tonnes every year.
Statistics of Prudential identified a temporary death rate in those working with asbest, and there are no life insurance.
Nellie Kershaw dies in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cooke says that Asbest Part in the Lunge "without any conscious doubts are the main cause."
That's the first case of this kind.
Kershaw's worker, Turner Bros Asbesto, no dealing over.
There is no damages to pay.
During the Second World War, intense ships are built, one of the most mortal contacts with Asbest.
Voluntary view of the industry on import of blue asbest
A vocational office confirms the first successful person-based class in Britains because of contacts with Asbest.
The global asylum production increases more than 4.213.000 tonnes every year.
Britain imports 139.000 tonnes.
A health and security executive in Britains requires all companys working with asylums for licensing.
The import and use of blue and blue asbests are legally prohibited in Britain.
Each use of asbest is prohibited in Britains.
The meteoliom position is adopted in British Britains.
Announcement of $350 million is announced.
Asbest is prohibited in more than 50 countries, white asbest is yet used in many countries of the earth as a precious construction material.
The global production is about 2 million tons annually.
China refuses the right of Hong Kong to Government selection, Demonstrators Swedish Review
On Sunday, the Chinese Parliament decided, despite the democratic reforms, to the nomination of candidates for the elections of 2017 by the Hong Kong electionship.
This action is likely to encourage the long advertised protesters in Hong Kong business, while the actives conducted planning and mobilization within less hours after the delimitation.
The decision of the Chinese People Congress allows the Communist leaders to demonstrate all non-profit candidates.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us warm," said Emily Lau, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Peking promised.
You have an angel of the inhabitants of Hong Kong.
And it's clear that we have it with a authorized regime.
In his defendance of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, Vice General Secretary of the Permanent Committee of the National People Congress, said that the authorisation of public nominations in the elections for the Hungary Government would be "caotic".
Since 1997, as the British control over Hong Kong left the Chinese, Peking promised to select the residents from 2017 the Government Presidency.
The Chinese leadership presented the decision on Sunday as a democratic breakfast, because it has a direct choice right to the citizens of Hong Kong, but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leading holds the end through a committee of nomination controlled by Peking.
After a new class, only candidates must be allowed "for love to the country and love to Hong Kong".
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and public protesters have been held in Hong Kong for some years.
Following the protestocratic campaign in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organisms have forced to disappear the financial sector if Peking does not allow real election right.
During the weekend, hundreds of Occupy-Central Workers were gathered in the rain before the government headquarters in Hong Kong within less hours after the delimitation.
At the demonstration, the organisms said that their movement had reached a new degree of civil unobedience and planned them in the coming weeks.
However, they did not make any similar information to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online communication, the organisms have reported that the movement of the Central School has only taken into account the last resources, a action that should only be done when all dialogue changes are encountered and no other choice.
We are sorry to say that all dialogues have been completed today and will be definitively done by the design of the Central Centre.
The authorities in Hong Kong have been prepared for the advertisement of Pekings since days, and it has been held on Sunday before the government's home, including police forces and barrikads.
The disappointments will be strengthened by feelings of many of them in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing controls on their city.
The allocation of people from the festival strengthens the competition of products and services.
Furthermore, the fear is that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and disaster freedom, are starting smoothing with growing pressure.
Some criticised the demonstrations of the Occupy-Central movement, since she threatened the business company - the lifeader of Hong Kongs.
"The protesters of which they speak could make great economic damage, after how many are involved in it and how long they continue," said the legal expert Regine Ip, which critics the movement for a long time.
We don't want to make any fear that Hong Kong does not make any control.
This impression is bad for investments.
The State controlled media also reported on democracyactivists in Hong Kong as under-controlled by Western Summits.
In this summer, an unofficial referendum to the electoral rights in which 780,000 people participated - more than a fifth of the electors in Hong Kong.
In July, there were ten thousands of democracy demonstrations in the history of the region.
The tradition of school closure in the United States is now translated to universities where Freshmen is offered with the private flight.
We are glad to be able to respond to this question and to offer the first luxury travel service of British students today.
To achieve special impression at the University, the company also offers transport options such as private flights, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also said that the service had a security party.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who, at least, need to cut their beliefs in a dangerous car overloaded by the country.
With our new VIF options, we are glad to ensure that students reach the university with a minimum wagon and a maximum of Luxus.
A company speaker said that there were no new books since the service was only introduced, but added that "Students would book the service in the next weeks".
In addition, the company shared that a market for this offer would be expected, despite the expenditure of the studies of $9,000 per year.
Students today differ themselves in their expectations and responses very far from students than 10, 20, 30 or 40 years - is more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF can exactly.
However, the National Student Meeting criticised the Service as a declined.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the NUS for High School, said: "This offer seems to be fully separated from the life of the many students.
Many students starting this month with the study see a crisis of life-keeping costs, since the available financial aids in the form of credits and stipendies do not keep the strong accounts for the easy life basis before they can think of thousands of Pfund for something simple as the arrival in the student home.
Feminists criticize race demand and police detention to Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was first killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants put their hands into the air and sang, "Don't look up," while they waited for the pit.
After two-way protesters in Ferguson, Mo, because of the exhibition of the unwashed teenager, Michael Brown noted the bloggerin Miriam Zoila Perez a change in the online discussions of white feminists.
Following their experience, white feminist commentators set the gender before race if it is about to assess reproduction rights and income balances.
However, while the middle Western relief increased and received observation throughout the country, Perez saw that the answers of white women were 100% around the race.
In comparison with the responses of black women of 9 August, personal tests came with titles such as "Remembers to Ferguson of a white woman" and "Feminism is not only about the subpression of women" later.
But for Perez, this means an important change.
"I don't think you're finding a lot of people who are about the white and speaking privileges on such high class," she said.
People feeled angry to express something to the cases.
It is characteristic for the crisis we find and because the situation in Ferguson is so proof that they need to express it.
For English Professionin Coritha Mitchell by the Oio State University, Ferguson's problems were made to light, which black Americans every day, but not to be considered as "Frauentheme" in the cultural room.
"I can publish something fun on Facebook about me and my partner and take 150 likes from everywhere," said Mitchell.
If I get something about how colorful in their own country's own land is the weak oven beach.
"How can women be safe to speak publicly about a relationship, but not about security in the public?" she asked.
For black women such as Mitchell, race, sex and sexuality have studied in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between races and sex problems.
For them, the black women didn't have the luxury to separate themes; they live every day in the combined reality.
While white women now bind the topics of race and gender in the feministical mainstream crisis, Angela Hattery says, Professor for Women and Family Research at the George Mason University, that her leaders did the opposition.
"Zwish 1865 and 1890 were at least 100,000 black men and the greening was almost always the management of a white woman," said Hattery.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the split between white and black women came to the point where the white army for women's choice right as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the fight for the election right could only be successful for each group: women or black.
"They take the decision to set up for women's choice right, and the choice right to black is to come later," Hattery said.
If you remember such things, one with power will be known why the white women do not believe.
We haven't done well our job.
We never helped the black women to protect their husbands and children.
In 1920, after women had received election law, it was a decade until white women were organized against the Lynchen Association of South Women for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was almost 40 years after the original prayer for helping pages of black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flow of white feminist reactions on the questions of Ferguson - police - racial discrimination - a speed of the time in which white feminists played with the problems of the black women from generations.
"Is it not wonderful if the actives who have such traditional feminist platforms have the right to educate a child so seriously as they do this with the right to receipt control?", asked Mitchell.
Feminists of the second generation that build their carriers on the fight against production rights and access to recognised resources are now trying to understand what it means.
The famous feminist activeist Gloria Steinem went two weeks after the exhibition of Michael Brown on Facebook and published a mentioned article by Rebecca Carroll, Columnistin of the Guardian, where she requires more protesters of white Americans to the issue of racism.
"I hope that women who have reasons for understanding one of the body inhabiting danger -- and thoughts of race that are clearly different in public surveys -- will be taken to change," wrote Stein.
Although the stones are a greater intersectional feminism in race as well as gender theme, some of their comments on the race theme in America are still refreshed.
Christina Sommers, researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" she said to She The people that young men in the United States, particularly young farmer men, "because than their sisters," but Steinems' comments in Ferguson are contrary to their previous critics.

There was a slight race of designs, instructions, games, exhibitions and information about the time of the Romans and their importance for Rheinland.
The main attraction of the day was unfortunately the martial army force of the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", used by each rain, in which the same Sand-prepared Arena was to demonstrate its robust struggle art.

Specially imprisoned was the attraction of the "retiarius", which was attracted with wrfnetz, Trizack and Dolch against the "Secutor" and soon stripped the bottles to the ground.
Thus, the swords metalically, the swords created and the rain flowns rise on through the Arena, that a fear and bow could be made for the health of the gladiers.
However, on the imposing "Summa Rudi", the muscle Seedsrichter, a strongly noticed eye.
"We wanted to reviv the Roman day and to make the culture of the Roman time," explained Lorenz Euskirchen, President of the Institute "Freundeskreis RÃ¶merkanal", the intention behind the spectrum.
After two years of preparation, a "Oppidum Roman" was set out from the free time park for a day, a Roman city, such as VizebÃ¼rger Minister Claus Wehage found in his green word.
Finally, the Romans have brought not only war and eruption into our region but also the Roman culture and many constructions we are surprised today.
Moreover, they were to be along the Roman day, about "Aquadukt-Marmor" of the eleven meters high and 1400 meters long redmarkanal browser, which was the first standing at LÃ¼ftelberg.
The Frontinus Society found the water and energy supply and now, and the manager Petra Fricke knew: "We're going to be useful today from the knowledge of that time."

A number of foundations from these exhibitions made it in a glass wind, including a large talent, several featured glass vessels and parts of a hospital cell.
The Villa has probably existed after Christ from the first to the fourth century until the case of the Germans in the Roman Rheinland, converted Morcheser.
The children also worked with the Roman wind mounting game, similar to the modern museum game, or writed as one of the Roman students their names with metal bands on wachst degrees.
On the position of the Roman troops, the Mosaques were mosaiken at the stand of the glassmuseum Rheinbach Glassmosaiken and served a severe weapon corners from stone to make the meal for a fladen brow or a museum.

Ebola: The Epidemic charges West African economy
The Ebola Epidemic in West Africa is also a serious weapon for the economy.
The markets are warranted - and international enterprises go to distance.

On the market only wants to buy food or something to desinfection against Ebola.
Liberia is the most highest of the virus, only here fell to the fiber more than 600 people to the victim.

Foods will be knapp

The population therefore gets the impact of epidemic directly and slowly: foods will be knapp.
On the markets, the Council is on basic foods such as the river.
Likewise, the strong region dependent on international companies is a image chain, with far-reaching consequences.

Genetic Sternment often wrong diagnosed
A British says she thought she was a consequence of a fault diagnosis over many years that she would die.
Karin Rodgers lived almost all her youth in faith that she had just a few years after she was diagnosed with another disease.
It actually lies to the Charcot-Marie Tooth disease (CMT) - a group of distortions that damage the nerves outside the brain and the backmark.
Charity CMT UK shared that fatal diagnosms are a frequent problem in people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Some 23.000 people in British populations have probably leaded to CMT that can lead to motoric storms like muscles, an incredible gang and crowded cells.
The disease also leads to female feelings or pain. The illness is inevitable and continued, which means that the symptoms will be worse with time.
When Rodgers were 13, she believed she had led to peace attaxie (FA) - a disease with very bad survivals.
Rodgers thought she would sit in the Roll Hall before she was 18, and died before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children who are aged 51 years today said, "I knew that I couldn't do the same as the others.
I fell constantly and I continued everything with me.
I was never able to go with the other Rollschuh children or Skateboard and was often in school because of my kind to work.
Rodgers said that she had left the room in age of 13 years after several operations to disappear their hair feet and to push her feet into the hospital when her doctor left the room and read that she was at FA.
"I felt guilty because I was nervous, so I told no one, but I went home, looking for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA society," she said.
When I received the answer, I was sent and crazy in Panik.
I thought I would be with 18 in the Roll Hall and die with 25, and I would slowly lose all my ability.
I did it all alone with me and planned my own bathroom.
She said when she was 17, she was clear that her ability had not taken so strong as she had presented and asked her doctor.
He just stood up, and turned me down, and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, otherwise you're already in the Roll Hall."
I think you've got something weak less of life.
After some genetic tests, CMT was fixed.
"If he explained what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner," she said.
Charity CMT UK has started a CMTwareness monastery to take care of this disease.

Business taxation of business officers in the space of Washington has increased economic recovery
A recovery of the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax decisions for enterprises in the country were easy in the past year while the economic emphasis accelerated, so a newly published study in the past week, and the company in Washington was not excepted.
Countries in the area, Maryland and Virginia, together paid $27.6 billion to State and local offices in the 2013 financial year, increased 3,8 per cent against the income of 2012 at $26.6 billion.
In the past year, the State and local tax charge of the enterprises increased by $4,3 percent to $671, compared to $3,9 percent in the previous year, and the third growth year was in consequence with the few years of sensible decision 2009 and 2010.
State taxes have increased more than local expenditures for 4,3 percent, as the study carried out by the Service Services Agency Ernst & Young with the Centre for State taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the tax income of the district, 56 percent, depends on business taxes, while 36 per cent of the income of Maryland.
Virginia allows the lowest tax income from companies with 28 percent.
A major part of the increase in tax revenues is founded in an increase in the real estates of the companies, the researchers say that the increase in real taxes has increased by 3,7 percent in this year after the three incoming years with growth rates less than 1 percent.
During a large part of these gains from large countries such as California, New York and Texas, the end seems to be joined to Washington's room.
Countries in the district, Maryland and Virginia have paid together over $10 billion to State and local real estate taxes in the past year, compared to $9,6 billion, 2012 - a increase in the course of a year of 4,2 per cent.
But the apparent recovery in the real estates in Maryland is not so effective in enhanced State and local tax receipts because the real estate taxes are more than a fifth of the tax decision of companies.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. are almost half of their State and local taxes in form of real estate taxes.
"In Maryland, a large part of the real estates, particularly in the fiscal area of D.C., is either the owner of the government or of non-Profit organizations who do not pay real taxes," said Douglas Lindholm, Director of the Centre on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore encouraged, for example, to leave a lot more on the revenue taxes to provide the same services offered by other States.
The latest income in tax income by enterprises cannot be acquired only of the recovery of the real estate market
Companies also seem to be achieved, the data.
Companies in the region reported about income taxes in state organizations of $2,3 billion compared to $2,1 billion in 2012.
Mary accepted $1 billion in the company agreement taxes, the highest amount of the region.
During the trend into the same direction, the local tax deficiencies for enterprises is not equal to all three places.
The rise rate in the district was 4,3 per cent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was higher, 4,9 per cent.
Only Virginia reported an average tax income of 4,1 per cent.
Virginia, with 6 percent of all three official areas, has the most smallest tax taxes of enterprises (in all three, there are fixed taxes).
The company tax rate in Maryland is 8,25 percent and in the district of 9,975 percent.
A comparative study of the US Handal Chamber at the beginning of this year showed that smaller State and local enterprises are requested in Virginia and a better tax climate that is in Maryland.
The district has not been studied in the study.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure through its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has adopted laws to reduce its company tax rates in this year of 6.9 percent to 6 per cent, the same order like Virginia, and the sentence will be 5 percent in the next year.
If the State continues to achieve its income objectives in the coming year, this law could reduce the tax of the undertakings of the State until 2017 to 3 per cent.
It seems to be better in the space of Washington, and therefore they pay more State and local taxes, the recent study.

Partnertown: German Bier for Guangzhou
Hooks and Malz - also in China a loved combination.
German Bier enjoys a excellent call in China.
Frankfurt's partner City in China now wants a breathtaking and also seeks a direct connection between the two cities.
German Bier, used in Frankfurts Partnerstadt Guangzhou, is the urgent desire of the officials in China.
"We would be very glad if a German bourgeoi would be able to move into our city," said the Vice-Parteist of Southern Metropol, Lieuni, in this week, when you visit a SPD delegation in his city.
The functioner of the Registering Communist Party China has always come back during the conversation on this attitude of the twentieth million metropols.
Guangzhou, also called Canton, is one of the most rich cities of China, warm Li.
Therefore, people have the power of buying Germany to be able.
The Hessical SPD President Thorsten Schupper, who introduced the German Political Delegation, said to the guest that he will be in Germany after a possible partner for the project.
"For bier it doesn't need much: good water, wheat and feeding," he added at the evening with the party in Guangzhou.
This love of life has already gone out Mr. Li, he shot the guest.
In addition, the functioner of Guangzhou has drawn up with bottles - but with rotwein, which was served to eat.
The Chinese Tsingtao brand returns to German Braukunst.
Tsingtao bus is used after the German cleaning offer.
More business transport
A second desire of the Chinese guests would be a disconnect between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vize-Partechef Li.
The airhansa had previously offered the aircraft, but in 2012.
"It would be the loans again," the Common Politics was convicted.
"The business traffic between our two cities continues."
Currently, you should take the move over Changsha to the province of Hunan, air-conditioned Li.
The management of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, is also at the air connection.
The Vize Governor of the Province Chen Yunxian made this wish in his conversation with the Social Democrats in the presence.
"It's a very good idea," answered the Chief Gumul â€“ the Chinese Vice-President Li Jinjun, an Intemporary Knowner of Germany, who was nicked to vote.
Lodged partnership
Guangzhou's loyal visa carrier hopes that he can visit Frankfurt in the next year to a partnership meeting.
Lione was already on the Main, but not yet in this function.
He came to the office only in this year after his carrier was defended from the office.
The local party Wan Qinglian should also go.
The action against the functioners of Guangzhou is part of a country campaign against corruption in party and management which is carried out by Head Xi Jinping.
The new spring politics Liuni had worked before his partnership for a American company, which is most un normally in the Communist Party of China.
Before his ambassador in Guangzhou, he was a worker in Fujian, where the VW car built a great work.
Frankfurt has been officially more than a decade of cities partnerships.
The connection with the 9000 kilometres of Guangzhou belongs to those that are paid on both sides, such as a school steel.
Last 25 years the German-China connection was established.
The southern metropole at the Perlflus is almost as strong as the whole heat.
In the next year she wanted to reach a Brutto Inland product of 250 billion euros, Li reported.
The family of Joan Rivers "preps the Daumen"
Joan Rivers has been understood since her arrival to a hospital in New York City three days ago, but her daughter had shown a pleasure today that the 81-year-year-old communist has been taken from her disease.

We're all pressing the thumbs.
Her mother, according to sources on Thursday after an emergency of heart-style in a clinic at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy, in the Mount Sinai hospital.

Amazon buys Swiss for $1,04 billion
AMAZON confirmed the information reported on Monday morning: The online skills - and video producers, and a number of other things - bought the Video Streaming Service Twitch for $1,04 billion (970 million US$).
The announcement is surprised not because nobody had expected a transfer of Swiss, but because it was too surprised that YouTube would buy the company.
Three months ago it appeared as if the sale of Twich to the video service of Google was decided for a coole billion, and the cooperation appeared, of course.
Twitch, which was founded as Justin.tv before three years ago, was started as a general Streaming Service - a Live Version of YouTube.
Instead, it was quick to a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravouring shops in games, a "YouTube for Live Games", such a investor.
The Swiss scene.
And "let's play", a video gentleman, in the owner, give the (st elder) plays a struggle of secret science teaters, are already very loved on YouTube.
It is even so that YouTube is often mentioned when you want to describe Twich, so the message was that YouTube wanted to buy Twich to take something pleasant to learning a game of an ethnified technology company that buys a potential competitor.
It's a rape why the deal with YouTube did not come as the company was prepared according to reports, as much to pay as Amazon.
Everything that we now know about is this statement by Emmet Shear, President of Twitch: "We decided to Amazon because they believe in our Community that they share our values and long-term visions and they want to help us to get faster there."
Another secret is honestly said that the unbelievable success of Twitch.
For Snobs like me to explain that they're doing such a sport, it's difficult to take the attraction that goes to see others at the game instead of take the control consolidation into the hand.
It's a thing to look at a friend at 3:00 a.m. tomorrow, while they're easy by resident Evil, and something else to see a ring on it, as he's 20 times after one in Call of Duty's head.
All of these games you could look right now.
Another problem is that many of the best games today are Ego games, so the survey can be the right receipt for head painlessness.
I add that the swimming pounds, in which the Roger Bannisters of our electricists are undertaken all games in record time.
But as long as a game or Humorvirtuose is there, his Twitch canal is probably not so interesting.
But what do Sceptiker know how I'm about?
Twitch is called by 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of Internet transport pipes.
And what exactly do Amazon want to do for this?
It's hard to imagine that Twich is so elegant in Amazon Instant Video, how YouTube Twich could easily be locked.
But Twitch has something that every company would like: thousands of young men who will be killed as an advertising.
As the President of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Swiss "believing both to the future of the Gaming," and the media shows no signs of a shadow, nor even - sluck - as a viewerport.
On the Hulpfburg at the Burggarten festival, some were going on the Sonnabend.
The concept of the agency was right.
Despite the powerful rain on the same time, 1200 musicfans were evaluated to the open-Air-Fest in Burggarten.
It was timely to be stopped.
"It was bad," said Ron Sem, one of the organisms.
Salzwedel is light and fun.
From two Spanish words, Max Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name of Amula.
Since the open Air in the Salzwedeler Burggards will express healty on the day and evening by various shows.
Well, and the pleasure comes from yourself.
This was already shown in the early Sonnday when the first visitors were opened.
A festival for all generations had promised organisms.
And this is their fun.
Alongside the skills of the bourgeois, Salzwedeler had also made guests near and further surrounding.
They followed the first Live Adventions, washed with the foot in the taste, eating cold drinks - shortly: clean relaxation and wellness were admired.
And that's pleasure through the generations.
While one on the covered white sand on the street, others laid on a quarter of wine in the vinothek, the follow-up on the Hubfburg, which was a great point of attraction for the small guests.
But also at the children's damage, the voluntary helpers in the realest sense of the word had to do all the hands to become the Andrang Lord and to raise fantasic creatures into the small faces.
The sizes used the Kickertics or participated in a Skateboard Woorkshop that produced the goodfoot crow from Salzwedel.
To the great rain.
Soon before 17:30, he sought to visitors, especially for families, looking for the weather and the dry.
However, the attractivity of the festival did not cease.
"There came more people than waiting," said Ron Sem, who said by a " success on the whole line."
That's why a repair of the great party in the coming year was nothing to face.
Only if the contents and size of the event needed to be worked, Sem made clearly in a first balance on Sunday against the people's vote.
As a bitterly, he described that interimly the imprisonment was to be stopped.
Of course, the security mark was visited with too little forces.
The following: Some who had already paid have no longer arrived on the area.
The resonance was very good.
In a first pretty treasure, the Salzwedele Mitorganist said about 1200 visitors that were gathered in Burggard.
There were problems in tonnology.
The Salzwedeler Hip-Hop-Band Blocks' n'Rox pushed its attack so far.
The technicians were not able to create a half-way sound.
The planned Shisha-Lounges could not be built because the cells were not able to be brought to Salzwedel.
"In the next year they will be there," said the Institute.
The primary of the Amula Open Air was more than available by the numbers of visitors.
And that's in bad weather.
However, the events have started some mistakes that are the first time, but have to be removed at the second place.
Also, in the social network of Facebook, the institutional criticisms are needed to take place in the social network.
"Sorry, but for 12 euros it's just awaited more", said Melanie Meier on the event site.
"I'm sorry you've got a little bit," Ele Zimmermann said at the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems.
I find it very good that some are not only stubborn, but also really trying to put something on your legs.
"Stahanie Jenses to Amula."
Now, the students remain a year to stop these criticisms.
New Radom in Berkum: Watbergs True signs shoot

The bugverees will soon be back to a race?
Lastly, the Zwist between the two Wolfratshauses Burgverens was again.
Now, you think the cases about a possible cooperation.
As an image for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Burg, Richard Dimbath, the former Chairman of Wolfratshauser Burg Freunde, the project in French GuÃ©delon.
Against a year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Freund Wolfrats Houses.
It appeared to be different to the positions, such as the history of the Wolfratshaus Burg and a possible reconstruction.
The two campaigns are now moved to each other: it should be a little talk about a common action.
These confirm the Conventions Torsten SjÃ¶berg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) on the request of our newspaper.
"I have called Mr Piffl and proposed that we could join us once," reported SjÃ¶berg.
Its views could be taken back to a race by all the members of the two future.
So be more rapidly visible success.
During the Burg freunds of the suddenly destroyed Richard Dimbath until the last time had a reconstruction of the castle on the mountainwald, the Burgvery agreement stands on SjÃ¶berg's "Delivery and Delivery" of the village.
Herbert Piffl, Vice-President of the Burg Freunde, has been very pleased by his own information about the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he's prevailing the guests.
A new presidency will be found in a member meeting in middle September.
At the moment, the unit applies to the 74-year-old about 40 members.
"After my friend's death, Richard Dimbath, we have left the activities from respect first." This "Denkphase" was needed to consider how it could continue.
According to Piffl, the new presidency will then go to the conversation with the Burg Congress.
To that end, the burg freunds could also make a current scene of shapes within their grouping.
A candidates for the presidency are not yet present, says Piffl.
"But I'm sure someone will be found." He doesn't want to candy himself because he has his residence in Bad TÃ¶lz.
The new President should be a Wolfrat House.
The dutyer wants to continue to work on the project, but it is very pleased.
The different positions in cases reconstruction will probably remain in the eyes of Piffls in the next time.
He worth Dimbath as "Missionar", who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not closed.
By high participation of the population, and by voluntary helpers from all the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was at the beginning skiptic.
But in the course of the time, I have made more and more to convince that it is reasonable to forward the project." It could be created a "institution" for the residue City.
There's nothing else here.
Furthermore, the project would be financing through EU Swiss, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, believe Piffl.
"The idea of the reconstruction is that I don't want to get personally on the boat." He hopes that the burgs may move something in this point.
The goal of the story to first document, "It's important and good."
Then you can see it.

Shrammel traumator quickly brings on victory tracese speed with the second season seat the right reaction to the disappearance against Helsinki and goes with a successful experience in the country players.

"I thought I had to clean the whole figs from Thursday and threw it under the lake," said the 26-year-year-old.
As a Srammel on November 13, 2010 to the last time in a federal party, it was still for ried.
So he will remain in special memory.

Putin requires the recovery of "Stabial Party" with the Ostukraine
The Russian President Wladimir Putin requested Russian media reports on Sunday that the Ukrainian Government sets the fight against the separators in the east of the country and immediately negotiations on the "State" of the Aborting Region.
His speaker Dimitri Peskow later explained that Putin had not agreed that the area of the Osservants would be a part of Russian, but that his status against Ukraine should be re-defined to give the Russian region the power to reply its rights and interests.
However, Putin's call to the Kiewer Government on negotiations at the highest level with the pro-Russian complaints is the strategy followed by him for five months ago: aid for the Separatists in the presence of areas and pressure to the Ukraine to allow the new proclaimed region of Novorosija factical independence to alliance with Russia instead of the West.
In an interview with the state television channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign for the recovery of the areas retained by Separatists in the eastern Donezk and Luhansk regions, adopted in March and April after Moscow joined the Ukrainian Halbinsel Krim on 18 March.
The cancer and the separators have recently described the territory "Novorossija" or "Newussland", which remembers the prerevolutionary glass period of the Russian Imperium.
Putin emphasized that all of the Ukrainian politicians who are attracted by the campaigns of elections on 26th Okt and, while government groups of civil communities in the areas held by Separatists, have hoped to take place in rapid peace talks "in their ilions" reported Itar-Tass.
"We have to take full discussions, not only on technical questions, but also on the political organization of society and the state of Southern Turkey, to assess the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskow said that Putin's referral to the State in the context of the greater autonomie, which has been discussed for months of the Guideline, in order to spread fears in Russian language areas that their cultural and legal rights were dangerous.
Only the Ukrainian government can share the eastern areas the necessary autonomie," Peskow said.
It is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskow said, "although it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine but a internal conflict in Ukraine."
The clarification of the cancer speaker for the correction of the "Fehl Interpretation" of Putin's notes underlined the leading order of Russia at the transition of the separatistic rebellion in the east, in contrast to the direct analyzing of the crim, which most of the two million of the ethnic Russians are.
Moscow would have greater difficulties to join the regions of Donezk and Luhansk in the East, since most of the 6,5 million inhabitants are not Russians and have been enlarged with surveys from the time before the conflict, a wide majority for the remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomie, which was spoken by Russian diplomates on international forums, would give the regional governments to negotiate their own trade agreements and external relations, and thus the Crumbl de facto give the control of a area that links the Russian State area to the Crime.
The joined Halbinsel in the Black Sea is the household for the major part of the Russian Sea and a important trade chain and historic art region.
The regions between the Rostow region in Russia and the Crime are also rich in mines, manufacturers and furnitures that make the main components for the Russian military.
The Ukrainian President Peter Poroshenko said that the Ukrainian legislation, after new elections, should consider the constitutional approaches in which the regions concerned will be established a greater control on their financial and the status of the languages.
But his imagination of autonomie seems to be a grievous opposition to which the crowd and the separatistic rebells are presented by the Moscow weapons and resurrection.
Putin's last request for Kiew to negotiate the Separatist leaders at the highest level, followed a further advance of the refusals in the past week after Russian troops and Panzers on the previous peaceful region during the Astury Sea in Ostcrane.
The separatists supported by Russia have been transferred in the hands of the Ukrainian security officer of the first step of a campaign to overcome the strategic coast region, the control of Nowoasowsk.
For this reason, we have a massive and military preparatory preparations to prepare Mariupol, a steel industry port with 500,000 inhabitants, which is between Nunoasowsk and the slight access to Halbinsel Crime.
Poroshenko said on Saturday at a meeting of the EU Guideline in Brussels and urged actions to prevent another Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet Republic who has been independent for 23 years.
"We stand short before a point where there is no back again," said Poroshenko.
thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of strange Panzers are now located in the Ukrainian territory.
The EU Group decides no concrete actions, which the leading requested the draft of further sanctions against Russia to enter into force at an unspecified scrutiny of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to return from their positions in Ilovakia, after two Russian Panzer cools and 1,000 soldiers in the Donezk region last week to support the deployed seminars, said Prince Andri Lysenko, speaker of the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council reports on Saturday in Kiew.

The list is 101 promises.
On the other hand, who had gained Grecko last month, said to the Confidential, "It's contrary."
All private letters and images should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and extended to others.
Grecko, at the time in New York, said reports according to a newsletter that the hack is "whomful" and that those concerned felt "sweet".
The Hacker probably has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-Freund Scott Speedman, including two acceptances in which they are above without a pool.
The film tool includes Palmers "Liebe is unable" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and the shower Browning from Sucker Punch were yesterday for comments to the fallen images.
A Representative Lawrence' said to TMZ: "It's an absurd violation of the private."

Radler, Jogger and Wander were yesterday at 8 Radeln on the Great Fieldberg and thus supported the "Aid for Grabs diseases".
The tour for which one tour was made a easy train for the others.
Nevertheless, they were all alone: it was pleasant.
Thomas Studanski needed to sleep well last night.
For first in his life, the chief of the Brauhauses' Main Brauhauses went yesterday with the rad to the fieldberg.
For the good purpose.
The small muscle chalet can easily disappear, particularly him, the participation on the 8th boards on the Great Fieldberg for the "Administration for Grabs diseases" (Frankfurt) also has also produced a valuable knowledge.
A great thing.
"I know now I can -- good!"
A small pool in the Applaus curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it was...
As Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberurseler City parliament, shot many of the 718 participants yesterday in the spring and came near the creature but happy to the plate.
Others were easier to overcome the good eleven kilometres long streets between Hohemark and fieldberg.
For example, Norman servants.
The whole green politics from the round day - Red Dress, Red Bike - made another thing to Understatement ("Every much of Profess, there comes the goal!"), but then on the mountain as a half Profi and went after 45 minutes without an appointment through the goal.
He also went through the street in a ruck, like Nina Kuhn, the press speaker of the city of Oberursel, who had made together with Frank Green.
For the two triathlets, the "Feldberg-Radeln" was not at all a sporting challenge: "It's about Charity, there we've been pleased with it - an exit we had done today without anyway", so coffee.
At the way they met Paul Wenzel from the top tripberg.
The boy (12) went down to the upper morning to the top to the same extent of the high.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had shot at 9:00 at home in the saddle, "mave" the fieldberg two times to spend fun to home.
"First-Toni" also had "Frite-Toni".
For the Chief of the Hauturseler Kultkiosks, Radtouren are easily on the fieldberg.
He had been using with his 6,5 kilo-rad 40 minutes.
A crazy event.
For this purpose, I'm glad about it," said Andreas Balzke.
The trans-trained manner says he is a " ambitious renradler".
It must also be, because he was under way with the "Fixie-Rad", that's also the renaissers, but without scene...
This also turned out without rad locker above, not only the 20 mulars who moved over the white wall and the powers of the hill, but also a jogger who turned a car with weight.
Bergwacht-Arkzt Professor Volker Lischke, who served with his team, equipped with Allrad-Bully and Quad, for security, said: "Then I know" from Frankfurt, which trained for a special locking line, just that he holds the lock itself." The man is so awarely his own locking mount.
The 718 participants - and so many as never - were sent in groups to the streets in the morning.
The Wanders first at 9.30 p.m.
The first radar drivers and drivers followed at 10:00.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers left out.
Bent Hansen, President of the Congress "Radeln on the Great Fieldberg", gave the start Commands and wanted the participants to have a beautiful flight.
For the next year, he hopes that it's enough to spent the streets to the fieldberg for the security of the participants.
