No free news for Tymoshenko by Parliament
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament refused the request to establish in the framework of a Novel of the Criminal Library, paragraphs of which the Opposition director Yulia Timoshenko was condemned.
The new regulation that could be able to release the ministry of the prisoned expert, the Deputy Members left the second reading of the application on the missing of the criminals for economic delicates.
Timoshenko was condemned in October because of the conclusion of an accurately concerned treaty with Russia on the sale of land gas to seven years.
The sentence is not yet legal, in December, the calling of the judges shall be negotiated before the court.
Timoshenko itself describes the judgment as a political race of the regime and also in the Western, the process defended the presence of the court.
On the basis of which the Minister of Exploiting was condemned to remove from the Criminal Law, 147 members were supported.
226 votes would have been necessary for its adoption.
Libyscher Sieg
The story of the Liberation Champion or Liberian Rebellion has already known their lossers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi is buried in a unknown place in the wilderness and without him the war is over.
Now, they're just to define the victory.
Like this region usually, we go to the elections of the islamics, the question is only which are the measured or the radikals.
The National Transit Council was known to the right of self-shake, which now has a certain idea with God.
Libyen would take the country without criminality, because for the burdens of the steel, the hands are shortly deceived.
Women should also forget an emancipation as quickly as well as any abuses of faith, and thus further.
Instead of a single Dictator, the company will come to the future from the coran.
Kurzum - in Libya will rule a order which would not be predecessable and, above all, will be worth.
Only - our lifestyle is now not the only and objectively seeing the best and would never be the library mentioned.
So it is more excited that the Moslem fighters have helped themselves above all of the unbelieving dogs.
For their excuse, only the fact that NATO's air attacks could not be conducted by any of the generals of America but by God himself, whose allmight has been assigned after any successful meeting.
The victory in Libyen?
We only participated in a shadow, we served the interests of Islam and our politicians in the person of the Dictator of a political commitment, without that any benefit would be made.
After the fresh and bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we looked better from a military order of Libyen.
Thus, the witnesses are anxious - the delivery of the crowd drivers.
But are the mineral oil companies also welcome the black gold to spott price?
Welcome and so the Western can finally boast the right of his self-freeness in matters of human rights.
If they don't destroy the shadow of the ownership.
Start a new crises series
France and the rest of Europe in the focus of investors.
On Sunday, a statistical tourist was made by Europe.
The individual States have published their information on their IPB for the third quarter.
Tskchy's economy has been wandered in comparison with the CV, Germany and France.
The market of obligations is today but all records.
The investors are not only Greece, but also Spain, France, Austria and other countries in the eye.
The statistical officers of Europe, Germany, Czech Republic and some of other European countries have published their predictions on economic development in the third quarter.
The PIB has increased by 0.5% according to the expectation of France, 0.4%.
At the same time, their data were corrected for the second quarter, in which Germany has marked a higher growth as originally was expected (Waching rate of 0.3% instead of 0.1%) while France had a slight decline of 0.1% (related original information only from stagnation).
Tschech economy increased in the third quarter of this year compared to 1,5 percent.
However, in comparison to the previous quarter, the Brutto Inland product was laid down and the statistics office confirmed that the trend of growth in economic performance has been confirmed.
The results are therefore worse than the approaches of the analysis.
The most important events:
The Tschech economy increased in the third quarter of this year compared to the previous year by 1,5 percent, however, in comparison to the previous quarter.
The German economy in the third quarter has increased 0.5 percent.

Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium and other countries are also starting to discover problems...
The reimbursements in Tsjish State licenses are under 4 per cent, even if the situation in the region is damaging.
In Germany, the ECB should be believed to the last instance.
The cups were qualified for EURO
In Montenegro they won 1:0 and now feed their qualification for 200 million
The football selection has evaluated the most difficult task of the whole saison!
Thanks to a well-oriented Torwarts ◆ech and a beautiful gate of Petr Jiráček, they won in Montenegro 1:0.
With a great happiness of the Czech Foodball, his luxury prejudice could defend the home game and it will not again be missed at the European secretion.
IHNED.cz followed the rise game in an outcoming report.
Weak resurrection in the first half time and a riding sports happiness in the second.
The Czech selection also seized thanks to the conclusion of the homemannship, a brillant ≤ech's and the herd of the Jiráček day right in Montenegro, and has therefore resolved its ticket for the football EM.
Also because of the precise defence game of the Tschechian manager, they have advised the Montenegriners only in the second half-time pressure.
The fisheries of the party were Damjanovic and Vucinic, which threw two rieschancers.
In the next year, with a excellent Petr ◆ech, the Tsychical selection will also be very glad that the secret football is a press of approximately 200 million.
From the first minutes to play right fighting football.
Both managers combined along the middle line, especially in terms of the Mediterranean line.
During the second half time, the pressure of the homemanship continued, and the wide complaints were rejected by the Czech refusal.
Iranian students are ready to die for the nuclear programme of their country.
They formed a living scene.
Some hundreds of high school students formed a living shoot around a corner object in Iran.
With this settlement, they wanted to demonstrate their support to the nuclear program of their country before a possible Israeli attack.
Students were praying on Sunday before the object and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
Some hundreds of students of the University of Iranian Isfahan formed a living shoot around the nuclear technology center in Isfahan, in which the Uran is processed.
They wanted to know that they were ready to protect the nuclear program of their country, if it was necessary to protect their own life.
The International Agency of Atomic Energy (IAEA) established in its report that Iran has not shown its efforts on nuclear weapons long.
In Israel also speaks about a possible attack on Iranian arms.
Students were praying at the middle before the entrance of the complex and then announced death to the United States and Israel.
In the case of an attaque that the Iranian Atomic Programme is widely laid down, the Israeli press from the centre of Isfahan would also be the attraction of atomization in Natan's attraction target.
The food card of a fatty kid: it's not premature and iss to dinner
More than a third of children from 9 to 13 have oversight problems, with 9 percent of all students and 5 percent of all children are over weight.
Current surveys shown - adiphose children most of families with unfair lifestyle.
Thus once again shows how important for the healthy development of a person is the mercy in which he rises, and the examples that cause him.
On the Tsypsy Adiphous children are to half more often on the table than in families in which normal children live.
More than 19 percent of the oversight children had an action on the previous day under the model "Adipositas is not an accident" pommes to the dinner.
In families with dickerchen also sports not just the favorite jobs, but also the majority of today's students - only 15 percent responded that their parents were at least one time in the week for active movement.
Question of 900 children
The survey was held over the past year before the end of the school year, and nearly 900 children from basic schools were consulted in the whole Czech.
This was the second year's action "Adipositas is not an accident", supported by the general hospital and society University.
Furthermore, the project took part of more than 12 thousand students from 4. and 8. classes.
Non-counted cost and lacking movement in the family are essential factors that are responsible for the scared number of children with oversight or even fat feed.
"Other than half of the children requested, for example, five times on the day, in the breakfast mode of dinner-sleeve-per-sendbrot, one of the main conditions for healthy food," said one of the survey results.
No breakfast and warming for dinner
Experts indicate that relative smallnesses, such as the regular breakfast of the family, are important for the healthy development of a child.
In Tskchy's early tips only 23 percent of the family of students.
And, in most families, everyone's premature for himself alone.
The worst was the decade that is not embraced in every tenth family.
The breakfast shall apply to the basis of the healthy daily food.
The survey tested, among others, that in the families of overseas children, a lot of most recently uncovered pumps.
And almost every one - without oppression of weight - drink sweet limones every day (70 percent)
Since more than 40 percent of the children concerned sport, but less than half of their parents do this - only 15 percent.
Make your own menu together
Another part of the survey allowed the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to join their own food plan.
"What Tskchy children benefit from 12 to 15 in point of food, it is far away from the ideal of healthy food.
Many meal feeds, meat plants, and natural sweet fish were included among their favorite fishes.
"Alarmantly is the great pleasure of sweet limonaden" in the final report on this survey.
During evening, so the main teeth, seated teethwares knocked before flowers.
Children’s pleasure hadn't liked almost, even the love of fish and vegetables than summer.
Return to health
At the same time, the survey also showed that the children are ready to change their conditions when they receive correct information.
"After the group of survey parties who have completed the questionnaires after the end of the outclosive proposal "Adipositas is not an accident", in many cases, a clear distinction of the preferences towards the principles of healthy food has been set out in the outcome of the project.
At the moment, this was, for example, at the sweet limos where many children began to give the privileges to normal water.
Children had also grown in the questionbourg a lot of earliest flowers or fish as the head of the day and were ready to eat less corners or sweet food.
Profess - a stylist must also be a good psychologe
In the present article, how to learn styleists, I was thinking a little bit that it was a little too much substance for the beginning.
So I didn't get the worst thing that happens.
Provisions of three Profess from the industry, the expectation of problemic figures and a seminar on how it goes on the place.
It's gotta be worse.
It is close to the test that more information and practical tasks are before us.
But even if the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, he is fully deployed.
This time we discussed with director Alena (in course, no only man takes part), as a woman is not an ideal proportioned figur.
And that's always the most of us.
The ones have a too short half, the others one to young figur without ordinary curves and again are likely.
It is the case of the styleist to catch wide students optic to extend the half or to draw up the necessary curves.
We also arrived tips like a woman like Jennifer Lopez - with a large bus, larger hairs and smell size - bright and figurable behaviour without that it operates all too provocative.
If, for example, the difference between the size and the hills is so large that the Rock or the hoses do not really take place, at least a piece should be divided according to measure.
This will not be calculated, because good sitting clothing is easily unemployable.
In such a measured rock it feels much better than in one of the stars that is always high and depressed, in the size, etc.
Childful figures can be allowed again, waiting with flowers, baths, applications, steckeries or disappearance.
With this many information and figur types, I'm glad I have a whole week time to let me go all through my head.
And yet, I am afraid that it is almost not to create in view of the deployed household.
Each of the curriculum shared a promi for which it should experiencing appropriate outfits - day clothing and dinner.
We must take into account the current view to the modest of the relevant star and its figur type.
I'll get to Miranda Kerr, who you may know from the Victoria's campaign.
Inside, I July, because this is very better for me than for Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has been likely accepted to the hundred kilo (a good, that's a little over), or also the young Selena Gomez.
The clothings we need to select from newspapers or search on the Internet, print and edit graphically.
In the "Moodboard", as the whole result is called, then our entire personal style and our relationship to the graphical development will be expressed.
It is, in fact, very important to think about the graphical side of the Styling.
In fact, the Model is not only purely physically, but also sets the product site referred to in the journals (for example, the trend stages, mantels, etc.).
This has told us the Stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But that's just Sunday.
That means a stylist must have a good overview.
The Saturday proposal adopted with information on Figuren Types was the same as three visitors from the industry:
The Stylist Jan Pocorný, the Modern Creator Jakub Polanka and the Modegraph Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that mode Illusion is and that a stylist should be able to use this.
And embedded stylist can work with a single waiting equipment in a different way.
The Zauberwriting word is variable.
So, for example, you can take a triangle as a living on the Jeans, such as a T-shirt or a mantel, but you can also put it on the narrowed body, put the paragraphs and put it as clothes.
It's easy to smoke the skin or the wheel high and the same looks differently.
"Spile this," he bowed.
Most of them came to me the following Council: "You must know the rules perfectly."
"The first time you should kill her," said Jakub.
Finally, I will be sure why we all need to do these teachers what you can combine with what you can and why, even if you are often seeing all others in Modernals.
Too damage to mode views.
Thanks to the photograph Ben I now know that a Stylist has to have prepared a lot of more waiting variables as he finally has been photographed.
So, for a Fashion story with ten pages (see 10 outfits) you must be prepared for at least five-five styles.
And also that the expectation on the photo in combination with other accessories, including in all different ways as actually.
This is why you have to count at the starting of the outfit.
This image and style shown among half of the success, which also confirmed us Jan Pocorný.
There you only need to see a non-lightly brillant sceneant, made a world shape from the image and Marketing.
In Czechya, the services of a styleist are more reserved.
Also known personalities keep this often for outgoing money (the main chain is that I bring something as I see is two-ranged).
And if some of us can style, then we must consider that he or she makes us a great likely different (or smaller) size when he or she really needs.
Then you only need to steal up to determine that the bolevard pressure writes again or taken the appropriate promi.
Jan and Mario put us on Sunday to heart, not to believe that a stylist only needs to focus on the mode and then the outfit "building together".
At his work he needs to communicate, especially with the people he's stying and he's got to be a proud psychologist.
People appreciate, without worship and standing on his opinion.
"When any manager has ordered us to look at their clothes and add little pieces, then we can't make her all pain and say -- my God, it's terrible."
"You must at least find some loyal things to which you are recommended what you can take to it", says Mario.
He also showed us what a so-called "platzasche" should hold.
So a cup that gets on the size and brings all the necessary properties.
Besides clear things, such as skin, roller or safety lines, it also contains instruments such as a Nylonfade (they helps the Stylist to photograph of products such as hands or holes), special clips with which wearing the clothes, if they are too large (scknadles or other clothes are subject to so that the substance is not captured) and naturally nuts.
But that we should not only listen to, but also have some practical testing, we learned how to be dressed correctly.
When photographing in the table where the footbod is right, you can disagree the shoes, you can disappear the outside.
We lived and...
With the screen, you must not even touch the shoes so that you do not miss it.
So you really have to be sent.
Mario welcomed me by loving my "Creation" without restrictions.
It is not just my strongness mentioned in fact.
All this was only the bruising of what we got to hear at the second weekend course.
One has become clear to me - to turn to the styling at professional level, it is not a kid game.
V Need for Speed: "The Run" - the illegal railway by America
Review
The originally without careful trip is a series of completely negative, dictant errors about routine travel to the spring.
However, it was necessary to fulfil the ambitions to the greater part, but what is protected that if nobody had a little bit more.
Before he came to the loading, the new part with the title "The Run" high expectations.
However, he discussed the annual game series "Need for Speed" to put a piece into a new dimension and he actually seemed to be not only one of many action wheel games.
We were also nervous, like the adapted passagies, where the main protagonist goes out of the car and continues to foot.
But as you've already been used at NFS, it's finally much different than you've been waiting for.
Surely, it is a fair comprehensive arkade rail, but the game of some overwhelming errors presented in this series is more or less than a few years.
So there are no errors more but more signs of an incomprehensive way in the principle of the developers.
The adventure begins very good.
The first time you are introduced into the story whose main figure Jack has some problems of personal characteristics; the only solution seems to be to participate in a illegal way by America.
In San Francisco, so at the Western coast, you are Lenkrad, with the task to be first in New York.
The basic contains a whole number of interesting elements.
The whole road is divided in 10 steps and in more than 50 individual roads.
This means that each race is exposed on other streets and that the individual steps are carried out in a different, sufficiently different and interesting meal.
You have no moment the impression that the game would always offer the same.
Some surroundings are still explicit, although the technical level of the graph is not over the previous part of the series.
So nothing about the world movement.
But the journey through the wilderness, through the bridge landscape or high by deep dispersed landscape is actually very accepted.
Go and bring untype elements a little deletion in the individual roads.
In the desert, for example, it is surprised by a storm of the desert, which is strongly limited to the view.
In the mountains, you must be deeply observed that a lawine is not protected.
On the other hand, the individual roads are well built behind each other.
Just a few, but they're rich.
One time you are trying to overcome the prescribed number of guests (in a classic rail), then you have time to take (class races against the stop pump), then a further personal dule with a single contractor.
And this is the police who wants to fuck the whole thing.
A news are passagiers in which Jack leaves the car.
This is more about some interactive animations in which Jack fly before someone and where the players should help him by pressing the right button at the right moment.
So nothing compleased.
However, it is surprised that there is much less than such passagies in the game as you would expect (concreasedly only three).
Lastly, this is the thing more profitable, because at least this element has no opportunity to be slow - it is in the context of the above elements that make the game rich.
The trip model writes in the footballs of the previous parts.
This means, seen from this point of view, there are no trees, otherwise, you could not say that it would be bad.
Whoever is looking for realistic simulations needs to be seen in a different way.
But an action-loaded renaissue will continue to be fully fair, although you can find better in the competitiveness.
To that way, everything is in best order.
Real problems are just looking for a certain time.
In contrast to the trip model, the collection model is not completely O.K.
A game of this kind is expected to be calculated with complex deformations and collections, but if practically before any object has an idea, how the car's holding, it's obviously not all right.
Typical example: In some cars the other car is easily easy, in others, nearly identical situations, but you're in the slaughters and desired pirouetten.
Or the card will be shot.
Thanks to the restart system, it does nothing else, since worse it is always.
The restarts are so removed: if you have total grounds or along along the streets, then one goes back to the last point of the streets.
Only - in each train you have five restarts.
If you're pulling her out, everything goes out of front.
The restarts are so much as something like a means, for the case that something is not available, but you should not leave yourself.
But sometimes it does not help the restart, there is nothing else helping learning the critical section from the head.
Explanation is unrealised that the same things often happen to the same places.
Some curves should, for example, be done in a very specific manner, otherwise it is not easy.
Otherwise, cars are always in the same configuration, notably if you come as first or five seconds before or a minute later.
This is particularly bad in situations when you see that the contract passes before a played on two incoming cars, but until you get there, the cars are already in such a position that you need to move or break them.
And it doesn't matter when you get there, it's all that it's so designed that it's always close to your nest.
The counterparts have further benefits.
In the whole game, there are several places where you can always be overcome at the same place from the same anger and also here again without oppression at the time.
This is the most depressive way to end the game on the long press that you're happening in opposite.
The conflict must clearly take a devil out here.
And if he's before one, then he's taking a look, so you're going to start the car there a couple of times to Klump.
Clar - you want to make the game easier and relaxing but this intention is so clear that they make the joy fast to the game.
And that's damage, because, although easier trip model, the game is totally sustainable and as well as loaded as it is almost not knowing where one of the heads stands.
And in the principle, it doesn't matter what "schuld" is -- the concept with fifty unique roads, the settlement of the rains in a way that no length can come, or something else...
An un normal idea is also the car change during the railways.
You can not see the tanks on the street, because you can just switch the car, although in most cases the car that you have right now.
The cars are divided in three categories.
The sports cars are suitable for the stedical areas, the strong American limousines for the right cars and the exotic Super cars for technical cars, for example on the Serpentines in the mountain.
In hand with the mode of play story is also the task mode (Employment) - so the races in the individual localities you know from the story.
Here there are not only medicines but also winning experience points for the own profile, which is commonly for the tasks (the challenges) and the history.
To reach the highest driver level, various objects must be closed: starting from the car until the background for the profile.
This is also connected to the online functioning carlog, which compares the own results of other players and also provides for other collective functions.
One of other uncomprehensive shits is a situation in the last stage of the story.
In fact, here you come with the car in a U-Bahn Tannel, where you are in the dark storm long (meanway).
See numbers between 150 to 200 km/h (meenweg), but one of the sides a U-Back and gets a combinationless to shoot.
In our editor, we will have been going to fight a long time about whether it was a Blackout of the players or whether we keep the authors for such a blow.
The technical side is nothing overwhelming but at least the visual impression is directly related in most cases and here and there is even lighting.
As a result, it is worse that in some relaxing moments the painting frequency will be slower and that, including quite dramatic, will be.
However, this concerns the accidents with greater number of participants, where a continuing FPS does not protect.
The tonnage delivery is soon O.K. and the soundtrack is smoke.
In the attempt of speaking a widely wide scale than young publics, a soundtrack a la "of everybody" - but who buys a game that is already because of music?
The total impression of Need for Speed: The Run? The feelings are more missed.
If the game would not be damaged completely unnecessary errors, we could say that The Run is the best part of NFS in the last years.
But that's how it's going to do the game.
For yourself a class of fun, but it should be prepared that one of these errors with the power of aircrafts should grow into the eyes.

EU Businesser Vicenová:
The Czech have the call of Negativests and Eurosceptics
"The Lisbon Treaty has produced the balance among the individual institutions feeling from the lot".
I wouldn't expect that such a hard war would be destroyed."
"There will be five, six years old until the matters have been fixed and all of their new roles," Millena Vicenová, the Tskish ambassador of the European Union, directly injured its proposal to the jurisdiction of the jurisdiction.
As it is serious, she takes the model "comprehensive and open about Europe", she already showed in the first part of her proposal, in which she had been able to describe the individual EU bodies and their mutual relations to a so-called and understanding way that they could help some lectors of the Karl University's jurisdiction.
Mrs Vicenová also welcomed the new expert Chairman of the Council of Europe Herman Van Rompuy:
"The beginning was critic that he was too unacceptable - a green officer who was not grown as a role, but I must say that it has killed all the hearts, as well he accepted the thing.
"It is a man who will make it to be patient to hear, communicate with them, particularly clear ideas of how to continue with the EU.
The new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy she then explained as a response to the question: Who is the actually - the European Union? what number should I call for?", so as an important step to agree and better readibility of EU politics towards States, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to make us our oil painter Quargel
Mrs Vicenová also joined the agenda which the European Union lived, lived and remembered in close future.
The Czech Chairman of two years ago described it as a success.
The Czech would have met the financial crisis and the gascrisis, and had also introduced the board for East Partnership.
In the case of the Government during the presidency, it was a large negativum, which has caused the image of the Czech Republic.
The Czech Relationship in the EU is now to make all the hands full.
With the words of the newsletter, it was not only the Presidency, but also the following crisis, which is not yet overcome to this day.
And there is still the seven-year budget of the EU, which makes the matter more comprehensive because of today's economic situation.
Whether there will be a slight and slow budget, which economic priority, which countries are more and less promoted, is now on the agenda.
The ambassador also remembers their own slogans with which she came to Brussels: "Conscious about Europe."
"If I don't like something, then it's a green corners, foreign words and fachjargon that nobody understands.
How do I actually know whether you are really in Brussels or around and different bananas, or whether we really want to make somebody to disappear the quarter?
It would also like to use the EU's ground to get more cheques in European institutions.
Europe of two or different speeds in view
In view of the EU Budgetarian, the Czechs are to be Eurosceptics, more negative than the positive sides of the matter.
For example, the weak distribution of cheques in European institutions is in Europe.
There are many factors of debt, among others, the resistance of our candidates, whose inability to write mobility letters and not last the weak support of the Czech side.
Besides the successful Tsjechical Presidency, she also took the force and cooperation of the visagrad group, which is so-called in V4.
"Do you believe me when a Pole or Hungar comes to me and a slowake is near, then the French says next to me: "Hello, what do you make the head together?" is it again your V4?
Mrs Vicenové, as regards the future, expects the EU’s hard rules for the budget policy of Member States.
As a lot of rare, as a "European Federation" she looks at the concept of a Europe of the two or even different speeds.
"We here are the countries of the euro area and the countries absent of the euro zone.
"We have the Schengen Room and we already have the Institute of Enhanced Cooperation."
"The first time has been said that the countries must cooperate that they want it and those who do not want to stand quietly. "
"There will be given more and more of such institutions, which will finally end on a strong "Europe of the different speeds", Mrs Vicenová.
In this regard, she also emphasized the role of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuyes in the implementation of the principle, in accordance with all the subjects of the European Union, with effect to all Member States and not only from the countries of the euro zone.
Border History:
The IBM Innovator acts in the second century of its existence
If you were looking for an appropriate word that IBM's strategy is the most precise characterised, then this might be the word "Longness".
For the wide public, IBM is the synonym for technological revolution, but it is known as a modern company, although it has already been spread a century since its creation.
The foundation of this longness has already put her first head - the Visionary Thomas J. Watson Sen.
He was very easy to solve the slogan, without a number of global problems, if people were ready to think a little.
His Slogan "Think!" was so on the brands to play the life of the future Ginging (and at the same time as the title of the firm journal that IBM began in 1935).
This was also the basis of the prepared company culture of Watsen.
"For us from IBM, this long-term thought means a continuous movement in the future.
IBM survive and therefore was successful in a whole century, because his principles remained faithful and not forbidden to change all others.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that we're creating more in the next hundreds," said Samuel J. Palmisano, the current Director of the company, an explanation of the Jubileeum.
Periodic System
Watson has already operated in the thirty years of its employees social affairs - similarly as the company Baća in the Czechoslovakia: The IBM leaders had paid vacation as one of the first American employees, a insurance by the undertakings more eleganter units as working clothing and an overwhelming removal system for best new and feeders.
Genuso excluded are also the long-term relationships of IBM with their customers.
The company was from the beginning of general in the Talent Promotion - as one of the first undertakings worldwide had any discrimination - and could therefore be searched.
In accordance with this anti-discrimination strategy, the current plan that the palmisman is changed on the scene of IBM next year by a woman, by Virginia Romatty.
It is for thirty years in IBM until she took the position of the Vetriebs, Marking and Strategy finger.
In the past few years, IBM has grown many future strategies and innovations.
No wonder - ideas are enough, in the company is almost a half million people employed.
A institution with a good call
Her unfair position in the Business ensures the company a strong image and this after inside and outside.
"At the beginning IBM had the concept of an institution, as a blow-based technology undertaking," said the Economist professor of the Harvard Business School and the author of a book on IBM, Rosabeth Mos Canter.
"IBM is not technology undertaking, but a company that helps business problems with supporting technology," added George Colony of Consulting Firma Forrester Research.
As the company itself stresses, it is a difference to be present only on the market or to directly form it through this presence.
IBM, in the states of their logos because of the Family Big Blue, has grown in one of the world's biggest companies.
It is one of the most different technologies – IBM developed equipment and software, infrastructures, hosting and consultation services in an unbelievable product width - from servers to the nano technology.
From all American technology undertakings, IBM has most patients and five of his employees have been designed with the Nobel Price.
For its most known findings, such as bank cards, credit cards, financial warps, Structure code or the discette.
With approximately 220 milliards of dollars, IBM was the second largest technology undertaking (as Apple), which was first transferred to Microsoft since 1996.
Quit the view
Not all the products and innovations had been unfortunately shocked by customers from today, for example, attempt with the own operating system OS/2, the online-Service Prodigy or also the IBM PC.
"Business based on the front movement, so you must not be emotionally bound to the past", says Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore IBM has no problem to build its basic walls on different platforms and if they do not work to leave them again.
In contrast to the counter player Microsoft, which is in the principle with its Windows operating system.
Successful technologies
The benefits of IBM participate in most services, software and equipment are part of a fifth.
In 1990, the insurance was the most strongest of more than 50 percent.
Since 2000, IBM had little gained asset in the value of 15 billion dollars, but it invested 58 billion dollars in the sale of asset technologies.
In these investments, IBM continues after 2008, when the new new financial crisis was the first time as a world-wide tour.
IBM also lived in the memory of his first head Thomas J. Watson faithu, which increased its capital of investment in the middle of the great world economic crisis.
Today, IBM seems to be overcoming the current crisis.
The value of IBM assets increased ratioously since 2008 by 120 percent and the reception of the company continued to increase.
The IBM company logans: everything can change - not only the values.
Therefore, this flexible guest can also be expected to demonstrate the next crisis.
IBM History: Thumbscreens in World Flights
The company IBM founded for a hundred years ago in New York (International Business Machines) had first a legally complexed name - Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name of the IBM she overlooked before 1924, was originally a brand name for a relief in Canada and South America.
The IBM's foundation for the later society was the fusion of four companies whose story is returned to the 80s of the 19th century.
They consider technologies, such as the famous stech card numbers for registration of work and ends.
The architect of this new company was Charles Ranlett Flint, who also had the presidency in 1930.
And it was Flint, who set the chief of the competitive manager Thomas J. Watson to help him at the management of the company.
This leader then has even put the reasons of IBM in the shadows - on Watson's ideas to this day, the unfair culture and identity of the company.
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, began, as the name has been sent, with the manufacture and distribution of all possible machines for trade, from wrest and cocks, to coffee.
In the first four decades in which Watson led the company, he doubled their wages at nine million dollars and the company expanded after and after all continents.
Watson was so unbelievable for the company that he sat in the headquarter forty years before he was released from his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
IBM began to work in the development of artificial intelligence and also developed the first programme language.
In the 60s, IBM's technicians and computers of NASA flights helped to lead all – to Merkur and Sturns and in 1969 also the famous air of humans to the moon.
Subsequently, IBM developed in 1964 the first computer family with the same computer architecture - the IBM System/360 series.
A classic PC, which was the computer standard of that time, occurred on the market in 1981 under the name of IBM 5150.
For twenty years later, IBM explained its computer production to the Chinese society Lenovo, but otherwise she bought the consultant part of the Pricewaterhouse Coopers company and grew full and fully in the business with consulting services and services with high more value.
The IBM strategy in the last three years is the concept "Smarter Planet".
It makes the intention of implementing technologies in a skillful manner that are not even planned, for example, to improve the situation in transport and town management.
In the trade sector, IBM has initiated the platform "Smarter Commerce" that would help the leaders to the whole commercial cycle.
IBM also has a strong story in Czech.
In 1932, IBM founded a decline in Tschoslovakia, mostly the first country in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ◆R is also involved in a strategic outsourcing center in Brussels.
The central for Mediterranean and Eastern Europe is located in Prague, and there is also a top research team of world-level, which is involved in the technology of vote disappearance.
Darina Rychtáćová over her unbelievable guests:
Iveta - this don't have to keep you, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtáćová (53) says - Now it's finish!
After her marriage Josef Rychtá (53) was made by the defender of Iveta Bartošová (45), Darina remained the hope that Josef was waiting for his royal dream and coming home.
But now it is finally ended with suffering, and she has set clear rules for another life.
"Josef can come home, but not more than my partner," said D. Rychtá 周ová.
When Darina Rychtá had commanded the Sänger I. Bartošová in her own house flee, you mightn't even fall into the dream as it comes to her husband.
When Iveta's on her dances went out after 30 days and returned to íčany, Josef went with him.
Yes, he even knew that he loved her.
With the time resigned Darina, even it seemed to be if she wanted to promise with her unbelieving man - but now she gave him the passport finally.
Rychytá, it doesn't matter with who his wife sleeps
If Rychtá月 Iveta Bartošová in the future, then he will certainly receive not open poor home.
"He is the biological father of my dreams, and if he wants to decide his days in our common house, I will not leave him out."
"Now, not as the loved, defended old ear, but as a man to whom I have yet had some bindings," said Mrs. Rychtá 周ová; but she also said, she has already disappeared of him emotionally and bested by mutual responsibilities.
The intention that Darina had shot the backway, Josef is taking with an orange.
"The decision of my wife I respect."
"I'm staying together with Iveta and nothing changes."
"My wife wants a paper- and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of the repairs, the garden, the ground, I make the purchases."
"Mit Darina, I'm very normal, only we don't share the bed even", said J. Rytteá (the sheet) Blesk.
If Darina wants to look for a new love, he doesn't want to move it.
"We're not sleeping together, so I'm worried if she's got a friend or who it's.
I'm obvious that it's my fault, I loved Iveta and therefore I'm taking any responsibility.
The worst female Unturns: How is it with you?
If you invite the men to call some typical female inconsistents, then they are improving some immediately from the pitcher.
Beloved women, do you recognize yourself again in the following lines in which we leave a few of the revues that give men the blood into the sight?
Income search
Should they have their gate to be a shot?
Do you have to buy at least one hair?
Are you pleased to buy and can it be a little more in actions?
Then it's really about a weakness in your case.
Some women are at least aware of their skills and try to keep their wage losses half ways.
But the hand on the heart, what woman has already to look for a good top clothing only through a clothes and not even all (in all possible colour combinations) in the kibine?
Even though the sale for most women is a hobby, the men is often the clean hell.
You know how often they said to her husband...
Permanent Unfriendly
"I'mn't I too cut?"
"I have to take at least five kilo - I should start to make jogges or gymnastic?"
"I'm gonna hurt you all?"
Does it come to them?
Yeah?
Then you may also be the women who are regularly regarding how they are.
This does not mean long that you have to go, but many men replied allergicly on when their wife is constantly worried about her appearance.
The stronger gender is one - with increased frequency of the offences, women are always more uncontracted.
Order and cleanness at first place
It's a fight against wind moons.
Turn windows, flowers and powders, which are swearing - and this is at least two times in the week.
Smoke with her partner, because he's back with smooth shoes on the sweet flowers, you've shot the children, because the smooth smoke is now dry again, and because the glass door in the living room has again fingerprints, where do the police makes so many smokes?
If you lead this kind of "Devianz", then you should know that you can do nothing and not stand at the first places in the family life.
This faultless cleanness can finally also cause mutual relations, and especially the peace in the family.
Styles
"Threen Turnhosen come into the shoes card."
"Do you really want to get the old sucks tomorrow?"
"A naked hand isn't easy on the footballs."
If your partner is set out such a tirade, you don't wonder that you bring it to the palms.
Of course, that's not bad, but they just want that's all his order.
If the men know that, then the women may not have so much megared.
Clash and Tract
Some women like to knock and push, where they are knocked or disappointed in the back.
Women are now focused on relations, so they like to translate such topics, like - who, where, with whom, such as and why.
Well, every woman of us has a little damage and shot on camp.
The hand on the heart - that's probably all the women own.
However, this is not to change the most pleasant calibers, with which nothing and no one is holy, who are likely to disagree each in their environment and represent a significant danger for women's elections.
Jágr and Voráček helped Philadelphia with their assistants to the victory
The Eishockeys Turm Jaromir Jágr was at the summer game of NHL with two major assistants at 5:3-Seg of Philadelphia on the ice in Carolina and is therefore again the productive twice player in the NHL.
The user of the overview of the thirty-year Eishockeystar was in both cases, Claudi Giroux, which was still added to a assistance and was called to the best player of the Matches.
Two assistants in the same game also described Jágr's player Jakub Voráček.
Jágr confirmed after the game of journalists, he has a great evening prophecy.
"That's before the game I'm telling him that he's a hattrick today."
I felt that in my feeling."
"He and again gets a feeling like this," Jágr said, after his action, Giroux already made a gate at the first scene of the Flyers.
A little later, the second meeting also had " a Tskish pipe".
Preáček fought behind the gate of the Hurricanes and set him between the rounds of the successful maximum Talbot.
A second before the abolition of the first third, the home player Patrick Dwyer obtained a Short-Hander, but the second third then were the flyers.
Concert Giroux.
In cooperation with Jágr, he reached its third meeting, then wayne Simmonds leaving the fourth gate.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't want to say he's the best player of the Liga, but he's supposed to be the best three," Jágr worth his center.
"I wouldn't fall into life to end my carrier with a Eishockey player, like with him."
"I'm glad."
"I turn my game to me."
"All the years in the NHL my players put their game on me, and now the speech moves on," Jágr bowed.
Carolina played again to the Drama - through the division of Tuoma Ruutua and again Dwyer, who carried out of a penalty, came down to a gate.
Matt read but prevented any other complication in which he was in the number two against one successful.
"Outlined Pronger acted yet in our area."
"He knew the pock, I took the trip up and (read) went to remove the pops."
"I tried to meet him, and I'm glad that it's over it," said Voráč, the last meeting of the party out of his view.
With this victory, Philadelphia took place in the street of the East Conference.
The Tshuch player of Montreal Jaroslav âpaček was dismissed in the game against Buffalo and was held in the second third part because of an offence on the head.
The Candys besides their learning Beck also have a leading in the Penalty Schnitt 2:3.
One of the crimes couldn't transform Tomáš Plekanec.
More than the lost points were likely to hurt the trainer of the homemanship, the high case of disease in the defence - the game they only played with five defence players.
"It's bad."
"The congratulation played only with one learned player, the rest of the young players."
"But there is nothing to do so we have to be done," said James Martin.
"To every way, we had nothing to do with the other."
"We had to make the game easier and get the pock out of our third."
There were still books here," said P. K. Subban, one of the players.
The Czech Tortue Ond月ej Pavelec turned thirty shoes from Tampa Bay and was so valuable to 5:2-Seeg over Winnipeg.
At the gates of the Jets, who had a series of five grounds, had five different protectives.
Development of travel prices since 1989
Before 1989, there were only five pledges of State travel officers: ◆edok, sports tourists, CKM, Reccrea and Auto tourists.
The travel officers were also sold only to the socialist countries in the Westlock countries, which were only elected in the West.
And so the Tschech tourists live to the eastern sea (in the German Democratic Republic - the DDR), in the Soviet Union (Sotschi on the Halbinsel Crime on the Black Sea), Bulgaria and Romania towards the Black Sea and Hungary.
A light exception was during the period from 1962 to 1972, as you were traveling to Yugoslavia, then the Jugoslawia was slaughtered to a nearby-west course and so the travels to Yugoslavia were strongly limited.
A large paradox of those socialist times was that there were not even citizens of the Eastlock (or Tschoslovakia) to travel in the framework of the socialist countries.
For example, if a citizen of the RESSSR wanted to travel individually to Poland or even to the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise could not be possible.
The travel officers also offered travels to the west, but then you had to take great shoppings in buy or even in the bedsack before the travel office, or at least have "good knowing" in the travel office.
That was not even a long time ago.
The Devise Addition - the condition for a trip in the Western - was divided only "politicly relied" people - the others who were still not traveling.
The Czechoslovakian currency was not a free driving currency, without discretion assets would therefore be impossible to bring the necessary financial resources (west currency) for a travel to the West.
The most cups therefore consumed their holidays in the country, no wonder that the Czechs had bought the unnumbered weekdays and dates - a nature that remains to this day.
The same revolution of 1989 followed a travel revolution of the Czech on the feet.
During 1989, a vacation in DDR or Bulgaria was the measure of all things, the Czech in the past year of 4,5 million of their foreign holidays in the world.
A manager paradox, which has not been aware of today, is the fact that you have not been able to travel over 1989 because it was part of the timely Yugoslavia.
In addition to the beginning of the 1990s of the past century, the devise obligation was highlighted in the nearby Western European countries, which has highlighted a huge flood of short visits to Vienna in Austria and Germany.
Tschechoslovaks could not get enough long of their journeys to the West, at least a few days to be there.
Tschech tourists slept at the travels to Paris in the park, for who had already lived the money for accommodation in the hotel or in a pension.
A typical character in the foreign routes of Chechen was at the same time a conservative, bier and long-term space, etc. full-packed carrier room.
Another important milestone was the establishment of the free circumstanced Czech krone – after decades, our tourists could finally sell the West currency.
Our life level and also the average employees have increased what was in a further important moment in 1997.
Thanks to the increased demands on trips, the travel officers began to regularly prepare travels by charter flights, so that the aircraft can be conducted incrediblely in comparison with the past.
The end of the 1990s, the Tschechs, excluding the United States, had already devised payment in the world with all high developed countries, which made more easier the trips.
For a further interesting moment in the history of the "post-amitiate" trip, it was in 2000, due to the high demand of the first direct charter flight in an exotic country - to Thailand.
Similarly all year direct charter flows with Tschech’s passengers in far away lone countries; in this year, there are 12 exotic destinations directly flowing from Czech.
Czech travels annually in exotic countries!
Another significant view in the Epoche, which marked our 'post-revolutionary' development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States had the visa obligation to Tschech tourists, and our country was definitively involved among the high-level developing countries.
In 2008, Tschechs were first used more than half of their vacation in the foreign country (50.3%) and first in their story they gave for a single holiday stay included the costs at the holiday place more than 15 Tsd. CZK per head.
The Main Meeting will find a new presidency - again a patt.
For about five months, the Czech Foodball has not been presidency, and it is likely that the followers of Ivan Hašek will not even be known at the side of the Tschech Foodball Trade (FA月R) after the extraordinary Master Meeting on Thursday in Nymburk.
Today, there is no agreement on which choice regulation should be chosen.
And without this, there is no vote on the three potential follow-ups.
Three interests want to manage the Tskish football - Jindich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
In June Hašek turned back from his function, requesting his colleagues at the departure to find some and a strong personality that could lead the football in the future.
Only - in the medie to Hašek the old quarrels between the two bandrooms that cannot be able to be a common candidate.
This showed click and clear on 16 September when the new President should be selected.
The Delegates of the Main Meeting were fully in the Prager Viertel Smíchov house, because the negotiation was conducted to no result and it was not only for the election itself.
There is no doubt that some of the people who are actually complained at the full congregation could have been in fact, only the customs representatives, or also the functional officers that were undertaken with a full comprehensive.
In this single point, at least a part of an agreement was made, including the recommendation of the Institute for State and Law, whose opinion was not placed on a full-based basis.
However, the fight against the election regulation continues.
The Executive Committee also did not give any clarity to the matter, at which meetings, whether ordinary or extraordinary, in the principle, is nothing else in the agenda.
Even though the opinions in relation to the election have changed a few times - the Neuralgean point remained the same.
The question is: How should you go in the 3th round to avoid a patt situation?
"The fight point focuses the question whether you should go in accordance with the terms or need to be found a whole other model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three expert Chairpersons of the FAELLR, who are present in the management of the Professional FADERR.
According to the added model, the third round of the candidate, which receives the greatest proportional support in the room for which it is candidate.
Masters are obviously ready to enter into the compromise that the candidate receives the higher number of votes from two rooms.
The Czech side reiterates the condition that the winner receives at the percentage of this stimmy number at least a two-third level.
"Therefore, the two projects have no sense any more, this mode would put the whole two-camber concept in question," Svoboda understands the interiors of the master side which starts best to add the choice regulation, but to choose, according to a valid settlement.
It is also surprised that Tomáš Paclicik is also described that the customary election regulation of all candidates is most likely to meet the Pelta.
"My desire is that it will be elected widely after the meeting."
"To not be exempt uncertainly variations, such as at the last Main Meeting," said the owner (the football clubs) Victoria Plze, who canded at the first time in his opinions against the Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
His opinion will be known in Nymburk to the new President and he believes that the candidates will also work constructively.
"The possible qualification of the national partnership for the football EM today would contribute to the reproach of the humor."
"When the football is only on the euphoric wages, then it is also greater for cooperation," said the functioner of Jabway, who contributes the greatest experience of all three adoptions, and it is both at professional and regional levels.
Rajchl's still back.
"I hope an agreement, but the situation is unfortunate."
"It's no thing between people from poems and gentlemen, but there's some effort to offer the rules to their own purposes "to be right".
"Therefore a new blocking is not excluded at the main meeting."
"I hope, however, that the healthy understanding finally does," said Rajchl.
Only - a lot of time to accept all pages is not left.
Some negotiations should probably be played directly in Montenegro, but who knows whether football generality will be completely complete.
The charter flight, with which Dalibor Kučera and Rajchl fly to Podgorie, couldn't start on the morning in Prague because of technical disappearance, and so it was kindly looking for a changed change, such as a part of the Executive Committee, but still to the exhibition of the Barrage-Hinn game.
Finally, the meetings on ministerial levels are likely to be held in the mid-eight.
Josef Dobeš, the Minister of School, Youth and Corporate Employment, would like to move the patent parties within the largest sports party of the country to agree.
In fact, it is a lot of the game: State contributions, the confidence of the Czech football and the active main meeting of the STV, which will show the Czech sport after the financial problems of Sazka, the new direction.
Paclik is in the fight around the position of the President, because he does not see any appropriate candidates
If Tomáš Paclík, the Chief of the Pilsner footballs had been able to make a strong candidates before the extraordinated Main Meeting, who would have fulfilled all his proposals on the new Chairpersons of the Czech Republic (FA月R), he would not, on the basis of the fight for this stage.
"If it would be a good adviser, then I'd fight for him and look at the choice."
"But in the current situation it did not have to find such adoptions," said Paclík ◆TK.
The main reason for Paclik, in Duell with Miroslav Pelta and Jindćich Rajchl, is therefore to prevent the pleasant favorites of the election, Pelta, at the street of the FA月R.
Paclik also emphasized that in the case of his victoire, he would remember the function of the President only one year, so until 2013, until the end of the ordinary main congregation.
In the position of the Chairman, he would like to see a top manager who is not too thrown into the football chain.
"I've spoken personally to some of the people coming in question."
"I can believe that some told me, they wanted not to identify the Czech football.
"It would like to change the opinions," he added.
Most of all, Paclicik is the connection with the Pelta's President of the Pilsner Becirksball Congress Roman Berbr, a man with a controversal call that applies to the backs as a powerful lobbyist, with the ability to affect delegated agreements on the main meetings.
For Paclik, it is uncertain that Pelta had the position of the President.
"Before his victory, the present state would be reserved, and in the Czech football it wasn't over."
"The support by Berbr, a famous businessman, with the football doubles badly," said Paclik.
He also stressed that the Pelta's name has falled before some time in connection with the phone hearings for the admission in a corruption case, but the pelta has been freely criminal.
"I don't know what best a victory of Pelta should take to the (tc.) football."
"And how we would be in the eyes of the UEFA and FIFA," said the Teenager Paclik, who was his previous exhibition, "which will sell the Pilser's football club when the Pelta will be President," but he sees something else.
If the patients are in the Thursday selection, it may, however, be able to present a future cooperation with the pilty.
Genauso also thinks another candidate - Rajchl, who supported the patient before the Main Meeting in October, who ended with a Fiasko.
"He (Pelta) would be the first I would go."
"He's got great capabilities."
"I could present him well as the chief of the National Managing."
"If I don't think he is able to manage the connection as a manager."
"I don't have my nest in cases I don't understand anything," Paclík said in September, "when he had assigned to survey that he was after the removal of the Seed Guids Committee with Lue'k Macela on the street replaced by Dagmar Damková.
The patient itself claims that he feels growing the role of the President of the connection.
And he is also head of Pilsen, who worked the first triumph in the Liga's first triumph since the past summer.
"I have the power to change something in the football mile and to contribute to a certain culture of this."
"To determine certain interest groups that have to affect Disziplinar and Professional Committees, which is sorting up to the situations of certain interests," Paclik, which does no heat of his anti-pathia, for example, against the Sparta-Cept Daniel K月etínsý.
As one of his priorities, he advises the determination of relations between the FARENR and the Czech Olympia Committee, with which he would help the politicians to lobby more money from the lottery tax in the sport.
"There is one of the key things that the new President should take place."
"If it comes to control the lucky games, how the political parties explain, I understand their argumentation, but they must also be clipped and clear where the money goes," he said.
His connection to the Pilsner Klub does not even look like a handicap, although he himself stresss that the President of the FA月R should be "partly".
Pelta is back bound with Jablonec, Rajchl with Prager Ducla.
"It's not just an ideal."
"It's not even a lot of sense of translating my acts in the Pilsner Club to a third person to return after half years," she said.
Pelta has discussed new sessions of the FA月R, which will result in the future.
Two days before the heading of the football meeting, one of the candidates for the Chairman, which is Miroslav Pelta, he will make himself strong in the case of his election to get a new status in the future, which excludes the election regulation.
The functioner of Jabḍa has been confident before Thursday in Nymburk and believes that the election campaign will be safely enhanced in a possible success of the Tsychen selection.
Pelta had already promised before the unrealised election in September, he wanted to concentrate on national partnership and the benefit of financial resources.
He decided only to participate in the election before the last Main Meeting and therefore helped him to protect his views on the management of the football and in a wide context.
"Over at all levels, the football, they are inadmissible and therefore are expected that the Chairman is known on Thursday."
"He feels that it's the highest time that the bond is leaded to someone, means the man who is mainly connected to the Japonecer Club, who also acted in Sparta and in the Executive Committee for many years.
He also believes that he has sufficient experiences to lead the Czech football.
He is convinced that today's problems with the election are responsible for the Euphorie that ruled by Ivan Hašek in time.
"Of the members of the Main Meeting in June, they were accepted, as they were adopted, in the main meeting.
If they had not allowed different statements, we would have already been a presidency since September," said Pelta.
The revision of the main document of the civil agreement was used as a lock fund for the delegations.
"If I am Chairman, then I take it personally, and I am ready to take personal responsibility if it doesn't fit."
"It's a principleal thing without which he can't be," said Pelta.
In addition, he did not try to limit himself against his continents.
He had announced that he could present cooperation with Jindich Rajchl, which he recognized because of his legal education, and he was well known that his sub-Canadad would be the first officer.
Today Tomáš Paclicik, he also did not take a long time, but he did not lay back to pelta.
He has been moved over a year in football and is already able to prove some success. "
"But his attacks were drawn down and many people were shocked from his election campaign."
"Therefore, now many of them are sure of his real character," said the Pelta to his continent who might be faithful to his declarations, which he already explained in September.
His view is the most strongest weapon the knowledge of the football of the lower game chain until the nationality.
And this should be the extension ship of Tsish footballs.
"I would also strive to end all the businesses from the Causa Bohemians to the recurrence of the corruption canal from the past year."
"I would then turn to negotiations with the private and State sector to ensure sufficient funds for the whole football," said the sixty-year candidate 周TK before two months.
At that time, he also declared that his income into the sides of the Tschech’s football would not mean personal shoppings.
"I must only trust the employment of all employees once again," said Strahov in direction, where, because of the long anarchie, it is significantly nervosity.
Despite the current catastrophical scenaries, who join the next heading meeting, he believes that the delegations will not go to Nymburk on Thursday.
"When you really have to be the only point of action, how you choose in the third round, we're going to go through."
"The football needs credibility and he won only back when he finally has a new leader," Pelta remains two days before the possible decisioning day of his functioning card.
Rajchl promises to start working under it
If the present Vice-President Jindich Rajchl should be elected at the main meeting on Thursday to the new Chairman of the Czech Republic's football bond, it would likely prevent many people in the bond.
Actually, Rajchl promises to start working in the case of his choice.
He wants to introduce system changes and to make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for each football area.
Furthermore, he spoke to solve the case of Bohemians to improve the relationship with UEFA and FIFA, to bring more money into the football and at least to continue the work that was started by the previous President Ivan Hašek.
"If the President, I want to take me to the football as a whole."
Starting from international contacts to UEFA and FIFA, on the national selection, the professional football, until the performance balance for youth."
"I don't want to say that I'm gonna do everything alone," Rajchl said in the conversation for the TK.
"I am a team player and I therefore want to distribute the competences in the Executive Committee so that each member has a certain area."
And I will distribute hard tasks so that the football will come forward in each segment with miles terms."
There would be no longer encouraging many, because she, instead of criticize others, should now start hardly," he added.
Through the critical atmosphere in the football movement, no longer candy.
"To me it's known that I'm working 20 hours a day."
"But I have to know that it makes sense and that people stand behind me who don't throw the ball between my feet and every step I do ask", said he as a declaration why he stopped.
"Most people told me that I don't need to repay, because others would be doing."
"There is trust that you can't play," he said.
It also motivates him to continue the work he started under Hašek.
"In two years, we've decided a great piece of work, and I'm not just going away."
"They have been started processes that may only come to implement in a few years and I would just see someone who stopped," he said and expressed his concerns for the case that the other candidate - Miroslav Pelta would choose that the situation could return to Hašek's time.
"I believe in systemic progress and that's something that Miek Pelta doesn't bring."
"Instead of him, all the people who would make the football so that he would only be elected for the election."
I'll be able to put some of the things, but not that I'm partly."
"I try to be Objective."
"I want football for all because it's all right and not only the election," said Rajchl.
He also resists the claim that he is just a president of the Czech.
"And if some people say the counterpart, I've really proposed to do the best possible for murderers."
"Emy example, it's time to consider whether the liga should not share in a Tskish and a mental part whose winners then fall into the first line."
"There couldn't happen that today only three men in the Liga play, which is especially a problem for young players in marrows," says Rajchl.
Because the Chief of Pilsner Clubs Tomáš Paclík has also concluded the fight for the function of the President, Rajchl is not to appreciate his opportunities to be chosen.
"I suffer strong support in the Czech Chamber, which has chosen me to be elected to her president and now recognized that clear success is followed to me," Rajchl, who also has taken part of the recovery of thirty million krones for non-profit treaties, the agreement of telecommits and the negotiations on the lottery law as his success.
On the other hand, it is the fault that the bond does not go to a single race.
While he says by Pelta, "It's disqualified from beforeward to help the Czech football to a new trust," he holds the second rival - the patient for a strong candidate that has actually offered the football.
"No one can ask that he has worked in Pilsen in only one year extraordinary work."
"If it is chosen, then he would have continued to make the things that Ivan Hašek has introduced and also the personal order in the Commissions would, obviously, would not change fundamentally."
He wouldn't want to give the things to his favor," said Rajchl over his rivals.
Europe Best Pools
Blue playing
From Julia Stanek
Planets in Ufo Optic, Prunkpools in Budapest: He who travels through Europe can live its blue wonders - and after a city tour or a change, the blue knocks in spiders.
A book shows where Wellness is the most beautiful in the water.
When Iris Meder went to search trials in the past half years, one in her pack was not missing: her bathroom.
Backing on the water, she looked up in artly designed coffees, she dreamed to Marmor potatoes who waited for them at the cockboard, and smelled over ascriptively restored youth skills.
Without a bathroom, she took it in her notice book - with scientific details about the construction and history of the building.
More than 200 architecturists found in this way - and now it presents in their rightly book "Badreuden" before: Populary Swimming pools in Munich, historical bathrooms in the Blackwald, "Hardcore beton buildings" in the Taunus.
By 13 countries, she visited its "Reis to the most extremely buses in Central Europe": Near Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she visited places in Italy, France, Czechya, Slovakia, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and each city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old German is a real bathroom enthusiastin.
With sport she doesn't have a lot on the hot, says Meder - only in the water is the other.
Crazyly, weapons must be discovered with blue kachels and Chlorgestank, while Jogger can smile in the park of fifth birds or glad birds.
"I asked for a day why weirds have to be so hot," said the Mader in Vienna.
"Then I began to gather beautiful bottles."
Water surface doubled architecture
The wellness factor in bottles is therefore so large because all the senses are used to be meddle.
And if the builders have made a mush, weapons can be a true eyemate: "The rest of a footboden has a water area in bowls."
"It's one of the ones awesome, reflecting the beauty of the whole building."
Everything is doubled optically: high weight, bunching kitchens, swimming pieces.
The small formated image band "Badefreuden" reports on 190 pages knowledge values about the architecture and cultural history history of historical wellness - but especially makes pleasure to a spread in blue.
Noteful examples discovered Polar Sammines Meder in their research in Hungary.
Besides pretty healing beverages, such as the 100 years old Szechenyi-Bad in Budapest, they found a nitrate water in an original cardhole (soil bathroom in Miskolac-Tapolca) and a thermal bathtub which is filled with alkalistic water and found in a flash building (Városi Termálpredö in Jászberény).
spectacular views offer many beloved free buses in Switzerland and Austria: while you have the whole city of the Swiss bathroom in the eye, you can look at the outdoor pool of a bathroom in St. Anton on the snow-sneaked Arlberg - and: There is a window in which you can watch the train on the ski piste.
This may be the most extreme pool design waiting for bathrooms in long territory: The Aquadome last looks out as a exactly landed Ufo in the Alpes.
From three after upper scals it falls in the winter, while the mountains of the last rise into the sky.
Alhambra at Blackwald
Not in each swimming bathroom, the pool-saminers grew up with the shoes of Chlor into the nase.
Many thermal bottles travel to Schwefel, in the Árpád Bad in the Hungarian Békescsaba, it is so strong to heiz oil that you are not believed to be landed in a healthy bathroom.
The smoke comes from the alkali-hydrogen hydrogen water that is almost black and its clothes lives on the hair, so when you can go into the clothes - a wellness experience of the special kind.
However, Iris Meder was discovered on her search for beautiful bathrooms: When she wanted to visit the free and sun bathroom in the Czech Bad Luhatschowitz, they found a closed terrace.
The 1902 architect Dušan Jurkovic was closed by Bad.
As the middle of a look through the polluted window of the red-weiß-wheel-flowing youth tree, she seemed it as uncrated among the flowers.
The accident has occurred in a swimming swimming pool in the Black Wald: the Palais Thermal in Bad Wild Bad.
Three Baufasen has already been behind this bathroom; you can not only discover the neuromany elements from the time of its creation in 1844 but also be a maurian hall in the Alhambra style that has been added around 1900.
Since the dedicated modernization of 1995, the Palais Thermal is the favorite bathroom of the Pool-Kennerin Iris Meder - and not only because it is originally out of the blackwald.
"It's already a performance to raise so different building style to a so great unit," says Meder.
In such a palace, the tauchgang in the thermal pool is only to be near.
Land speculation
German Bank allows the light of road materials
From Christian Teevs
The German Bank's business with agricultural materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has made a working group to check the impacts of the speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the consequences will take the consequences.
Hamburg -
For federal busers, it is clear: 84 percent of the Germans are not acceptable according to a study that banks with agricultural road materials such as weights or but speculation.
Two thirds of the requested are to ensure that the German bank and other credit institutions are encountered from this business because the problems of the world's officers are disappointed.
This is the result of a Forsa question in the task of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented by the Foodwatch mid October.
This shows the author Harald Schumann that the rates in the global fuel browsers bring the prices to the height, and therefore the banks have a debt in the world of hunger.
The consumer campaign has been treated concretely against German-Bank-Chef Josef Ackermann, even if large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley.
Originally, the provisions of road materials were considered to decrease hampers against price deficiencies.
However, most experts agree that the zockers have associated with offers and demands - and make the costs of the guests.
Otherwise, as the US concurrents responded to the criteria, he spoke to check the pre-reviews and said that there was no business to "value the good call of the German Bank to play."
According to the information of SPIEGEL ONLINE, a international working group is currently checking the prejudices from the Foodwatch Report.
Until the end of the year, the test will be completed, then the results will be presented to the term of the German Bank - simultaneously as the recommendation to be done.
In the end of January, the bank's spectrum wants to share what results it affects.
Finally, a reduction of the heat farm could be in place or even the complete return.
Ackermann is based on his image
Foodwatch-Chept Thilo Bode welcomed the message, but in conjunction with his critics in the financial sector: "The weight on growing prices of food shows particularly drastic, how without consideration banks today damage."
Ackermann grows as the top bankenlobbyist now, especially in the obligation.
"The German Bank must run all plants from its portfolio where money is used for food prices on food prices," said Bode.
"It's whether Mr. Ackermann is about hungers or the call of the German Bank."
The view of Ackermann is surprised on the first view, but it is clear that the conzerning of a few months before the end of his office wants to make a perfect image.
On Monday, the German Bank noted that the head would not be changed in the Surveillance Council.
With a decrease from the overwhelmed agricultural speculation, he could assess his image.
And to make possible insufficients he needs to shot himself, so he would finally make his followers.
Any second would announce road equipment
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager.
Today, more than 300,000 internet users have participated in the organization campaign campaign.
On Sunday, the survey issued for which the Institute Forsa asked on 7 and 8 November 1001 people.
On the same time, eleven percent keeps it legitimate that the German bank plants are offered for food prices.
Many banks would also take personal consequences when they learn that their bank is involved in such businesss: each second would announce the survey of all plants in which money is financed in the road speculation.
43 percent would be advised by an such bank, 49 percent were allowed to think of announce their account and change to another Institute.
21 house in Wien
The surrounded Pavillon
From Ingeborg Wiensowski
A architectur history with highs, tips and Happy End: The Austrian World Exhibition Pavillon of Brussels in 1958 reached prices in Vienna to the Museum, stood empty and gained.
Now he's opening again as a exhibition house.
When modern post-born architecture is warranted, by clear forms, bright halls, moving weaks and new constructions that are typically for the faith in technical progress, the Austrian Palestine of the Architect Karl Schwanzer for the British World Exhibition in 1958 is an earliest and famous example.
Szenzers Pavillon had received the Great Prix d'Architecture for its easy and sweetly operating stahl building.
The construction shall apply as a milestein of time architecture to this day.
He made the architects so known that he also built the next world exhibition of Austrian Pavillon.
With its leading BMW-Verzylinder house, it was finally established in Munich in 1973.
As a temporary exhibition building, Pavillon was built after the world exhibition in the Swiss garden, building at the Wiener South Streethof and opened a museum of the 20th century - the "20's house" was called.
The building was not slowly and technically as a museum - no walls for the saving of the art, no good climate.
Nevertheless, it was used so long until the timely genetic art was received in Vienna a new house.
Since 2001 the building was empty and came more and more down.
Now the architect Adolf Crisanitz has built the Pavillon, he is now called "21 houses" and is used as a museum for the timely genesic art.
The service provider opens the Museum Belvedi, which is the house, there is the first exhibition - a case of lucky in every way.
The new engineer Agnes Husslein-Arco, who became a new director of Austrian Gallery Belveder in 2007.
Husslein-Arco, promoved Kuninfotorin with a well-known carrier, in the youth as ice as a smooth store, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as a creative director of the Museum of the Modern Salzburg, made the building backward to political and time-sufficients, she owned public resources and private spensorengels and sets the use.
Besides the present art, the works of the image Chauer Fritz Wotruba should be made by the same Institute, a coffee and a book load should be made and a office should be built.
Watching, small meat
The Crisis was then the ideal order for the implementation.
Not only because Joseph Olbrich's Secession has built and expanded the competition and gained the competition, but because he studied at the Technical University of Wien and the Pavillon was a "neverthean important place" in which he had seen the exhibitions every week.
He knew the urin and he knew the problems of the building, which had lost in his translation to Vienna and its use in greatness and easyness.
There were greater problems in this reconstruction: the building was a 'early energetic teacher', says Cristinaz.
The window profiles of the glass were exchanged, fixed glass of isolated glass and replaced the glass glass by special safety glass.
Further browsers are increased or replaced, and asbestos filled brackets were healed.
Two shots have place for the new use, a smooth light bulb between house and road guarantees the beating, a bucket leads to the entrance - almost a new construction, but still easy swimming poviolon.
The original outdoor doors are left, the house is shocked in the old rock protection colour.
And the Kinosal is even exactly exactly as he was before.
And all this under closer supervision of the Authority and with small food.
"Oft needed to be found a material that is good and quiet and also pleasant to the art protection company," says Cristina and grows on a smooth ground in the ground.
Despite all delays, problems and reconstruction, the building has remained flexible and easy.
If it was difficult with the Pavillon, "the from Brussels thenkam," Cristinas said shortly, a typical "Drop-in-the-City story".
So a architecture remains "ever in the wrong place" and it is still wanted to be "a correct consciousness."
In this case, the 21th house is not in the wrong place, because it has been a strong building case: For the Swiss garden around the whole new "Hauptbahn Court" quarter, with offices and living houses.
And another case of luck may be found: the 21th house could be able to enhance another cristantz, because Sammini Francesca of Habsburg has bought the Berlin's Temporary Kunsthall, and as you hear, it is already negotiated with the city for a vital location in the Swiss garden.
Bahn plant Winter crisis package in millions of heights
The train has equipped a crisis plan to prevent adjudications in the winter.
The number of employees should be doubled.
This costs millions.
In the fight against winter-sufficient affairs and repairs, the German train will be added to more than 70 million euros in this year.
The "Picture" recorded previously on an internal crisis plan to be provided for investments from about 300 million euros to 2015.
This should also be achieved in extreme behaviour of cars and railways.
In addition, an integration of internal and external employees are planned for the disappearance of the snow removal on rail plants and railways at 16,000 people.
The aim is to free railways to the start of operation and 90 percent of the necessity feeding within four to five hours from snow and ice.
Two months ago, Bahn-Chef Rüdiger's ring had also been shoted in this winter after a spring with government and industry before adjudication accidents and repairs.
In the past winter, the train had significant problems in the movement of persons because it lacked, among others, in difficult weather conditions, reservations.
Thus, numerous new regional duties for years are waiting for an approval of the railway partner.
Furthermore, there is a delay in the delivery of ICE duties.
The train also makes for years that it should make more often checking ICE acids in the workshop after a ICE has had an accentuation of accents in the CAT.
German Bank pays millions flights in the United States
After the tumult on Chef Josef Ackermann comes from the United States: The German Bank has to pay a million bus there.
As if the problems at home for the German Bank wouldn't be enough, the industry now also includes its past in the United States: the Frankfurter Institute pays in a comparison to $145 million (106 million) for combats because of the Pleite of five large co-sciency banks during the financial crisis.
It's on sale of Hypotheken papers.
The financial regulatory NCUA provides a whole series of large banks to have committed the common banks with false provisions to buy the financial products; they would have played the risks.
Those papers are lost during the financial crisis strongly and the banks are low.
"We are satisfied that we could solve the topic without having the parties to the court," said a German bank speaker in New York.
The Bank did not impose any fault in comparison.
This is also applicable for the citigroup obligation to pay $20.5 million.
The NCUA president Debbie Matz welcomed the revenue of the two money houses.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the US community banks and is engaged in plots to protect customer installations.
The NCUA is trying to replace the outstanding miljard damages.
The comparisons now closed are the first of their kind.
The Regulier was also precoced by other large banks and in the summer JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
The intermediate Hypotheken papers are so-called Mortgage-backed Securities.
These are home credits.
When the US is placed in 2007, this was a number of financial persons to defend.
In September 2008, at the level of the financial crisis, the US Investment Bank killed Lehman Brothers.
Even though the events have come back for several years, the banks are now wearing a dark wind in the United States.
Investors and supervision authorities have forced unnumerable devices to receive reproduct or degradation.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has solved the largest Boxwell.
It offers 18 international large banks to have overcome two US creditors of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in Hypothetics in the volume of approximately 200 billion dollars.
The German Bank also needs to be a case of the FHFA, and there is a number of businesses in the value of $14,2 billion from 2005 to 2007.
The supervisory authority requires that the Frankfurters for "substantial losses" are simply, however, without calling a exact sum.
The German Bank had rejected the requests as without holding and explained that they want to resolve.
Warren Buffect increases with 10 milliards at IBM
Financeguru Buffect invests strongly in IBM undertaking.
Since March, he bought more than ten billion dollars.
Before the great American investors Warren Buffect had always declared not to invest into IT and computer companies, since the long-term development of the companies is only bad.
But now he read the business reports of IBM and modified his opinion on investment in the industry.
He has already had to understand many of the fact that IBM offers services, especially for the computer systems of other undertakings.
An investment of Waren Buffect shall apply as a flower attack in the financial world.
As a result, IBM is now called "Sir IBM".
Because Buffect now enhanced CNBC's CNBC company that he bought 10.7 billion dollars since March IBM.
His investment interest Berkshire Hathaway is therefore a 5 percent of the most actionnaires of IBM with a share of 5,5 per cent.
Buffect said that even IBM had not recognized anything of the commitment.
He blessed the management itself in the economic crisis for ordinary benefits.
"You've done a great job," Buffect said to the strategy.
IBM takes for a long period of time to the luxurious IT services such as the operation of accounting centers.
The more than 100 years old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as the performance of companies.
Buffect had missed technology persons until the time.
He says he's only investing in the company whose business he's also understanding.
Instead, Buffect packs about a curve railway, in a smoker producer or machine fabriker.
His Holding Berkshiire Hathaway is also along about 80 own daughter nurses, such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former München's back.
The 81-year-old had received the small textile mark Berkshire Hathaway and built it with low investments to one of the most valuable enterprises of the world.
Yet, his style of life is divided.
This is why he is for unnumerable teachers around the world.
His almost unlawful sense for money service introduced him the name "Orkel of Omaha".
Following the Buffect Investment, IBM’s action has increased a percentage.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, it is valued at the barrier over $220 billion, and it counts together with Apple and Microsoft to the most valuable technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, he said the Buffect, but he wouldn't want to get in.
Forward Bill Gates, you're a friend.
The threat is crucial
After the discovery of the Zwickauer cell, the Turkish media in the German jurisdiction.
A newspaper says of a "blood ideology" that is now rescued.
The murder of eight species and a Greek small undertaking in the year 2000 to 2006 had a legal extremic background.
This message is reacted with fear and concern in Turkey and in the German Turkish population in Germany.
For for many German Turkes, a longly confidence pending returns: Since Brands in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there has no comparable violence with legal extremist background.
That is in Germany foreign confidence, however never stands in question.
However, the discovered legal extermist network shows extensions whose size is not yet uncertainable.
"Is the black ideology again?" titled the internet exhibition of the Turkish magazine "Hberturk".
The "Sabah" magazine stresses that one of the ones should be a V manager of the constitutional protection, and is concerned that the German authorities may also have been developed in the jurisdictional summary.
The Turkish Communities in Germany reacted: She remembered a mass watch before the Brandenburg Tor to the victims of racisist violence.
On the first two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin had thought together with German and Turkish politicians in a festival of the fifth Year of the German-Turch Accwer Agreement.
In joyful colors, it was insulined together - as a story of success.
As an earliest acts as the report reporting of some Turkish media: "The Netherlands's gift for the fifthth" is the title of a article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", which refers to the basis of the murder series.
Germany's expenditure of the "Currency" is not able to get this actual connection.
"It begins to stink," says the title of the column of Ahmet kilahci.
He stressed that people are murdered, paying taxes and have provided an important contribution to Germany's reconstruction.
Only critically, in German Turkish Internet Forens the action of the police and its later success is discussed.
Why not the German authorities have been more higher than looking for the extractive environments in the legal environments, the authors are wondering.
Some are at least ready to drastic resources: "We continue here, so the migrants remain nothing else than self-defence and weapons."
"There will be the best self protection."
"For the goodness of the declaration and fear of the extension of the whole network, the internal peace in Germany is very strong."
What it means, if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mulls and Solnces in the ninety-year-old years have defended.
The photo of Solingen's brand rain is deep in German and Turkish memory.
Since there was no other event showing the live Turks here clearly that there is a crucial threat, and the Germans, that missile and distance could be able to be in the legal violence.
However, the approaches have shot our feelings on Turkish side.
Do not repeat past errors
In the Turkish press, it was particularly noted that the allegations of the German policy had been made after the suggestions: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survival of Milles.
Following Solingen’s Brandan attitude, he sent a board to the Turkish State presidents, but he was invented by his outer minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel said that he had the words of how many debts were given to the green gates.
As if the value of a person is calculated after the height of his tax expenditures.
The current report reporting of Turkish media reveals how deep the unbelievable confidence of many German tours in the green legal state.
Besides the efforts of a comprehensive declaration and revaluation of the legal extreme terrorism in Germany, it is now necessary open words.
The Scanning Bank of the Serbian
The most famous bank of Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
The UBS went into the financial crisis nearly wheel and slowed by a crisis in the next.
Now it should be a German.
It wasn't like that Axel Weber.
After his spectacular decline of the Federal Bank, he was known in July 2013 that he would have an unexpected and luxury work as well as spectcular: the Administrative Council of the Swiss Great Bank of the USBS, an unexpected and luxurious carrier territory.
Axel Weber felt publicly, the Switzerland commended her beauty and the UBS for its new winning solidity and gave friendly comments on the future colleagues.
"The UBS has made the tournament."
"I'm glad to cooperate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
However, in September, it was clear that everything would happen.
A guest of the UBS in London had moved all the secure systems of the bank and over 1,7 billion euros.
UBS-President Oswald Grübel, not only a banker in Switzerland.
The Administrative Council of the UBS also applies to as proposed - and all ask: When is Axel Weber finally coming?
Weber's bank in February 2012 has been recognized that it was possible to advise the bank.
And the Governing Council Presidency has already taken part in May 2013, as the Bank had participated on Sunday.
For Axel Weber, it'll be hard.
He was not a banker, but the economic professor and notes' bankers, and would have safely needed a processing time.
With a bit, he then takes the responsibility of the bank's strategy, which once again proved that it's the title of the Great Scandal Bank of Europe.
Since the UBS is a great part of the world, until shortly she was the greatest manager of the world, and shoots the other part for years from a scanal in the next.
Nothing, it seems that the one remains so proud Swiss bank.
It started in the financial crisis.
By 2007, the UBS had an excellent call.
The image of the emerging and solid, but also equipped Swiss manager had combined her with enormous objectives: she also wanted to become a great number in the investment bank.
So the UBS 2007 managed on one side with $1,6 Billions more money for customers than each other bank of the world.
And on the other hand, she was pre-impressed as a bank of investment in the Liga of the world's largest banks.
That made an impression.
The other banker and later year-year-old prosecutor in Zurich Hans Geiger tells: "My students have always set the UBS as a model of a good bank."
"In this view, you're asking me how could I just miss me?"
He was crazy.
In 2007, there was a remark in the UBS for the first time.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli was surprised, who believed as a high-intellectual and also genial banker.
Some months later, when he went out.
The Bank's investment party had been shot up with subprise paaps and had to describe billions.
The UBS announced an increase in the capital of wise and 13 billion francs.
For this reason, she found investors, however, who, some of which had already been laid down the naze before, had been an intransparent Asian State Fund from Singapore and a Arab State Fund, which had been so refreshed that they have not even learned his name.
But that was only the first gun.
It was worse in April 2008.
The Bank had to notice new billion losses, President of the Administrative Council Marcel Ospel, 2006, and the Switzerland’s second best administrative Council was backed.
In October 2008, the catastrophe followed: The UBS was taking into account their fair investments in the financial crisis before the coastal crisis and had to be saved from the State.
The National Bank bought the UBS for thirty milliards of problemtic values, which the Swiss Eid Eid Society gave six billion Frances for a ransom change paid on which she could be the bank's currency.
The whole Switzerland was defended - because she noted how dramatic it is for a small country if it is so large.
Finally, the UBS 2007 balance sum was more than five times larger than Switzerland's economic performance (see graphs).
"We couldn't save the UBS again," says bank researchers.
The first catastrophe concluded the second.
Over a few months, the UBS capitalized in the tax road with America and explained that it was ready to explain the data of clients that could be left with the bank's assistance.
In addition, she fixed a payment of $780 million - as a remuneration of unfair gains from these businesses, with the provision of criminality.
The UBS noted more or less open to help in tax interaction.
At the same time, she lost something that has been in competition for some customers: the Nimbus of the disappointment.
After the Scandal, the Swiss bank secret was not the same.
It followed the return from the Chairmans and the Administrative Council.
And the Exodus of customers.
Thus, within less months, the Bank had lost their credibility in two central business areas: in the investment banking by the fair speculation and the power management through the assistance to tax interview.
And as soon as it was a little more quiet, just as you thought, the UBS will come back again, since these unnecessary storys followed: one of the individual shopping shots 1,7 billion euros before the bank notes that something is clear.
And it will be clear that the risk management in the investment bank is obviously not yet fit.
"In addition to the case, Adoboli has to be found that risk control has been too little changed," said Martin Janssen, economic and financial prosecutors at the University of Zürich.
The financial state of a large German bank is also safe: "The problem of the UBS is that she has no risk control."
However, it was exactly the idea of which the Swiss bankers had been attained for a long time to become the obediences of the great powers of the world: no too large risks, so the security for money was also liked to break up the world by the Alpene Republic.
The Tresors of the Swiss banks were the symbol for unfair confidence, such as Lindt and Spingli for particularly echoolde.
The UBS Central in Zurich is still close to the Climate of the Swiss private bank, which is just a little larger.
The situation is really classic.
The Bank has its head office on the Swiss Railway Railways, directly leading to the Swiss Sea, which is covered by the snow-sweets of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are fair, the layouts are the highest in Europe.
Juweleres like Tiffany are found here between the Swiss traditional detainees like the Conference Swiss.
Since centuries, the Swiss banks are resumed: from the National Bank on the Palast of Credit Suisse to the Electric Private Banks such as Julius Bär.
The UBS receipt is involved in a severe drug door.
Thirds are the walls of marmor clothes, so they are dinners of leathers, beside the bank Logo, a great hint to the "safe".
The UBS knows what the customer is looking for: security.
This idea of the Swiss Bank has both Swiss Great Banks, UBS and Credit Suisses, but sometimes - or have been advised, as the head of a small Swiss private bank found.
His names would not like to read in the newspaper, finally, as all Swiss bankers, even with the two large banks.
The UBS has become too much, especially in the investment bank, where the cases would be expanded.
The Swiss had nothing to say any more.
"And if, they have adapted the seats of the case."
In fact, it was the angel Investment Bank, which changed the UBS, of the highest benefits and then the debkel: No European financial institutions has lost so much money as the Swiss Great Bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was visible.
"In that mid-eight, the Government coalition of the small seven-million countries decided the greatest rescue action in the history of its nation," wrote the author Lukas H fertilized in his book "The UBS-Crash".
By 68 billion of France or about 45 billion euros, politicians agreed to save the Great Bank before the Bank.
How could it happen?
Along with the Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially in the size of the US.
In June 1998, two of the three Swiss Great Banks were closed to a strong concert.
There was a bank that was too large for the small Switzerland, and continued to grow.
This helped the two different pre-dependent banks of the UBS: a series, but sleeping bank with the weak point Administration in Zurich and a farmer but has already been stronger internationally.
Immediately, the internationalised investment banks came to a lot of money with which they could throw a huge race.
Two names are connected with this increase in the UBS: Peter Wuffli, from 2001 to 2007 the UBS Conzernch, and Marcel Ospel, at the same time Chairman of the Administrative Council.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel are a dream team," says Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the high-intellectual, distinguished that understands many of models and statistics, and wood, the Bauchman who has worked up from bank teaching to top."
But Ospel has left the end on Wuffli.
And Wuffli has probably made a critical mistake: "He thought his models are the reality," says Geiger.
"It's a tragic case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear that it's been over the case before.
The workers of the UBS are clearly remembering the leading force meetings, on which conzernchef Wuffli always extended the same word: Goldman saks from the throne.
The American Bank was the most powerful land investment bank.
She brought the League Tables, the Ranglists who documented the success of the banks at that time.
So the UBS wanted to get on the top.
Some steps have been hurt.
In the devise business and in the acquiring trade, she played completely up.
Nevertheless, undertaking officers who were assigned have a weakness: In the international currency, in the "Fixed Ine" language "Fixed Ine", give it a huge distance to the largest banks.
The UBS has fun in American hypothecs.
In order to close these lambs, UBS was in a adventure that she almost costed the existence.
Hungary to growth, both the bank has invested as well as one before its hedge fund in the American sub-present plants.
She developed to a strong machine, which packed the value papers on American hypothetic credits and continued, but also risks.
Anyway, when other banks were looking for exchange.
"In the summer 2007, when the American real estate market was in Flamen, the UBS has bought there," says banken expert Geiger.
So large the euphorie, so deep of the case.
A manager had to go after the other when the trials were trying to get more difficult than thought.
Posts at the UBS were closed and are warm to this day.
He who leads the Grand Bank now has an unable job.
It must find a strategy for a bank which has been retained all the closed business models.
Bank researchers have already a idea: finishing the investment banking, concentration on the property management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank does not want to go (no) so far.
But investment banking must be strong, so much is now clear.
On Thursday, the new Bank Chairer Sergio Ermigo in the world wants to present its future strategy.
The 51-year-old Italo Sweizer was in fact thinking only as a transitional solution when the bank was surprised by a predominant green.
He has been implemented: it must continue the business of the UBS, and the Serbian Bank shared on Sunday.
Ermtto wants to return the investment bank to the middle of the nine years.
3 500 places it's hard.
But it won't be rich.
The UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
What's she gonna win for money?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is safely present now.
He's just saying that he's gonna be looking for a apartment in Zurich once.
Next year.

Intelligent forces are widespread in cities
A variety of housing crystals used as “proble oil”: however, from the cities the high intelligent animals are not longer lost, most important experts.
The ones like they who want to refuse very quickly: the powers are included for centuries, but in many communities, people who are aware of dreck and laughing of the animals.
There is no means against the "problem bird" until now.

Sealing is only thinkable as exceptions in hospitals, homes or schools.

Unless the surrounding is not solving the problem in the towns, the citizen Wolfgang Kellner had said to be leather.
You think it is a combination of animals from sensitive habitation areas and local offers to sell them again in other places.
"Infotals instead of Ketenshagen" were the psychologists and ethnologists Uta Maria Jürgens for a slightly other transition with the animals: "Another piece on the face we can finally take the best knowledge."
Together, in Schleswig-Holstein, he founded the Ascheberger Kräpe-Learched to inform the noticer of the life of the high-intelligent satellites.
The project will already be adopted by tourists.
Furthermore, the critics on the lamentation of the birds had a own view: "There is all many communications that have to say much."
Intelligence and fertility of the animals are legend: Saat crowds are not only used to come to a leather exhibition, but have as a means of their tool even here.
Cambridge's conduct researchers tested along four sate corners, as far as the intelligence of the birds.
In an experiment, the birds quickly learned that with stones they needed to bring a beauty to the inturn to reach such a mottlarve.
Without a lot of training, they recognized that size and form needed a stone to make the platform collapse.

Mass murder at a personal level
Peter Englunds starts with a sense and great new book "Brease and fear." A story of the first World War, mentioned in nineteen shocks" with a long list of chief people who go to heart.
Here is a tip that can be done: Drop this page carefully and make it to your bookmark.
You will know these people in England's romantic narration very well. And these main persons will function as your GPS, as a light tour in these few moments, in which you're like English men and women lost in the Nebel of the War and are aware of your illusions.
Peter Englund is a Swedish historicist and journalist.
He is also the new Permanent Secretariat of the Swedish Akademie, decided by the Nobel Price for Literature.
He wrote an unnormal book that he does not describe as an "the work of the anti-history".
It contains only few large names, important contracts or comprehensive disappearances. There are few ambassadors, rare reporters or discussions about tactics and equipment.
It's less a book of what happened, he explains, but rather "a book of how it was." It's "pensions, events, experiences and stimms".
"Beauty and fear" almost the war experiences of 20 more or less inaccessible men and women together on both sides of the war, from schools and botanics to mountains, doctors, hospitals and officers.
Some of these people will be held to heroes.
Some will be dismissed or died in war captive, losing leather modes.
Each of this life blows like your guests in a church, some come to while others solve.
England's book appears from the usual stories.
It also corrects the idea that the first World War was only the war of the western position.
"Beauty and painting" walks with expert views about other war views: Alpen, Balkan, Eastern border, Mesopotamien, Osta Africa.
On the soldiers in this book, a feast Christmas feast among the pyramids in Egypt, the settlement is an unresolved problem.
This is almost since the beginning of a movement book.
The war overwhelms the life of these people as a natural catastrophe, like a Hurrikan Katrina, who runs to Cordit.
Do you think you're a woman who's at home with her children and canonen fever in the telephone. Are you staying or take the flight?
Who's coming over?
Anybody understands what happens or why this war is carried out.
"Free facts", says England, "whoved with mutation, acceptances, hopes, hopes, ideas, fixed theories, dreams, dreams, dreams and dreams. "
"Beauty and shooting" follows individual people such as Florence Farmborough, an English hospital in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German shipmaster.
Your storys were mainly recorded, letters and other materials already published.
Your life reports may be horrored, but they are extremely alive in Englands of the small collection in details.
Many of them are acting from lack and helpers.
In the story of a German school, he said, "Replace, all the replacement."
"Standle Caffee, false aluminium, wrong radier gumm, papers, wood."
He's talking about the replacement in Germany.
He describes "Flesh, which was made from painted river and was backed in Hammelfect (and lastly served with a false knee of wood), tabak, which was made of cracked wheels and shocked cards, shoes that were chosen with wood."
There was, as he noted, "837 registered foods allowed in the manufacture of horns, 511 recorded coffee customs".
Some stories are of honor and tolerance.
One American recognizes his own step to the wildness and says about the war: "If you feel that this is, although all this is what was more provisioned for men than to sit in the leather, with a dinner, a dinner and a cigarette, and a whisky in the hand, and to do, as it said, a fassade civilization and no barblei were set behind their own steal and structured heats."
Return recognizes a British soldier that he probably dies and no one takes any notice of it or will worry about it.
"When you think to offer yourself away, you want to think this happens before a public," he writes.
Instead of them it is so terrified as " a man who has been condemned in the secret."
Other observations are acting from the old Europe that runs out of each other and about new types of terrorism.
"The Conflict has become increasingly in an economic disaster," says England, "a war between the factors."
He begins the arrival of what he calls "a new spectrum in the Business of the Year of the Year": "The word used and ideologically convicted masses in the measure, which kills while he sits behind a table."
People keep themselves in an unprecedented manner, and there is also fresh behaviour as heroism.
England discussed the soldiers who actively tried to hide themselves in a prostitute with a sex disease in order to disappear the Federal Service.
"The great expression that can be discovered in the trade with Gonokocks, because soldiers bought and shot themselves on their genetics, in hope to come into the hospital," he writes.
"Those who were really unfortunate called him in the eyes, which brought them to be the rest of their life blind."
In this translation from the Swedish of Peter Graves, Englands Poesie will be inaccessible and perfect to his human task.
In decades of small scene, he begins the way and way, as the war "in a single manner, uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hate".
People begin to ask why their leaders bring them to war.
The best books about the first World War were most infringed as Paul Fussells "Great War and Modern Memory" or Romans like Erich Maria Remarques "Im Westen's nothing news" as an overall history books.
England band involves a non-conventional resthalle.
His book has the most heavy end of which I've ever read in a book.
I don't give it anymore.
But it's like he threw us out this side with the chief persons before the nase and added us with a steel wood.

The last education unit found the Montagnage on the Manhattan site of the East River.
The command to enter into the park came "in the last minute," said someone who trusted with the orders, what was for a declaration as "profession".
"The little policemen who were connected to my knowledge didn't know that it was about the acquisite park," said one who wanted to stay anonym.
"The only ones who knew that it was about the acquisite park were the highranged officers of the resort."
A reason for the secret was a lesson that learned the city.
On October 14, the officers wanted to store the park, but returned when hundreds of protesters were gathered together after they learned from these plans.
The officers of various police units were involved in the operation of the Sunday, among others, for examples of use from the whole city - hundreds of mobile officers, normally used in high criminal neighbourhoods.
Mr Kelly said that many people were in the park during the day, almost like pendler, that 1 hour in the night is a good time to enter.
"It was appropriate to do this when the lowest number of people in the park," he said.
Rescue car with jupiter lamps and lacchers stand before the past on the Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive near the Manhattan Bridge.
The lamps and the previously marked news that were disappeared from the lambs seemed to be angry by many protesters.
When the public officers in their light winds were entered into the park, many protestors simply took their things together and left the place.
The police said that no cells would be fixed until 1:45, to give the trial time to spend her Hab and good together.
Other teams of officers were seen as they were gathered in the area to take into account, they should be needed in the park.
Reporters were forced to leave the park.
Paul J. Browne, speaker of the President of the police, said that it was to their own security.
But many journalists say that they wanted to stop watching the police actions in the park, and they said that the movement of the officers was very rare.
Mr. Browne said that television car in the Church Street could have been made on the west side of the park photos.
When the police moved in the Western direction by the great one by the protesters' personal affairs, among others a kitchen, center and clothes with clothes, their own officers followed the resolved of the city.
Some protesters who refused to go were shot out there. Images appeared soon later on the Internet.
A principal manner of protesters was located near the kitchen area of the camp in the center of the park's position.
Some barriers created and the police continued its methodic arrests.
Circa 10 persons in the camp center of the camp are connected to their poor.
And two people kept themselves in the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Ambassadors of the catastrophe protection were called to solve them.
As Mr Kelly said, there were no arrests in the park until 3:30.
The reimbursement was completed after the police's explanation after 75 minutes.
Mr. Browne said that 142 people were arrested in the park.
For most arrests it came, as he said, because "inconsistent detention and contradiction against a conclusion."
The prominent officer was Joseph J. Exposito, head of the division, the highest uniformized officer of the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, Chief of Criminal Officers, was there.
Despite his presence, Mr Kelly is not the operation, as Mr Browne said.
For the case they should be accessed, a second group of officials at the east of the Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar Street.
In the Cortlandt Street, a road block north of the park, and in the Pine Street, a block on the south, was made barrikade.
It could be observed how these locations from the police continued the surrounding of the adquistti park around.
A place was observed as many officials, many of them with protected screens, people outside.
Circa 28 people were in the north environment.
Some of the most forced actions in the night found in the south of the park.
On the south of the Pine Street, a protester split on the road of a police vehicle and other demonstrators left the air from the flight of a police bus.
On one place, the amount of sperrholds was made.
At the end, a officer and a prosecutor came to the hospital.
The employer's work will be resolved because of resolvedness against the city
The company, which has been aware of the hundreds of schoolers who have lost their workplace last month, planted to resolve the city in the middle, since the disappearances because their unnecessary impact on schools, teachers who are poor and discriminating.
It is likely to be the last opportunity that the company, the Council of Business 37 is still open in their efforts to make the delimitation.
Six hundred and thirty-seven schools, co-ordinators and other employees who were members of the poorest paid officers of the city and lost their work in an approximation, described as a political race in the past year that the city’s access to a health fund that the working groups had been denied to be closed with which the budget flows should be closed.
This prosecution was categorieally rejected by the authorities.
At a hearing of the town Council, Dennis Walcott said, Director of Schools, last month, the releases were part of the budget that you decided in June.
A member of the city Council was back and explained him that the Budget would not be specialised that employers would be released from school assistance.
The officers of the town Council said that they had and announced the Ministry of Education before a case. In Wednesday, there will be a press conference on which the entry of the case will be announced by the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the Ministry of Education of the City will make a complaint and assigned workers as complaints who are all fair or Latin American women, such as most of the helpers who have lost their work.
Elizabeth Thomas, a speaker of the Minister of Justice of the City, said that the city does not prejudice the object and that it could therefore not be commented with their individual evidence.
According to a complainant project from New York Times, the company focused on the number of releases at schools in the army quarters of the city to support a case for non-equality treatment. It claims that poor schools had lost more help because they were chronicly underfined.
It indicates that while there are no releases in the Iceland and only few releases in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa schools, 17 schools in the district 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, have lost and have been released 46 helpers in the springs 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
With the determination of the loss of five of eight schools who were appointed in the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of the students live in poverty, the setting states: "This is no neighbourhood of parents who can organize the SSPs to initiate budgets."
P.S.: The budget of the 36th Distrits was cut this year by 3,26 percent. Moreover, money lost when the city has changed its calculation method for extra financing for every school.
The company also reiterates that the heads of the High Schools were led by the language in a Memo into the Irre, which authorized the delimitation of co-ordinators.
The Memo used the English word "excess" to describe the action, even if "excess" (exess: presentation) in the United States usually describes the use of a teacher of a school list in a pool of available workers that are paid by the central office.
"Six-sixty-sixth interview coordinators have been deleted, not transferred," said the project.
Mission ended, Congress ready for Libyen
It seems finally like the Republic and Democrats in Washington to comply with regard to the situation in Libya.
All that was necessary was the success of the Refugee, the arrest and the death of Muammar Gaddafi's long-year Dictator and the finalization of the American integration.
On Thursday, the Committee for International Relations of the Senate decides a resolution, which is undertaken by President John Kerry (Massachussetts) together with Senator John McCain (Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Conecticut), which Libyen lives for successful rebellion and the US American troops for its "Mut".
"This resolution appreciates the cutting people of Libyen who have started with the reconstruction of their country," said Kerey.
"It is a confirmation of supporting its democratic efforts by two parties."
The language may be unlawful, but until now was nothing easy in the Libyen debate.
This summer, the lawyers of both parties and the white house against the election of a number of resolutions for the imagination or misliance of the role of the US military in the Libyen Mission of the NATO.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution which approved the limited military forces of the United States in Libyen.
The law was rejected in the Senate by a wide group of both parties, and there was no vote.
However, in the same day, this law was passed in Senate. In addition, the room decided a decision to correct money for American operations in Libya.
This is why the U.S. mission is in a type of legislative feed - with a congress that was enough to critify Obama's progress in the framework of the mission, but not enough defended to finally leave the grounds under the feet.
Then the decisiveness of the Congress was overcome from the events.
Tripolis fell in August under the Liberian Rebells and Gaddafi was killed on 20 October.
The NATO mission adopted officially on 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to do.
The resolution of the Committee for International Relations "greats the people of Libyen to their huge encouragement and extraordinary delay in their self-free" and "loves men and women of the United States Military and their coalition partners that support military operations for the protection of people in Libya, for their extreme courage and professionality."
The resolution also confirms “the national interests of the United States in a successful and unrelated transition of Libyen to democracy”.
Does the new measures receive full support by the Group for Foreign Relations or will they split the legislator as has done the law of June?
The latest vision focuses on the opposition of the Senator's Richard G. Location (Indianapolis), the Spitz Republic of the Committee.
Local speaker said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final provision of the new law.
According to Capitol, the Senat is to vote this week on a constitutional change that calls for a comprehensive budget to a top priority in nearly any Congress legislation of the Republics and some democrates.
The measures under the direction of the Republican Bob Goodlatte (Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment of the budget or a different area which comes at the time to vote in the Senate or Congress.
Other legislators have tried to make their amendments to vote, although they have often tried enough.
Goodlate change is only one of 68 constitutional amendments presented to this Congress and include a whole band width of themes.
Some are double - the same law was submitted to the Congress as well as to the Senate - others are just easy from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of compensatory budget change and a further depth that would control the 'Bund expenditure'.
Some of the laws are also identical, but they give their chargers, in particular those who want to move their life course - to speak the possibility of having such a "related" measure.
The budget control law adopted in August requires both Senat and Congress on a change of budget compensation.
In March 58 Senators have established an unrelated resolution that supports the idea of such amendments.
Apart from the budget, some members want to limit the number of the provisions that members of the Congress, while the Republic of José E. Serrano (New York) would like to impose the limit on two officials of the President.
The Republic of Jesse L. Jackson (Illinois) proposed a number of amendments that ensure the right to good education and health care.
A change that offers an army under balance is as well as a amendment which submits the breakdown of fadens, a returning proposal.
Some legislators also want to allow the recruitment of federal laws if two third States refuses them.
As the Members proposed changes, they are more rapidly moved as in the past years.
On 111. Congress, lawyers of 77 have made such amendments on 110. Congress 66.
The time shall be compared to the previous 1990s in which members regularly propose more than 150 amendments every two years, so the numbers available to the Senate Library are available.
But they were not much more successful than today.
The last amendment to add - the 27th - was ratified 1992, but it has already been proposed to the Congress 1789.
"According but not besides," Giffords in the first television interview after the attent
On ten months after an armed man from the next disappearance during a election event in Tucson, the Republican Gabrielle Gifffords (Arizona) held a Montagued Party in the national television. It was blood only to the Broadway Stack "The Sun Will Come Out Tomorrow" and said that the desire to get to be greater than the return to the Congress.
When she comes together with Diane Sawyer in the ABC news "20/20", she takes words and needed help when you go.
The shipment showed the severe sustainment of the damage which shared the wheels, the left side of their brain, and made their head from front to downward.
Before three months ago, she returned surprisedly to the Congress to triumphing her voice to the criminal breasts.
In their first television interview after the attent in January, when six people were killed and 13 were killed, the laughing gifford, laughing and blood - and described their usuality as "seed".
When Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gifford answered: "That's good."
The interview with Gifford and her husband, astronaute Mark Kelly, was a part of an original "20/20" specialist, which was called shortly before the publication of the new book of the wife: "Gabby: a story about Mut and hope."
The Special Giffords Genesung has been followed since the Attentat of 8 January.
In videos, which Kelly had been signed in the first weeks, you can see them in the hospital bed, with cut-rained head and a long shape over the stars.
She can have only one or two fingers when her husband encourages her.
Months later, Geffords sit in a road studio, while therapies show you how they make easy movements.
A gun with his head.
A dream with the lips.
And then, their first words, "What."
After a few days, Giffords flights another word: "Toast." She wants to change your breakfast.
Videos playing in the ABC show showing that music played a important role in Giffords' funeral: you can see how the Congress Authors together with the therapeutes in Cyndi Laupers "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Pettys "Free Fallin'".
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords said to be two hours daily with therapy, that she cannot remember herself on the day of the attent.
Her husband said he had an article of a daily newspaper on the attent when she had stopped him and asked for the six people who were killed during the attent.
Jared Lee Loughner is in a prison in Missouri and is being treated medically while waiting for his negotiation.
"So many people are dead," said Giffords Sawyer.
"Hart, heart, heart."
During his marriage, Kelly Sawyer told, "I was taken."
"Why, I'd say, 'Gabby, you weren't seen?"' said Kelly.
You've just been killed.
And you'll pass through it, and you'll get you and you'll come stronger than ever before.
Repeat Trucks as Respect
The event was a Wall Street-Gaala, which gathered millions of dollars for obdedachless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock slew a ballade about unfairness, flatation and loss.
On a word, hundred soldiers, matrosens, pilots and marines were gathered around him.
The amount of black smokings rose up and applauded.
"The soldiers and soldiers were seen as herden," said David Saltzman, who organized the dependence in the early year.
A ranghoor military officer on the Gala, which was observed, among others from the head of the stage and the time president Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops.
"They were introduced as the children of Waisenin," the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organisms did well.
I know.
But it wasn't a respect, it wasn't.
The contrary presses illustrate the severe relationship between the military and the most delayed, sometimes surprised American public.
The troops are overcome with Lob for their sacrifices.
But the Lob has his price, say the service members.
The public takes itself increasingly as you do the people in Uniform suffer.
"We were no way of victims", said Brigade General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But obviously, the only way of support is to press us into the role of unfortunate souls."
The topic is extremely sensitive for military leaders who are not incompatible or in the fight with the public they want to appear.
They also recognized that the wrestness that the returning troops in the last years of Vietnam was worse.
As follows, discussions of friendship in the styles and privates between warways will be held.
After his two sons were returned from war with the Marines, the Colonel warned them that people could see their service from two different perspectives outside the military world.
Some would look at a sense of emotion because they had rebells seen and rescued to eotic places.
Others would ask whether a "covery, forced veteran under the surface" had been prohibited, Canzan who had fighted in Iraq and took a high state post in Washington after his return.
During his work's search, he said that some of the questioners asked whether he was in a position to keep the pressing of a requested post in Washington.
"If you speak about your service, you should keep the negative end press," said Canzan, his sons.
The lack of difficulty of the military grows in part to the lack of the Americans' interest in war.
Services on the slaughter are made by a country that has little experience with the military and only seems few benefits in Iraq and in Afghanistan, only rarely expressed as a lob.
"We are not estimated as a nation of military Heldenity, as it was absolutely in the Second World War," said Leader General David Barno a.D., the US troops in Afganistan.
Instead of this, the loving of politicians and publics focused on the suffering of a service member.
Truths find acknowledgement for the number of attacks they have taken, the number of friends they have lost or the weakness of their violations.
Military is the growing pressure towards hard management
In this week, an important hearing decides whether 28 women and men are not involved in an administration before the military force.
If not it comes, hundreds of complaints are ready to the next hearing.
Elizabeth, released by Lyman, was 25 years old and in the 11th week, when she was entitled by a soldier council night.
It was in October 2008, and she just returned to her castle in Miramar north of San Diego from dinner with a friend when she came to a male college, which was a 12-pack Bier.
He asked her if he could join her into a drink in her room.
"My warning blocks have gone," said Lyman.
But the texaner had their minds.
I thought, "Well, he's 19.
He's from Texas," she said.
"I wanted to hear about my building feelings."
A few minutes after they went to Lyman's room, the man stood behind her, pressed her down and charged her, confirmed her.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and 27 other current and former military officers were expected on a process with historical audience in Arlington, Virginia, where it is decided whether a case they have been adopted against the former defence Minister Robert Gates and his passenger, Donald Rumsfeld.
The complaint claims that Gates and Romans are not prevailed against the widely expanded administration within the military and in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February of Susan Burke, a jurisdiction lawyer from Washington, D.C. introduced the appeal to 17 complainants at the beginning of the following months: 25 Women and three men who say that they were managed or misused by soldiers, and that the military refused to condemn it, to condemn or to provide an appropriate legal statement in accordance with the preventive attacks.
Burke says that she follows the highest military management, since the problem begins there.
"The military is built herearchic," she said.
"Who are the individual persons who are in position to extermine the culture of the disappearance? The leading."
Moreover, Burke says that she has contacted nearly 400 more survivors since February, many of them could be part of future plants.
Its strategy: Instead that all complaints so put their eggs into a corb, they will, if necessary, get a lot of other carts to get the pressure right.
The team of defence for the Ministry of Defence, introduced by Federal Officer Neil MacBride, has made a request to deal with the subject.
The acts of the Court of Auditors shall lead to the defence strategy in the first line that the military cannot be appealed by current or previous soldiers for offences to which it has come in the wars.
In the light of a law of the Supreme Court of 1950, which is the product of fertility referred to in the 1950, the Government does not hold for violations added to the active service of soldiers.
"The murmuring wounds have resulted during the military service of the complaints," said the document.
The Ministry of Defence refuses any comment on this story.
The things have changed since the 1950s.
If women are still not allowed to service in the fight, the distinction is only in the name: modern wars have only rarely clear flowers.
In Iraq, as well as in Afghanistan, the teams of soldiers are increasingly important, especially in contact with domestic women in the war areas.
The result: among these two wars, 150 soldiers died, two thirds of them in fighting treatments.
It's time that the military is modernized, says Burke.
And she is not in their battle alone there: three other clothes are dependent on them.
In the Yale Law School, the Veterans' Legal Services Clinic provides an object to the four most important military academies because of the mobility of fraud feed atmosphere.
Independently, the common Vietnam Veterans of America gathers a object against the military in which you focus on the diagnosis of “Perfective Disturbation” that had received the management sacrifices to leave them from the service - a usual step-based workers like Anu Bhagwati of Women's Action Network, a human rights group.
Its group had extended the object against the Veteran Administration (e.g.: managing of wars) in which she had anticipated its discriminatory practices in their circumstances with performance accurates for persons who have been misused in the service.
New laws were submitted, independently, by a mixing of Senators and representatives of both parties to the Congress that offer a number of points of content.
The 2010 Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office (e.g.: The Office for Prevention and Communication of sexual abuse) of the Ministry of Defence No 3158.
However, most misbrushes are not reported and take into account this number of approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19.000 cases that it comes per year.
The report published in March also investigated the criminal persecution Councils: 2010 20 per cent of the most occurred cases in the military before the court, only half and half of the civil law.
The complaints in Burkes case describes their attacks as only the first of a series of dreams.
In Lyman's case, she reported the military police of less than one hour after the case.
In this night, she said, she was asked for 11 times to tell the details of their management of a whole number of police, doctors and command officers.
She had a manager, and the blood of her anger, who had gone out of a slaughter on his arm, was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman was listed to a judge. During the audience she was asked after the sex she had before her agreement with her friend.
Six persons said as a characteristic products in the name of the cut-time tower who finally spoke.
"I remember the day when the judgment was sent," says Lyman.
"I thought that the ways would be put. I ran out of the court room."
"She brought me to the psychiatric department and I remember that when I came out again, my commander said, "It was not his procedure. This was my procedure."
Lyman was requested to visit a military pysychiater, which finally diagnosed a diagnosis of personality and explained for serviceless.
In January 2010, it was unfairly released so that it did not receive any support.
If Lyman and other complaints have arrived before, it is clean speculation, says John Turley, Professor of the legal science at George Washington University Law School.
Nevertheless, he notes that "in my view they should come before."
What is between them and a judgement, this doctor is which is criticised since the first time it was made in question.
I'm a criticism of the Ferez Doctor.
The military takes a decade behind, because they don't have the same disappearance and the same disappearance that brings a disaster with themselves.
He adds: "The opportunities are against them, but it's important for them to try it."
These things will only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the hearing does not follow its way, Burke, the lawyer of the complaints, starts with their hundreds of other complaints for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the military in this regard until it comes to reforms," she said.
Or until we die, whatever we're going to be first.
walls have eyes: How to watch Facebook
Before the new face of the legal extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Brevik was only one of many guys who sent their anti-inmigration unit online.
On Monday, Brevik, who had decided to have started an amok course in Norway in July, killing 77 people, had the first public hearing before the court.
Although Brevic is likely to have acted alone, he is not only in the Cyberspace: he has been a lot of time before his computer attack and has been fighted with some of the millions of nationalists who support the legal groups on the pages of social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, researchers wanted to find more about these people.
How do you find them?
It's easy - you've just got to log in at Facebook.
"We found that it was not difficult to come to them," said Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report of the British ideas manufacturing DEMOS on the digital population in Europe.
Facebooks Hide personal data is so enzyklopedia, says Bartlett that researchers simply need to use the advertising tool of the page to determine their desired demographic data with scientific accuracy - as it does marketers for years.
Bartlett's team found a half million Fans right-to-developed groups throughout Europe and then added them, but instead of linking a new band or a new diagram product, the add users played a survey in which after their status of education, their stops against violence and the estimation of their own future.
Thanks to Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to ask more than 10,000 attachers of 14 outer right parties in 11 European countries, without having to leave their office once.
"It's a right new research method," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are pretty surprised. Online providers are most young, male and immigration.
But in a kind of surprise disappearance, they are "these who combine their online active museum with an offline activity museum more vulnerable, democratic and less warm than those who remain behind their computer screens."
DEMOs work is only a example of how Facebook will be in the hands of scientists.
Ideales, medical researchers and political scientists use the site to study all things, from health issues to society agency such as in Likes, text messages and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users that add three contents per day, Facebooks "Datensupernova" generates a research tree that increased the number of scientific work with the name of this page in the last five years about 800%.
For some researchers, Facebook's beautiful is the fact that you can study through this page of people that are usually not reaching his clipboard on the street.
"If you've previously tried to ask people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"They should first inform the party and which would never have granted them access", says Bartlett.
"By Facebook makes it all away - you're going directly to them."
Others say that the page offers an opportunity to recognize and solve social health problems.
An current study of Dr. Megan Moreno by the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their full advice on Facebook have significantly more to the problem of drinking than students who have sought on this subject.
Moreno suggests that equal students, such as residents, watching the page and helping a student if they are too many status updates.
"You can't solve a problem if you don't recognize it," said Dimitri Christakis, Morenos Ko-autor and Child Health Leader, Behavior and Development at the Child Research Institute in Seattle of Washington Post.
"We found an opportunity to identify dangerous children that would not be found otherwise."
Facebook also continued to add the data of his own population.
The data team of the page has created statistics about the status of relations and Valentine's day, the selection participation to the interim elections 2010 and a national lucky index (in the first line of the information on which Facebook has access only – Masters of the Freedom of digitality since long, that the page should be available for others to research.)
However, the Facebook users know that the page is observed whether they want it or not. To make a friend that is remote of thousands of miles to play Scrabble, you can provide your own personal data.
But what if the users of Facebook will be part of a survey of which they don't even know anything?
While researchers have closely established directives how they collect their data offline, it is allowed to all online.
"I don't believe that many users have thought of the fact that a researcher could study their profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London Knowledge labor, a study from 2006, in which he studied the public pages of students on Facebook.
"What's about, it's just about her and her friends."
Then there is still a question of the methodology.
Even offline there is no guarantee that a researcher is absolutely honest.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know how many of the information are true in a user profile and in contributions.
"What you're saying on Facebook and what you're doing outside Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
So Selwyn thinks that a clipboard and a stift are still the best research tools that everyone can use.
"There is no replacement to go out of the real world and talk with real people," he says.
"Social Research needs to take care of the social - and every many social life is still offline."
"Kalt and unmeasure": Anders Behring Brevic appears the first time before a public court
Otherwise, Behring Brevik, the man who had two amokles who were killed in this summer in Norway, has described himself in his first appearance before a public court in Oslo as a "weapon" fighter.
"I am a military commandor in the northern resistance movement and a Norway temple writer," he said before a court room with more than 500 people.
"I lift up the court because you have received your mandate of organizations to support hassideology and because it is supported by multiculturalism."
"I recognize the laws, but I don't be accused."
Right Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Brevik during this monolog because he was not able to give the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform on which he could express his views.
For the same reason, he refused Brevic, who had a previous sentence, allowance to turn to the members of his victims at the end of hearing.
In addition, Nesheim said that Brevic police had been investigated for 12 more weeks, he had no access to the media. He said that all visits and the whole correspondance of eight weeks will be checked exactly.
Approximately 30 survivors and members of the victims participated in the hearing.
Some came in hope to see Brevic in the eyes, others wanted to confirm that he remained behind the lock and the river.
All took part of the goal that everything goes out of a way.
"I thought he's hurt and incompatible," said a survival of Utoya to the northern NRK.
"It was incomprehensive, but it's a little further after I saw the suspect and heard."
Brivic took a dark approach and a blue clothes and operated during the whole hearing. He looked to journalists and survivors in the eyes when he betrayed the building and left again.
Although Breviks' earliest indication, he would be part of a greater "condition" movement, the judge came to the conclusion that he was not sick and said that there was no evidence that he had had complianced.
Some may appreciate that the attacks of 22 July appear to be the work of a individual excretist and not a Radikaler group.
But is it automatically easily easily facilitating the coffee and the promise that a whole nation still springs?
"I wish he looked like a monster, but he doesn't do it," said the member of a victim.
"It would be so easier if he's thirst."
7 Lections of the interview with the destroyed Steve Jobs, which has been shown in a theatre this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, some compare him with Henry Ford and give the technology to be a great modern founder.
What Apple-Fans may be the most recently discovered in jobs interview that has been discovered in this week before special movie lines on the important markets, is how much this creative head process has understood business and employment.
He was certainly a designer, a dream and himself named Hippie, but he was also a spelling organization, based on charts - a man who believed that many business managers leaded to "the disease of the thought," that is a really great idea of 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a great multitude of handwork arts between a great idea and a great product.
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the TV series "Triumph of Fachidiotes" on the removal of the staff computer and sat more than one hour together with jobs in which they brought one of the rare and outstanding conversations.
At this time, 10 years later, when Job was deployed from Apple and he had already worked hard on his new computer company NeXT, and was glad about the wide acceptance of the Internet.
During a small part of Cringleys interview was used in Fachidiotes, he says that the copys of the interview were missing in the delivery.
First after Job's death, a complete copy of VHS was discovered in the garage of the director.
This easy transformed film material forms the basis for the 68-minute film "Steve Jobs: the loss interview", which comes to the landmark theater.
For someone who is aware of the fact that he has rejected an outstanding interviews, Jobs here appears awesomely in the explication of his technological philosophy and business strategies.
And unbelievable.
During the interviews, there are four times to a longer time between question and response - 10 to 15 seconds in which Jobs clearly turns his thoughts and seeks to be accurate.
There are also moments in which Jobs' Perfection is coming to day when he seems unresolvedly reacts on Cringely's questions and striving him to make it faster on the topics or injury treatments of greater importance.
Before the medicine of Pixar, iPod or iPhone, the lost interview appears as far as in secret, if Jobs assess what other companies do right or wrong of his view and provide their own vision for the future of the computer.
It's a thing to read posthum reproofs of the Carriere Jobs. But Jobs here as the pleasant dreams that is on the scene to greatness is something different, originally and inspiring.
He has a vision, how things could be and should be.
Soon after he made this all here, he went out and did it.
A fast look at seven significant sequences of the lost interview:
As he learned to lead a company:
"When all the years in the business I always ask, "Why are you doing things?" and the answer you're always coming is, "Oh, that's just going to be done."
Nobody knows why he's doing what he's doing.
I found it.
Jobs continues its efforts to rationalize the book management in Apple.
Acknowledged how costs were recorded - most of them started with "standard costs", which were drawn on blow sharing and then adapted to "detection" - it developed a automatised factory that ensured that business costs could be set up to the smallest.
As the dad has been heaped:
Jobs tells the "Blue Box", which he built with Steve Wozniak, a device with which you could lead to the telephone society and directly speak.
About the device has already been written a lot, but Job's retention when he describes the Blue Box as a act of self-determination, is strengthened.
He describes how Wozniak and he would test the box by using a mandatory phone, acting an call and then connecting from a AT-T network to another while they spend as many satellites as possible.
"We sent things a half half times around the globus and when you'd pushed in the phone, it came a minute later to the phone," Job said.
"We were young, and we learned that we could build something that can control Billions of dollars in infrastructure throughout the world."
We both, we didn't know a lot, but we could build this little thing that can control a huge thing, that was an unbelievable lection and I don't think it would be without they would apple.
Jobs continued to tell about a glorious style, the Wozniak and he was engaged in the middle of the night through the Blue Box in the Vatican and wanted to talk to the Pope while they were so well able to look at Henry Kissinger.
Since several members of the Catholic Erarchie were revoked in midnight to talk to the American diplomate, the two had to leave before the Pope himself came to the phone.
As he loved the technology (and an unprepared Bill Hewlett called):
In the age of 12, he was looking for a number of frequencies, he was looking for Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after its 20-minute phone, Jobs for the summer received a part-time job at Hewlett Packard.
"It had a significant impact on me, and it was the only company I had seen in the age and it formed my views about what was a company and how well he treated his employees."
Afterwards, one of the HP workers who visited the research work of the company in Palo Alto was visited where he was "the first desktop computer who has ever been created" he saw.
He was so great as a coffee, having a small screen with braunic roads, and I loved me in him.
I'd like to put it on HP as a teenager to upper clips and to write programs for them.
How to improve innovation:
Several times in the interview Jobs says how to find new products spontan.
Once early in his carrier, when he built some platines, he was requested by a customer to build the whole computer.
He worked with a payment period of only 30 days and needed to consider both the construction and the delivery of the devices made.
Plus later, at Apple, he remembers the problems he had in the development of a computer mouse:
"I remember the missing arguments... you cried to me that there would be five years [by build a mouse that would cost $300] and I got up and went out and found a manufacturer."
9 days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15. It was incredible.
Over large enterprises:
Long before he left Apple again, Jobs saw the ways in which so many industrialists helped with their visions in steel and the controls of their acts were lost.
"Do we think you work at IBM or Xerox, then do you make a better copyer or printer, after and?"
You have the actienmonopol, so the company is no longer successful.
sales and marketing make it more successful, so [see] those who are finally leading the companies and the product with which people will be removed from the decision-making.
The product genius that has led to this monopolation will be required by people who do not have a concept for good products, such as bad products, explosed - handy art.
This happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have the whole computer industry.
You could have been ten times greater than that Microsoft of the 1990s could be...
You've tricked the ground from the victory.
About innovation as art form:
"It's all of the handy arts between a great idea and a great product... if you develop this great idea, it changes and grows."
Many learn of his identities.
It is necessary to make votes, some things you can't, but electrons, glass, robots, manufacturers.
You need to see 5000 things, these concepts, and bring them all together...
Lastly, it goes out of the smoke, it's going to be trying to make up with the best goals that people have created and then try to make these things together to what you are doing.
Picasso said to copy good artists, close great artists.
We're always crazy in the star of great ideas.
Part of what Macintosh did greatly, was that people who work there, musicians, defenders, artists, zoologists, stories were the best computer scientists of the world.
If it weren't the computer sector, they would be creating fantastic things in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with health law enforcements, as a case of court
On the day in which the Supreme Court gathered the doors closed behind to discuss the politically shared question whether a complaint of the health laws of President Obama has taken two of its judges, Antonine Scalia and Clarence Thomas, to a dinner which was issued by the Castlei.
The case in the past Thursday was placed when all nine judges were looking for a talk to consult the requests for testing.
One of the cases concerned was a complaint that 26 States have made against the wide reform of the health ownership decided by the Congress last year, a law which has been concluded in the conservative activities throughout the United States.
The judges are deemed to hear the hearing. It is actually expected a 5/2-provisional debate on the basis of the 2012 presidency campaign at the time of its decision to be reported in full gain.
The lawyer who stands before the court will say that the law is to cut the law will probably be Paul Clement, a General Officer under the government of George W. Bush.
Clements Kanzlei, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two decades supported by the annual dinner of the federalist society, an elderly group that defends conservative legal principles.
Another company that sponcils the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the economics, the National Federation of Independent Business, who respect the law.
Another sponsors was the Pharmaziegigant Pfizer Inc. which is financially involved in the process.
The dinner found a few hours after the court consulted the case in a Washington hotel.
The service was Mitch McConnell, the Chief of the Republics in the Senate and a explained health reform.
Scalia and Thomas.
This is nothing new: the two judges visit the events of the federalist society for years.
And this does not disappear against moral rules.
In fact, judges are free of the behaviour code which regulates the acts of the low federal authorities.
If they were probably falling under principle 4c of the Code, which states: "A judge can participate in laws nearly and other organizations, whereas the judge does not speak, honor or program can be a guest of such events."
Instead, the extreme neighbourhood of Scalia and Thomas was made up to two of the candidates related to the case and to a company with a massive financial interest in warning the moral and government activities.
"This flattering breast with Moral and the opposite to the Codeex punishs the laws of certain judges, the court holds the same rules applicable to all other federal directors," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause, a civil law movement in the United States.
"The judges and divine men during a provision of benefits with lawyers with defended procedures in the court."
Their income and support of a dependence for this event are signed on any object to impartiality and are not acceptable.
Scalia and Thomas shown little attention to criticians that say they would be easy to be judged with groups leading from the agenda, such as the federal society, for example.
And Thomas's marriage Ginni is a well-known conservative activityist.
However, the conservatives say that it is judge Elena Kagan who has a moral problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the General State Advocate under the Obama Government, when the first law enforcements came to the court.
Their criticians were obliged to turn away from the hearing of the case because it is too important to defend the law in order to be unforeseen.
Kagan doesn't make any institutions to do this.
Boeing receives record payment of 18 Billion dollars to the country
Emirate airport provides 50 double aircraft type Boeing 777 with an option on 20 additional airports.
Boeing also sold six Boeing Dreamliner to Oman Air, a business in value of more than 1 Billion dollars.
It's really a rare message that a company gets a order over 50 pieces of its products.
But it is a great business when the company of the aircraft Boeing Co. is and the list price for these 50 aircrafts is total of 18 Billions.
Indeed, Boeing's officer is the medium-Orient, a growing gold mine to future airlines.
In a prognosis published on Monday, Chicago's companies estimates that airlines from the Middle East in the coming 20.2.520 aircraft needs $450.
Boeing announced its greatest order of all time for commercial aircraft, measured at the value of the order: 50 second Boeing 777 Jets.
Emirates from Dubai's aircraft came from the Emirates.
Furthermore, Boeing was announced in 2011 on Dubai air view to buy of 20 additional aircraft that allows the whole list price to be $26.
On Monday, Boeing Oman Air six Boeing 787-8, which improved the Benzin consumption and the comfort of the passagiers.
The list price for six of these aircraft is at more than 1 Billion dollars.
"This is absolutely positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Birsenfachmann of Morningstar.
"The quality of these special customers is very high."
Many airlines in the Middle East are in possession of the oil producer countries.
So they have not only the money to pay the aircraft.There is mostly an increase in oil price, which normally affects airlines because this is one of their largest cost points, not so damaging because the country gives a higher oil price.
It is important that they hold less than other airlines to steal or move airlines when the oil prices grow, Dihora said.
"They have a natural insurance," he said.
The order of Emirates confirms Boeing's leading position on the market for large-scale aircraft and helps keeping the SAS air-conkurrent SAS in shopping which includes the A350 predefinition.
Boeings travel on the air view comes four months after announced Airbus, you would move the introduction of the largest A350, which is directly competited with the 777-300ER.
The introduction to gain more confidence after customers requested higher use and riches.
The Boeing Acts have reduced 1,5% to $67.94.
The sister of the Mexicon President is apparently the election in Michoacan
Luisa Maria Calderon claims that drug drugs were supported by the PRI in the road for the governing posts.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon appears to have lost the office of the Governor of Muchoacan during the forced State elections. They said on lunch, drugs had affected the rail for one of their guests.
After the previous results, Fausto Vallejo has gained the institutional party of the revolution, the PRI, the rain around the governing posts in the Western State.
"The attack of the organized crime during the entire election process and particularly on the spring day is alarming, not only for Michoacan, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderon in a radio interview, a day after the election on Sunday.
"You have threatened our candidates, our employees in the surveys ... you have ordered elections to build roadblocks ... and people to vote [for the PRI]."
The PRI ruled seven ten years in Mexico until she lost the presidency in 2000.
But they strive after return and victory in Michoacan is a important step in these efforts.
The PRI is a victory in the presidency election in July.
Vallejo seems to have killed Claderon only who had yet been brought in the surveys before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate of the conservative party National Action PAN of her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as a victor.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate of the left of the Democratic Revolution Party PRD, who is currently still ongoing Governor, came to three places, a serious delay for the backed and unfortunate link guide for the presidency election 2012.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the previous results.
Vallejo, the former citizen of the Main city of Morelia, liable connections with drug hospitals and refers to the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been managed by drug cards that have specialized on Marihuana, heroin and amphetamine.
It is the homeland of President Calderon and he elected Michoacan to launch a military opening against drug drugs in December 2006.
The violence is still ongoing.
A PAN officer was killed a week before the election event for Luisa Maria Calderon and numerous candidates were exempt from fear of the local choices.
For the PRI, a victory strengthens the party, unlike how the elections in Michoacan also appear.
The man who is in the course of the president's ruin is probably grateful to Enrique Pena Nono, the Vallejo from Washington, and said, "I think that this victory can see us in the next year."
ADB provides aid to the European Zone
The Asian Development Bank (Asian Development Bank, ADB) calls for India and China to support the European zone in its serious debt crisis in order to prevent a long-term disappearance that will increase the growth of Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, director of the ADB with a seat in Manila, said that the two of the most fastest growing economicities of the world must make "all in your power" to facilitate the recovery of the currency block or by the International Monetary Fund or by direct mutual agreements.
He warned the countries of Brazil, Russia, India, China, to see the “loss” difficulties in Europe, and said that the financial support of the European lead and European resources through Asia would help to prevent a long-term conjunction of the global economy.
We all sit on the same boat.
"There is so every helpful Europe from this crisis," he said the financial Times in an interview on the border of the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asian can be protected until a certain green, but it is not an immun."
"When China and India can help, then with all the means."
The European currency of Europe is in the past months in a severe crisis.
During the past days, Italian interest costs were dangerous and the first ministers have returned from Italy and Greece.
The rising grave criminal crisis in Europe regrets that the global economy could fall into the recession and leads to calls to leading debt countries to support the euro zone.
Mr Nag said that any Asian support was analyzed by the IWF, but it said that mutual agreements, such as the buy of the EU Responsible Fund, the European Financial Stabilization Facility (EFSF) provides greater negotiations to the European partners in Asia.
Anand Sharma, the Indian Trade Minister, said that "Indigent will do everything in his power" to help the euro area, since its own economy is now leading to the synthetic exports and the extinction of foreign capital flows.
"No one wants the euro to continue to remain instability and turbulent," he said.
"We are standing out of great challenges and we need to receive a high growth level."
"It's no option, it's a task, for where else we find work for our millions of young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no permission to help the rich Europeans when they are self-related with major economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at the US-American Brown University, said that it would be very difficult to sell the 1,2 Billions people in India help for Europe, from which more than $800 million or less on the day.
"And one day, they will find that the Greeks are going to road with 50 and take holidays on the street, then there's a problem," he said.
Lee Howell, the Administrator of the World Economic Forum, asked for a similar reason why India's reserves should be used to maintain the numerous and well-betaking officers in the public service, leading jobs in bad jobs, lossed institutions such as the railway.
Mr Nag said that the crisis in the Eurozone will have "significating lobby effects" in all Asia.
The prognosis of the ADB with a growth of 7.5% in Asia for the years 2011/and now is "the risk of removal" because of the huge risk of Europe.
He said that weak markets should create "Crisen plans" to protect himself for a distant distance and significant deployment of their words.
Third warnings from the pentagon before possible infringements in defence
The ministry of Defence Leon Panetta called the Congress on Monday when he warned that automatically Budgetary Coordinations would be aware of national security and that he solved a financial chain reaction from the Halls of the Pentecosta, to the war offices in Afghanistan and the civil flowlands.
The Pentagon is already exchanged by $450 Billions during the next decade, but now fear that further rates of $600 Billion or more are necessary if the Congress can not end in the expenditures.
"The effects of these shortcomings would be for the Ministry," Panetta wrote in a letter to the republic senators John McCain, Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, South Carolina.
He said that a disagreement of the Congress in the achievement of a budget agreement, which will lead to a such decline, would lead to 23% general shortages and a number of new projects.
"If a high reduction, carried out in such unrealised way, most of our ships and building projects would be seriously harmful - you can not buy three quarters of a ship or a building - and other modernization efforts," Panetta wrote to the Senators.
"We would also be encouraged to divide freely from a major part of our civil personnel and because the reduction would be used so fast, we should allow civilists to achieve the goal."
"They changes would cause the faith of those who will be destroyed by our military and hurt our alarm preparation seriously."
The shortcomings were finally met with the battle troops," said Panetta.
"When the wartime contingent in the anti-terror campaign is not directly concerned, the serious impact in the basic budget would affect warming efforts," said Panetta.
"Personal options have been corrupted, what would lead to delay in the settings and optimizations supporting the war."
"The holders of the staff would be cut down what would lead to the late payment to wartimes, and the legal and political support would be destroyed."
The two Senators answered Panetta 10 days ago and requested further details about the potential of the automatic corrections to the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequences of the ministry of defence would include a rapid decline of the United States as a leading military force of the world."
The Senators said in a common declaration on Monday afternoon when they published Panettas letters.
"This is a result with which we can't live, and it's certainly nothing that we should be disappointed."
"Against the action is a threat to the national security interests of the United States and its entry."
Whether Panettas letter and the new warnings of the Senators will increase the pressure on a compromises in the Budget or will continue to increase demands to extend the pentagon of frequency.
Panetta has increasedly expressed the possible shortages, although he could gather many years of experience with the Budget in the Congress and the white house before he came to the spring of the Pentecost, and he knows that he is serious decisions.
At a press conference in the past week, the Minister of Defence made a dark picture that could prevent -- a military with shoes but without kernel.
"It's a ship without matrosen."
"It's a Brigade without Munition."
"It's a air weapons without sufficiently paid pilots."
"It's a paperman, a army of the cavernes, buildings and bombs without sufficient soldiers who are in the way to fill the mission," said Panetta in his opening language in the Pentagon.
"It's a battle that lacks it on Moral and Alarm preparation and that is not in the way to take it with potential damage."
"It can really be disappointed."
In an annex to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta has made new details, how reductions "significating operational risks: delays in crisis, conflicts and catastrophes, serious restrictions of our global inclusion and integrability, which leads to an inaccessible risk in future war operations".
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could fall to the victim, including those who have already been dismissed and already found in the early planning phase.
This list also includes the fighter F35 Joint Strike Fighter, a planned new boom flight, the next generation of Ballistic U boats, the new Littoral Combat Ship and the new ground campaign that needs the army and Marine to replace the homage.
If the further development and tests of the F35 would be stopped, this would be in the next 10 years to 80 Billion dollars, but the complaints say that it is an important step to reappear, so that possible dangers can be banned by China and other damageers.
How to disappoint a lie
A view to the current shadows shows how sensitive and widespread deception and lies are in the daily life.
The Chairman Chadidat of the Republics, Herman Cain, is concerned to be the accused of sexual decline by several women, and both sides seem to be the lies mutually.
The leading of Penn State will be accused by Myid, as it is obliged to retain reports which have missed a pensioned Footballtrain boys.
In the past week, a microphone was heard by the French State President Nikolas Sarkozy to the American President Barack Obama, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroyed carriers and destroyed countries.
The New York Congress Deputy and the Internet Exhibitionist Anthony Weidner became a nerve when he brought delusions in a course, which were very rapidly repressed by immoral evidence.
The former presidencyskandidat John Edwards is accused of the defence in the campaign financing which is related to the deterioration of an external business.
And then, of course, there is no one who has experienced the media cyclus who has solved President Bill Clinton, when he at his second office at the Oval Office on his sexual relationship to Monica Lewinsky.
Historys about schools and colleagues are widely expanded.
There were cases in which teachers had presented their students the trial responses to make them well at their performance testing.
Mentors that should learn the opposite send a message that lies and lies are okay.
How much do we live?
As studies, we lie every day between 10 and 200 times.
Many of these lies apply as a warning.
Another study shows that strangers are three times in the first 10 minutes of a meeting.
Lies to recognize or "detect lies" is an important to learn for each person, and this is both from personal and professional reasons.
Within a society game, such as slaughters, where it is the goal to call you, it is a series of knowledge-based skills based on scientific data, which were gathered during the past six decades of universities that conducted large research projects, particularly in the fields of psychology and physiology.
A research result is that most old myths have been discovered of lies.
Lies look at one in the eyes.
They're smooth, smooth, comforted, and not always crying.
However, you can not close that these lies are difficult to discover and discover.
A dedicated lies artist can turn to the truth by learning something about the structure of the proof, which fair face expression, question and Timing.
I have made a few years to investigate the scientific results of the comprehensive and steadily growing area of the disappearance, and it is clear that the removal of a drunk is a modern capacity that is easy to learn and help us in our comprehensive world, especially if the establishment or the demands of persons or negotiations or the management of their own professional responsibilities.
Good lies are very good in order to appreciate others to retreat their interest and control their own emotions, and they spend intuitively as they are accepted by others.
Thanks to the research we know that the extroversed people are more often lie than invested people that men often "the same orientated" lies optical than women whose lies are more "oriented to others" - normally they want to protect the feelings of others - that married people are less to lie their partners than unmarried people (or the lies they say, they are most "feated lies").
We also know that if a person has been disappeared as an unfair, others feel less debt to have this person angels.
How do you know whether someone lies?
First, watching the normal behaviour of this person.
This is called "Baselining", the outdoor position.
It provides a reference point to the later assessments of changes.
Watch the stop, the laughing, the stimm quality of the person of your attempt.
You should better know when someone usually tricks his feet, so they don't accuse him to unjust when he triggers him during a meeting with his feet.
Then look at anxiety of abusive and non-verbale behaviour.
Consider these ingredients as alarm clocks that write, not as a proof of disappearance.
People who doubt may be encouraging when they try to remember their story. Maybe they show their feet in the direction of the door or they move in direction, change their position in a significant way or show a "Attention according to the option," this deep, relaxing, and changing in the stop if all hard questions are passed.
Questions are often readily signed that a settlement is passed to keep up after this relaxation according to the opposite view.
Also, look at the language of your person's test.
Scott Peterson is famous when he used the past form when he stated that his killed marriage is still alive and a national search for her.
Delicate people can also use a distant language: "I had no sexual relationship with this woman... Miss Lewinsky" or if you've repeated a curious question in the whole.
The most frequently verbal signs are subtle.
Some people use "qualific language," when they answer a clinical question: "Well... to tell you the truth... as long as it is known to me... by best knowledge and conscience."
The response will be highlighted as shock, so often the alarm closures.
There are no samples to discover lies, but you can learn capabilities through which a disappearance is possible.
Thanks to these capacitys, everyone can be rarely to the victim of offenders, both in private and in professional life.
An oil pipeline plan is processed after danger by long-term US authorisation
A few days after the Obama Register has dismissed the approval of a planned oil pipeline of Canada to the golf of Mexico, where the company has strengthened and at the same time undertakings is trying to build the pipeline company to replan the project so that you can return to normality again.
TransCanada said on Monday night, that the planned pipeline will be removed from the ecological sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska.
The company announced the decision on a press conference in the Parliament’s House of Nebraska.
Alex Perbax of TransCanada said that the company continues to be sure that the pipeline will finally be approved, even with another history.
This came after an announcement of the Foreign Minister in the past week, after a decision on a federal authorisation for the project, until the new possible period is checked in the area of Sandhills in Nebraska and the Ogallalala-Aquifer, a large water-site insurance.
"This is a step forward," said the Republic of Lee Terry, a Republic of Nebraska, against Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Ministry of Foreign, a decision may be made up to 2013, after the elections in the next year, even if officers learn that politicians were involved in the decision.
Obama explained last week in a written statement that the decision was a task of the Foreign Minister and said to support it.
The 1700 miles-Pipeline was connected with the Mexique golf.
She would have 700,000 barrel oil per day from the province of Alberta to the refrigerants in Texas pump.
The Pipeline had to go through six countries.
They hate the environment, but they love labour markets, because they appreciate that the pipeline produces 20,000 jobs.
However, the legislators Nebraskas, who are against the plan, take the laws to enhance a return from the region of Sandhills and the Ogallalala-acquifer, a main source of drinking water and warming.
The current study on the impact of the environment of the Foreign Minister has discovered that the project would only have little impact on the environment, but the source of energy economy claims that the Ministry has requested a separate song of the review procedure focusing on two issues.
One is whether a lobbyist who was introduced by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a complaint of Hillary Clinton, was in an interesting conflict.
The other is whether an undertaking, which was designed to carry out original study, was an unrealised choice since it is connected to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle applauded because she probably had a little kid in fear to fall
A New York family states that the Disco Dava Patti LaBelle in the Lobby of her Manhattan’s building had got a tobacco case that would have made her little daughter so feared that she had been put to fear.
The Tirade of Lady Marmalade's 18 months old Genevive Monk feared her that she led to "perspective changes, sleeping" and "effective fear for for strangers" she said to her family before the Supreme Court in Manhattan.
On November 10, when the carrier Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, was a child gardener, and Genevievie wanted to stop a family flight.
During Kevin Monk took the car, Roseanna Monk went on the arm to the Lobby in its building at Riverside Boulevard.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter for a moment.
"Abody appeared after me and said, 'You know what your daughter just does?" I said, "Yes," and went to take her back on the arm," she said.
LaBelle encouraged the worse woman.
"She said in a aggressive sound, 'You should not put your daughter near the door,' said Roseanna Monk.
I said to her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She was warmed and began to flood - she used the F door and the A door and was very laugh...
She had a flat water in her hand and began to cut out of the flat on me.
She said Genevie would be hysteric.
"I said to this woman, 'See what you did with my daughter,' said the child's mother.
LaBelle turned on her mother, who had still been on the arm, and had to be kept back from her guidance and moved to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The baby cried so much that it had to be transmitted, she said.
LaBelle family later asked for an excuse, but no answer received.
The LaBelles Chief and Representatives did not respond to calls in which a opinion was requested.
The case is not close to a certain damage, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said he was not a honor in mind and the family plans, the money they take, the child-sharing assistance.
"We want Patti LaBelle to take the responsibility of her behaviour," said Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is absolutely inaccessible, particularly if it is a child gardener against the day that brings a 18 months old baby on the arm."
Climate oppressions increase the economy
In the first year, when Mario López Valdez is at the government, the unemployment and the black work increased in Sinaloa while foreign investments were returned and slowed up the economy.
In 2011, Sinaloas' s history will remain in remembrance. It is the first year in which Mario López Valdez seems to be the initiativer of the Wandel and has caused great hopes for the economic growth to the government. However, in the context of climatic oppositions, the growth could not be the speech, but the most important economic indicators have disappeared.
The lower temperatures in February caused not only millions of losses in agricultural levels, but also increased the growth of the State economy in the first quarter year and reduced the overall economic activity by 3,6 percent This is mainly on the historical development of agricultural development by 31.16 percent, which increases in further economic sectors.
According to one by the Council of Mexico for the Development Rural Sustentable (that the Mexican Council for Sustainable Agricultural Development) report on the impact of the Frost was defended by 582.000 Hectars of agricultural landscapes used, which completed 78.03 percent, and the remaining 21.07 percent of the feeding, mass and kitchen are partly disappeared.
The Institute of Statistics y Geography observed a rapid growth of unemployment in the Mexican State, since from January to March 55 053 inhabitants of Sinaloas had no employment. In the second quarter, the unemployment rate increased at 5,28 percent, and from July to September 6,19 percent, 74 000 unemployed in Sinaloa. This is 18 969 more than in the first quarter of the year.
Manage Liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa in the year comes back to several factors. The economic scientist Gerardo López Cervantes, Decan of the Faculty for Economic and Social Sciences of the Autónoma University (UAS), commented that the public institutions's policy explains the growing unemployment.
"When we are currently observed, it is an increase in the unemployment that has to do with several factors.In addition, with losses of liquidity on the market due to the medium-related regulations by the legislation which has been decided to combat money wars in the Congress, because for those who are not easy to allow them to invest or use them for something else."
Migration stopped
López Cervantes argued that the growing unemployment also has a demographical factor.
"The number of people who have left the country to search for for foreign work, especially in the United States, has gone back. This is going to return to introduction problems and otherwise because there is also difficult to find job.
Black Work
The analysis of the labour market in Sinaloa is even more difficult when you take into account the high share of the black work, which includes 60.38 percent of the employees in the country without paying social insurance.
To the unemployment and black work, the lower lenses in the entire Mexico, in accordance with the Statistics of the Institute of Mexico of Social Secure (Mixic Social Safety) and the Secretariat of the Work and Social Preview (Regulation Authority for Employment and Social Privacy in Mexico).

The Court approved the transition to the digital television in Mexico for 2015
The conversion of similars to digital signals in the past years is the most important changes in the world.
The Supreme Court of Justice of Mexico (SCJN) which the constitutional statements imposed by the Senate and the Deputy House against the Presidialer Order and the force to submit the conversion of similar signals to digital signs from 2021 to 2015, due to the lack of eight votes required for law-determination.
A minority of four Ministers, including the President of the Principal Court of Justice, John Silva Media, was the view that the President Felipe Calderón has not overlooked its competences when he expressed the law Secretariat with the details on the circumstances of the earthquarters.
This decision was denied by the Constitution Street in life, since he did not receive the necessary majority of eight votes to decide on constitutionality or non-Constitutionality, so that the law remains in force.
The project for the event developed by the Ministerin Olga Sánchez Cordero was proposed to explain the statutory secretariat for constitutional jurisdiction, as for which the radio and television regulations concerned the Commission Federal de Telecommunications (Coffee) (Free Commission for Telecommunication in Mexico) is responsible, so that the Legislative Secretariat would conform to the Erarchic principles and the precaution of legislation.
In addition to the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Corder themselves.
In this case, both the Senate and the Deputy Chamber of Constitution against the Legislative Secretariat, the Minister of Sánchez Corder did not advise the legislature and put all activities to establish digital transmission.
The Council also deleted the object made by the Deputy Chamber without entering in the debate on the project for which the Minister Sánchez Corder was also responsible.
In its contribution, the President of the Minister expressed not to be accepted with the project's arguments, but in the sense that the country Government cannot regulate the measures to take the public management.
"I don't even believe that if you would be doing that the independence of the regulation place would be affected." She also recalled that the planning of strategic policy areas, such as the telecommunication sector, is responsible for constitutional reasons for the central government, because it leads the State situations.
The replacement of the similar signal by digital is one of the most important changes that have occurred in the last years of the world, and it affects better use of the radio spectrum, increased quality of the signal and more channels.
The decrease of the conversion, she said, is an exhibition of the use of digitalization, which is a decision in public interest which has not only technical aspects "and they involve economic, social, political and security aspects."
These matters, she stated, "but the actions of the whole system needed, in accordance with the principle of economic leading by the State, they contained a group of characteristics that the constitution is leged in the hand of the central government."
She remembered that many countries in the world had already performed the digital conversion, even though they were available over highly specialized institutions.
It is not possible to conclude that the Government includes the competence of the Congress, because the laws adopted by the legislation would be protected”.

In the middle of the new Italian government
The designed Premier Minister, Mario Monti, is tomorrow with the President of Italy to present this new government that the crisis, which Italy has led to the border of the Economic Communities, will provide sterlines.
The designed Premier Minister, Mario Monti, is tomorrow with the President of Italy to present this new government that the crisis, which Italy has led to the border of the Economic Communities, will provide sterlines.
A Communication from the presidency paid announced that the Monti appointed on Sunday would take place with the President of the State, Giorgio Napolitano to confirm the government training.
It is concluded that it will be presented to a majority of the Technocrat Kabinet, although it is not clear when the new President will come to its office.
Monti said he would present the results of the conversation with the political parties on government training.
"I want my absolute confidence in the capacity of our country to complete these difficult times," said the former EU journalists.
Monti not expressly confirmed the government training, but out of its comments it indicates that the obstacles are overwhelmed.
The "Rahmen is well hidden now," he added.
In less than three days, a government is much less time than normal, but Ireland is fighting against a political and financial crisis that has paid the costs of the debts to a non-profit height.
The new, introduced by the former EU Commissioner Monti, must decide to be a hard sparpack requested by the European politicians to recover the proposed confidence in Italy.
The pressure on the heat last on Monti was still increased by the weak market situation, due to the Italian State authorities for 10 years with 7 percent of interests. This is the position that Greece and Ireland seemed to provide the European rescue screen.
Emma Marcegilla, President of the Italian industry Conf industry, participated the press after a meeting with Monti: "We would say we would support this government after all the forces."
We believe that this government is the last opportunity to get Italy out of this emergency.
The success of Montis was significantly increased by the support of the PDL Party of Silvio Berlusconi, which had to come back on Saturday after the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are intended to achieve good results," said Angelino Alfano, Secretary of the Middle Right Party.
The support of the PDL, the largest Italian Party, is essential, because many of its members have spoken against a majority of Technocrats, which formed the Monti.
Support by the Parliament
The new Monti Government requires strong parliamentary support to implement the unlimited steps.
In response to its efforts or the delay of the reforms, a recurrent attack of the financial markets could be re-encouraging.
The Italian Union of Foreign Banks is a catastrophe, also pressure.
Monti began on Monday with its discussions with political parties, workers and entrepreneurs, and youth and women organizations.
The service provider shall be completed.
Monti has been appointed this Sunday of Napolitano, which has set an extremely rapid government change in Gang as a response to the crisis.
After a short opposition to the end of the last week, as it was known that Berlusconi would come back, the uncertainty on the success of the new President has reached the costs for the Italian State licensees again.
A rescue of Italy with a State Debt of €1,8 Billions, would be too much for the current EU rescue screen.
Monti said that his Government should be held up to the next elections, which are at the moment of 2013, notwithstanding the preconcept that the political people would only give him time to implement reforms, instead of dealing with the elections.
Monti explained that he would like to take politicians into his chabinet, but the large parties are that this should only exist from technicals to be a note of their concerns in view of the procedure covered by the pressure of the financial market.
Political sources show that the mutual unbelievers and the unity between the parties make the involvement of people from political life complex.

The quarant moved Costa Rica to his tournament to the feast of his twentieth year
"In Costa Rica, it's a dream that makes it."
In the exclusive talk with Viva, the Basist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam says that the band is prepared to give the next Sunday in the National City of one of its best concerts.
More than 20 years they were expected, but the band ensures that she's a dream when they played in Costa Rica.
The Basist and the Foundant of the Group, Jeff Ament, who gave Viva last week from Brazil from an exclusive interview.
The band is in the south American part of their tournaments to the feast of its twenty-year-old property and on Sunday, the 20th, they make their only stop in Central America.
At 19:30, they were engaged in the National City with the band The X from Los Angeles and Las Robertas from Costa Rica.
You read a statement from the conversation which is found in the online output of La Nation.
For your costarian fans, a dream is done when Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica: Do you know what it means for your fans?
To play in Costa Rica is a dream that has also done for us.
This is just the second time that we played in South and Central America, and until now it was great.
I've been only once to vacation in Costa Rica. It's a beautiful country that we decide to stay there for a few days.
For us, it's exciting to bring our music there.
I ask you this because the band factors are completely granted. They live the days before the concert.
What are you talking about your most obvious factors?
Thank you to stand on our side all these years.
We've been using about 21 years until we came to Costa Rica. Thank you for waiting for so long and it makes us sorry to have been used so long until we came here.
Some people are even thinking that your concert will be the greatest show of the year.
Is it not a little pressure from your visit?
Some of the most greatest shows we have set up in the last 21 years have been held in the last two weeks.
We played on a few rieshows in Sao Paulo and we hope that they made us fit for this concert in Costa Rica.
Really, we've like to play there.
We love this country, we like to surround and we are endorsed by the Djungel. This is why Costa Rica is to the best countries of the world.
How did you meet Costa Rica and his bottles?
Many of our friends are Surfer, and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo, where the waves are easily unrealisable.
My friends have always gone to the surfense to Costa Rica and Nicaragua. Join with Mexico, we have learned the wonderful area to survey. In this way, we have learned about people who love the surfy.
With a view to the tour you ordered your ries show with many lovers.
What plans do you have for event in Costa Rica?
As we've never been playing there, we don't have borders.
We will try to give the best possible show with many different songs. We want to play a few songs from each album and offer a good and multi-party repertoire.
You're never getting your repertoire again.
Why?
I think this is partly because we have nine plates and can play more than 120 songs. Everyone likes another song, so the decision we're going to play everywhere is not easy to fly.
If we have no longer played two or three songs that we have no longer played in the repertoire, we can get our concentration better and we are surprised because they call us for the reasons why these songs have affected us.
This makes the show more interesting for us, and I believe, therefore, for the public.
With this tournament, you celebrate your twenty-year-old story.
If you look back, can it be difficult to believe you in your success?
Yeah, it's total.
First of all, I think no one of us has imagined to play once in a great rock band, and it's also over 20 years, and it operates like a dream.
We also put on these blessings and find it great to be able to make music together now.
We like us and are pleased to bring music.
We have a chance to go to the places of the world that we ever wanted to visit.
The things couldn't be better.
What did you mean to have participated actively in the birth hour?
It has always been a honour to belong to this group of large bands.
We're well happy with the Sound Garden people, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprised and richly unrealistic when a movement out of a group of friends is out of a group.
Go and get a band out of a city, but it's not usually when five or ten groups come from the same city at the same time.
We're boasting about and feeling earned to be part of the Seattle Group.
Sometimes we're still playing together.
In the last year, we were on a festival with Alice in Chains and Canada with Mudhoney and we saw sound gardens on their tournaments. We were glad to be happy with all of them and it teach us to be part of this coming Seattle Sound.
It is also very unrealistic that a band, such as your musicians remained so long.
Yes, four of us are playing together for 21 years and Matthew (Cameron) stripped to us 13 years ago. This is only much more time than many bands.
First of all, I think we all are happy to be alive, and also to take care of each other.
We are all close friends, why we have opened musical ways that give the freedom to experiment.
One trusted to another and his music.
Your relation to peace has not always been easy. On the other side you could always do your success you wanted to.
How do you find a balance?
The way we have grown, it has made us easier to find a balance.
We're sure to not be too often on tournee, because it's too easy to spend this game with large people that love your music.
As you think people have come because of music, remember that you're the music and what she's called in life needed to watch without to be a famous Rockstar.
What memories do you have on your other project Mother Love Goode?
I think we've written very good songs, and at first it was great.
We were three years old a band, which never made a plate out until Andy's death.
We've been excited to have been used so long. We've still been well with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who built the band with us. If I hear a song or photos, I think about what was for a unglazing man Andy and how he brought me to laugh. It was always a joy to go to work to laugh together and talk about music and football and many other topics.
He was an extraordinary person, and we missed him.
The domestic bands Las Robertas are responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it that you know their work, especially Eddie Vedder, and the band you've searched for the opening?
Yes, the production has sent us videos of several groups and this band is best. So we're nervous to see what Las Robertas can provide life. This will be determined attentive.
Why do you always change the text of Yellow Ledbetter when you are alive?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), I don't know.
He sing him, and I think he can't sing the first thing he's inside.
From whom are you affected as a Bassist?
From so many+
To the first ones I have included Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so many I could talk to the whole afternoon of the Bassists that I like.
How did Pearl Jam have done to keep the creature in life, although it is not a modern appearance?
I think we all don't feel very close to the word of Grunge.
When I think about it, I'm inventing the bands I've mentioned before, for example, Mudhoney, Sound Garden, Nirvana and all the others who have arrived at the same time. If they're still important today, I'll find the great, because it's pleasant to hear this music and make bands like Mudhoney now better music than ever.
At first, her music was dark, now she's more positive.
Why?
It's interesting because I think there's a few songs on the new album that could make something easy to do. But there's also other songs like The End or Just Breathe, which are invented as very dark songs, even though they have something positive on themselves.
Boths came to me the dreams when I heard how Ed she played. It's very dark songs.
I think if you're going to be old and something traumatic has happened in your life - for example, if you lose a family member or a friend - it affects your artistic creature and your music and these two songs clearly for me.
But I'm also thinking that you can be a happy man and still dark music.

The speaking of both presidents in the city of Guadalajara "referred to exchange information on all policy areas between the two countries," the Chairman of the South American country has known on its website.
According to local media, Mujica was looking for Calderón's support in terms of the case with France when the French Government Chief Nicolas Sarkozy had set the G20 in the French city of Cannes the South American country to a list of tax paradies.
In his diskurs, Sarkozy continued to exclude those countries who still come as a tax paradise from the international Community, which was rejected by Uruguay and granted a request for his ambassador in the European country.
Mexiko has been the Presidency of the G20, a group consisting of the world's most powerful weak and industrial countries. Since January this year, a agreement on the exchange of tax information on the prevention of duplication with the South American country.
In the past few years, the Government of Uruguay has tried to facilitate the consolidation of agreements on the exchange of tax information to be addressed from the "Green List" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which are not all international standards to cooperate in tax situations.
Since 2004, a Free Trade Agreement between Mexico and Uruguay, which has contributed to an increased good exchange between the two countries.
The snowful installer relates to "Super Mario 3D Land" the third size
Super Mario has never been in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D country" he fighted for the love of the girl in Stereo-Technology.
The game that comes on the layouts of all the world from the beginning to the properties of the transboundary 3DS console, which can be tridimensionally played without a particular brief.
"Mary is the figur that needs to say how the Stereos copy functions without brille," Omar Álvarez assured the responsible for the specialized presses at Nintendo in Spain with the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez explained that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first video game of Nintendo, which has been developed from the beginning for this console" because until now have been successful articles like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" annexes already existing.
The Nintendo's talker emphasized that although there is three sizes, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "emotional" video game that allows a fast, flight game.
Álvarez confirmed that "Super Mario 3D Land" two games in an enthusiastic: the first part is easy to initiate the lowest users.
Then experts may be able to turn to the different levels of playing more difficult, a "stream round".
Moreover, the users can choose in real time between a "aggressive D" or one who only performs the duration of the action. To overcome the obstacles to become victims of the "optical effect" must always be played three sizes.
This fluid Super Marios into the threedimensional world also means the return of the Figur to a tragic console, which has been no longer the case since 2005.
With this video game, Nintendo runs the fan of the Saga and resumes the success of the last exits: The snowful installer must overcome platforms with dangerous dangerous risks to release Princess Peach.
However, the players have news on movements, the environment, the clothes and the enemies - and a " playable" luigi.
Column offers Portillos for the delivery of Portillos to the United States
The President of Guatemala, Álvaro Colom, announced this Sunday that he would lead to the delivery of the former Governor Alphonso Portillo to respond to this in the United States for the disappearance of $70 million.
This ends the proceedings on the application of the United States to deliver Portillo, so that it can be made before the court.
In a press conference, Column confirmed, its decision was based on the independence of justice manager and government, taking into account that a decision-making court had already ordered the delivery.
He noted that during his Government, he did not have acted in court decisions and had held all claims of delivery noticed by the Government.
Except Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marrokin are delivered for murder and serious corporal crime, Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both on drug trade.
The Colom's action is a government act which is carried out when all the legal and constitutional institutions have been issued to condemnate the former president of the Staat Chairman (2000-2004).
According to the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and of the Constitutional Guatemalas, Portillo must be issued when his statute is closed in Guatemale and guaranteed its human rights.
Portillo was released for the submission of 120 million Quetzals in the Ministry of Defence during his government time, and the exemption had been made before, but the Minister had resolved the case to be new.
Trinjove has helped 6,000 young people affected social exclusion
The organization was called to avoid marginalization of young people without vocational training.
The first 25 years of the Social Aid Organization Trinijove had made significant results: In this fourth year, 6000 young people were supported by social exclusion to find out a way out of their difficult situation.
The workplaces created for this social group are about hundreds.
At the end of the year, a yearday was held in an event in the former workshops of Fabra i Coats, which participated over 300 people.
Trinijove was called in the City quarter of Trinitat Vella with the goal of life, young people with low training, without work, with drug problems threatened by the risk of marginality.
At the festival of Sant Andreu, there were many responsible for institutions and institutions working in these 25 years.
The participation of political representatives of different directions on election time-making was the impartiality of the work made by Trinijove.
In addition to the President of the Generalitat (Parlament of the Autonoms of the Catalonian Region), Artur Mass, and his colleagues Jordi Pujol took part in the festivals of the former Socialist Education Minister Ernest Maragall and the former citizens and the current left-grown city Council Ricard Goma.
The large room of Fabra i Coats also visited the current Catalonic Minister for Social and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the Social Work of Sparkasse La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas noted that Trinijove was in very difficult times called in life and that today's time is not less complex. But he added that the work made up to now is a good basis.
For the Presidents of the Generalitat, Trinijove is a form of view to fighting difficult circumstances and gives people hope in difficulties.
"The economic crisis is for the union and the work that he provides is nothing new," he said.
The placed house in which Riesen Party was organised was placed
The owners had 11 of the 13 apartments in the building on the street of Balmes No 51 (Barcelona).
The 12 house officers left the building tomorrow afternoon without opposite.
All states that the alptrooms of the neighbors of the house No 51 found a end on the street Balmes.
Two persons, at midday, voluntaryly left the building that they had undertaken illegally and organized great festivals that had dedicated the neighbourhood to disappearance.
After the removal, the door was exchanged to avoid similar situation.
"To now the access will be controlled," the houseman confirmed.
The households who were dedicated 11 of the 13 apartments of the building - the rest were inhabited - took the entire electrical installation and part of the water supply. They also had stopped the walls and left all kinds of mull, especially the doses with alcoholic drinks.
In the three lower periods, large partys were celebrated until two days and the middle to disappear.
Besides the building there is a discoothek, Balmes 51, which also causes damage of it.
Her owner, Mary Pantinat explained Europe Press that her business would have returned to 80% since the start of the house order.
The owners of the Discothek argued that the households made their unlawful competition, because they sold the drinks to three euros, while they costed 10 euros in the discoothic.
In addition, the owner of the free time local was shown by the neighbors for rest, while the laughter was not held by the visitors of the disco, but by the households and especially by the guests of the festivals organized there, and the visitors were always more and longer than in the past weeks.
The complaint of the discoothek explained that the decrease was so large that it agreed with the owner of the building to pay for the last nine months.
The Guardia Urbana (State Police) also confirmed that she had received more complaints in the past few weeks.
The President of the PP (Partido Popular - Volkspartei) in the Board of Barcelona, Alberto Fernández Díaz, has requested the last week to create the building immediately and to get the problems of the busy resident as well as the origin of the city rental in the Griff.
He explained that before the summer there was only an item of the building, but that the owners of the house in the last months in all days of the building and almost all apartments were predicted. In some, they even came to the building.
In this sense, he added that "It is necessary to put the crime to a end and act against the social actions in the building."
Yesterday, another building was created in the city quarter of Nou Barris from the Catalynian police.
During 15:30, the police was closed to Montral No 35 when she had received a call from a neighbour who had observed how four people wanted to enter into the building.
The four were detained indirectly.
Park or mountain?
The architects are deleted from the stripes on Honorre with the description.
The 16th tour describe opens the debate on the importance of Collserola in Barcelona to New.
In the middle of the 1980s, the Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), the manager published its scope on the promotion of Collserol.
The Broschüre described the mountain as a great park in Barcelona City.
He was even compared with the Central Park of New York in numbers.
In 1987, the park was back to the top border of Barcelona, because the capital city of Catalonians was part of the few not to the north-South regulation, but to top (Gebirge) and below (Mer).
The institution of Collserolas as a natural park plays this idea.
As an example, he now served not more the Central Park, but the Yellowstone with wild shoes in the role of the yogiberary.
As far as the city was in September, it was found in 16 competitions for other accessor to Collserola.
Unfortunately, a door refers to the concept of a park.
Or, it's like this, or someone's supposed to put the tour on the country.
The question is from himself: Collserola, Park or Mount?
The description is not only from organising view, but also in relation to the city's conversation the theme in the mouth of all architects in Barcelona.
It is almost a recurrent to the two members of this old chain that are in the surrounding.
And exactly this fact provides the substance for one of the rare agreements between what three architectures in Barcelona thinking about, and some university professors who have admitted themselves to the project.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: The description is appropriate.
For Roldán " it is necessary" after the attack on the coasts on the "Front on the mountain" as far as the discurs of Ildefons Cerda, which has not been exposed on the green bottles.
"You should get out of the principle that Barcelona's greatest park is of the street.
Otherwise, because he's good.
Collserolo is more complex," the architect urged for which the title "Tore of Collsero" is "lexical case" in itself: it must not be "comm access to a park, but as a limit of areas in which it must be treated."
Modell, like Roldán and Bayona with strong construction experience, considers the proposal as a "intellectual challenge", which is "related" in itself.
The "Uncertainty, which brings itself today with the creation of a public space" according to the experiences of the 1980s, which had their "sweeding time" in the Forum.
The first fear is the own exclusion to what can be built.
"Whatever to be limited is always to determine the next step", i.e. to overlook it.
"You must think about new building-building planning instruments, because the present [related to the Metropolitano General (PGM)] can lead to a real catastrophe."
Modell, who holds a question, is simply the side of Collserola, which goes in the direction of Vallesana, " can be understood as a park that doesn't go in Barcelona" or a pure topografic reason.
Modell recalls that there is already a study of the patronnat de Collserol, which should not "stake in taub ears," although it is grateful that she has given her group the possibility to participate in this project "for the first moment".
He also notes that the neighbourg is the city of the Geneitan Letter that allows the architecture to participate in the debate, although he explains whether this technical profile is the multidisciplinary teams called in life ("the right", he said, "We should only be a tool."
Bayona states that the response to the question in the title of this article is complex, since in the terms of description there is a global view of Collserola: "There were 16 competitions in the cereal" he says, "after the Achse Gebirge-Mer, but there is no average vision that considers the area in its entirety."
At least, in his case, it took part in the 16 competitions.
In other words, the programme and the definition of a project for a gate would collect the architecture of the Tor.
His view should certainly ensure the city that the stripes directly over the Ronda de Dalt are equipped in its whole length, which produces a certain transition between the city and the Greenzones.
Casino lost Jonás Larrazábal, who comes free
After 72 days Sweeves, the composed of the Casino Red released the brother of the citizen of Monterrey from the process that is conducted against him because of a severe impression.
After 72 days of prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal is released after the complainant of the Casino Red before the Second District penalty, which led the process against the brother of the citizen of Monterrey because of an impression.
After the attentate on the Casino Royale, Sergio Gil García, owner of Casino Red, published a number of photos and videos on which Manuel Jonás is able to help him pay for a money sum so that the city manager accepts the secret operation of the Wetthaus.
Following the crime, the State authorities opened a criminal procedure against the brother of the Pansist citizen who was adopted on 2 September for 30 days.
Four hours later, with the officer of the Ministry of Public 3 and Delitos Employal Delitos, he was led to Casa de Arraigo 1 in Barrio Antiguo of the capital.
In this place, he stayed 49 days after a second penalty order after the officer of the Ministry of Pubblica had rejected the crimes because of deterioration and organized crimes.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Casino Red City of Cadereyta, because he had met the owner of Casino Red with one half million Pesos. He remained just a few hours in the Mediterranean Secure Treatment Trade.
The authorities allowed him to participate in the court procedure as the island of the Stedical prison of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On 25 October, he was proposed by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Governance of the Distrit, Jorge Yánez, to a duty regulation, which determined that after almost two months of the period of investigation, sufficient evidence to discuss Jonás in order to pay the payment of 1,5 million fees to the representatives of the Wett House to open it in this case.
This Monday, the Author of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, the judge José Luis Pecina, was sentenced to the brother of the citizen, so he is put on foot in the next hours.
During the hearing, Ramiro Aria asked the officer of the Ministry of Publico, Garcia Gómez, whether the offence had been paid, and who the owner of the lawyer had spoken his remission.
According to the 197/2011 court, Jonás Larrazábal is free to speak, and there is no effect on the process, and there is no decreased injury.
After the hearing of the Author of the Wethaus against 15:50, Larrazabal Bretón was immediately placed on free foot.
The Secretary of Judge Yánez, Jorge Yánez, went to the fortified prison of San Nicolas de the Garza, to share Jonás that he was free and would put his case to the acts.
He also informed him about the correct settlement on an immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome provides details about the aircast case, where the Government Secretary Franc Blake and other seven people have come to life.
The Secretariat of Communications y Transportes - SCT (Secretariat for Communication and Transport in Mexico) informed that the investigation results of the accidents in which the Government Secretary Franc Blake Mora and other seven persons have come to live, indicate that the Hubscrawser with its entire untranslated structure was directly contrary to the ground without that the pilot could introduce notice.
At a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary for Communication and Transport, confirmed that the pilot had confirmed before starting the weather conditions had been appropriate for the aircraft.
"The content that the propeller flows in 25 meters height contact with trees, while the Hubshawser lost the roof, it seems to demonstrate that the Helikopter had several contacts on the ground."
He also explained that the Hubcrawser was built for 19 insses, so he fulfilled all the conditions for the transport of the staff.
He also said that in the areas where the machine was produced, there were no fucking guns found.
"After the search, no airports were found at other places which affect the whole structure.
The Hubstrawser was built for 19 instances, so he complyed all the conditions for the transport of persons.
The area shows a 7 to 30 degrees.
At the same time, it is priority to get the research results as soon as possible, however, these months may have been able to keep a year even.
On the other hand, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airopuertos y Services Auxiliares (Secretariat for Airports and Help Services in Mexico), that the Hubstrawser of the Mayor Presidental State fleet with travel speed and the aircraft was caught on a slight distance.
"This information increases the adoption that it was at the time of the resolvement of normal air operation."
At a press conference, the Head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, set up six relevant points that should be taken into account during the investigation:
Find:
In accordance with the air standards, it was a flight in accordance with the rules of viewing the flight. This means that the manager had to have sufficiently looked at the air and on the ground.
Weather conditions:
The AICM identified appropriate weather conditions when starting. During the further flight towards the border area between Mexico and the Mexico State, some deep clouds were opened.
Selected aircraft errors:
It is possible that the manager had chosen a lower area with a better view towards the Cuernvaca Tal.
Appendix:
The overall coordinates and the last radar appointment of the Hubshubers are agreed. It may not have given any control loss over the aircraft nor a disappearance of the aircraft.
Strengthening the oversight of the aircraft in a limited area:
The information available to the present time indicated that the Hubcrawser was deleted from just and long-term direction.
The pattern of the destroyed aircraft allows to imagine that the Hubshupper was closed with his unfair structure on the ground.
No indicators on brain or explosion:
The rest of the airport offers in the case of the airport will not close on the block or on the explossion.
The latest investigation results are added to a number of territory contacts.
The aircraft was found at a level of 9200 feet above the sea level. The surface is low and shows a reduction of seven to thirty degrees.
The photos show the sequence in which the Hubshawser has probably gone to Bruch.
Some information indicates that the Hubstrawser could have had several land contacts.
Following a minimum search in a area which was gone through the mixed area, there could not be found widespread airports that strengthen the adoption that the non-transfered air structure was contrary to the ground.
MSS announces a research protocol for the purpose of the Gene for fatity
It is a social insurance officer of Mexico, which provides a research project to establish the Gender for fatity in children and youths supported by specialists of the IPN.
The Institute Mexicano del Seguro Social - IMSS (Social insurance officer Mexico) announced that there is a research project to discover the Gender for Vesselity in Children and youths under the title "Newnessness network" which should be found in connection with genetic brands in oversight.
Miguel Cruz López, Chief of the Unity of Medical Research and Biochem (Division for Medical Research, Training Training Biochemie) said that an interdisciplinary team was built from doctors, hospitals, food specialists and social workers.
This team is supported by Postgraded Students and Students at the National Institute de Health (INSP) and at the Centre de Investment and de Student Avanzados (Cinvestav) of the National Political Institute (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the study. Interests can come to the MISS sports offices in the Valley of Mexico, where the Saturday is 8:00 tests with children and youths are performed every Sunday.
He noted that the investigation on the sports area of Cuahutemoc (in the West of the Federal State Mexico) began and continued on the sports place of Nezahualcoyolt (in the East of the Federal State Mexico).
If the objective of 500 to 600 research persons is reached, the study will continue on the sports area of Independence (in southern of the main city) and concluded on the other part of Morelos (in the north of the capital area).
He explained that the objective of the study is the knowledge of the factors and the role of genetics in connection with the development of fatty and the identification of risk factors of mexican children and youth to prevent chronic degenerative diseases.
At the end of the world’s diabetes, he explained that three thousand children and youth aged six to 14 years with the understanding and taking into account food demands for their parents.
You will also ask questions about their physical activity and their family disease previews to control the risk factors, diabetes or negative inability to be effected.
He increased that, at the summers referred to in the events, the investigations were measured (standard, size, number), their blood pressure controlled and determined blood values such as glucose level, triglyceride, Czechreid, Insulin and genetic factors (see the identification of Genen in connection with fat liveliness in children).
Cruz López noted that this investigation would be carried out by the concern of health personnel on the alarming increase of young people.
"The health surveys from 1999 and 2006 indicated that in about six years the share of female boys is about 77 percent, and that girls had adopted fatliness by 47 percent. The oversight has also increased dramaticly," the Specialist of the IMSS.
He demonstrated that the search for genetic brands was found because the genetic history of the Mexiko population was different from the other peoples.
He stated that a Mexican (in) average of 65 percent of Indian-American, to 30 percent of the European and to 5 percent of African disagreement, reflected in the genes related to diabetes and oversight.
In general, he explained that the genetics of fat liveliness were pressed in the inability to break the oversight of the energy taken to us (Calorie), so that it would be put into the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefits for the investigator would be used in a comprehensive investigation of the children in which it would be determined whether such a weight of oversight or fatity would be marked.
It would even be studied by the adventure of dark hairflows in the middle and innerarm (Akanthosis), which have been the probability of substance changed diabetes and diabetes in the prestadium.
All information would be treated confidently and communicated to the parents in writing by the doctors. The doctors explain to parents all the results of messy and offer changes in the style of life that are appropriate for prevention of diseases.
Cruz López explained that it was three basic factors responsible for oversight, fat liveliness and other chronic diseases: moving manager, which means lack of movement every day, the most time of the day before the televisor and use of the transportation, instead of walking short ways.
High Kalorie upgrade, which means an increased use of drinks and coal hydrates (Tamales, Brot, Pizza, Hamburger etc.) together with a high fat and egg and genetics that should be analyzed in this research project.
UNAM's content prevents ball players
Rafael Herrera, researchers at the Chemical Faculty at the Mexican University of the UNAM developed with polymers to make the mixture of anti-conditions and temperature results
If the signs were taken out from the road board, it would not be necessary to repair almost 200 000 slots when the rain time in the Zona Metropolitana del Valle de México (State area of the Tale of Mexico), Rafael Herrera Nájera, researchers at the University of Chemie (FQ), warned and assured that if the building and the maintenance of the Asphalt Layer was appropriate, reducing the number of clamps are significantly reduced or even completely disappeared.
In its term "coopers from technical views", which he held on the international year to chemical, he stated that the labor for which he is responsible to develop asylums changed with polymers to make a similar mixture that shows greater mechanical resistence in high and low temperatures.
Mrs. Najajera said that this kind of modified asphalt in territorys with extremely called climate, such as in some cities in the north of the country, should be used to improve the behaviour of the road bulletin and to avoid the removal of slaughters.
He explained that the asphalt - the most serious part of the earthly oil - a coal water connection, of which part has a high molecular weight - the so-called asphalt - and the other part of a lower - the so-called Malthenes. Commonly they give to the road's characteristic behaviour.
Zealastic behaviour of the asphalt means that this is in high temperatures of almost 180 °C as a fluid, it is very nervous and almost fixed at 50°C while it is low.
"This means that the oppositeability of the assemblies on the streets is not equal, but that one day, depending on the biological and temperature conditions," the Chemiseer took out.
The researchers of the FQ noted that the roads of Mexico’s city had most of them a flexible road legend that had been gathered from six material storys which contained the latest three asphalts.
Among the top ships a disappeared story of asphalt that had been stolen from small, asphalt and then defeated stones.
Each individual stone of this dismissible story shall be bathed in Asphalt.
If the vehicles continue to move and produce powers, it allows a good road distribution in the road bathroom.
"When it was modified, the powers would be distributed better," said the Chemianer.
"Otherwise of the divorce," he exhibited, "with a last scene that is called a tragging history that consists of small stones, i.e. from sand, who was also building in Asphalt.
As such damage are in contact with the road line, they need a larger mechanical force than the disappearance history and have to create delivery.
The most forces receive and distribute the tragedy, also requires an appropriate discipline and the material that it consists of, must be maintained.
The terms of behaviour, particularly infringement and temperature deficiencies, are also important to take into account the water, above all things," he said, "and it affects the behaviour of the divorce history significantly.
When the ground is wearing, water is dragged into the shooter and is only difficult to resolve. This causes the resurrection of all the road flights and then the residues of guns.
When a slope ends, he said, "It would first be the covering history, while the disappearing story will be affected at first. But the slaughter does not immediately, but it is a process that should be kept in the first signs by appropriate control programmes."
The member of the National Researcher System (National Research System Mexikos) stated that the vehicle load is a further important cause for the removal of clamps, and therefore, the dicks of each piece of road board must always be in relation to the vehicle load and must be ensured that this regulation should be kept in order to avoid frequency clamps.
Rafael Herrera argued that even many research work had been laid down, for example, about asphaltemulations that have already been on the market in other countries, and that the slaughters had simply and without use of high temperatures.
What did the candidate del Valle miss to be the new Miss Columbian?
Analysis of factors that resulted that Melina Ramírez Serna did not get the krone of the Miss Columbian.
The Valle replaces its 14th. Miss Title.
Again, Valle del Cauca went empty at the delivery of the Krone for Miss Columbia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to be satisfied to stand on the winner podium to see a silver chrone and the band she showed as a new Miss Columbie.
With that night, the Department has received results in Cartagena, where Mrs. Atlantic took the Krone and the Zeder, the Department already attended on 14 Miss Title and Melina Legios of Women from Valle del Cauca (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Isabel Romaro (1993), Gasce Aljure (1993), Gasce Aljure (1983), College Maria (Catalado), Stephané (2007), Markia Evers (1988), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Dina Romaro (1990), Dina isabel Romaro (1993), Garesce (1993), Gasce Aljure (1993), College), Stephanice (2007.
The great question that is today said: What was missed?
Since the result is the decline of a great favorite that she had shown in any vision that she had been available to be the new Miss Columbia. It was not on the part that she was elected to the Queen of the police and the Major Rostro Jolie of Vogue, a title that was also the beauty Queen Taliana Vargas and Natalia Navarro, and which took the krone of the Miss Columbia with home.
The first factor, which is essential for the decision of the Jury to recognize her first lady, is that she has not convicted the answer to the question "What book has affected you the most strongest and why?", which she was sent by Martín Murillo Gómez by the Carreta Literaria Leamus.
The young woman from Valle del Cauca asked the questionnaire:
"I read a lot, I think it's quite a way to civilize, last time I think that the book that was the most strongest for my childhood, 'The small prince' is, a rightly deep governing book.
It's a book of universal culture that we should all read. I just read a book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book that has 'Leidenties'.
A response that was to be a few opposite, first because of the sentence 'sich' and the second, because she didn't explain concretely how any book mentioned it had affected it.
But after the end of the Zeremonie, Melina explained that it feels quiet and happy with the result: "The universe is wise, what happens to happen.
And for all people: Please read a little 'The small prince'. It's a great book.
In other words, the love of El Valle is burned.
A journalist of Bogota stated that she was the privilege that all cases were the most home and that had received all the prices in front (Gastronomia Wottbewerber Oster, Public Order on the best-country and Reina Madre), "the other candidates had made amazing what the queen stressed, so that she could not clash on the bottle."
And this was noted at its first view in the bathroom at the street of the Hillton Hotel and at their two accommodations at the King's feast.
Although she was sure, she lacked the strength and the weakness that the representatives of Magdalene and Atlantics had made.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como en house" at the RCN, said that the fact that Melina was conquered to Miss ", says, the candidate who wind the most prices during the competition will finally not be kingin".
Furthermore, Valle went to the end of the press from the road - an ironym.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has not been able to convince the jury of their interest for social work, which lastly is the essential of the national beauty law.
It has already been his reason that two days before the composition of the International Jury Lucy Doughty, they were looking for a woman who had involved the social affairs of her country.
"It's not enough for a Miss Columbia. You must look out on the body and focus on the social acceptance, on the fact that she had already been working before the participation of projects," she said.
It is also speculated that Valle with its defects of the therry and the fibres that you had noted her in the magenge. But this is contrary because the jury chosed it as a candidate for 'natural beauty' with a healthy body, good food customs and responsible for physical work.
The royal of the Queens, Jorge Hernán Orozco, says that Melina had not the best body that it would be better, "but her problem with the figs at the edge that had not been aware of honestly said for me, pressed her point on the last day."
However, the journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos is the view that the mistakes of the woman from Valle del Cauca were the chirurgic attacks that she had undertaken.
"The operations are okay, but Valle didn't know how to make it right.
Her body has never been their strong side, and this place had to pay it."
By this price, which is the first time of the National Beauty Act, a grateful prejudice that should be true in the night. It was found that Raymundo Melina gave a treasury price to let them not come into the gentle of the Krone.
Anyway, whether it is true or not, it is the fact that Melina takes its domination year from today, not as a queen, but as a princess, a position that gives you the opportunity to be made in the name of the national beauty law of Columbia at one of the international competitions.
However, she will be one of the queens who, despite her superbeing attraction for the Chargena, entered into the story.
This was the work of the doctor who identified the body of Alfonono Cano
A lophoskopist from Cali was the man identified "Alfonso Cano" in the history.
The work of these officers plays a key role.
Last 4 November, a lophoskopist of the public prosecution unit (CTI) from Cali as the man who confirmed the identification of the Leader of the FARC (Furzas Armadas Revolutionarias de Colombia - Revolutionary Military Forces of Colombia) by compared to the Fingerabdrücke.
From the seven lophoskopists in the Division of the CTI, Eliazar González was working this week, a man from Puerto Tejada, who had been sentenced in criminal proceedings for 21 years.
At the beginning of his carrier, González worked in communities of Choko, where he often had to be in the dungle to reach the place where the bodys had to be identified.
In 2000, he went over to Valle and after the completion of the necessary course, he specialized himself on lophoskopies, which is the investigation of the hair that is equipped with the curations, i.e. the hand- and footboards.
In the week of the use against Alfonono Cano, Eliazar was pointed out to pack clothing for at least three days.
Something great was waiting for him.
Saturday night, he went to the town of Palmira to Cauca.
He knew that he had to identify two bodys and that the defence was that one of the man who led the old Guerrilla of the world could be able to be. So he should take the ten finger print sheet of Guillermo León Sáenz (the real name).
However, when he reached the survey to the place where the body was drawn up, he could not identify him because of his physical appearance, because this appeared to the images he had seen in the mass media, not at least.
He had no bar, was clothed like a farmer of the area, wasn't clothed, and was very dark.
But don't lie fingerabps.
Weapon with a lamp, tint, a plant clothes and a clothing lamp compare Eliazar the fingerprints of the body with those on the printing table.
He saw right: it was "Alfononso Cano."
Another night, this man from Puerto Tejada was responsible for the ministry of defence, John Carlos Pinzón, to report that it was actually the head of the FARC.
Searching for Swiss
For a dactyloskope of Sijin in Cali, the courage of which the President John Manuel Santos Eliazar González had been granted on a press conference on the use of "Cano".
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an executive science without error currency that can be a key factor for solving a criminal.
Lophoskopists identifi not only bodys, they also support submittions in murder and rashes and confirm the identity of the individuals identified.
In their determination, a lot of criminals shall be deleted or no.
We'll take them the fingerprints and search them in the database.
The researcher told us that he had to go a wall out of a house, because the teacher had protected himself exactly on this place with his hand when he took out one with shock and money full of safety.
"The walls are difficult because their surfaces are unrealised for the removal of fingerprints. But in this case we could take the impression of all the hands and the penalty who had participated in several disasters," he remembered.
Aid of the fingerprints can also be charged or charged by murderers.
In front of Kurzem, a dead man was found by snaps flakes.
A family owner could be defendant, and actually, a fingerprint on the flower was agreed.
Although it does not ensure that it is about murder, he will be involved in the place where the penalty was started.
A Dactyloss copyer of the CTI explained that “the fingerabpresses with chemical or physical reactions would be taken from the object”.
If it appears, a plant box or a band is used to accept.
Then the printings are sent to the asylum, which is the bank of pollution or individuals.
"The problem is that there are still many colonies without clearing documents," the expert stated by the CTI.
He said it wasn't all as it would be in the TV series of SCI.
As not all the gold is green, it is not even all that you're drawn up, a fingerprint.
However, it can be used when a corresponding comparison is carried out.
The "Empty" calls for the authorities in New York
Some hundreds of demonstrators were in cells on the adquisition plate together.
A majority came to the road order and changed its location to a close park.
The members of the movement of Ocupy Wall Street requested the authorities of New York to find out when they tried to return to the Manhatte Plan after they had been placed in the morning scene and had tried to put another place on the Big Apple.
Some hundreds of demonstrators were able to deliver access to this place.In the same time, another part of the movement was held at the Room Command, and a park was northern in the city where it came to nine festivals.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp on the place, we meet us at another place and the fight with legal means to continue back to the acquisition, with seat and peaceful demonstrations," said Mark Bray, one of the movement "Ocupy Wall Street".
Bray explained that the response of the "Empires" to the removal of his cell, which was directly commanded by Michael Blomberg, the citizen of New York, until the court came, where the judge Lucy Billings made an order prohibited the powerful ruling of the place and the demonstrators accepted the cells.
Moreover, the "Empires" moved a new park that is located at the creation of the canal Street and the Sixth Avenue throughout the neighbourhood of the entrance to the Holland Tannel, the New York and New Jersey associated with the Trinity Church.
They could take the place at least a hour, but then the police entered and arrested some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not give exact numbers. He assured the message agency Efe that he had seen several journalists with hands.
The organization ensured that there were hundreds of people in this place where a resolution of religious leaders as a sign of their support to members of movement and dissemination with the police.
In particular, the adquisition plate (in private property) remains closed in the expectation of a fair hearing which is still applied for this service, and analyzing the legality of the positions held in the morning screen.
Some of the demonstrators sent from the place, photo copys of this fair order, and distributed them. They even gave some policemen who watched the place what had "a few small coasts" to follow, as Bray reported, who had shown that some policemen would have shot the demonstrators.
The right instruction offers the authorities to place members of Occupy Wall Street from the place, and the application of "actions which have been adopted after the order and forbidden that the demonstrators with their cells and other things they had used before return to the park."
The citizen Blomberg is clear before the press that, based on this right order, the opening of the place for public transport and the demonstrators will be re-evaluated. The demonstrators said that the city had not allowed them to re-institute the city's laws with cells and sleeps in this place.
The citizen personally defended the renumber of the adquisition plateis, where almost 200 persons were taken, and the decision was decided because the demonstrators “against the right”.
Blomberg explained that he would have given the order for the removal of the place because it had "transformed a place in which people had not come to demonstrate, but to spread the laws and in some cases to add other persons to damage," because "in certain business they had been drunks" and the residents feared their quality of life.
"The revolution in the morning green was unique and shows that bloomberg is based on the protection of financial interests and is not interested in the protection of the interests of the North American workers," added the speakers of the movement that complained to the citizens 'no respect the prize freedom'.
The members of the Occupy Wall Street informed that they think "growd actions" for the Thursday, together with communities and workshops, to remember the two months that the Protesters are now held since 17 September.
Pamela Anderson is in the TV-week show the youth Maria
With Michael Bublé and other Canadian Bermedtheaters, it will be held in the TV program "It's a Russell Peter's Christmas"
The Candierin Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue swimming in "Baywatch", caninchen at "Playboy", the woman of the Rockmusics Tommy Lee and now the player and model will be the vision of the Canadian TV's female.
The CTV private telesehcanal today recognized that Anderson occurred together with the "crooner" (Bal loader) Michael Bublé and other Canadian Berthods on 1 December in the TV programme "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" and a very special youth Mary life.
CTV today spread images from the television program, in the Anderson, which also belonged to the distribution of a pornos on the Internet itself, in which she was along with her former husband, the shopping player of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears as a virgin Maria with a poppe in the shape that Jesus should be presented.
In the scene Peters appears to be a known Canadian Comicist of Indian origin, who recently worked as modern at the sentence of "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" by Charlie Sheen, as Jesuskind.
The CTV Week program is not only married by Anderson and Peters, but also on the Canadian Sänger Bublé, which ends March in Buenos Aires, the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato married, and the contraverse is not far.
Recently, Buble was called in one of his concerts in New York the North American Kim Kardashian as "Hure".
Japan is born again after the earth
The BIP increases approximately 1,5% thanks to the domestic discoumption and ends the speeral of the free case from the beginning of March
Since March last, the Japanese economy was paralysed, which remained in the distortion after the destruction of the earthquake who entered into a nuclear crisis, and the worst catastrophe that Japan had lived at the 2th World War.
The first summits of the government in Tokyo assessed the shoes of $300,000, a shot that seems to be declined in the difficult world economic situation.
Following three long-term cases, the data for the Brutto Inland Product from July to September were used to finally conclude this chapter: the GDP has increased approximately 1,5% in comparison to the previous quarter and 6% to the high-released quota in the year.
The measured value in the second quarter - in Japan starts the year in March 2012 - also means the fastest growth from January to March 2010.
The recovery may partially be explained by the sale of machines for the reconstruction of the earthquake and the following tsunami areas.
In fact, the enterprises increased their investments at 1,1% compared to the decrease of 0.9% for capital installations set up from January to March, the first reduction in six months.
Nevertheless, the real consequence of the Japanese economy is not exclusively from key-States that use the crisis to build or renew infrastructures.
In particular, Japan is observed by the development of the internal competition, which is currently 60% of the Japanese PIB.
This variable increased 1%, increased from the growing expenditures for vehicles, travels and free-time jobs.
The Year Stigma Stigma
Tokyo has trusted the internal market after the Yen - the Japanese currency - in one of the "smoking for flights" of investors who fled before the Eurozone crisis and the delicate projects for the U.S.A., a privilege that holds a grabstein on the accounts of export companies.
A stronger currency is the products in the foreign market, a serious problem for a country whose economy focuses on the health of the large technology producers.
Toyota and Sony, for example, brought their weak business results from July to September to the notice of Yen.
While the markets continue to establish the EU's internal countries, the Government Yoshiko Noda remains washing.
"It must take into account the persistent risks, for example, the damage of some foreign economics, the impact of overwhelmings in Thailand and the rapid evaluation of Yen," said the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
The perspectives are really not very survivors.
The organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) explained that most Member States would have shown more clear signs for economic development in September.
The indicator, which passes for the global economy, brought the light that the breast positions would be attracted at the greatest economic positions.
Because he turned around four tens to 100.4 points compared to the 100.8 in August.
The euro zone is even under this average value, which is at 100 after it was shot at 99.13 points.
Athens will make doubts again
Daddymus said that the sponsor measures would be adopted, but the conservatives will not be signed in writing agreements.
With the risk premies of the internal countries and widely uncertainty, Greece is further damaged in the Labyrinth, which results from the Greek European Criminal Krisis.
The impression that the "consens" of the new Greek transitional government more than a reaction on the pressure from Brussels is a real convergence of political forces, it is slowly designed by facts.
During the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, yesterday noted that there were no alternatives to the structural reforms and that the hundreds of days which were expensed at his nomination may be too short for their implementation, ensured the leader of the Conservative Party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras that he supports the new spare measures and, in any case, will receive its request for new elections on the date proposed by 19 February.
"The most important task of this Government is the implementation of decisions taken on Thursday of 26 October," Papadimos assured yesterday to open a parliamentary debate, which will be reached tomorrow with the confidence of the new government's position.
The first initiatives are a package with 24 employment programmes for the reform of the Disciplinary Law and new actions against tax interaction.
Nevertheless, Samaras' communication is not the doubt of his arrest: "We have bound us to support the transitional government, but nothing else."
The Conservative Guideline went a step too far with its challenges of the EU and of the IWF, the organisation which needs to be closed to the 8,000 million at the athens needed.
But the European Commission, which is still irritated because of the impact of the poker game with Papandreu referendum, reaffirmed yesterday again at its request: economic assistance would not be signed if the new government and the leaders of the major Greek parties would not be signed as soon as possible.
The speaker of the Economic Minister, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the inspectors of the tropical "such quickly" to the Athens to discuss with the new government, "What's for the payment of the sixth section" at 8,000 million euros, although there is no final date.
The Greek knee has still a few steps.
Queen Sophia: "These are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stressed the "pre-prioring" position of Spain in relation to this type of financing.
Spain "the world has reached a pre-related position in the role of small financing".
The Queen Sophia in Spain remembered that Spain has developed the second player of this fund for international cooperation in the last two decades in the world. Its "Wesen" stressed that it was a "building for social progress, justice and hope for a better future for the whole humanity on the basis of trust in humans".
It was convinced that it was "no doubt" that this kind of business would be "resolvedless" to reach the United Nations targets set up by the United Nations until 2015 and "in particular the goal of the number of people who need to live with income from less than one dollar in the day, so under the "Armut limit".
Hispany, "weather worked" on the extension of the beneficiary network "for the last part of the world and leads this task to responsibilityally," said the Queen Sofia, who hopes that the initiatives and contributions that are held from the Gipfel to Thursday, "the creation of new capacity and better opportunities for the hospitals and in particular for women are guaranteed as the main benefits of these benefits.
"We have many successes" and "we are many challenges."
The gap on small credits is not only a Forum for debates, but also a platform for the building of "sharing basic objectives".
The Queen stated that it would be stressed that until the end of 2015 175 million poor families should have access to these financial services and that ten million of these budgets will be overcome the poverty limits.
The conception of the small credits in Spain and the rest of the world returns to the Mohammad Yunus 'for years ago' which the Queen Sofia judges as a "act of justice and recognition".
The father of this financing instrument described it as a "considerable idealist that has described the fight against the poverty" and her work was known for 15 years when the queen went to Bangladesh to learn the donor strategie on the place.
A year later, the first World Goal in Washington and other meetings in the Elfenbetic Coast in 1999 and Canada in 2006 were able to observe "continuous further development", the Queen, whose engagement for this project yesterday had been used to assess as "familie noberhead" in Valladolid and as "Fürscherin of the Army".
Finally, the Queen Sofia urged her proposal by animating the attendants to participate in the debate and seeking solutions in the fight against poverty.
The Ethic Command
The Spanish External Minister Trinity Jimenez argued that Solidarity is “the Ethic Command” for all the democratic state.
In this respect, she noted that it was an error to link development aid to economic booms times, as it was a "continuous obligation".
Jiménez was the view that the small credits were a "est and rigorous policy for the eradication of poverty" and that the Governments of the industrial countries should now be "more than ever" according to solidarity criteria, and do not need to allow the solidarity of the crisis to the victim.
For Spain the smallest credits are one of the most important forms of development aid.
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, "the success", "marginalised" people, "bounded before the doors" "Hoffnung" and opened the citizens of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, called the attendants in a city welcomed by the Spirit of Solidarity.
The CDU is proposed to select the Presidencies on the basis of general stimulation
The first day of the Congress of Christian Democrates (CDU on Monday, 14 November in Leipzig, provided for Angela Merkel, Canzlers and President of the Christian Democratic Party, without real difficulties.
The future of Europe was originally not intended in the programme, but it has been done in the original way, particularly in order to achieve the actives that the government's policy is today and that it is possible to appreciate Italy as the lax.
The Presidency proposed by the Chairman of the European Commission has been adopted almost one-one.
Only nine drivings had been made under the 1001 delegates, ten had the voice.
The number of minutes at long position Ovation, based on their intervention decisions at first Angela Merkel, and some hours later Wolfgang School, have not opened any doubts by the three European finance ministers.
The main idea of the cancers is - as well as the requests - the following Slogan: the response to the crisis is not less but more Europe.
Not only because Europe means peace, but also there's no millions of jobs directly depending on the euro."
For the cancers, "the time of breaking in Europe has come."
This could be expressed by a strengthening amendment of the European Union's Lissabon Treaty on the budget policy of the countries in the European Zone, but it could also be a face in the election of the President of the European Commission on the basis of general stimulation” to Europe.
However, this is one of the proposals adopted by the Congress, which clearly Wolfgang Schube Pate.
Surely it is just little likely that the 47 are fast on this revolution: Great Britains is the matter rejected, and the leaders of the CDU believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is the same opinion.
However, the milestein is laid.
The delegations also rejected the proposal of the measurement of each country in the ECB standard according to the measurement of the individual economy, which clearly increased the position of Germany.
The cancers in its parties have therefore strengthened the point of reference to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but has no longer tried to gain its congress at the costs of the "klein" or the European countries in difficulties that would be critical to the arrogant German.
As a result of the Europe's interest in the French friendship, a paragraph is set out, Angela Merkel does not call for the plan.
At least not direct.
Since it recalls that Leipzig has been in the middle of a blow slaughter.
In fact, one of the highest density levels of the Napoleonian army.
What does the drug represent in cash notices?
After family assistance, UMP and government now take the disease notifications into attack.
Nicolas Sarkozy will take place on Sunday, 15 November in Bordeaux, to visit a family assistance course and to submit a talk about this, since 2007, the issue of the fight against social fraude and the economic independence of the State.
In order to join this attack, which is designed to undertake the economy in a dark test, but on the other side, it is not less provisions of the right presidency campaign, the majority will focus on workers' diseases.
First of all, the Government considers the establishment of a fourth karensday before taking into account a currency statement in the private sector.
In good German, this means that an unemployed worker would lose the wages of four days, therefore at least 15% of its monthly income.
But it would help to bring 280 million euros in the daytime.
And the one with another mass massed more symbolic characteristics: the State officers have invented an unwanted carens day in the case of diseases (against there are, in contrast to the three carens days in the private sector, no free shortterm).
While these questions are in the discussion, most of them also simplifys the discriminatory thematics, which is to address the abuse related to unemployment.
"Controductions will be significantly important, and they will also be reproached if this is requested," warned Xavier Betran on Sunday, on November 13 before the microphon of the Sender.
Like in other cases, the impact of this report appears a little unproportioned on the reality of malicious actions in the field of malnutrition.
In fact, since 2002, it has been a permanent observation and political discovery that have been most frequently produced fruits.
Franzois are not more frequently sick than people in other places in Europe.
Nevertheless, we first deal with the country-related figures.
According to CNAM country diseases, more than 237 million euros have been paid in 2006.
With the Economic Research and Documentation Institute of Health in 2008, 11.3 billion euros have been 11.3 billion of health expenditures.
The amount was 46% concerning maternity survivors and unemployment accidents and 54% concerning disease survivors, which is here 6.2 billion euros.
And then 2.5% health costs.
In 2010, the French were held with a number of 14.5 guests in 2009 by a study of Alma Consulting Group in average of 14.5 hospitals.
A average value that defined certain differences: another, from Monster.com, was published in 2007, a carrier planning site showed that 75% of the 40.000 requested, French workers not to have taken any single hospital day.
Another study presented this time of hospital insurance clears that 37% of the diseases in 2010 were of shorter than 8 days; 22% between 8 and 14 days, 15% between 15 days and one month, 15% between one and three months and 11%.
In comparison with their European neighbours, the French workers are therefore not more than otherwise unemployed.
In 2010, a long-term study conducted by two researchers of the French, State Centre for Science Research (CNRS) showed that between 1994 and 2001 the global disability rates (in disease or other) was based between 10% and 11% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
The drug in curtain notifications provides a disagreement of the black work.
Consequently, there is only a weak exam.
The reinforcement of legislation since 2002 makes it possible to have systematic controls in disease notifications over 45 days.
In 2008, the CNAM (public school for exemption and further training of technologies and engineering) has identified under 1.5 million controls that 13% of 285.000 of the realised, short-term currencies, which are here in 37.050 cases," unlawful or too long".
In the systemism controlled cases, more than 45 days of currency, there were under 1,2 million 11% to "unprofit or unjust" cases hereinafter 132.000.
In general, this makes 169.000 injuries" cases on several million employees who have made a currency.
A number representing only a weak exam, for example, those of the black work.
In accordance with the Dominique Tian Deputy Deputy Member of the Dominique Tian, a complainant of the reports in July, this is between 9 and 15 billion euros of the case of tax wine per year, which is more than the total costs of daily costs, and therefore significantly more than the defraud in recent persons.
Papademos: Greece should introduce a new adaptation plan
Greece has needed a new adaptation program to start its economy.
On Monday, on 14 November, the Prime Minister Lucas Papademos announced the fact that his Government had not reached a hundred days to fulfil this task.
"Of the efforts to continue to strengthen the economy, we need support of our European partners and a new programme for budget adjustment," said the Government head in his first public talk in the implementation of the debate on the award of confidence of Parliament in midday.
The implementation of the European Union’s decisions adopted on 27 October is the "Haupupup up-up" of the new government, since the impact of the country within the eurozone" is on the game.
Mr. Papademos has been planned to reduce the 9% of the U.S.' of the Brutto Inland Product from today to the end of the year after that in 2010, 10,6% and in 2009, 15,7%.
The rights depends on the new Sparmaoptions
Antonis Samaras, chief of the right flight, had granted its approval to the measures already approved in terms of an outcome from the criminal crises, but had beforewarded that his Party would not be ready to an additional sparma-declaration.
"We will not vote at the least new mass decisions," he said, at the same time, a Deputy Assembly of its Party's New Democracy.
He was prepared with the indications of reduction of budget and debts, as well as to combat the disappearance, however, every policy was strictly contrary to which the economic disappearance would be bound.
Ooli Rehn, with economic and monetary allocations, the Commissioner of the EU, which had prevented that IWF and the EU had not granted the necessary loan of more than 8 billion euros without written guarantees of all parties on their support of the planned measures, had responded to Antonio Samaras that his word would be sufficient and he would not signed anything under pressure of Au.
Euthanasia and Combined Freetod must be legalized, such a expert segment
The Canadians live in disagreement of death, as the report of the Queen Society of Canada is reported.
The Group stated that Governments, health institutions and doctors were working together with respect to harm-term treatment in order to prepare the best damaging resources, and that was also out of the cancer cases.
The Canadian society lives in destruction against death.
Only 9% of the Canadians will actually be able to speak to their doctor about conditions where they want to die and take places to this purpose.
This is one of the conclusions of a imposing report of the King's society of Canada, where six experts were involved in different areas, including Ethics, right and medicine.
This group recommends that the Government should change the law of criminality in order to allow the assembled Susid and Euthanasia where it is elected, or in patients who are considered in the way to take such a decision.
The experts have recently published a recent survey of the independent company EIU, which had compared the death quality in 40 countries of the earthquake.
Although Canada has been placed on the 10th Rang, the study notes that "the medical mortality of death in Canada has produced a culture in which people fear to cut the subject of death."
Medical concerns or not: 77% of the Canadians have no access to the damage of resources, so the experts designed by the Queen Society of Canada reported us.
And despite the majority of the Canadians' desire to die at home, at last, 68.6% of those in the hospital died.
From the whole country, the rate is the highest death accidents in Quebec.
In the healthy question concerning Euthania and withdrawal Suscid, the persons of the report have concluded that the position of the Federal Government, which has already been enthusied, are not intended to adopt any amendments of the criminal law on Euthania and joint Susidion.
However, there are now some experts who have inspired all those countries whose approach Euthanasia has legalized or decreased sustainment or decreased, there would not be any evidence that such discriminalization would be followed in their proceedings of Euthania or comprehensed Susidion of uncertained persons or not voluntary.
In contrast, there are significantly more cases of such transmissions in the countries in which Euthania and the Susidid is not legalised, such as yesterday Jocelyn Downie, the Master of the report confirmed in a teleconference.
"Euthanasia is done in Canada where she is clearly illegal."
"Again Suzido is practised in Canada, although it is clearly illegal here," Jocelyn Down.
Canada claims Euthanasia
We regret that, according to an Anus Reid Reid's question in 2010, 85% of the Canadians at the benefit of Euthanasia had been endorsed, because they were thinking that they were allowed those people at the end of their life to deal with their suffers.
And 66% believes that the content of legalization of Euthanasia has not to consequence to report the message that life of older or dismissed people is less value.
With regard to those who have already been practised by a participated Sustainment, the applicants have 41% thought that they should not be prosecuted in criminality.
With regard to the rights or introduction of the resources in patients, a situation is less clear than the defender of the report.
In addition, those in their recommendation proceedings that the prosecution of the funds for which a legal deployment has been provided should not be applicable as a criminal.
The expert group also requests that the professionals of health care should be discussed in the task of respecting the funds to live and that must be feared without criminal persecution.
The Group explained that Governments, health institutions and doctors cooperated with regard to the treatment of harmful lessons in order to prepare the best damage resources, and that also goes out of cancer cases.
Lastly, the group calls for the existing resources in the Canadian institutions for health-related institutions to reduce physical pain or life-related measures to take them at least into consideration, as such a few as the Euthanasia served to reduce physical pain and belong to the same procedures.
Conservation of other experts
Some experts in the right of health property have already provided precautions in respect of the conclusions of the expert report of the Queen Society of Canada.
RA Peter Deschamps, specialist in the health law, has described the stop of the subscribed experts, among others as "extrem" because those of the Euthanasia Praxis in hospitals in the endphase did not set borders.
"This opens the plots for a situation in which every one of the living and older than 18 years is to ask another person to be able to be able to be at his self-assassin," RA Dechamps, who had held a summary of the report yesterday.
RA Deschamps also emphasized that the defenders of the report appeared to be the own responsibility of individuals over all other values involved in the social society.
Now, he says that it would be "guiding and obligations in a society".
Margaret Samrville, a specialist for health law, also has expressed the conclusions of the report which they have been signed as "Pro-Euthanasia Manifest".
Margaret Somerville, who is a member of the King Society of Canada, is in particular uncertainly the reports relating to the non-profit of misbrors in certain countries in which Euthania is legalised and accompanied Suzid, such as the Netherlands and Orgon.
The King of Jordan calls for President Assad to the power agreement
Damascus presses a "Complott"
Syria is also Isolizer
The Participants Baschar al-Assads have demonstrated yesterday before the authorities of the Auві Minister.
The diplomatic pressure on the Syrian Baschar al-Assads, which, however, faces this by Russia's support and shows a "Component" against the country, has been strengthened yesterday.
Two days before the Exclusion of Syrian Liga by the Arab Liga, the European Union has decreased its sanctions against Damascus, although Turkey and Jordan, the neighbouring Syrian countries, had taken a position in favour of a decline by President Assad.
King Abdullah II. At the yesterday, the official Arab Prime Minister, the President of Baschar al-Assad, was requested to put down its office in Syria, "the office of the United Nations has already been killed about the fourty civilians and members of the government.
"Let Basch the interest of his country in the heart, but it would also be necessary to create the conditions for a new medicine of the Syrian Political Life," the King of Jordan, Neighbour Syria, in an interview with the BBC.
The Turkish Diplomate Chapter Ahmet Davidoglu, on the basis of the fact that the Turkish Diplomate Diplomate had not been consolid by success since the beginning of the year.
"In the Middle East, those who do not be able to find peace with their people and do not have to be satisfied," said he in playing Syrian, the neighbouring country, to which Turkey takes a steadily warrant stop.
The United States welcomed the "forcing of the consensus against Assad and the machinery of the Syrian regime" according to the decisions of the Arab Liga and the European Union.
"International Community, the United States, the EU, the Arab Liga and the countries such as Turkey have been an increasing sound in respect of the repressions in Syria," observed Mark Toner, a speaker of the State Division.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the Government Middle Age in the South Syrian region of Dar'a, the Syrian Observer for Human Rights announced OSDH.
Two other civilians, according to these NGOs, were changed to "shake and severe bombs for Jobar" in the defended city of Homs in life.
However, at the end of the crisis, the Syrian Au-Trade Minister Walid al-Mual considered that the country's taxes were taxed."
Furthermore, he reacted to sustaining the decision of the Arab Liga, Damascus from his tasks, which was made by an " dangerous step".
"Sirians" did not submit," he added, "the compounds that were missing against Syria. "
Following the Sustaining Decision, the Arab Liga is currently investigated by a "Swillmechanism for civilians" and wants the removal of 500 members of the Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers in the country.
Alain Juppé also spoke for the deterioration of UNO observers to protect civilists from the repression of the Regime, who had been captured after him in his "Paranoia".
A new new collection of Liga is intended in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the plan decided on 2 November, but in particular of the circumstances, for example, the military forces from the defended cities and the release of inhaft demonists.
The Russian autumn Minister Sergej Lawrow adopted the decision of the Arab Liga yesterday as "uncorrect" to keep himself before the objection of any sanctions against Damascus, although China had already encouraged the implementation of the crisis.
Italy
Monti requests markets for suffering and Italy to prepare
Mario Monti, the future Italian government team, asked by the markets a little bit more time to form its stage and to use a program to renew the loss of the Berlusconi government's credibility for the last months.
The former EU Commissioner had held a negotiation with the political parties today before present meetings of workers and employees.
It was his task to call a Kabinett in the Parliament, which is relatively close to external technologies.
"Monti spoke of a important programme with a number of victims," says Francesco Nucara, Member of one of the numerous smaller groups participating in the conversations after he was joined with the official Council President.
Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber of the Deputy Chamber, had expected to put Mario Monti a statement of confidence to Parliament until Friday to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The discussions will be made in the presentation provided by Mr. Monti of a list of provisions, which will certainly be rich from a decade of ministers to the head of State Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented that the deep neurvosity of the barriers and obligation markets requested their time.
In "A democracy there are certain days" to prepare a government and a government program, he noted that it was "certain that the markets will be double and comprehensive."
His order by the President was welcomed by the markets, but the disappearance had been strengthened again, particularly after an unexpected industrial decline in the Eurozone in September.
The first minister should be founded by an existing stage from the previous Technocrats, although he had noted that it should also include "politics".
The new government should be present only until 2013, on the date of the next Parliament's elections.
According to Gianfranco Fini, President of the Chamber, the new government should receive the evidence of confidence of the Parliament to Friday.
Mr. Monti has committed its function to work in all durations in the meaning of the goal to make Italy to the "western protagonist" in Europe.
One speaker of the Commissioner Olli Rehn said that "see our diagnosis against the Italian economy itself, taking into account the new government."
The EU, who is convinced that Rome will not achieve its budget balance objective in 2013, although the plans taken on the last months, has requested new measures to be taken.
Emma Marcegilla, which is the chief of Italy, which is meeting on the Sunday on Monti, also consists of the need for economic marketing," a country that has no growth that cannot respect deficiencies."
Mr. Monti, who is known for his competence and its independence as the Commissioner of the EU (1994-2004), is a "Epoche change" in Italy after 17 years of 17"Berlusconsism; the "Professor" symbolizes the "Professor' challenge of confidence" as well as an "ander Italian" authors.
The greene's unknown here is the longness of his stage.
President Napolitano would like to prevent the elections before, since Italy has granted obligations for 200 billion euros from April 2012.
Russian scientists helps the Iranian nuclear energy programme
A Russian scientist, whitescheslaw Danlinko, helped Iran to develop one of the nuclear weapons that was used with a nuclear gun, so confirmed a atmosphere, American NGO specialized on Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security ISIS based on the recent report of the International Agency for AIEA and other documents of the UNO Agency to submit this scientist.
The AIEA had shared its "estern concern" instead of a "mobile military size" of the Iranian Nuclear Programme.
According to the incoming study of the AIEA document following ISIS, the Danileko had clearly been born in 1934 since the beginning of the 60s over three decades in a sowjetic military currency centre in Tscheeljabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production produced by explosion by synthetic diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991, he must have left the center to establish a company in Kiew, which produces the "Nano diaman" diamond.
The economic difficulties of his company would have led him in 1995 to contact the Iranic news in Ukraine.
Before he returned to Russia, he contributed to a Irish programme from 1996 to 2002.
In its last report, the AIEA noticed that the Iranian development of a nuclear power system was supported by the work of a foreign expert, which was not only in this technology, but also as a State member of the Agency shared its entire vocational carrier on unfairly to this technology, which worked directly in the military energy programme of its origin."
Anti-islamic crimes and delicts have accepted approximately 50%
The crimes and delicts against Muslims have increased from 2009 to 2010 to 50%, where other racistic or religious crimes have been motivated in accordance with the FBI statistics published on the same period or have been lower or have only been taken.
According to these data, the total number of violence offences against Muslims was increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, so 49% increased by 13% of violence against katolics, a 4% decrease against criminals against Jews and a global increase of 14% in anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number 'has motivated crimes' has increased in very weak mass to 6.628 cases, including 47.3% by racial differences and 20% through religious divergences, the FBI.
"After a disappearance in 2009, these crimes and criminals have again grown," the human rights organization of the human rights first.The increase of anti-islamic violences is particularly significant," added the organization to a community.
"Human Rights First had a long time understood that the violence against Muslims should be considered, as well as all forms of hatred crimes as a severe law violation against human rights," added Paul Legendre, a responsibleer of the organization.
"The American government can and should be done more to fight these conflicts," he added that this could be implemented under improving police stops against the "Hass crimes".
The "Hass crime" is a heritage of the epoca of the fight for civil rights.
This legislation was decided after death Martin Luther Kings to combat violence stages sent against race, hair color, religion or disappearance, and is now involved in criminals of sexual nationality.
Twitter walks the platform and talks more Facebook
The Microblogging site Twitter has introduced changes in the presentation of their platform to allow their users in particular to observe the activities of those who follow their inputs, which allows the service once more than Facebook.
The new tab "activity" and another "Name" allows you to better readfully follow the activities of other "Twitterers", the Internet user whose messages ("Tweet") are followed and followed by your messages.
This allows you to find whether these are allowed to follow their messages whether they are subscribed to new contributions, favour certain messages, etc.
This new Twitter menu offer was visited before its general Internet distribution on Monday" in August, at a lower percentage of users ", the Twitter speakerin Carolyn Penner gave the French pressage at the AFP.
Twitter was known for its little instinctive functioning, covered with something ethnic anmutendem wordlaut (RT for the referenced Recovery of the contributions of another person). Next afterwardday to recommend follow another user) with the happiness of the initiative, then opened a greater public with a more comparable manual to the great public network Facebook and Google+.
In the network, users discussed with the help of certain "Tweets" on the Internet about this innovation.
"It's inevitable and similar to very Facebook," writes @jemb123.
"The function" activity will help me follow some elements of my flux-Twitters better", defied@dannykronstrom.
Austria
Subscription of a "Gloyal Budget Rule" in the Constitution
The Government of the Great Social Democratic/Christ Democratic Coalition in Austria has decided in the Constitution to reduce public deficits and to avoid any possible degradation in the Top-Bank Agency of Austria.
It was the Social Democratic Canzler Werner Faymann highly personally announced by the outcome of the Ministerial Council, although the public Austrian State debt was at 74.6%, therefore, weitaus was about the criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty of 60%, however clearly under the level of law of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If the payment of Austria is not on a gun of AAA+ to AA+, we should pay more than three billion euros every year," said Michael Spindelegger, Vize Canzler and Christian Democratic Au  quiz Minister.
Austria has also been requested by the European Zone Member States of 26 October: the Heads of State and Government had already requested the reduction of public deficiencies to the end of 2012 and a return to public account weight to the constitution or by the adoption of an equivalent law.
This is the first European country, which had been the constitution of such a "regulation".
Until 2017, the Structural Budgetary Efficiency should be reduced by 0.75% of the Bruttolands Inland Product (BIP), since 2017, the Structural Budget Efective of the State should not exceed the size of the PIB, whereby the regional countries should be assigned as compared with the communities.
The aim is to compensate the budget debts under the 60% criteria set by the Maastricht Agreement in the horizon 2020/21.
Starker Yen
Noda moves with a new intervention on monetary markets
The Japanese Prime Minister Yoshiko Noda said on Sunday that the Japanese Office would reiterate the monetary markets if the Yen should continue.
"When we set an excessive voluntary" in the Yeen currency, we will also intervene as we did the last time," said Mr. Noda in the Senat.
On Sunday, the Yen was renewed close to the historic levels that the Japanese authorities had sought to intervention on 31 October.
Tokyo massive Yen sold against dollars to reduce the Japanese currency value that is to impose a new record value since 1945 against the dollar.
However, the Yen is regularly increased by buying investors who view the Yen as "related value" in these uncertain times of global economic disappearance and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar is caught on Sunday by 77 Yen, which is under the symbolic level of 105 Yen near the levels that had paid the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis notified by the $201, the euro is more than 160 Yen.
This throat of the Japanese Divise causes exports of the archipelines, as it protects the costs of the "Made in Japan" products and reduces the value of income originated by Japan from the country.
"Japan fights after the earthquake and the Tsunami on 11 March, who have shot the Tohoku Region (Nordoses) for its reconstruction," said Mr. Noda, who fears that this disappearance of Yen might already be able to kill the weakness in the kiim.
The third world's growth in the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter for the first time in this year, thanks to expensive exports and the consumption of the "polymbized" household 'employed".
However, the First Minister appreciates that Yen is not the economic funding of Japan.
The Finance Minister Jun Azumi, on the other hand, opened the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a second periodic meeting of its Food Political Committee, requested to take all considerable decisions to disappear the Yen.
However, Hirohide Yamaguchi, an expert Governor of the Institute, noted that the BoJ has already introduced "valued measures" to read that there was no additional monetary closure in middle.
At the end of October, the notice bank had increased its State obligation grants at 5,000 billion Yen (47 billion euros) to overcome 55.000 billion Yen (519 billion euros) in order to overcome the liability market.
Eurozone:
Swimming rates on the height, flowers make backwards
The risk of enhancement of the criminal crisis is constantly determining the European concepts.
Despite the upcoming of the new government heads in Greece and Italy and the best growth numbers in France and Germany continue to increase the Councils of the declined countries.
The bulks that are still concerned about the stability of the euro zone also dismissed the Sunday on 15 November a little more in negative filters.
The CAC was lost at 10:00.4% in Paris and fell on 3.064 points.
The Dax in Frankfurt returned 0.4%, London was 0.1%.
"Of the new steps relating to the reimbursements of the Member States in which euro area is in difficulties, the global acid markets continue to provide a part of their recent gains.
"The capital leaders are nervous and are just aware of the aspiration risk," said Terry Pratt, institutional broker at IG Markets, settled by the Pressetario Reuters.
The Börse in Tokyo, on the basis of the new fear of the market operators in terms of capacity in Europe, has continued to continue the crises of the debt, with a bath of 0.7%.
"Japan has just directed his eyes to Europe, and the trade moves to limited change correlator, while the teachers have no evidence that the situation has stabilised," estimates Mitsuchhewed Acino, Foundation Manager at Yoiyoshi Investment Management.
This resuming concerns for the future of the Eurozone causes the unit wage that continues to be bathed on Sunday.
The euro moves to its lower level for one half month.
Furthermore, the European value was 1.3570 Doller, so it was about 0.4%.
In accordance with the Business Masters, the CDU, the Party of the Canzelles Angela Merkel, who had gathered a request in the Congress, had been made for a request, particularly for the possibility of countries in difficulties to leave the Eurozone without the European Union at the same time.
The Italian and Spanish Councils are far than 6% width.
The lendings of Italy and Spain continue to be a very unrealised level.
On Tuesday morning, the reimbursement of the Italian obligations reached 10 years of 6,85%, the Spanish title was 6,2%.
These circles in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to worry about the investors.
The future Italian Government Chief Mario Monti requested the markets to restore the situation affected by the injury in Italy.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos had confirmed on its side the implementation of the decisions taken by the European Zone on 27 October on 27th meetings.
Spain is in the view of the markets on Sunday the Parliament's elections in the country.
The Cinsian ("spread") between the German and Spanish 10-year-olds has even reached a new, historical higher.
In waiting for growth numbers of the eurozone
Statistics have seen a growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, therefore a little better than the expected 0.3%.
However, the statistical Federal Ambassador of INSEE had revealed the numbers of the second quarter, which was a minimum of 0.1% of the Brutto domestic product (BIP) instead of a stagnation.
Actually, it is the fourth quarter that the economic experts most troubled.
Germany had a growth of 0.5% on the same period.
A first higher rate of the whole euro area is expected at 11 hours, and the EU Commission warns the risk of a reception.
Energy policy:
Facts should be made on dogs
There is a subject that cannot be treated on the basis of short-term considerations or on the basis of emotions, so it is certainly the energy policy.
Availability and costs of electricity affect directly Mae's purchase power as well as the competitiveness of the companies.
It is comprehensive to take an election meeting on this issue and to consider the position of nuclear energy.
The debate will only bear fruits when it is a whole of economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
Franzois should fund their view on objective facts, rational data.
Although there are 7 billion people on this planet, demographic evolution will be a disagreement of electricity demand until 2050, a large part of the world's population should not be made to a vital element.
At the same time, the decline of fossil resources is to be able to continue to produce constant electricity without the need for the reduction of trail gas emissions, to forget a theme lost from the environmental debate to combat climately unregularities.
The accident of Fukushima does not change this parameter.
Therefore, Germany continued in his decision to monitor nuclear power.
This is neither the case in Belgium, which understood its decision of need to find a replaceable source, nor in Switzerland, which is at the same time decided only to build nuclear powers in the last generation.
Great Britains, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, and Brazil, to call only some States to continue to decide.
The United States, on the basis of the Fukushima, decided to open their park another unit by taking up the work that is still under the Atommunfall, three Mile Islands.
Although this is designed to renewable energy sources, German model is likely, however, the reality of the discipline is contrary to the discipline.
The election in Berlin will be in the form of a deterioration of the electricity price, which increased by the increased import of gas, increased energy independence, especially from Russia, increased by gas and coal power emissions.
The overall effects of these ungrate effects will be given in less months.
The case of Denmark gives a point to think.
Denmark is on the basis of a European tablet managers of wind energy, with 30% of its electricity, on the other hand, the country of one of the most strongest coal and gas users using wind energy; in addition, its CO2 expenses and its electricity prices are 65% and 50% higher than the appropriate average European value.
Thanks to the competence of our energy policy, our neighbours pay one in contrast to our French household of 40% higher electricity account.
Since energy price in globalised economy is a key role of competitiveness and a stability of industry on national levels, French companies have benefited from the most modern electricity in Europe.
Each significant reduction on nuclear power would therefore lead to a strong increase in energy price, which will lead to the great expenses on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of the purchasing force.
Questions show that the price is a large majority of Frenchs is a little ready to pay, as it is able to recognize the principle of this energy source.
We regret that energy policy of our country has allowed our country to build an industrial wealth with 125,00 direct and 410,000 industrialized jobs.
In the light of its strong export factor, it brings a unmended specialized smaller and medium-sized enterprises to the international markets and makes them to creators unnumbered workplaces.
If France decides to extract the nuclear power, the large part of these PM would fall to the victim, and the 6 billion euros annually to the export of investment and nuclear energy would be more and more tolerate.
What electric would lead to an EPR to function for sixty years when the decrease of its producer is planned?
In order to solve the energetic parity, it is a little like a devil work to produce electricity.
The CO2-arm solutions developed by the company Areva are produced by the complementarity of energy sources.
The highest possible security level is absolutely operative for the nuclear power.
In France, we have a security authority conducting unpromised and transparent controls in existing works, such as the construction in Flamanville.
Their work teams, which have made a name because of their professionality, are just to be visited by the security provision.
Inside 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three severe storms.
Only one, and even in Three Mile Island, is entered into normal operational conditions; he lost no consequences for human and environmental.
In Tchernobyl, the Drama was abolished by reactor construction, as well as inaccessible, human disasters.
In Fukushima, some appear to forget that the accident of two natural catastrophes has never been revealed by a mass that caused the death of more than ten thousand people.
The nuclear industry will also take its teachings from this accident, as she did this after the two previously done.
As the fruit of this action and the cooperation of the security authorities of French and German operators and construction of nuclear powers, the EPR provides a draft that is able to resist to these phenomenas.
Since the electrical engines are considered to build a nuclear power power, it would be a fabulous gift to the competition of Areva and EDF by leaving them free trains to gain the leading position in the uncertain nuclear development.
It is unfair and legitimate to seek the best energy bouque for our country, but it would be to make a debate to our country without responsibility, emotions, dogs and party managers, which is the same economic, social and financial situation.
Is the immigration Last or the opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy was criticised by old winkels - translated by police, judicial and administrative bodies based on one of the numbers of policy, the compatibility of this policy with the status of a "lance of human rights", as France himself had signed.
The sentence of the foreign students had recently been announced on the week views that the Minister had been accessible (see Libération of 23 May) that France's Talente, Maurer or Kellner had needed from the outside."
But this policy was only rarely analyzed from the economic point of view.
Indeed, there is a greater consensus between the right and the left.
On the right side, the tong of James Chirac was suggested in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed, including over 2 million immigrated workers, there is no problem for a country" by the left side by Michel Rocard, which had expressed 1990, France not to take the whole poverty of the world."
A unique difference consists of the grade of the greenness
The fear of the invasion of the national land was divided in 2005 both from the right and from the left.
Among the two camps, the immigrants were adopted as a burden for the economy and the French society.
The only difference is in the grade of the greatness of the immigrant.
Francois Holland is limited to its programme on banalities that indicate partnership development allows us to solve our ' migration problems'.
This proposal of immigration as a burden, as a problem, may affect the elections, but it is economicly precious.
As the economic experts Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron appeared in a recent work that joins the latest knowledge concerning immigration (Exceptional people: How Migration Changed Our World and Will Definie Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 S.), there is a larger consensus on the positive impact of the immigrant flowing on economic growth, lower and workplaces in the immigration countries.
Increasing the immigration would strengthen growth and damage the labour market situation.
The fears against the impact of migrants are based on the ground that these drugs are replaced by domestic workers, especially the smaller qualified, making pressure on their loans.
However, the experience shows that immigrants in truth are significantly more complex than the internal loan workers, since they carry out severe professionals in sectors that are not technically charged.
The lower qualified immigrants are working in sectors which are less travelling in home workers who are qualified among immigrants in dynamic sectors where training is not compared to employment.
Posistic Loan Effect
As a chirurg has difficulties to work in a country where a lack of anaesthesis dominates, this complementarity also affects a positive effect of immigrants' income on the home and inner market situation.
John Peri has calculated this way that a 1% increase in the immigrant flow has increased a consistent, long-term increase of real solutions between 0.6% and 0.9%.
And this, without a view of the fact that the variety of ideas introduced by the immigrants is added to the economic growth (the highest part of immigrants in the American Nobel prices; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute to social systems, in the European countries at the end of approximately 1% of the total budget.
For example, the World Working Organization appreciates that a person who is in the age of 30 years to Germany is indirect to the public house in the average of its lifetime a net amount (expenditures less than 150,000 euros).
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to bring the lacking snit points" to the deals".
However, these dents that the immigrants should disappear, have made the contrary effect.
Europe has found the democracy, now it remains to think of the European Democracy
Democracy is a valuable good; also a significant good.
The European continent should be able to remind himself who had been allowed to move on the tragedy of the first World War, the totalitarism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also the Francos in Spain, the Salazars in Portugal and the chief in Greece.
Some have certainly believed that it was relaxed to shoot the right of stimm, which is directly and possible to see the democracy for every time over their enemies.
You know from Napoleon's little ones," that it was a characteristic of the mind of the spirit.
The general electoral right, which is the necessary condition of the democracy, is not sufficient for this and can be expressed as well as to "Unterpretation instrument" as the Republician philosoph Etienne Vacherot expressed.
No, democracy requires more: a public space, a public spirit, values, a organization, division and control of violence, training, clarification, economic and social community, a jurisdiction.
The crisis in Europe, where we find, is a economic crisis, but it is very much and more political and democracy.
The switch of the Greek Tru-Falish Reference Division would have been doublely concluded characters: once again, the need for a powerful return of the policy, but on the other side, the feelings of their inconvenibility, their inherence.
This ambivalence should be considered as overwhelmed.
True, the lines of the democratic fight have been made today, and that the republic soldiers, or at least most of them, have no longer go into the right direction.
We have nothing to win to achieve the success of the national referendum, which has been organized, depending on the needs and on a circular sequence.
A liberty for the European Allinheran or a speed with related eyes in the leges of the national resurrection: a green choice for the State busers!
No, we want to have a shock, but a collective task, from full law, declaring and steadily, a choice and democracy, this time at European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal - there is no longer awareness in the savings where the figure is to stop - because there is only one crisis, and it is dominant in Europe.
It is the whole Europe, which is concerned by the market dictator and the Rating Agency, which leads to its earliness and the manner of solidarity.
It is the whole Europe, which is paid at international level.
It is worried about sovereignty transfers towards Europe - it is all Europe that generally lost its sovereignty, and that each individual of the nations who have been dedicated to him.
Throughness is to give the leading of the European project to the peoples.
Since it is placed in the totality of whether Europeans reduce the burden of their debts, free from the markets and can move to a future through investments.
The growth of the crisis has decided at the European level to convict, which cannot be disappointed without a total democracy of laws without bringing us safely to disappear.
After this proposal by James Delors and the socialists have long been fighting, every one is today on this European economic management.
All right.
But this without political integration and a stronger democracy, as it prevents the citizens, would be a new torture and a further sackgase.
We must take a new European construction step.
To allow the Republic to decide in France, it caused the fact to "istitute Republics".
The revolution of interests could not be sufficient here.
This revelation continues to be valid.
We need to create a better integrated Europe at the economic level.
This can only be achieved by seeing a politically creating more democratic Europe, a real European nationality.
We need Europeans to create Europe.
"Contactless" Chip cards are generally shown
The World Guest for Chip Cards opens its tour on Sunday in Villepiter near Paris in optimistic stoping.
In 2011, Eurosmart should complete an increase in the global sales of microprocessorchips (EC cards, SIM card cell) with more than 6 billion sold units.
The most leading segment is allowed to provide payments in public transports or comparison of purchases by simply keeping the card on a read device.
Besides the past a year ago, 320 million should be sold this year 460 million connected chip cards worldwide!
In 2012, its market share should increase (580 million expected units) and more than 10% of the global chip card market (6.925 million cards).
With regard to the uncontaminated payment to the ground, Europe has been due to the long time of the Asian region.
Some 26 million visa cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75.000 payment limits are accepted.
In France, the claims are more distinguished: only 400,000 without contacted visa cards were distributed.
However, the consumer markets are dampf.
Carrefour has therefore emitted 2.5 million contacted pass MasterCards this year.
In order to overcome higher speed, the banks now need to make their customers with these cards.
"Two Grei's Green Financial Institutes have committed to exchange their customers in future systemic bank cards that are covered with uncontacted chip", reported Gherard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Bank testing payment per mobile
However, this is only a first step on the way to pay for the future: the mobile phone.
A disallowed percentage of devices is equipped with the necessary NFC technology for implementing these transactions (on Field Communication).
"They've been in a relation."
"As at least the next year they should learn a real survey development."
"We calculate the sale of 80 to 120 million world units in 2012", says Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks took initiative.
The Crédit Agricole had announced the start of a test course in Caen, which will be held from December to June next.
The iPhones of some 200 customers and employees must be equipped with a capsule that allows non-contact payment.
The ECB has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And also at last the society had been designed to prepare the marketing of a offer which allows their customers to pay on telephone.
Terrorist border understands from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the relations between al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb and the sect Boko Haram.
The relations between the terrorist group al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect Boko Haram appear to be confirmed.
On Sunday, the Algerian Vice-Au-Minister Abdelkader Mesahel had confirmed himself that Algier had now reached the jurisdiction.
"The way and way of work with both organizations and the relations of the secret services to a clear cooperation," said he without further details.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The reports on the findings held in the last January of two Frenchs in the niger have been promoted for days.
The antaine de Léocour and Vincent Delory in a restaurant in Niamey of attachers of Aqmi should be required at the next day as many of their departants are only an operation carried out by the French specialities.
Französis and Nigerian ermittlers want to have found several telephone chips who were members of the terrorists.
Terrorist acquiry
The analysis of the telephone calls leads to several conversation partners stationed in Mali, Nigeria and in Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), the Empires interest in particular the numbers of two conversation partners: a number leads to a Nigerian who was a long time in Maiduguri, a city in the north of Nigeria, who had stopped Wiege of Boko Haram; the other leads to a man that is close to the Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a progress, but you must doubtfully have to be cleared before you can talk about an operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Harem."
"It's thinkable."
"As for many years, you know that the sects concern financial and intellectual support of Aua's and that it is increasingly active," a few of the Nigerian researchers' clients Amuwo.
In these past months, these "Subsidation Services" are always made in their history, as well as the talks and the types of operations of Boko Harem, which are now involved on the movement of self-ammortal data, as well as the use of steadly complex materials that hold the same manual as those used by Aqmi.
The international community to start at Washington has been conducted on Abuja since this time, to take account of the problems caused by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have considered the group for a long time as a Community of Illuminates, which should not be given particular attention.
Quick success
In 2002, Boko Haram Haram was founded in Maiduguri in the area of a Mochee, a school, and the fundamentalistic Iman Mohammed Joseph - which means in Haoussa so much as "Western education is a shame" - follows the creation of an islamic emirat in the north of Muslim Nigeria.
In this middle region, the meeting will be rapidly achieved.
She is politicing and encouraged to retention of the skills, while its encouraging actives take place in the fight against the unfair central government.
The actives have first churches, bars and authorities in the visa.
2009, Boko Haram's active attractions were particularly active to the Commissioner.
However, the reaction on the side of Abuja is as usually unnecessed.
The army surrounds the city, you number 800 dead.
Mohammed Joseph's captivity will be killed in prison.
Accordingly, the sect will be radikal and lost its economists in the north.
The last Christmas she was known to an attent in Jos, who called for 80 people, then to another in Abuja.
In June Boko Haram is proclaimed to the fault of a self-mortality that had reached a police headquarter in Abuja, the first kind of his form.
In August, the local seat of the United Nations on the priority of international objectives was made in the United Nations.
The education of a terrorism in Africa, which will lead from Macedonia over Nigeria to Somalia, affects experts since all security experts.
During the Aqmi Mali and the nick to cover the Somalier of Al-Shabaab in Kenya, Boko Harem seems to be a new threat in the center of the continent.
The last week, Alain Juppé has made an appreciation with President Goodluck Jonathan in Nigeria before Boko Harem and has been ready to share all indications."
The world governed by the Republical Presidency scendies
With Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry are revaluated in simplification and uncertainty regarding China, Iraq and the help provided for Israel.
Can a crissy shot America make a comprehensive world simply to not say: lead anxiety ideas?
If you listen to the republic presidency scenario, the elector could almost receive this impression.
Since some days, the Middle of Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and their Master's statements, and their states concerning the UK policy, traditional republic difficulty, are recognized.
About China, Iran and Israel's help, often undermined slogans in no way.
With regard to the name of the "Grand Old Party" at the highest middle in the course, Romney moved the Chineses to settle before the WTO and to see the "substitution" topics in a America that, through the deployment of all industriales to Asia, is the most important.
You'll run when it's supposed to impliance an trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, the former ambassador in China under Obama and the only candidate who seems to have a expensive vision of Au-Weapon policy, has disappeared the air with respect to his emotions.
He was called to a manual but constructive conversation exchange with Peking (or the current stop of Obamas).
But Huntsman is not listened because he is engaged in the thresholds of the views.

Romney was also obliged to military crimes against Iran if the sanctions were supposed to stop the Nuclear Programme.
"Where I'd be chosen, I'd go to the Iran's content," he had made it.
"We're choosing Obama, they're getting the bomb."
Furthermore, he promised an increased military assistance to Israel, and Obama, to be defended by this partner against obligations.
The undertaking Herman Cain, the second highest placed candidate, is on the basis of a huge note of assets.
Recently, he urged to give the Chinese military conflict because Peking's attempt to develop a nucleal weapon." It seemed that China has already been in the possession of military atomic weapons!
The Technical Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and calls for military combats against Iran to be ready to take the American arms in Mexico against drug cards.
Obama 2009, the aggregation of follow-ups against Cuban terrorists was also addressed by Cain, Perry and the candidation Michele Bachmann.
It is far away from John McCain, the Republical candidates in 2008, a political weight.
The current presidential conflicts, Reagan, has also been simple ideas and has gained the cold war, despite all of them.
They call for remember that Obama himself was a amateur and had to drink water in his wine, what was about the subject of antiterror.
They are encouraging the right to the success of his Naiven Zwiegeses with the Iran, the dedicated resort of his "Jung" from Irak, his uncertainty in Libya, which also introduced him the call of the weaknesses.
However, this appeal is not all such unnecessary.
The population appreciates the positive balance of national security under Obama, which has disabled bin Laden.
Since Iraq, it is protecting military interventions leading to the release.
And Obama is more surprised by argumenting that America should be rebuilding economicly to enhance his leading position to a new life.
North Stream, New Tor to Russian Gas in Europe
The North Stream Guideline, which is on the East Sea and directly associated with Russia, has been operated in operation.
It must provide gas for an equivalent of 30 million households.
The Russian Gasriese Gazprom wanted this event with glanz and Gloria.
More than 500 guests, including four State and government heads, have been connected directly with Russian and Germany under the sea level.
The German Canzelles Angelika Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medwedew, the French Prime Minister François Fillon, and his officer Mark Rutte, from the Netherlands, has symbolically directed the tax of Ventils, which promotes the Russian gas in the mental European network.
With the new gas guide, 27.5 billion kilometres of Russian gases per year will be allowed by a first road direction of 1.224 km long that connects the region Sankt Petersburg with Mecklenburg fortress.
A second road guide, which allows a total delivery of 55 billion kitchen metres of gas - the equivalent of the French total consumption, will end 2012.
And you are already allowing the eventuality of the construction of a third guide to the same streets.
For Gazprom, the timely and pointing preparation of this huge construction work is a victory.
The project was strongly affected in Poland and Baltic States.
The north-Stream Pipeline will therefore allow direct gas delivery to Germany, which is to avoid any trace transition through third countries (Polles or Ukraine) on the countryside.
For this reason, these two countries lost little their power: for it will now be more difficult to explore pressure on Russia by driving them to close access to forest European markets.
Warschau, the most strongest involved in the debate, was not before, to compare the north Stream Pipeline with a "new German-sowietic package" in connection to the bond between Hitler and Stalin in 1939.
This means that the theme is the most sensitive.
Western Europe has gained a further higher security of the Russian project.
However, this is on the costs of a disappearance of European energy, as the project has killed a broadcast between West and Eastern Europe.
The Russian vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich, western and western countries, to demonstrate strong gas consumption and to translate their gas benefits to nest.
"This gas guide is a component of our partnership with Russia, which is a new Arteria associated with us in organic and manner," confirmed François Fillon in enhancing the gas guide, focusing on which green gas contracts are also important by political and economic side.
All this explains the width light of the numerous Gazprom managers represented in Lubmin.
The construction of this gas guide is also an excellent technology.
The sub-water guide consists of steel with betonum detection to protect it from ships.
She's sleeping on the seaground, about 200 meters of density.
Their building had to be exempt from the Second World War of Minor Area.
"Etwas hundreds of mines had to be removed or destroyed," said Jens Muller, speaker of the North Stream society.
Furthermore, the increased mass measures to protect the fauna and Flora had to be taken.
The leadership is a long slot of metal, hard like 242 turtles, which is over the whole length of nothing: nor through Ventile, nor warranty stations.
A control platform was provided before the coast of Sweden, but the project responsibilities had taken away because the Sweden had little been able to see a Russian State society on a permanent manner of their costs.
"In the case of a Havarie, we're leaving the gas class in less than one minute," preciseed Jens Muller.
In the case of a leak, the gas in the gas guide is therefore in the air.
However, this case is not only less likely considered by the constructors, since weight is appreciated to a competence of a leak for 100,000 years.
The State monitoring of the gas guide is guaranteed by a subwater robot that is controlled for external observation flights from a sea, as well as from a device that is circulated inside the gas drive.
It owns the form of a cigarette, which is a meter diameter, is introduced in the interior of the road drive and passed through the gas pressure.
After three complete days of the continuation movement by the drive at a speed of 3 meters per second, the device provides more accuracy information about possible metal deformations.
The gas guide was designed to operate for 50 years without to be undertaken only the least reparatory.
Gascirculation is fully easily guaranteed by pressure.
This includes 200 bars at the accession-, 100 bar at the exit place.
Five societys have made their powers to achieve this project.
However, the leading management remains in the hand of Gazprom, which holds 51% of the shares.
Furthermore, the German companys E.ON and BASF are accompanied (15.5%), as well as the Dutch Gasunity and the French company GDF Suez (9%).
These five companies have formed a company Community called the North Stream, which is covered by the construction and operation of gas management.
She has her seat in Zug, where the taxation is specially good.
Gazprom has so far accompanied the entire capacity of its gas transport, along with a extendable twenty-year contract.
"Gazprom is paid for the total capacity, notwithstanding as the green, the real carrier is equipped", precisely Gens Muller.
The financing of the gas management building has been deleted to 30% of actionnaires and to 70% by bank loans.
The whole employment costs should be of 7,4 billion euros for both road guides.
For GDF Suez, the total of the investments was 240 million.
However, minority acts are certainly associated with their exhibitions, since Gazprom is only the hafting risk.
Gas guides a sandwich coast with kifers to Lubmin from the eastern sea today.
The 4.5 meters of high Venezuela form the gas evaporation pumps.
Sensors measure pressure, temperature and other identifications of the gas concerned before it continues to be delivered into the German gas guides.
Since Tuesday, this terminal is delivered with a million kipmetres of Russian gases for a long time.
In full capacity, this would be 3 million kilometres per hour and 6 million in 2012.
Moleskine, a brand notice book.
From a Italian company, about 15 years ago, Moleskine wants to return the new style to Moleskine now.
It has a flair of Abenteuer to add for hours to the letter.
The notice book of Moleskin is easily recognizable, with his black, right intake, his gummiband, the earlidow sides, as well as moved over the time.
The Moleskine notice book, however, was found in 1997.
The Italian company mode that has his seat in Milan decided to bring a different design notice book on the market.
Maria Sebregondi, at the time of the company's Fachberatein, is deployed in the marketing of the new product.
The notice book was inspired by an alther production technology called Mole Skin (Maulwurfshaut), which is called a treewollack, which is used for polar bottles.
This kind of notice book was very asked by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has left an old and almost forgotten object, who has seen a pregardist artist until the 20th century," explained Mary Sebregondi.
The success takes place.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26% and are undertaken by a paragraph of 12.7 million pieces.
This is far away from the inhabited production of the first years in which only 3.000 notice books have been conceived.
Moleskine has been the Italian border and is carried out in 70 countries, even from France to the United States.
It is difficult to make a phantom image of the buyers, as the notice book holds as well as students and teachers.
Moleskine has the image of cosmotic, cultural and offensive customers.
The small, Italian company numbered in his 12 employees today is employed over 100 officials and has two offices since 2008; one in Milan, the other in New York.
The company distributes its notice books in book negotiations, on internet ports like Fnac, in small buffles of the city centres and understands about carrying out its identity.
"We have followed the new writer, notwithstanding the resurrection of the e-mails," said Mary Sebregondi.
This cultural character is engaged by the development of the company Moleskine: shortly, the brand has made an exhibition named "Detour (Umweg)" in the architecture and artists its own notice books.
In August, the company also brought a bond with Leopardenmuster on the market as a film festival in Locarno.
Moleskine benefited from his success and this cultural journal and understood to diversifie his products: cups, calendars, flags, computers... The brand shows the entire band width of articles.
A success that brings news on the plan: In early 2006, the Mode of Investment Fund SG Capital Europe, the current Syntgra Capital, has been bought by a new chapter in the history of the Moleskin company.
Why does the unemployment rate remain at such high level?
Approximately 19% of the disappeared persons are looking for a workplace.
Today the "15th week of work for persons with disabilities".
Despite a more conscious public policy introduced in 2005, the unemployment rate in dismissed persons is still doubled as the average average value: 19% against the unemployment of the total population.
Deeply?
"No, then notices Erric Blanchet, Director-General of the Adapt Agreement, which sets out the "What of the work for persons with disabilities".
"The progress achieved within the fifteen years is significant."
"There was not two of the unemployed rates, but three times so high."
"No way yet remains much to do."
However, it should be said that for unemployed unemployed continues a number of obstacles before they get a job place.
Furthermore, elders are: 37% are aged than 50 years (17% in the mean).
They have a lower qualification level: 80% of them have no asset and only 10,000 persons under 2.3 million students with higher education.
Finally, the long-term unemployment is very widely widely: 53% of persons with disabilities in the total average of 38%.
There are so many criteria that cause a new growth of work, which form the "Cerns of the problem", as Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, founded in 1992, the company is able to acquire a disabilized business.
So many of the skills.
Stay the uncertain talk, the spirital behaviour that knows but continue slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS entries for the magazine La Cité that the consulted managers had "represented" is "represented" by persons in rolls, psychic or intellectual minorities.
The result is that the private enterprises with more than 20 employees have a stretch way to achieve the target of 6% dismissed acquiring acts set out in a law of 1987.
These recent names, from 2008, are numbers of a quota of 2,6%.
"We are now at about 3%", reported Peter Blanc, Director-General of Agefif, the organization that is intended to introduce contributions from enterprises which are sent by this law.
The evidence: The number "Gending costs" of operational sites has reduced the amount of payments between 2007 and 2011, and the amount of the amounts of 59.000 to 46.000 (and 606 to 480 million euros).
"The Law of 2005, which presumes contribution increases, made a strong pressure on the enterprises, said Peter Blanc."
"But this improvement also brings real knowledge to the Great Entreprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of the operational officers between 20 and 49 employees, 82% employees were employed with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What for a luck"
Before they sent the "Blue Service Services (20:45) the stars, Eden Hazard and George's Leekens had not appreciated their pleasure that brought them the friendship game.
It would be too far decided to say that it has given a secret understanding between them, but the image says symbolic walls.
Page on the City of France, George Leekens and Eden Hazard were able to clos good and pleasant peace.
Five months after the temperature of his attack player against Turkey, the Belgian National Trainer had not met as a lob on his person.
"I'm very satisfied with Eden, his progress and the fact he's Belgian."
"I want to look forward," the recent leather's sure.
What is the contrast between its presentation in Klub and Nationalelf" It's a unit that justifys everything."
"In Lille I'm all the year about what's not the case in Belgium."
"It's time for me to go to the start."
Hazard will come to Saint-Denis, led a Libertain against Romania with respect to the Matchs against France to fill finally."
However, without the note of the “congratulation”.
The French National Society has been burned since the age of 7 years, he led his rich fields between 1998 and 2000.
"I was always supported," he confirmed.
This leads to strengthen the "unique" character of this congratulation.
Sovereignly: "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be there," he forgots.
"We just walked through the way."
"They can play mean green happiness!"
Leekens reads on his side with goodness "Stolz".
"The Stolz extract a Gammatch."
"Stolz" also, in his own ownership as "Nachbarn" - confirm that France has become a manner at a very high level," and less than one year after the dream of Knysna.
"Laurent White has worked good work," he said.
Although Belgium is missing in the next European mastership, the technician seems to share the airport with the blue (the French National Elfment) ..., which is directed by Brazil in 2014.
"We're the small Belgians coming out," he remarked.
"We are about planning a thing that the players are ambitious, they are hungry."
"They will notice this at the previous games." The game against France.
Portugal is very reliable
The portugiesmanship of Paulo Bento looks at the green optimism to the back game against Bosnia (22:00) this Sunday in Lisbon.
Two mankinds had the carefulness at the game.
"To the end of these 90 minutes we will be a happy mankind and especially a happy country."
Paulo Bento is already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no the least doubt of doubts that it is "La Selecçao", its National Effect for which he is responsible for qualifying Europe's secretary since September 2010.
This is in fact only 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a mask to play and serve a gentleman, either Bosnia.
In view of the play (0-0) on Friday in the hell of Zenica it seems clear that the wrestle is not yet affected.
Portugal dominated over more than one hour the party, but the manager was not able to print the matter as important as it would take the pressure of her.
"There is a good result, however, which affects a certain risk because we have not achieved extractor."
However, at home, in her hell-speaking stad de la Luz in Lissabon, the Portugueses are convinced to be before a public that should be on the game, even if the party was of course annapped as "sehr knapp", said the optimistic, clear Bento.
"We're waiting for a very nice match, but we're fully convinced to gain the top hand," said the 42-year Portuguese Trainer.
"We have continued to be a 50% opportunity at the season of Europe 2012," the followers of Carlos Queiroz related.
The University on Friday in Bosnia seeks the Portuguese to achieve and gain a gate.
A disagree can already be sufficient to the bosniests who also need a gate.
"There is a good result, but a certain risk, since we have not achieved extractor," suffers Bento.
"We are attacked against a manager that has high technical quality and has a lot of individual qualitys," he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese had already proposed to extract maximum pressure on the Bosnia to give "not time to think."
A good idea, under the provision that it will be implemented this time in fact.
