Norway's rafficky: Is this the world's most cool fish?
Norway's five million people's highest standards of life, not only in Europe, but in the world.
May the secret of the country’s success may be connected to local business in some fishes?
Take the choice of the past time.
Put them in the middle of a smooth bottle.
Just leave one week.
Now you have one of the big Norways to drunk your bulls.
I'm in the small Fagernes town, about three hours far from Oslo.
There's no, it's a pretty wonderful -- and this cow is always in the air.
Rakephistic and water-- as much of the fish you love, it's fermentated for a year.
The Norways will gather here for a most growing feast that is called for the most growing feast.
He says, "It's what you're going to make Festival" and "Rakfisk Generali" Havard Halvarsen, "It's a bottle, and then you're driving water."
People are around us eating small fish bottles and drunken drinking in many mixtures.
Havard says, "So many people love aquavites more than the raffixk."
The drink can kill the cow.
I'm calling a few pieces.
If you can escape out of the burden, it's not bad - it's not a matter of a sustainable language after a little long bus trip.
Rakfisk Norveish is a very different product in the spring of water and water in the waters that are expected in the water.
Then, when they are well deep, they will be leavened, and it is new with the uncertainly disappeared alcohol.
Before a lot, thousands of people were difficult to leave from countries from Norway, mostly disappeared to ABD.
Now the population is wide with speed - more of 13 percent of the jobs, high mass, and the hazardous monitoring systems.
The old race and sooner people from Swedish who are more rich than Norway.
Rakfiss is something important, if the past of Norway is a little collected, even a part of life.
You can buy the most pair of the world's foods.
But it's all that's pretty. You'll give a little bardwich or a sandwich £9 ($14).
Norway, most of the world's news are not coming in the day - and most of them like this.
The people who have been here for the past 77, women and children are not inquiry to speak with the other Brevic name of the other year.
Instead, it's called "22 kids" about killing.
Norways are difficult to believe that one of them in the peaceful countries is able to make a gaddar and murder.
Norway's greatest oil and gas industries have grown from the beginning of 1970.
Our Garson's magazine, Anna Northic refrace, has a long-shaped hair and a blue-sweet eye and displayed: "But we're not the only reason that we're so good to be so good."
We, how you say, you're a prominent people.
In English, most of them are like people here. We are perfect.
We're not a shower, we don't like the chapter.
Norwegian oil riches are very careful — a small percentage of the money coming from the industry, all of which are special to the future benefits of vegetables.
The others, when they had no money, in the years of global crises, joined the wings of the Norway campaigns.
"We're glad as long as we can walk in the mountain," says Anna.
"And a raffinetic seventh," he's sweet with a quiet coffee.
I'm standing in the black and I'm waiting for something to eat. I've eating enough.
Now every hamburger is absolutely different and more disappointed.
But it's even more than that bathroom.
One of the number of hotels that I have left for dinners, which are the best of mysters here, and perhaps the hardest fire – they are fishing.
There is a viable television connection on a carrier on a carrier.
It's like the Eurovision songs.
"How do you have the best fish in the mountains, Thor-Juardgen?"
"We're here, Havard."
They're dogs, they're drunks.
A man falls from the sandalies, perhaps in the watervite effect.
Or maybe all these fishes are out of the cook.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto is faced with a difficult start
When the new president of Mexico prepared to go to the office of Enrique Pena Nieto, BBC looks at the difficulties that Will Grant and the people's missing expectations.
It's particularly bad to the trafic of Mexico now.
In the best time, there was a warm city, and there was a huge cause for many mother rotations since Monday.
But the purpose is not to stop people going to work, but the protesters stopped reaching the meclism.
Saturday, the new President of Mexico will take the bird of Enrique Pena Nieto and take the task to manage the nation.
In contrast to an unfair mission.
Flipe Calderon, in the purchasing administration, had a good operation of the Mexico economic actor, but in six years a drug control of 60,000 in the country.
Mr. Pena Nieto said to the Oval Office of OBD this week, President Barack Obama, "It's a great word to the Mexican people."
I'm gonna offer a new security strategy to make our agreement.
Before Mr. Pena Nieto's former law testing in the Mexican operation, Mr. Pena Nieto was deployed.
The crowd around it was divided in a new leader in this area, which grows in the ancient mechanism.
A wordful man
For example, the Royal Valley of Bravo is remembered in love in the Bravo Castle.
The inhabitants here revealed that he's creating the tourism in his place.
You can go from Mr. Pena Nieto's new carriers to reach the town to get a city, a great progress on the changing roads and all sorts of ways.
Furthermore, the plates moved on the name of the modern spor centre and the impact of the museum.
"We're looking at her to bring the real and remaining change," Mr. Pena Nieto says, "the concert of the Gabriel Olvera Hernandez's member of the jurisdictional PRI party.
In particular, we hope that our country is very interesting and genuine change.
81 years later, Vicente Fox was sent by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congress member Olvera states that after 12 years later, Enrique Pena Nieto was very waiting for 12 years after the Congress House.
And he refused the new president of the Ombudsher to appoint it as expensive.
It's a clear man who calls himself with a great country visious.
One man who knows to listen to any more than all.
But it's not the idea that many people have about the ancient roads.
In Nezaa, Nezahualcoyotl, he couldn't be disappeared with the Valle del Bravo's stoned parks.
A baniology of Mexico City is under the top of the otoyle.
And the problems in the household are hard and urban.
This year, it was called to help drugs fighting drugs in the prisons and especially more widespreadly against women.
In two years, we've been killed by some women's body over two years.
Mr. Pena Neo was killing more than 1.000 women in Mexico, and more than the city of Juarez who was recognized by the murder of women.
Those who operate Mr. Pena Nieto in the best way, said she couldn't start mourning up to the problem of murder.
They're the worst way when they come not to his rule.
In a typical beton house in Irinea Buendia, the daughter of Mariana Luna, he's got my eyes with the pictures of the ages.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana in 2010 announced.
But she believes that his family was killed by his partner.
"He remembered the body when I went home," said Senora Buendia.
There was a look that she showed that he was driving, and death was so far started.
When his mother tells the story again, she looks at a picture from Maryna's wall down, and one word found on it: Adalet.
But he said that the family was exactly denied.
The power officers acted with me as an elderly co-code, who made a problem, and a craftman.
What people wanted to make it easy to accept and shut their knees.
"But when it's so irregular and disagreement, it can't be true," he said.
President Pena Nieto comes with severe responsibilities on the birth of Saturday.
For ten thousands of our family past six years in Mexico, he promised to priorize them during the new president.
The PRI Congress member, Olvera, says, is a president in the Valle del Bravo.
But this is what the victims of the city of Neza feared the most.
Bradley Manning didn't admire the bad acts.
The soldiers are trying to come against Bradley Manning's bad ideas.
Doubt, Maning Quantico is focused on the time that soldiers in Virginia stayed in prison.
He wants Maning to shut the case when he was arrested.
In the army, thousands are accurated to play secret documents.
The soldiers tried to indicate that the greatest secret material deficiency in the Summit of the United States was accused in the army, he was awaiting over the military of Bradley Manning who had lived on the bad behaviour.
Ft. Before the stage in Meade Maryland, he revealed that Ashden Fein Manning had not shown a disagreement in the 9th months in Virginia.
It's just a day later when maning had thought that maning had been overlooked in the trial when he was overlooked.
The army, who observed in August 2010, are accurate to play thousands of secret documents in Iraq.
Materyal later was released by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never corrected that Manning's source of information.
On Saturday, Fein studied the forms that Mening had been filled with the maning forms since the year 2011 in the Single Military prison, after the meeting of Maning.
The officers asked Maning questions and noticed their answers.
When he asked for forms on Saturday, he told Meaning's behaviour's behaviour was "feeld" and all the system's behaviour "Multice Professional"
The forms don't show misunderstanding, if the officers ask Meaning's right to do so, he says Fein.
Maning told them that they were talking about the matters and that they were talking about the concerns of the visitors, and they told them to be moved to them, but they didn't keep the matters.
Maning said, "They haven't written anything.
He asked why he didn't decrease the behaviour on the acts of behaviour during the 2011 meeting at Yarbay Denise Lind de Manning.
Maning responded that the situation was resolved in the meeting of Maning is "promised".
The army told them they have put the watch of him in an incredible way to protect him and others.
"I wanted to know something I'm sure, and I wanted to get out of the POI... to bring out the roof of a smoothed life residue," said Maning.
Maning was arrested to Iraq and expressed about the transfer of military in Virginia in 2010 in Virginia, in Virginia, in Virginia, for about two months ago.
He said he's thinking about Kuveyt, and he's felt there once because of the warm.
He said that it was a stress that he wouldn't allow them to know what is on the outside world.
"It's the coffee that house, Camp Arafjon's crashed," said Manning Persempers on the day.
I thought I'd die in that caffeine.
Maning said that most of the days, at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours, were only in a small cell.
Maning just said a bed, a campaign, a finger, a little clothes and their eyes were given.
He tried to walk, because he said that he's got to sleep in the day and even keeps up the rules.
Maning always said she was sleeping out of the cellar's eyes.
When the warriers returned, they didn't see her face when they're going to wake up and told him they're back.
Maning lawyer found a photograph of conducts made to Manning in Ocak 2011.
In 2011, Maning Nisan was moved to the Fort Leavenworth military in Kansas.
At the same time, the judge asked Meaning's day in Persian's day, a survivor, who was hard to sleep at a night in Quantico, asked about the warrants in one morning and the other courts were difficult to stay in front of the pitchers.
In the number of maning, he explained that he didn't have a chance to hide himself with the battery.
When the judge asked on Saturday, he told Meaning's order to cast him out a battery to cast him out, but he didn't put anybody out.
The maning's day of Persis, likely, expressed why he wasn't a danger for himself, because he was difficult to sleep for a previous night.
Manning Soura said that she could harm herself that he could not do this.
Maning explained that that night's pops and fingerprints were taken from the cells and their eyes.
At least the lawyers hopes that at least the lawyers will consider their tests in the prison and that the warrior who is expected to be fulfilled at the beginning of this year in the court will reduce its punishment in a large measure.
The war said that Manning would have accepted his crime in smaller crimes, and he was planned to fight in the worse crimes.
Duration has been planned to continue in this week, and the surveys are waiting for discussing the situation of the survey.
Pentagon Manning said that all the magazine was observed in Quantico according to the rules on the courts.
Those who are contrary to Manning, helping the enemy, be reasoned to be wrongly distributed in the Internet, to communicate their national defence information, and to denial or records.
If you're in the case of all of me, it's likely to be in prison.
My American identification crisis
Many say that it's difficult to leave Mexico because of the depth of the opportunity here.
The Mexicans are in the course of the departant; they remember difficult time to the Mexico,
Navarrette says that the Americans of Mexico have crashed between two worlds
I've been in a pretty busy trip to Mexico City, and I've turned back into your ground, and I'm surprised.
It showed two courses: one "Mexicanos" for "Meksicous", the other "Extranjeros" for "Extranjeros"
I was standing there a couple seconds, I wasn't sure where I'm going.
I've been called as a "Meksic" in the center of California for all my life.
In this ethnic steno, my friends in Boston say to their own "Irish" or to my friends in New York.
Then I decided in Mexico.
But that was Mexico.
And my grandmother had no need to stenoya or tired.
I was basically American.
I'm talking to Spanish, I'm so good to manage both sides of a meeting in this language.
But I don't have local words and I can't escape from my American attitude.
That's why I got my passport and I went through for extranjeros.
I thought that when the president of Mexico elected Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White Saray to visit the President Obama this week.
Like the two countries' leaders at the day, it is always like when they met two country leaders: let the skin, drugs and drugs.
Pena Neo was glad to talk about the growth in Mexico to come into the United States Democrates now, even in Mexico.
The United States and Canada wants to be combined with the United States and to create a tactical blow in North America.
Pena Nieto swore to continue to fight the drug cards.
Relations with the United States to Mexico are full of smooth and unfair feelings.
In 1848, most Americans probably never thought that the United States had operated Mexico and that their leaders had been difficult to give half of their lands with difficult difficulty.
But not minutes, but some centuries are memory for the Mexicans everywhere.
This is why, when a US authorities said something about Mexico, you will begin to hear the decisions that the American neighbourhood has dealt with the Kingdom of Mexico.
And Montezuma's children goes on the way to fight.
And again, it's really a really difficult relationship for Mexico with more than 35 million in the United States.
Do you want to talk about immoral feelings?
There's too much.
The winners in Mexico and the loser people have the opportunity of the country and people who haven't created.
The only reason that many people have to live in the towns like the Mexican pools of Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is to be a person in a point of view, perhaps a father or a grand father in Mexico, and have to leave to northern.
And mostly, this person dreams a profile – ten, less education, and vs from a fair village.
We are theirs and we will give them.
It's not mexic.
And now, though we live the American Slaughter, we can't see what we've found, and we're never going to get out of what we've found as a good job.
Our identity may sometimes be uncertain, but our trust is clear.
They are United States.
In addition, we know that most of the Mexicans haven't loved us in the manager class.
This feeling is responsible.
They're seeing us as an abusive newsgine, and they look up as a high group we've been uncomfortable as a mixed group.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, and our links with Mexico are never so strong.
Our ability is about the complete deficiency of their eyes.
Our parents wouldn't have been lost in Mexico.
And now we haven't found us hidden by the backward of the U.S., but they have lost and lost spirits.
My wife, born in Guadalajara, came to the United States as lawful, remembers that they were Mexicons, and that the Mexicoians and Mexico have drunk to them.
Although it's a visitor, the U.S. seems to be a part of two countries.
At the same time, most of them are not feeling like part of the Mexican American two.
We like to listen to Bruce Springsteen, and to listen to Los Tigres del Norte.
You're getting the best two worlds, but you're not a dog.
We're seeing American in Mexico.
We are accepted as Mexico in the United States.
Now, as I learned in my trip, some Mexican leaders and some of your skills want to reconnect Diaspora.
They want to work to show their interests to the United States, Mexico's recent Americans to work as a "Lands".
We're hard to say how beautiful it's a country like us to visit the Americans and to strengthen their legal leaders with Mexico.
Yeah.
That won't.
There's a lot of feelings.
And most of us are not sure that this is a great country.
I'm afraid you're the only friends.
That's right.
At least some Mexicanians are still ready to remit to Mexico for a century before, then some Mexican Americans still have to accept their family members to be conducted more closely than this.
Hmmmm.
Maybe we're "Mics" more than I thought.
Old wars, New Central East
It may be an uncertainty for the fires between Israel and Hamas.
Should the Arabs and the Jews continue peace between the Middle East?
Another blood smoke shows that such a hope is empty.
Whoso's so much outcoming disputes were turned to a lot of buildings, most of the Philistines and six Israelites killed, and the great city of Israel from Gaze was in the nearest part of the high city of Tel Aviv and the sanctuary city.
But when Israel and the Philistines seem to be burdened in the former storms, they changed in the Middle East.
And the Arabians took parts to the air, and did not be pleasant, but the Philistines, and the children of Israel shouted in the region.
Maybe this makes them more bloody than the old one.
Yet, there are reasons for thinking that they have been killed.
What a war that has been lost
It seems to be very hard to get right now.
And if he continued the fireholds accepted in the 21th Castle, he strengthened both sides of war this week.
Since 2007, the German movement managed Gazze will indicate that Hamas's leaders are difficult to return Israel from Gazze.
He couldn't start to kill some of the leaders and destroy Gazze's 1,7 million people in the world and hold Israel's people in one of the pools.
Of course, Hamas Philistin now wins the middle of Philistines in Fatah.
Furthermore, Hamas's leaders can make the result that they're in their time.
In the Arab world, Hamas had strong and rich friends.
Israel's most widely resurrected regional power in Turkey, Katar, one of the most rich and dynamic duties of the Cruz, was the most wide.
The pleasant Hamas people said that he was an inspirant Israeli, a ruling of Hizbullah military party, which rises to the north of Lübnan, the Federal Teacher of Bear could overcome the Syrian, and the King of Hamas was deployed by the King of Territory.
Furthermore, his brothers' high-speaking brothers in the southern Arab countries changed the highest part of the country of Israel in Egypt, and the most important in Egypt, under Muhammad Mursi.
In 2011, there was much less time for Hamas' Lake Lakes Governed Egypt until the fall of 2011.
At the same time, my sister Hamas's neighbor's friend and leaders are far more about the campaign of Hamas.
The future diploma can be defined as an actor who has not even been banned by Israel and America.
At the same time, Israel's officers will bring out exactly less results.
He's laid back back to Hamas.
Demir Kuba proved the value of the anti-country system and most of Hamas was destroyed.
Israel will sleep more calm for a long time.
Diplomaticly, Hamas has decisively condemned Hamas as soon as never America has never been, and most of its European countries also have been engaged in the last warrant events.
In addition to all, Israel grew up in Netanyahu’s headship, who had not seen the peace process in great measure.
Since 2004, the rucks from Gazze were killed by about 30 Israelites, Israel who wanted to go down to the Western Judea and continued to expand the Jewish places that protect the intimidable bombers.
The Likud Party's election on 22 October, Abigdor is still comfortable to Mr. Netanyahu with the war group.
Why are these false Philistines giving their governments?
If they're actually running the West Jeriah, are they not smoothing fires like they've been in Gazze?
It's better to keep them behind the wall and cast them up their heads.
Maybe it's winners, and it's still possible to change the Arab guards.
And if the Sustainers won the power in Egypt, and the other places like Israel are less, they're fighting for priorities in their homes.
Israel's defence union is greater than the Arab neighbors.
The local sovereign force will not help to resolve the economics of the new Arab governments.
Pragmatic Mr. Mursi worked together with Barack Obama and may have done the starting of something.
Israel's gotta look at a long time.
When the rest of the Arab world is democratized, the Philistines are creating a busy bus in Tel Aviv a day, which is unremovable to escape in the areas of Israel's business.
The pressure in the Jewish government is already blown by the democracy and it is enlarged when the Arab population grows.
He'll get a diplomatic diplomatic to turn Hamas over a few years against Gazze, who grows up bloody tasks.
There's a need for outdoor team on the two sides.
Most of the outer world and of the sensitive people who have been famous in this newspaper remain as the two governments of Israel's security.
And if you're a little hopeful fire, it's a sense that the foreigners will give a little more pressure.
The Egyptian is now a better place to stop the arms of Gazze, Turkey, and Katar, which has been a Jewish government in 1967, accepting the country change and common coast.
The Arabs have to hard to meet Hamas and Fatah.
This is more useful than a secondary government proposal that is close to BM for a Philippian government.
And Mr. Obama is a role when I bring Israel to the table.
At the first time, he agreed to offer his peace plan.
It seems unlike to take into the white Saray.
It doesn't see a huge way.
There's a skill of life in the United States in the Middle East.
This means a peace agreement between Israel and the Philistines.
Sigara's packing laws walking in Australia
Sigara warnings and disease organisms are placed in the left green boxs for all marks
Australia has entered the first laws on the world of cigarettes and drugs, and heats and babys who have been sigarys, and babys who are sierrately sigarys.
The only important difference between the packages that will be given from Saturday, with the same small type of letters that will be marked.
I'm the most fucking drug to pack it in this world.
Australia's Federal Government says that young people's purposes disappearing the shigar drinking.
This, if they don't start cigarettes until 26 years of people, has been encountered by 9 percentages that they will never start.
"You can see that the children's children are working to sell the brands of their children," says, "and even a lot of the age of age," and the children showed the idea that their children are not a pretty logosis and are working with the federal health career of Tanya Pliber.
Although Australia has one of the smallest cigarettes in the world and changes will have much less effects on the cultures of many nations, other countries think that they are likely.
The pillar's industrialists made sweet lobbys against blood.
She said that the pillar's firms would support the black bottles, and they'll be able to send to the cigarettes more and more accessible.
The British American Tobacco from Australia Scott McIntyre said: "They will be no serious results of Jaasam."
Chinese and Indonesia's hearts will bring more of these products to sell Australia in the streets.
The others say that the laws have increased the work.
Zico Import of a small family company Pty Ltd from Sandra Ha ha ha, two months ago, the Silicion slaughters of the British American Tobacco, the Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco had been scattered out of the high bloods in Australia.
Zico says he's sold more than 6,000 sold and waited for a new store.
That's a good job for us.
In the demography, the people say that it is the popularity of social media in which the potential atmosphere plan is calculated.
A magazine, Australian blood, has denied televisions and sponsority, and many soldiers wanted to hide the skills from places.
Australian local companies and sites have decreased the internet records, but marine sites can't decrease.
Becky Freeman said, "If you are on the top of the world and know your products, this was only a little window, the place you need to join the record."
Freeman marks showed that it was an increase in the "gouvernemental" sites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Does this Marlboro really like the civil skills?
The British American Tobacco said that the Australian industrialist was concentrated with new rules before it was paid.
Industria has continued to pay for the new regulations of the Republic of Ukraine, Honduras, and the Dominican Cultural Republic, so that these countries have advocated any of the countries in the World Ticaret Organization with Australia's important measure.
It's likely that a WTO decision is in the middle of 2013.
If we are more, the government said that she made them see with other countries who think of the same package decisions.
The first country, Canada, was the Canada's first country who made the advertisement of photos in 2001.
Now, Brizilya, Turkey and Ukraine were released to more than 40 countries.
England, New Zealand, South Africa and India are thinking more bloods.
Most of Australia's drinking a cigarette.
Images don't affect me.
I'm coming from seeing them.
When he bought a packet with all the lips, Victor El Hage, he said, "Take a cigarette and place."
If you need to be honest, there's just a reason for me to leave, she's my little girl.
Sydney's center said he's hard to hide the only type of package packages in the center of Sydney.
He said, "I've got an hour before I've gone, and now he's getting my four hours."
"It had to do all the people, then, well, our job was finished, we'd say we're going to shut it," he said, "to get his hands into the air.
A world's fashionful fishing team is very bad.
When we've lived mechanical difficulties in this thanksgiving day, and when we've got to wait for another airport, I've been waiting for five hours in the airport.
So I've been a long time to think about smoothing.
I won't lie to you.
And if it was half days in the air at the air, it's pretty important to wait for flights, books, magazines and iPhone. (I don't even talk about the smoke.)
But the growing way some atcademics and children are impressive to enhance children.
They say that it's normal for us and our kids.
The brain is difficult to go to interesting tanks, and it may makes creative.
And most of us aren't able to try the smooths of the randoms because we're depending on the other.
So, do we have to make a fucking shot?
Yeah.
And no.
But I'll get back to it.
First of all, I wondered that a new story was a lot of less than many people.
In Canada, the University of Calgary is a professor of Green and Roman history in the University of Italy and says: "Subsequently, Vital A Tarih" (Jonevi University, 2011).
"It's actually a very long history of the disappearance," said.
There's a Latin wall writing on Pompei's walls from the first century.
It's how we're going to deal with it.
This is that it has been defined many different ways and has been discussed, says Ontario, the teacher of the psychological university in Canada, John D. Eastwood.
After looking at the literature of research, he was defined as an attempt of an atmosphere of 100 personalism group, Professor Eastwood and his communications.
He said, "Whatever it's about to be hurt, it's not a person who wants to be impressed?"
He said, there's nothing to do in the mixture.
He said the test of the smile is that the smooth mode and time-limiting feelings of an interesting process.
It may look like the depression of disappearance.
But professor Eastwood, they may be about but often people who are in the way of seeing the problem around or around the world, but they said people in depression would see their own problems.
Sometimes, when we're just going to be a concentration, we think we're crazy.
In September, Professor Eastwood and the Communities, the Psychologic Scientists, published in the magazine of the Psychology Research, signed a former test of the Destruction Agency.
Some groups have heard a high and high television program in the outside room, and others heard it very smallly, but the third group had never heard.
Those who hear the television of two other groups have reported more frequently, they have lived in difficulties without concentration, but they weren't sure because it was a problem.
One of the writers in the Guelph University in the Ontario, said that you're trying to concentrate on a hard or intermediate task, and that you're an interested deployment in the Guelph University of Mark J. Fenske.
On the other hand, when you read something painful, "It can help you to turn out the bad tools in the one factory, to distract your attention from music. "
In fact, it is usually possible to help people to fight with it as a sign of pain.
"There shows that children who have been allowed to be moved and have learned more than children who have been able to be moved," said Professor Phenske.
We're all attempting the trouble in some points, the aircraft, a monoton talker, a smooth movie.
But some of them are more often more often than the others.
In 1980, researchers have developed a Destruction Death In 1980.
The death, "Much as I have to do is, most things I have to do again and monoton," and, "I have a lot of interest, I have no time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, who was a psychological professor at West Florida University, said that, in particular, researchers, were more and more widely needed to hear the need for men.
However, generally, it's a very bad group of pregnancy.
In 1991, the professor Reed Larson's human and community development in Illinois University made about 400 people and their parents in the day seven and eight times communicating the civilians.
Gentlemen found that when 32 percent of the school and payment, they've been mixed in 23 percent when they're not in school.
On the other side, the parents said that 3 percent of their parents were flown.
Professor Larson said he didn't know if the percentages are higher or higher.
But he said that when children and heroes wanted to do it, she knows that it was the time of warming.
That's why I turn back my first question: is it good to hurt men?
Sometimes no, because it shows that people can lead to these agreements to play or use materials when investigation is deployed.
On the other hand, professor Vodanovich said that many philosophs and writers have been connected between creativity and creativeness.
The N.Y., professor of psychological in the U.S., said, "It's a chance to tell you you have to do anything else."
But your mind always doesn't know what the most appropriate thing is to be done.
If you're scared, and if you're going to play this energy and use it to eat, it's gonna make you happy.
But if you're looking for TV, it can be happy to go short, but it's not going for a long time.
So if you're gonna give a IPad to her when your kid is hungry, it can't be a bitch, but he doesn't learn to enjoy himself or to get herself, he said professor Phenske.
And he said, "It'll be transfer to the other case of editing yourself."
It doesn't learn to enjoy himself only, but it's more in other areas.
I don't think we're really glad to be disappointed.
We must not have to do so much elective.

So I'll give you the most true, healthy and reliable news at the National Journal and Harbor.com.tr.
I'd like to get a sound file that brings it to the competitive.
We'll take these articles in our sections that will continue in the form.
You can find reply to all questions concerning dealing with dealings.
You can take your questions that you don't have an answer and specially concern you.@hurresse.com.tr
I'll be in the street to answer you at the shortest time.
What's wrong with?
MALULEN is the unprecedented work of the age of work, at least 60 percent, which is not able to work in the SSK and Big-Kur's situation to condemn the lives of the SGK, which are counted by the safeguards, which could be revealed early to their recognized life.
When the workers are working, they can't be able to make their vacuums apart from the top, as well as in the situations that they have lost their powers.
Who's going to say?
I write from the diary, my name, Majeste Waltekin, I'm 920 days of security, and I'm only 540 days, and I'm 1460 days of warranty.
Furthermore, I'm a kid sick.
I'm connected to the diagnostic machine.
I'm working on a half worker.
Can I get a penalty penalty?
- The best Bey's past first.
You haven't seen when you've first worked on your problem.
However, let's just tell you how the deceased is.
First of all, the most important circumstances identified in the blood have been secured since 10 years, and your total first day should be 1800 days.
Moreover, you're supposed that you've lost 60 per cent of your work, or case or disease results in the collective force.
However, because you're a diagnostic disease here, you're not allowing the 60 percent of the time you're not fitting the summit.
Of course, we don't know how many years you worked.
And your ten years, and the days of your day, and 18:00, you shall be revealed to you in a month, in which you have made your apartment.
Conditions of real winning for the month
Should there be no one who has been a 1800 days without a decade?
- The prize rate of payment is to be completed in 1800 days.
However, there is one desire, and he has decided that another is constantly decisive for those who have decided that it has been an safeguard period for 10 years, unrequesive demand for other circumstances.
What kinds of diseases or disappearance will be defined in the future of our progress in the future.
The situation of the event that has been resolved before starting
I'm Ahmet Woler.
I'm taking all the circumstances in the SGK, and they told me, you can't take a back to the first time before I'm sick.
I'm so crazy.
Isn't it wrong?
How am I going to do?
- Ahmet Bey, you've written that you've made all the circumstances in the law but that's one of the mother's conditions, and that's not one of the SSK and the SSKs placed in the blood before the loss of the diseases.
It's not possible that you don't have to move this trail.
Yet, when you have an old self - control, you may be able to make your intentions.
- I have 3980 days, and I'm 16-year-old.
It was designed by SGK before I come into my defence.
They told me you can't be a bitch.
What I'm doing in this case.
I'm not going to be smooth.
Will you show your way?
- Yeah, you've heard it.
You can't be a massive.
But in the SGK law, there is a provision for you.
I mean, before April 2008, and then there are two situations.
If you start to work before this newspaper, the SGK will always be abolished before you work, you can receive at least 15 years security period and 3600 premium days with an elderly agency number of days.
We therefore suggest you that you will be in the request of a month to join you the most closest of the SGK.
- Well, if you were working after my earlier 2008, then you could have been ensured for at least 15 years since and at least 3960 days of abuse, age and death security.
Do you want to get away from here when you busy?
I'm working as a spot in a worker.
When I went to the hospital, it was a cancer to me.
I want to be a bitch.
Do I have to leave the job in this case?
Can't I start a month without disappearing?
I don't want to stay unemployed until you're busy.
- You've heard it.
It's necessary that you've got to be separated for a month-based desire.
But before you start the months, you'll need to be numbered by your SGK blood.
But if you're wrong, it's a month with you.
There is no meaning that a month connection wants to be paid, and you've got a risk to remain unemployed.
It's enough to be your 1800 days for that.
When you're going to SGK, you'll like to love you to one of the patients authorized.
And when you're taking the health report you're taking from here, the SGK will be a reason for you to assess the report in your health, and your cancer disease will decide that you'll have an impact on 60 percent of the month.
However, if you have to fill the 10 years of security, this time will be able to connect you a month.
So we can shortly say this, the guard of the securityists who are working is not an understanding of the "related" decision.
But if the guards working in any case, they may ask that the SGK and the disappearance of the situation and the month may be connected.
And if this happens, and the other ways are stoned, it may be a bit early monthly shot for the starter.
Did it be to make the low-Kur borrow?
I'm low-Kur protector.
I'm driving all the ways.
However, they said you can't be deprived because it's my reward.
What I have to do.
- I'm amazing.
He told you whoever he told you.
You didn't write what's the other way but if you think that you're taking these ways, 4/b is difficult to pay your prims.
But I can give you a special tiyo.
I suggest you to pay your tax banks or buildings like this.
As soon as soon as soon as you'll get a lot of months, and you'll be paid in our payment just one moment ago.
These buildings will be easy to be paid because they've been abolished from your month.
What is the stage of disappearance?
The SSK and Bach-Kur, and I, of course, worked for the Emekli Sanctuary.
When I'm lying my feet, where'd the month get to me?
If you're working on more stations as the SSK and the peasant, you're the latter, you're in a security fault, so you're safe, and you're going to move the last month from the SSK.
SGK is also the valid hospital reports
How is it going to do?
Can I get the health report from the hospitals?
It's enough for you to start social security media or social security centres for health reports.
I have learned you, and I will love military hospitals with the Turkish Army's hospitals, university hospitals.
However, in the case that you have not revealed these hospitals, it may also be tackled to the highly deployed hospitals of health.
It's possible to love a special hospital, right?
- You know, it's like it.
In the former regulation, only governmental hospitals can be slacked and lived with the risk of risking patients to be made to hospitals, 01.09.2013, with a new governance to walk with SGK, which can now be advised to the treatment in the environment and to see other patients’ lives of personal risks that can be improved in patients, and that you have received health reports here.
What are the definitions searching for love operations?
It's enough to be the primary time of 1800 days of the civilization occurred in the SEVK demand.
The hospitals in relation to the hospital will be paid by SGK.
Moreover, 10 years' security periods will not be searched, and SGK looks at this.
In the situation of the disobedience of the month, if the person is in the meaning of an important deficit, 10 years of security period only in 1800 days, according to the report of health.
This is why when the person has come to the first time in the detention of the crime, I think it's likely to be able to deal with the SGK only in the 1800th day.
Remote operation

South Pamir, after the Mimari University ended the Mimari University in England, he took sound diplomacy from the SAE college and made a master of sound technologies at the Middlesex University.
My Communication technological technicians is also expanding sound engineering in the ITM, and gives music technology, sound technologies, executive technologies, electronic music and יותר record technologies.
Subliminal message
"What's the sound technology exactly?" It's the first question.
"A technology that can be used in many places in the world.
Our brain is getting everything with electrical senses.
The sound frequency is a kind of electricity, energy.
You can allow people to move with the command you want."
And one of the most important subliminal messages of the sound technology.
The new message is placed in a frekans out of a flower border, which can't be defined by this top memory, but it's going to be lower.
For example, Pamir's reporting a terrorist attack to that area.
The terrorist field will choose this message to be changed to a changing changing changing songs like "Don't do this attack".
It doesn't understand what it's about, but the lower beauty gets it, and a voice from inside comes like she said to her.
He will even see him as a message from Allah.
However, there are certainly lawful and punishment in the world and Turkey that these messages are used without social security.
But South Pamir, only one time, has been prepared a sub-conference to the students in the United Nations, to tell the comments.
"I listened to music during the conference to students.
I put a sound in the music for Suu.
I asked them at the end of my Sun, they couldn't stop the students.
They've told all that they've been very dreaming."
According to Pamir, there are subliminal message users: "There are some radio channels that have done, but the details are still unfortunate.
There's a canal in the German "Cara Seine Radyosu" a frequency of radial islanders.
The subliminal method is reports to be attracted, containing the dictionary, civic calling, commanding drugs to use.
The German police also knows Turkish police, but it can't be started because they've changed the frecans.
In addition, this kind of dangerous messages was used in the music world.
In particular, some heavy metal groups are...
According to these ideas, there was no terrorist in the aircrafts that entered into the flights, and the direct attack of direct pilots has been implemented with subliminary teams that were highly known.
Swimmingboard
Sound technology can be used in crimes.
It's from this science in the U.B., especially in bank skills.
For example, when the police moves to the telephone rubber with the sound engineers, they can find out where the songs in the song of the song can be deployed.
A sound metal, the throne, the plastics, the wall or any other material.
And it can be possible to define the size of the room that is in the shadow of the sound format, even the shape of the room, how many oxen it is.
Thus, the sound of the offendant can be advised by what kinds of substances there are in a room and in a way.
And there was a computer program used that Pamir had even made the buildings of a Tataristan's buildings, "I know where 175 holy planning can be provided to the perfect sound regulation.
It's not a paid technology, but $4-5,000."
Sound frequency is also used in the mixture and decoration.
Pamir's got a lot of jobs about it.
There was a regulation where his workmen went, in a relocation of the upper substantive meetings, which the voices couldn't come out of the table.
Only those who are talking at the mass can hear the ones in the table.
Nobody more than two steps can't hear anything talking at the table.
The general system of these types of regulations is: "If you want to destroy a sound, it's a decrease of your molecule in the same frequency, you'll touch another sound and you're going to destroy the sound energy.
No one could go to the flight if it's not the system.
Because the sound of the air motors is so high.
The voices in the storm will destroy each other.
Even if your system and your windows are open, you can create a long-term environment in your house."
Have Egypt piramides been made with the voice?
There are other interesting work from Pamir's first sound engineers of Turkey.
It was a regulation that has been made on a open air disk in Availability to be heard out of the sound of the music.
The sound can't go beyond the border, it's disappeared with another sound frequency.
Even in a room, it can be made quiet after a clear line.
The Pamir's school spor salon, and the spor and the concert.
So it's used for two.
Because it's gotta need to play the basketbol when it's playing, but it's got to be not in the concerts.
Only in the commenting concerts, there is a sound catalysis that can be heard only with sound technologies.
"We use frekans that destroy the sounds that are disappeared as a ghost, and that will be able to disappear the music.
MTV's very far on this.
He says, it's a remarking concerts, and it's sounding smodyo in the sound area.
The test was like that.
The sound frequencies separates two aliminiums from each other.
There were scientists who described that the piramites were made with the voice of the Egyptians.
They thought it could be removed and placed.
I'm asking, "I'mn't it with an unfortunate use of bad purposes?"
"I was afraid when I read the York University work from the Internet, so he reads others.
For it answers the good persons who are well-knowledged, except the laboratory conditions, and they may cause evil results.
"Dualar's effect by the Arabia."
And the sudden Pamir says, "For all the voices of your ears, it's known to the heart of all the voices of your ears.
The sovereign people hear that they're only concentrating, but other voices are reported to the brain, and they're going to be careful.
So it's good to be done to walk on the ground, to make the natural walks.
I think regulations should be set up in schools.
So the student will concentre the voice of the teacher's only, and it can provide a longer concentration."
The Pamir said that it's a very rich frequency of the sound frequencies, and if the prayers believed that it's been an impact of the Arabians, it has a very rich frequency leg, and when the voices in the words come back, it's a lot of improving effects.
"But you need to read the prayers soundly, and I'm going to read the Yasin wall. "
Frekansla Love Tariff
"Is it possible to love someone with sound frecans?"
Not loved Pamir's lovers, but the more true person's feelings to move, saying: "Therefore you need to find the frequency of a person you want to speak when you want to love.
You can affect it using a higher frecans than this frecans.
For example, let's think that the press person's fashion is 300.
And you want to play a music to cancel your feelings.
If you're disappearing music, the only flower flowers of the 300 frecans fall into the strength of the only low-based flowers, and you're still pressing the low-based capabilities of that person.
Maybe this might be loved to the one who is present in that moment."
The Pamir said that they can speak more effectively of the sound systems in the world, when the press sounds have been made out in front of the plan, a political artist can feel like a highly wonderful one.
And he said, "There is a sound that Mikail's in the day of the dream, which he has believed to be made, and how will it be? And Pamir's answer said, "Behold, a sound will be close to the voice of the human, because the voice of the people is close to his voice.
"What is a wonderful object, and it is like a man's reproach."
'He's going to rise up.
In Canada, Jennings Capital Inc., an Analist Dan Hrushewsky, said that the Governments were trying to reduce their money in order to reduce their wages, so he will continue to arise up from the current highlight of the gold. "There will continue to be a secure vocational tool."
In the first half of the last week, Hrushewsky, China and India's leaders, in a higher way, showing the highest relations of the AA in the festivals, which was higher than the World Interest, in Hrushewsky, China and India, in the first half of the first year, showing that "the gold demand is highly connected with the Indian, and the Chinese leaders are a great role in this."
As I remember, Hrushewsky is the largest of India's traditionally traditionally winners, "I believe you're not a lot of pretty glass to manage the gold of the United Kingdom.
People's gonna find a way in this frame."
The Hrushewsky will continue to serve as a royal worker under the leaders.
Many of the West governments are forgotten to be forgetted by the source of the 'dispilin' extinction.
The forces are trying to reduce their wages in the way to fall the value of the money.
So it was found that gold captures will be high from the current levels."
"Orly gold goes, it's stopping the risks of raising the pizza."
The Record of the World Gold Consequent Marcus Grubb indicated that a physical identity that is not reliable in the golden and comprehensive finance platforms, the coffee, and its reliable features, “If Uzun’s govern, developed characteristics and piyasa have been retained to improve their risks.
He showed gold portfloors that were of small mixtures shown that it was a desire to bring it, usually it was better to get more sustainable and uncertainty.
The Grubb has noted that the request of the golden learning has risen in the past 10 years, "Take, over the global gap is less than 1 percent of the world's vary.
This means the opportunities of pills are still very important to grow in the golden currency.
In this globe, 78% increased gold and swimming clothes were protected by the swimming interest on the underlying.
"Hindistan has to enhance its national gold stories to support economic growth."
The world's largest gold pills in India and China, and Grubb, in the second round of the second year, included the demands of gold, gold and chicken in Asia, have increased the number of taxists in the world.
At the same time, Grubb remembered that 54 percent of the music demand in China, and in India, 51 percent increased.
"Grubb would normally be quite quite quite quite quite quick from the Czech Talks.
The Nisanda said, "She did not wait for the golden fittings, and he was shot up in the request, and the dogs were shocked quickly."
However, Grubb in India indicated that many preventions have been made by the government with the golden ithalamics, and that the Indian Bank is also supported by supporting and reducing battery exits, “the six demands are likely to be tackled by gold-related demands, and therefore can be found with non-profit channels.
The World Gold Consequence believes that India's policy correctly needs to see a strategic development.
Furthermore, it was found in order to assess the national gold chains to support economic growth. "
Global gold trends
According to the report of the World Gold Concept of World Trends in the past week, 856,3 tons of gold, and 508 tons of gold in this second area of the year were an international demand of 856,3 tons of globally clean and crowd.

In the terms of the word, it continued to grow stronger demand in China, waiting for the warrant to increase the gold in the future year, according to the same scene, 87 percent increased and 276 tonnes reached in the collection of this year.
However, in India, 71 per cent of the first golden ceilings, 310 tonnes were higher in the first plane.

"Filmin's head character is working in the father of the young Hikmet, Germany.
He's completed the education of Hikmet's greatest dreams, and he's able to add a doctor to the pasture in the months.
And it's not much to read and work.

It's a long metraya from a smoke movie.
The Senator of the Galada film and Dr. Ismet Era explained about the 80-year-old campaigns:
"When we start to this movie, our purpose was to make a short film.
But the first screens of social media saw so much interest that we were exciting to hear us to take a long metal.
They told us when we went to Itanbul's distributor, "Do we have a player?"
I said, "We don't have thanks, but I've 86, and I've got a cardiac game."

Everything has become a little bit of my immature!
The books of the students who read in common school were recognized and renewed as a media student
MEB, a year after education 4+4+4 has been transformed all the first schools in Turkey, media and images in the school.
Following the 1-year education period, a new scenario was the recurrent "intensive".
In Turkey, all the schools who have been engaged in the middle school in Turkey have come to my day, the "Reversie" of Konya, which was in Meram's Language, has been established in Sheker Ortacolum.
1 Year of normal environment
My first school, four+4+4 past year after the edit.
In school, the system currency was seen education with 6, 7 and 8 students in another school.
The school, which served normally as a common school, has been impressed with the end of the 2012-2013 learning year.
I believe, I accepted his students as a student at my school for the first time this year.

In the context, he explains that interesting expressions were made by the Millennium Education Society.
"With a number of schools, we've turned back to the bests of students and school numbers, and we've made some schools again with the Konya Valley, and in my head, it's been a prejudice of 15-20 schools in the Conya.
Students join the e-chool system with the school codes.
However, the former school is abolished from the ancient school code of the system.
The new school code is to be opened to the system's students.
The schools and the kind of schools used the new code of the school, and the teachers, because they had not been punished in the middle school.
And those who wanted to take their children's natives from these schools and can give them to other schools.
