A Republical strategy to combat the Obama election
Republic leaders justified their policy by the need for combating electoral fraude.
However, the Brennan Centre considers this last as a myth, stated that electoral fraude is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by foul.
In addition, the Republical lawyers have noted only 300 cases of electoral fraude in the United States for ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this respect, these measures will take part in the American democratic system.
In contrast to Canada, the United States are responsible for the organization of federal elections in the United States.
In that mind, a majority of American governments have made new laws since 2009 that makes more difficult the registration or vote process.
The phenomenon took the extent after the elections of November 2010, which were added 675 new republic representatives in 26 States.
Consequently, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the vote law in 41 States were introduced during the only 2011 year.
The new electoral laws require that the elections present a photo-identity card and a evidence of American citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws reduce the periods of vote by anticipate, invalidate the right to incorporate as a election day and to remove citizens with their right to vote.
Before the 2006 elections, no American State would require elections to present a photo identity card.
India was the first State to have such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirms the constitutionality of the Indian Act.
The Republics stressed that this practice was extended to other States.
During the past two years, they appeared law projects in 34 States to make the elections to present a photo identity card.
It is important to note that, contrary to Quebec, American citizens do not have universal identity card like the disease insurance card.
In fact, 11 per cent of the American citizens, or 21 million people in age to vote, do not have identity cards with photos issued by a government of their State.
In addition, five million new elections in 2012 have no such identity.
But it is often costs more than 100 dollars to get the required identity card.
New restrictions affect young people, minorities, and people with low income.
In fact, 25% of the United States, 15% of those gaining less than $35,000; 18% of the citizens of more than 65 years and 20% of the elections from 18 to 29 years do not have the identity card required with the photo.
Well, more.
Students, elections considered to be more voted for democratic candidates, are not authorised in several States to use their identity card with their institution.
In addition, the same States authorize members of fishery or exchange clubs that vote more from the Republic's side to use to vote the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no State would require a demonstration of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to submit such requirement.
Since 2011, a tenth of States adopted laws requiring elections to prove that they are American citizens.
These measures are clearly limited to the Spanish vote.
However, he learns that two Spanish elections on three favour the democratic party.
Furthermore, the Republician lawyers appeared in 2011 by laws to denial the registration of elections on the day of the crisis in eight States.
In addition, they have limited the right of persons and groups to provide assistance to elections wishing to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, during the 2004 general election campaigns, the election registration campaigns have contributed to recording approximately 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have increased 17 per cent of the registration rate of new elections in 2010 compared to 2006.
Furthermore, the Republical legislation adopted laws in five other States to reduce the vote period by advance.
For example, in the 2008 general election of Floride, 33% of the elections that had been voted by advance were Afro-Americans, while those were only 13% of the elections of the State.
He's going with the Spanish.
These were only 11 per cent of the election, but 24 per cent of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the white forming 76 per cent of the elections was only 46 per cent of the elections voted in advance.
Although democratic lawyers and their supporters are opposed to the adoption of laws restricting the registration of the elections.
Several law projects were blocked by the vessels of democratic governance.
The United States General Avocate is interventioned to sustain the most contrary laws.
They were able to limit the disappearances partly.
For example, only 16 to 34 States have adopted laws requesting the presentation of a photo identity card.
Nevertheless, the new rules laid down will be inadequate to make more difficult in the exercise of the vote law in 2012.
Democratic criticians demonstrate the partial character of the laws that have been voted and seeing a clear goal of improving the results in 2012 in key States.
A report of the Brennan Centre of 2011 shows that the States that have adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required to the electoral colleague to report the Presidency.
It is too early to state that those legislative amendments at the level of the electoral system will have significant impact on the results of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the rate of participation.
In this respect, these measures will take part in the American democratic system.
Prostate disappearance: pass the test or not?
In fact, the ACS test would sometimes present erroneous results, with false negative results or still false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
What to do further make the men already decent to carry out expenditure tests.
Pass the test or not?
We asked the opinion of two specialists.
In studies conducted in the United States, there were many pollution between the witness groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and to have close recommendations.
Another study, this European, concluded a difference of mortality between patients who had dismissed and those who had not had.
This study also demonstrated, with a follow-up after 12 years, that a 30-40% of more chances to have metastases if they are not extracted.
I therefore recommend the test from 50 years, or from 40 years if we have a direct parent that had a prostate cancer.
Afro-American men are also more risking.
The key is to take the right decision once a cancer detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others who are indolent.
The risk of his cancer must really be understood by providing possible options by not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life and, in these cases, rather rather, for active monitoring of disease.
Today, many men who are detected a cancer will not be treated, because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threat their life.
They will suggest that active monitoring will be made and if the disease is progressed, it will be offered to them a treatment.
Furthermore, the criteria are determined to decide who should or should not be treated.
I therefore recommend even if I get the test.
But the interested person is to have a discussion with his doctor to determine whether it should be done or not.
In collaboration with the International Urology Society, Movember has created a tool that allows to assess the proof and anti-APS test.

Prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no wonder to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of research, the adoption of good standards of life remains the best way to reduce the risks of suffering it.
It is thinking that if everyone had well eating and moved sufficiently, it could be 30% of cancers.
"If anymore anybody would smoke, this rate would smell at least 50%," said André Beauléu, the Canadian Society.
On the other hand, it is evaluated that approximately 10% of cancers are caused by heredship.
Several people are also fully explicit.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tabagism remains a priority, despite the reduction of the number of smokers.
Cigarette is linked to 85% of the cases of pommon cancer.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This night is extreme to people's health.
"Today, there are 1,5 million smokers in Quebec," he discovered André Beauléu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after the left of the cigarette, the risk of killing a half-country cancer.
The weights
Ambassadors and obedience also favour the appearance of disease, according to the SCC.
They increased the risks of cancer of oil, cotton and rect, ossphage, pancreas and uberus.
"The research demonstrates that the regular practice of physical activity during all life protects the cancer of the coton," adds.
Food
The body also recommends limited its red meat consumption.
In too large amount, it makes the risks to be reached by a colorctal cancer.
The charters also, and they should be avoided.
The conservation of meat by smoking, seating or sasalison may lead to the training of carcinogene substances.
"There can end the body cells and lead to cancer development," explains.
Vitamines
During the past years, several scientists studied the links between vitaminary and cancer supplements.
However, their research is not concluded for the moment.
Vitamine E studies are contractual, according to the SCC.
While one of them found a decrease of the risk of cancer from the prostate, another noted rather an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established.
Mr. Beaulieu also stressed the importance of speaking about his concerns and his family old ones with his doctor.
"To pass a exhibition test, it doesn't give the cancer."
The Higgs Boss Decorated
The announcement of the likely discovery of Higgs' Higgs bows has created all a emi, the last age, and for reason.
We believe that this bowson is involved in the responsible mechanism of the mass of everything in the United States, nothing else.
And then, it is the last part of whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best, or "pleasant" explaination of nature and behaviour - but which has not yet been mply observed.
But for physicians, it is not yet completely sure that Higgs is well.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that you have a new particule, and that it is a lot like the Higgs bowl predicted by the standard model.
Furthermore, new data issued this week during a great physical congress in Kyoto seems to confirm it, but still missing data to be completely certain.
Let's imagine that he's good of Higgs, because the chances to argue seem miserable, and let's see what it's.
There is, in this world, a fatally unconsolidable law that wants that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
Don't be able to extract this rules - and try not too strong, you're going to hurt you.
Although the physic of the particules is a good world, it appears that it also has a law of this kind: the principle of exclusion of Pauli, which stipulates that two particulars can not take the same space at the same time when they are in the same " quantity" - this "status" that consists of greatly in some of their characteristics.
From there, physicians classify the particules in two categories.
In a coin, there are good citizens named closure, who are wisely obedient to the principle of Pauli.
And in the other way the boss are, a sale of anarchist band that have no respect for nothing - in any case, not for this principle, which means they can speak and well be found in the same place, at the same time.
The Particle Adventure, the Berkeley Laboratory Laboratory: the mixes we will not discuss here, and the "Foll Parts" by which the large nature forces are provened and which Higgs' bows would be somehow obvious.
Thus, these boss must be stressed here, not all are so extreme animals that we can believe it.
In fact, if you have to read this chronic, it is through a bowl of extraordinary banality: the photon, or the "Light Party" which is the "messager" of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particule with an fast electric load or change of direction, this "drange" is the electromagnetic field in this precise place, a little as a ball launched in an etang.
Of this "dirangement" is born a electromagnetic onde (of light, or infringement, or optraviolet, etc.), and this onde is nothing else than one photon - and then, one of the boats "powerers".
Stabiliser Champ
It goes likewise with Higgs' Higgs bows, that's close to this other field, the Higgs field, which must be "differed" so that this boom appears.
But this Higgs field is a lot more stable than the electromagnetic field; for exit it, it must be reached from very high, very high energy, a little as if it was a green edge, which only a very large rock could rise on the surface.
That's why a great accelerator of particules like the CERN - the Hadron Collider Large is an approximation of 27 km from circumstance! - to reach such energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the report between Higgs and Mass.
These are in fact not all parts, nor all materials, which interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like the lovers, do it, but others not - a back of paper, for example, will never stand himself on a flower.
And in the same way, these are not all the particules that interact with the Higgs field: those who do it have a mass, then others (such as the photon, tens) do not have.
Now, what is "pour bringing" all these researches, Mrs. Plamondon asks?
For science, it will be able to verify the validity of the standard model (MS), and it also allows physicians to screen any difference between observations and preventions of the MS.
They are also many to want ardently to find it, because the least difference could open a door on a "new physical" and open some lots of the Modele.
This, it is necessary to say, still has huge cares, not proposing any explication for gravity (oups!) or the dark material, which is about 80% of the U.S. matter (re-ups!).
But we haven't found such disappearances to the CERN until now.
Repercussions
The impact of these researches in the daily of Mrs. All-le-Monde, they are more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to say that there will be nothing.
Keep: At the beginning of the 60th year, the laboratory pioneers, in the Bell Laboratory, hadn't understood the revolution that their work were going to deploy.
They were sent to it scientific applications, but nothing else was.
In fact, we have already told the physicians Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was found in 1960, and he himself put the first constant lacer (the first was cleaned), in 1962 - at the start the laser was rather seen as a "labo gadget".
Installing...
And then, applications may also result from all the tools around the search.
For example, the same Willard Boyle made a small light captor in 1969, during its optical work.
This captain, though it was not all his original intention, served now from "Oeil" to all the digital photos of the world, and valued him the physical Nobel 2009.
This does not certainly mean that LHC's activities will necessarily transform our lives, but that means that, actually, we never know...
Palliant care - The best way to die... ◆ Le Devoir
With his Commission died in dignity, Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate must be taken under little while a draft law is prepared.
But, in this essential area, much remains to do.
The Devoir tried to look at it closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr L. was still alone in his apartment of Montergy.
The prostate cancer had left him a repit of two years.
"They had given me five years to live, I've done seven years," said he, mid-rain mid-figue, reached in his bed in the house of Palliant cares Victor-Gadbois, from Beloeil, where he came the veil.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared to it," said he.
The disease does its work: a huge weakness that prevents it to be alone to the toilettes and even to eat alone.
Besides a dinner, he agreed to help meat, resigned.
He's even dreaming, speaking to the unknown ones around him, bringing his medications, offering a bathroom.
The force of the ordinary death.
"My greatest desire is that I'll be healed from diarrhea, it's humble."
Some hours later, the team found a remedy to that bad thing.
"In our life, we learn that a man must be shot," says Peter Brodeur, a psychologist at the house of Victor-Gadbois.
Return to the stage of the child for some persons is an unacceptable humiliation.
" It depends on the capacity of the person " to accept regression, notably.
Because, from the view of many people who are in Palliative care, great moments are deprived even in the heart of this regression.
The patients who enter into the Victor-Gadbois palliat care are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life pronostic of three months.
At this stage, the 'the team of doctors and nurses that around them does not provide cares " curative " .
For Ms. A., 89 years, worse fear is to die " conscious and enthusished ".
But the disease showed me to discover my kids.
"I have good children," added she.
"I have no more desires in life," she said, "and before accepting him a mask to help him respect.
She also waits, in the next days, a last visit of her son came from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, there is a group of benefits, body care and food assistance.
That's the Palliative care, that we're given it when there's nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, a Palliant care bed for 11.700 inhabitants is considered.
It's very little when we know we're gonna end all about to die one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains the Dr. Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Whatever is at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
In the death, we will accept to proceed mouth care for brandy or Pepsi according to the request.
Diabetics will no longer be able to control their sugar rates.
And death is part of the daily.
Yesterday, we served a drink to Mr. X, died during the night.
This morning, it's her son who will end the drink at the feet of the deafter.
" We help the neighbours as well as patients ", says Nathalie Saard, care director.
In the house of Victor-Gadbois, the days follow, but they don't look like.
On the side of an old man of 93 years, who has his last family meeting in the court, well calmed in his ears, while a young man of 36 years dies tragicly, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having all tend to survive.
"That's since six months, there are still three to five beds that are occupied by old cancers of less than 45 years," concerns the Dre Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to the Victor-Gadbois house come from their home, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to Palestinian care
It is said that 77% of the Canadians have not just access to Palestinian care, i.e. to care designed to suffer when a disease has come to the terminal phase of his life, which is home, hospital or care home.
And many organizations, such as the house Victor-Gadbois and the Palestinian Society in the Grand Montréal, are specialised more or less exclusively in the cares offered to cancers.
This is precisely this great care in the chebeco health care care care, which is worried of several specialized doctors in Palliative care to adopt a law under ehutanasia and assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifest, signed by the summits of Palliant cares, including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, is a circle to demonstrate their opposition to such an initiative.
According to the Christian Martel, the cubeois health system is not enough to ensure that everyone will have the right to quality cares before it is accepted to ehutanasia.
Received, she said, I saw a patient walking 14 days in the emergency, in great sufferings, without making it necessary to encourage it.
I'm afraid that patients don't ask to die because they don't receive adequate care.
And parallically, a number of uncles are acquiring on their patients until the last day, although the worst pronostics.
The hopes of survival of Helena Richard were already minime when she left a testing chemical.
When I announced my uncle that I stop the treatment, she answered that she regrets that I stop fighting, she told me.
But she told me I was over!
No care of any sustainable
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the diseases who ask to die thanks to the drugs that have not accessed their request after they have been stressed by a Palliative care team.
But it is necessary to say that Palliative cares are not absolutely capable in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, Palestinian care director for the Grand Montréal Palestinian Society of Palestinian care, patients would be refrescative to treatment in 8 per cent of cases.
At the end of the life, the doctors often used Palliative seed, which is to dream patient up to the moment of death, or sporadically, or permanently.
We can't look like this part of suffering.
Furthermore, the unemployed disease will have the opportunity to have this Palliative seed.
The diseases that are not emphasized always say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But it doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to ehutaniz me," that means "I want to be excited."
The achievement of this report was made possible by a periodism of the Canada Health Research Institutes.
Great Agriculture Scannings at Quebec
Foundation officers, BTP's enterprises, collectors of political and specialists of the Italian Mafia, tell the day after they know about a formable "systema" industry of building, officials, political, syndicalists and mafiosos.
A " industry " which costed very precious to the Cuban contributions, especially in 1990 and 2000.
"It's pretty curious as the system gets out since we took the great means," Ironizes James Duchesneau, deputed to Quebec and the former police leader of Montreal.
The offence has been carried out in 2011 by the investigation of a foundation investigation on distortions related to road work contracts in Quebec, with which the first Liberal Minister of the time, John Charest, had allowed only to repay.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, the covered financing of parties and the corruption of officials.
"In the beginning of the investigation in 2010, the only service of transport would be paid a billion dollars on contracts," some reflecting their instincts to touch a party quote!
The Charboneau Commission, "ha already falled two months," added, expecting that it comes to "demontate the strategimes behind individuals".
A permanent anti-corruption unit created in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit created in 2011 was also attained with its government verifiers, investigators and analysis.
More of the "sauade Marteau" police who, since 2009, had led the "cartel of eggs" from Montreal to put the sweet penal on the contracts ...
The past weeks, she occurred to serious investigations and brought accusations for fraude and corruption against municipal elections, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, a city of bathroom.
The next list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who comes to release his Laval Maire post, the third city of Quebec.
It is surprised that it has been involved in repairs in the exchange of public contracts.
It is also formally accused by engineers to the neighbour of Montréal and Italian undertakings, including Tony Accur and Lino Zfeld.
The latter made sensation by explaining the mechanical of the "systm" receipt of public contracts.
He himself paid for 3% of the value of contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia intermediately linked to Montréal Union, the part of the Garal Tremblay Sea.
Mr. Zfeld has sown all winds in the year 2000, giving more than $88,000 Canada (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to liberals then.
He should also organize a collection of illegal funds for the former Libéria Minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Business contracts for costs
In Montréal, the "systrum" of corruption worked around.
Gilles Surprening, former engineer in public work, it was well detailed before the Commission: in ten years he received from cadeal construction companies, invitations to travels, golf tours, restaurants, bucket matches and pots-vin total of $736,000, with exchange of costs that he gonflowed.
Other neighbourhood officers have been revealed to grass the contract from 30% to 40% the factures, by extra fairnesses.
Then a marriage organizationer, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay that he had opened the eyes on a parallel budget and feed his cash with money.
Following these revealations, Mr. Tremblay released the beginning of November by Montreal in a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal's first elections to throw the alarm sonnette.
In the area of Rivière-des-Pries, east of the island, it is ensuring since 2010 against the sale of a municipal landscape bought $5 million and returned... $1,6 million to promoters, in full real booms.
70% money sold in electoral campaigns
The investigation that will finally be implemented, said that it "stake on a board to understand the operation of the system, infilled by furmis, to stop the gangrene and enforce the faults".
The process, she said, is "doubt but positive."
We are now cleaning the plague but it would need a single investigation unit in Montreal and a guard, to not see the doubtful practices.
Like we're doing the fucking thing.
Regularly.
James Duchesneau notes its side that "The officials flighted hundreds of millions of dollars", but especially worried about the role of "Elu at the moment of the Strategian" when they were not trembled in the magic!
When 70 per cent of money was sold in the financing of the electoral campaigns in Quebec, he is ironized: "We told me that it was only a reflex of reality."
The Government of Chebekos proposes to limit the donations to the parties, but it will not change the woman, according to it: "Over the electoral expenditure will be limited, there will be money sold in politics."
He prepares a complete review of the system of public contracts and financing contracts: "We can't go down; go to the foundation of things, with strongness, will restore the house on more solid basiss, with more controls and laws."
If this story shoots the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who are not going to look in their own court...
"The PSG is not FC Barcelone!"
This season, you've taken a new survey with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by individual awareness, but also by the new size of the PSG.
The big players came.
Every day I'm progressing on them.
The technical staff has also brought me much.
At daily, these elements can steal my level of game.
And, in match, it's easier.
Everything's going very fast at the feet.
But I don't burn.
From my beginning to the INF Clairefottaine preparation centre to my past to Saint-Etain, I've always developed by pallets.
So you will benefit from competition installed by Carlo Anceltti...
The records of this age are used to contain high-level matches.
They also know that each training is crucial.
What does a player like me wants to make face and provide the maximum.
Furthermore, Carlo Anceltti supports me much about my position.
He's disappeared by adjoints like Claudi Makelele, who played at the same post as me.
Anceldito is the man of the situation?
Sure.
Anceltti inspires respect for all technicians.
Today, there is no equity in Ligue 1 and is part of the best European professionals.
He has a great experience and has gained many titles with hot clubs.
He cooked great players.
I think he'll get some other titles to Paris.
In January, I had a comfortable debate with him.
I went out of a series of wounds.
The confidence that he agrees to me also explain my performance.
What look are you looking at the first part of the PSG station?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the leader's place.
But we're still in embussing.
One of our major objectives is the Champion Ligue: we are qualified for the 8 ends.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We're gonna try to go as far as possible.
Tomorrow, everything can happen.
But we will have our word to say to the very good European teams.
We first want to end the first of our pool, before Porto, to be able to get the 8th back at the 8th.
Can the PSG become a short-term European club?
It's already the budget...
In order to become a large European club, Paris needs to take tits and record in the period.
Today, that's not the case.
Financely, the PSG provides the means to achieve this project.
In Ligue 1, do not get the title, like the last season, would it be a big gun?
Of course, this would represent a huge deception.
This year, we really have a heart to impress this type of champion.
The last season, we're not far away.
In May, there was a deception because we had the qualitys to end first.
We've made a very big season.
We're finished with 79 points.
Usually, with 79 points, we're supposed to be a campaign...
But another team, Montpellier, has performed a more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's good.
Even though the large teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are to fight for the title, I think we have the arms to bring it.
Are you sure the media are waiting too much from the PSG?
It's normal that we are waiting for a lot of what we have been invested and players.
It is completely accepted.
After that, when we gain 4-0 home to Troyes and find things to reprove us, it's sure that it's a little disappointing.
We're asking what people are waiting for more.
We can never win 4-0 all weekends.
We're not the FC Barcelone!
We're trying to put up a game project.
A team built with time.
We have tried in Ligue of the campsites that we could answer here.
Look at Manchester City which hasn't arrived since two seasons to qualify for the 8 final, they also have made huge expenditures!
Watching the inversions, you were imagined with 15 points of advance to the dry!
It was negative to our adversary and the campsite of France.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not well the last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is passionant.
I hope that at the month of May, we could have the dream to say that, despite all the difficulties, we have ended to get it.
The PSG seems totally dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic operators.
How better we say there's a "Zlatan dependence".
This means that Ibrahimovic is very perfect and he puts a lot of goals.
He came for this, and he proves that he's the star of the Ligue 1.
He demonstrated wherever he passed that he was a great player, a world star.
In the group, the man and the player are respected.
He also respects the men he's around him.
What he did is really extraordinary.
This allows the others to steal their level of game.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you live Euro 2012 with France's team?
Like a deception.
I had a heart to participate in that euro.
Unfortunately, my wound has prevented me to split the game time.
I've seen things out there, and I've been strengthened.
Today, I'm able to make good matches in selection.
That's what I hoped since my baptism with the Bleus.
The lessons of what happened in Ukraine have been taught, and today we must have an example of behaviour.
What look are you looking at the first months of Didiar Descarps at the Bleus head?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualified group for the World.
The elector is ridiculous, near the players, and inspires the winner.
Like the Laurent White.
But I don't want to compare.
White has reached its objective by our qualification for the euro.
I hope Didiar Deshamps will lead Bleus to Brazil.
Is the good no (1-1) race, on 16 October, in Spain, a founder match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone was fighting for everybody.
Before this shock in Spain, I never had been playing like this in my card.
With Bitcoin, pay and sale without banks
Any contrast to current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and treatment costs between stakeholders.
Furthermore, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the conviction that the current monetary system makes banking monopols lead to financial crisis.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (pseudonyme), is at times a virtual currency (in dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files to pair.
Around 200,000 transactions have already been registered through 15,000 computers on the network.
A little thousand of websites accept bitcoins like donations or as a means of payment.
The Bitcoin course, after reaching a sum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, was lowered to $2,5 months later, before returning today about $10 million (the courses are estimated on the Bitcoincharts.com site).
No very impressive, compared to the global exchange in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has been interested in a report on virtual currency published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as " virtual currency with the most successful", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "samilate to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin distinguishes other virtual currency types such as the "credits" used to progress in a video game that you can gain or buy it (and sometimes exchange back).
The Facebook Social Network has also developed this type of system.
But every time, a central authority is controlled and treats exchange.
With Bitcoin, all the network novels are at the time expositive of the account book, checkers, currency emisors, and buyers and vendors.
How does this network function?
Each transaction between two users is actually made between two electronic addresses in the way of an e-mail.
Unless a user can choose a different address for each payment, as well as an anonym.
A set of information related to this transaction is electronicly signed by a double key encryption system.
The network can thus verify transaction authenticity.
Thanks to the contents of the file, it is possible to ensure that the expensed bitcoins exist in the public account book distributed throughout the network.
The clothing step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It will be the privilege of adding this additional line through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched to the computers, and the winner, a preliminary central banker.
This is a file-shake phase, that's the transformation of a larger file to a shorter and unique digital printing.
The computers take the new transaction and add to him a number before we're doing it all.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular printing (beaucoup of weirs at the beginning).
Once that number was found, the other noods actually checked that it's good.
The transaction is then instructively linked to the chain of the whole other transactions; any change would change the end.
If, for fraude, a user wanted to pay twice with the same very fast money (more than ten minutes), one of the two transactions would be valid by the network - the other remaining orpheline because the two have different empires.
The computer has solved the 50 bitcoin challenge.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in movement is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divided to a hundred million, which leaves the marge...
The challenge difficulty is also addressed to each increase in calculation power.
The life of the network has already been high and lower.
Web sites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and flood bitcoins.
"The fatal used does not relate to the protocol itself," said Peter Noizat, who comes from launching Phoutum, a real currency payment company using the Bitcoin Network.
The ECB also states the possibilities of money cleaning through this anonymous service.
But the cash also has this standard.
Weight actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this nature.
Others, like WordPress blogs platform, accept them.
Reception, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the account book and showed that about 80 per cent of bitcoins are not circulated.
In November, the "geneous solids" were launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been earned," Johnn Holmquist rejoiced, working for Coinabul, which becomes bitcoins in gold.
Peter Noizat, also author of a pedagogic book on this currency, believes much in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system, Paytuania, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a mobile payment without contact, but he uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions that become so slow.
The portrait is more than its identity and may therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement goods, which do not need to install new complete or software.
It is enough to communicate a telephone that can "fotograph and recognize", specifics Peter Noizat, which provides thousands of users.
There is a general redistribution movement due to hydrochrical systems for more horizontal systems.
"It will need time to impose Bitcoin, but 2013 could be a tournament," said he.
The ECB, in its report, also provides the revaluation of different risks today regarded as high, in case of success of this currency.
We're gone from Afghanistan.
And then?
The French troops left their responsibilities in Afganistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
Otan and Americans should follow end 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army returns her ownership and that the Afghan shall choose their future, without any expectation of us.
These are especially the Afghan countries we have punished by considering them as terrorists.
And we, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the slaughters, the mournings.
Taliban is composed of foreign extremes, former refugee leaders in Pakistan, but often of countries that refuse foreign military presence, such as the Soviet time.
They want to defend their traditions, old and archaetics, even if they were joined by jihadists, Pakistan, Arabs, Uzbeks, Tadjiks.
Tolerate, sometimes helped by local insurrections, these will not be more when the Wests will become more discreet.
The start of the French troops from the Nijrab Base, which I observed from the high colleagues planted by ananders through French credits, was done in the order.
The convergence of camions and blinds joined Kaboul without being attacked, overwhelmed by helicopters.
There will be no deployment of Taliban on Kaboul since the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irregular progress between 1994 and 1996.
Kaboul was then empty, fire country and blood because of fighting between different factors.
Their country's control was then pursued as a kind of release, a return to security.
Afghan has paid the price of the obscurity of those countries override by the Al Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved today.
Old Moudjahidin, Afghan and current Taliban governments join the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notes of the anti-sovic war are returned to the power in 2001.
They were moved to businessists, from government lands to restore them in territory to build refugees from Iran and Pakistan, which benefits of "normous American sub-traditional contracts".
They have decided; most of them haven't fighted themselves.
People, as I heard it in the campaigns, seek to a government that is not a flower.
Many young people want to leave, as those who have benefited from the United States: the capital flight is significant.
Young people are disappeared from war and his ideaology.
They co-counted the modern world in their exhibitions in Iran or Pakistan, and appreciated the benefits.
Over 65 per cent of the population is less than 25 years; Kaboul is now 5 million inhabitants, a fifth population.
In the cities, government schools are full, girls like boys.
It is necessary to provide work to young people who will not want to return to the obscurism of the former parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
All, including armed opposers, are flowers of portable telephones; television, and its turc sheets that present a modern world, are followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities go to the commander be considered as lawful?
Old commanders of Antisovic fight are already concerned about restoring provincial billions, which will escape from the central power.
The Afganist, mountain countries, local identities, should be able to benefit from a certain decentralization in the image of the Western nations, but the United States wished to transform it into a centralized State, a strong presidential power, to remove the Minister's position from the Constitution of 1964.
The President of Karzai does not want foreign controls, particularly at the opportunity of elections planned in April 2014.
But its country is, since the 50s and premature years, depending on foreign aid.
No industry has been transferred on road, no barrier is available, no important irrigation system has been recruited.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced, except fruits and legumes.
The priority is left to the private initiative.
In a 30-year-old country, government infrastructure control was required.
The voice was spread that Afghanistan had minor rich immigration.
This did only add to the feeling that the Wests were there only to get it.
Without energy to treat iron or cut minel on the place, or means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no minimum operation.
The Chinese has already left the mine from my Aynak, laying international archeologists (fined by the World Bank) to blow the buddical site and remain the most important employees in the province.
Another day, as Afghanistan and Pakistan, which widely depends on imports and exports, will be retained to normal reports.
The start of French fighting troops ended on 20 November.
The new Cooperation Treaty provides for continued traditional assistance: girls, boys, French department at the University, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for archeological Delegation.
Since 2009, to try to "gain the hearts and the spirits" and to achieve the unable task of cooperating aid and offensive actions, a "civil-military actions" of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), removed in 2012, and conducted well by a small French NGO, many collective interests and agricultural rehabilitation actions in ten mountain villages.
Those working gourmands were able to help contain insurrection: irrigation, powder, potable water, rebounding, fruit trees, land protection and increased culturel surfaces.
What will we have to remember, after two billion euros of military expenditure?
A more modest budget would contribute to improving local life conditions, very hard in these valleys often at more than 2.000 meters of altitude.
The Ambassade received ten written requests from small agricultural achievements from local communities from the province of Capisa.
In order to free from the insurrection carried out by foreign groups, what the farmers said to me to wish, it should be necessary to maintain a small civil aid for them, well controlled and directly touching them.
A Constitution on the Force in Egypt
It's a new poker puker of President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains divised more than ever around the constitutional declaration, which is provisionally granted to him the full powers, he decided to play all his vacuum.
Taking everybody short, he announced, Friday, that the Assembly would vote its final text on the next day.
It was just a week ago, the head of the State had granted two additional months to this Assembly to end its work.
That's about two years that Egypt is supported on a provisional text, several times amended by institutional stability and leading to legal complaints.
This new initiative has only increased fracture in the country.
For its opposers, the President continues in its "authcratic Deliver" and continues to "translate his word" and "paid the right."
On the side of its parties, it is ensured that it is a way to end faster with the institutional and political crisis, accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be organized within 15 days.
A very short time lap that the Frères are obliged to refuse their project to explain the text by article, to the Egyptians.
For the Chairman, it is also a way to find a popular and democratic legitimacy while the condemnation is damaged throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will vote well, as he stated it in an interview to the American Time edition.
As this appeal to a depressed vote is the last of the Egyptian people: "I am voted for my text, or I keep the full powers," those before the suppose to end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange ambitious that 85 members of this Assembly representing the text yesterday, with great islamic majority.
Most of the officers lacked the call.
Monday, a little before the constitutional declaration, they closed the door, supposing that they couldn't be able to deal with their views.
The representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary access, 11 persons, replaced members have been added to the hot tomorrow.
Some are very close to Muslim Frères.
Without surprise, it is most often the oneanimation that the articles have been voted.
Any comments were delighted that one of the divergence of the day has been expressed around the time of prayer, some members of the Committee believe that the penalty of the representative was badly regulated.
The text, which was still being "which voted, contains 234 articles.
Objects of all attention, article 2 remains finally identical to the Constitution of 1971, stipulating that "the principles of the chario are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for which the "isolation of Islamic Law is a major refund, hoped to replace "the principles" by "norms", which would allow a closer application.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is a gentle of their good will and respect of the other components of the Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy" answers the officers, which only see a bit of communication.
Because according to them, the islamization of the Constitution has been made through other articles.
They are in particular article 220, which confises the Al-Azhar University a consultative role, particularly in order to verify the compliance of laws with the charia.
According to the Egyptian Sophie Pommier specialist, it is concerned that "the people called to proclaim are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the prematures of a theocracy."
Furthermore, the fears of the liberal are affected by the fact that the next receptor of this university should be much less moderate than the current.
"To the time there is no concrete religious implication.
With this Constitution, we remain in the framework of the Civil State.
Most of the jurisdictes who work on this text are not the olémams but universities, for some formed in the French system" tempran Alexis Bluet, which prepares a thès on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But it recognises that there may be ambiguity around article 220, because the terms of employees imposed into religious vocabulary.
It is referred to the "fiqh" in particular [islamic jurisdiction, ndlr].
And the question might be in the future to know what way the civil judges are responsible for being made above."
In addition to its religious aspect, the text of vote here is very criticised because of the extended powers it granted to the President of the Republic.
Muslim Fristers say that these are relatively reduced in comparison with what they were under the former regime.
Another licensing point: the powers granted to the army.
In accordance with the wish of military, the review of the Defence budget will not be submitted to the Parliament but to a national Defence Council.
In addition to the proceedings of civilians in military courts, as requested human rights associations.
These are also part of their concerns about the text, which they judge liberty.
The crime of blasphème is kept and the insulin is now prohibited, which might have serious consequences on the freedom of expression, including press.
Furthermore, no article has been encouraging women ' s protection, Heba Morayef, human rights Watch.
According to it, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by article 36.
The word was not contained in the previous Constitution.
While the President of Egypt had to express himself last night at television, manifestations are planned for this afternoon.
The support of the Chief of the State will challenge them on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the Centre of the world and a sea of salvation waits for Ukrainian tourists
The Terre promise gathers the size of Bible truths, modern comfort and wild nature.

A ship can lead you from the mountain feet.
Ski tracks are around 45 km long.
Ancient believers want that the gods of the nations have lived jadis on the top of the mountain.
Visit the only museum
This country is opening about 300 museums.
You can't visit them all during one stay.
Here are the five the most interesting ones who really depart from it.
First of all, the Israeli Museum is located near Knesset (Parliament).

A superreal beauty.
There is a process of salt water treatment, limon, healthy bottles and to demonstrate different diseases such as denmatite, allergies, asthme, eczeem, arthrite, bronchites, diabetes, but also for quite simply spread.
Discover the secrets of the Antiquity
They are kept by the old city of Tel-Aviv, Jaffa, on the side of the Mediterranean Sea.
It is passed through the famous Via Maris, which retreats Egypt, Syria, Anatoly and Mexico.
The city is mentioned in the Greek and Egyptian laws of the Antiquity.
According to the legend, it is that Noah built his arch and that Persian saved the beautiful Andromede, with which he lives here a long and happy life.

Under the Roman Empire, Césarée was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman procurers, including Ponce Pilate.
The renovated theatre is today used for dinner concerts and operating spectrums.
Comments to tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your journey, it is better to improve the euro dollars, because they are easily exchanged in cellars (an today 1 equipped to $3.8 sheets).
For the city transport, these are mainly bus, but Jerusalem is equipped with a speed tramway and Haifa is the only metro line of the country, consisting of six stations and capable of overlapping the low and upper parts of the city.
It's almost a subterraine funiculary.
The trajet in all types of common transport costs 6 sheets and allows you to make changes during 1:30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath.
Since Friday at the summer bed on Saturday, markets, shops and public transports stop their activity.
And the week of work begins tomorrow.
Many coffee, restaurants and hotels serve only from casher food, which excludes the porc, the sea fruits, the fish without wheat and the plates consisting of milk and meat.
There is a multitude of plates based on an agglomy and bulls, soups and disserts based on coco lake but also the housing, traditional Jewish past, different sacks, the bottles of mould weights, the falafels, fruits and legumes.
There are no dogs in the streets of Israel's cities.
On the other hand, there are many good nourris chats that promise the high air.
You can see them at night sleeping on the thresholds of cars.
These festivals love passenger places and they refuse only to give them.
The location of a car varies from the mark of $37 for 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Business costs $15 per day.
Lower a glass will cost you 15 shekels on the day.
A entrance to the museum costs average 30 shekels.
The language of the figures
Three million tourists around the world have visited Israel in 2012.
It was especially people coming to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
1118.8 thousands of Ukrainian tourists arrived in Terre Promised from January to October 2012, or 51 per cent of more than in 2010 before the cancellation of visas on 9 February 2011.
"What language is going to Moscow," migrants economic money to learn the language
While deputys and military human rights deployed what the law on the obligatory language testing, the certificates have already made their appearance in the country
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, Saint-Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, these are Central Asian citizens: Uzbekistan, Taiwan and Turkmenistan.
Their only purpose is to win money to help their families stayed at home.
Since 1 December, a law is entered into force and stipulates that every migrant employer must take place in Russian review.
For the present, this rule is only those who intend to work in the services, housing, private services and detailed sales sectors.
However, with time, the Federal Migration Service promised, the tests will become obligatory for all immigrants.
Furthermore, it should be valid to the knowledge of the language, but also to the history of Russians and law foundations.
It is necessary to validate its Russian language knowledge to get and renew its work permit.
It is only the citizens of the countries where Russia has official language status.
Persons obtaining certificates or diplomas before the crime of the URSS in 1991 are no longer concerned by this law.
Welfare, negative attitude and protection of rights
The system of the review centres will be under the egide of the Russian Institute of Pouchkine, the University of the Amitiate of Peoples, the University of Moscow, the University of State of Saint-Petersburg and other higher education institutions of Russia.
The immigrants may have reviews in all cities of the country: more than 160 centres have already been opened throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce reviews was supported by Members of the State Dome and the Federal Migration Service.
But, before the law enters into force, human rights defenders have already put the question in the press: what is going to give?
What is the obligation to know the Russian will change for Russians and immigrants?
First of all, representatives of the migratory service will help to reduce the number of persons suffering "of the slave at work."
Many speak of the defence of the rights of migrant workers, explains the Office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of the rights must be started before their exit.
Only an organizational selection system will allow 90% to solve foreign workers' problems.
There are problems for non-profit migrants, without training, those who do not know the language and who do not have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, certifie Sebelev, the future migrant is intended to believe malicious people who will provide him a "send" in a surpepped house where he and ten of his similars will be tourned for months without food and without paper and must be trained between 12 and 14 hours per day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"Take them, they are promised, and when they arrive, they are lifted, and they do not touch the planned salary," confirms the Chief of the Migration Services Director for Tadjikistan Migration Services, Tolib Charipov.
Don't dispute me, sir, the policeer!
However, many representatives of the Central Asian Republics who wish to win money in Russia trust that they are not only aware of the country's language where they want to make it, but also that they write with difficulty in their own language.
This is of course not their fault, but their badness: few Turkmenes, Ouzbeks, Tadjiks can be able to follow themselves as it would only be a passable primary education.
In fact, their families are not even what to eat their children without talking about them correctly and teaching them for school.
Since they arrive to adolescent, these young people are starting to gain money since the opportunity is present.
It's difficult when we don't know the language, they trust.
"You feel declined and amidried."
However, human rights defenders notes an important aspect of the Language Act.
Reviews will be designed only to migrants who have a legal status.
Without status, there will be no examination or official work later.
However, most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
"Good or defence of entering"
Many immigrants explain that it is not so easy to obtain a official status in Russia.
The reason? Administrative barrières and always these language difficulties.
Furthermore, the legalization costs for money: between 12 and 16 thousands of roads.
And then, we can get a false record for only 1 500 wheels.
Russian police officers know that we have false documents, that we have no registration, from where the cases of extorsion.
"They ask us 100, 200 wheels, about what to buy cigarettes, the te," he trusted the journalists of Oumed Khouchkadamov, Tadjikistan.
"Take fast, don't lie and buy a beautiful art work"
From the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was discovered that the registration of migrants was not only false.
Several false language review certificates have already been confiscated by the employees of the Federal Migration Service.
False papers are of a regular colour printer.
Of course, their new owners did not hurt them for nothing: every migrant who hoped to facilitate the task of reviews had to be deployed seven thousand red for this document.
It's two times and half more than the official procedure: this will cost the worker of three thousand roads.
Representatives of the power and defenders of human rights agree that the short term goal is to protect the system against corruption so that it may be impossible to buy these "papers".
The authorities may give migrant workers who could not validate the first time to follow language courses.
Furthermore, immigrants who do not know the Russia will be proposed to work in areas which do not imply to communicate actively with people.
The Ministry of the Interior is not concerned in the arms market
The part of legal offences is very low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes that the law against civil weapons should be sustained.
This is the reaction of the authorities against recent incidents: that it is a marriage or murderer organized by the Moscow jurisdiction Dmitry Vinogradov, which had done seven dead.
The police wants to prohibite the port of guns to caoutchouc in public places and to reduce the legal age of obtaining arms allowance from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the Chief of the Douman Committee for Security and Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, which promised that the amendments to the Arms Law would be introduced to the Douman of State in the next time.
Everybody is not satisfied to see that Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "creating visa".
A open letter is appeared on the Net where his authors, representatives of various tour centres, require to leave "the insensed duration".
The percentage of crimes committed with a registered arms is minime, stated at the Russian Service Vasiliy Lesnikov, jurisdictionist and specialist of Crime for BBC.
According to the Interior statistics, for a period of six months in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with an immatriculated fire weapons in police services while 1,168,000 crimes were registered during the same period.
The open letter authors are some that the strengthening of civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals to approve the black market.
According to them, today we can find any weapon for a reasonable price in Moscow.
However, the Ministry of the Interior states that it is monitoring the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Prosecutors: use of the office
The black weapon market provides several channels.
The main channels are five, tell Victor Baranets, Colonel for the pension served for ten years to the Ministry of Education and to the General Quartier.
Screen capture from a site taking weapons Commands
The first is the military trace, i.e. the arms who have been flighted during military operations in the Caucase.
"They arms were flown by Russian officers, but also by the Caucasians", explains Baranets.
The second type of black market weapons are those of the crimes to the forces of the order.
Baranets explains that it is so much weapons flowed in the police stocks as well as those derogated directly to the representatives of the forces of the order.
Illegal weapons go to sale since military interfaces.
Many of these are often explosives.
"The tested versions indicate that some fires have been deceived to dissume the deficit," explains the former military.
For Baranets, weapon manufacturers are there for something.
"You see private weapons uses that do not revalue the competition on the international market and make the weapons on the black market, particularly in Moscow," says a expert.
One of the other black market sources is the contraband.
An important part of weapons and mixtures comes from poor countries, such as Kirghiz.
"We find a local production, sometimes artisanal, a mafia formed and organized approvision," adds the old military.
Where's the arms coming?
Experts evaluated the approximative part of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
In 2011, a report on the issue was formed by the Public Administration Centre for Analysis and Study.
Specialists analyzed the reports of the Department of Interior and Rosstat, criminal dossiers and public data on weapons.
The great majority of illegal weapons, explaining researchers, come from the army and order forces.
The half of the arms presented on the black market was found " by the offence of employees related to the arms", explains in the report.
According to researchers, 17% of the arms come from military conflict places, 14% are flighted during the manufacture and 5% are "Clandest flowers".
A solder and consulter of a armor requested to keep the anonym to ensure that no person has been buying the weapons found by these specialists of the Clandest flag; they are too old.
The most often, according to him, vendors will find new goods in military interfaces.
The person purchased by a teacher is a unit, for example a TT weapons.
It's telling her by pasting the goods by a grill.
"It's the town transport and returns for 900 € by the unit with two chargers," says he.
"It is true that the police is on the basis of all cases, as well as when crimes are on the point of being elected, it makes a control purchase at the illegal weapon goods," adds the vendor.
"It's like in a luxury bottle."
The seller and the buyer are generally found by the skills of knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a type is manifested and suggested me to come to Begovaya's race where someone had to take me into a "coin" to drive.
The gun's price, it's given me on place.
Victor Baranets in military observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the vendor.
There are sales on the markets, but there are also needs to come to say, for example, "On the part of this person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter has lost a depth."
Now I'm even buying a couple of American poings for a person to whom I trust.
He only gives me them to me because he knew I won't give it.
Small news are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Baranets tried as a buyer of illegal weapons in the middle of 1990 when he was prepared to publish a article on the subject.
The schemes, according to him, have not changed.
We gave him a photo album there was "all what we want."
"I believed in a luxury bottle," remembers the military.
There is no secret for the buyer, explain Baranets, we can try everything.
As a potential client, I don't appreciate to buy, we're going with the forest vendor and a target is installed.
"On let me throw, and when I am convinced that weapon walks well, we're starting to negotiate," describe the expert.
A bottle since his canace
Search engines show websites and groups on VContact where you can buy weapons "for different uses".
There is no need for any document or for any person to meet.
"It's enough to have a precise amount of money," it is written in publicity on the site "To buy a weapon or a battle mixture."
Users and leave their request and ask their questions.
And we're sold to the younger?
"You are allowed, of course," the Ivan user requests (host orthography).
"Book TT. Moscow," says "Fedorenkov" in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has distributed a large network of false sites and has increased the desired persons to buy fighting weapons.
People rose on food as bottled loups and then they found to operate carbon in Siberia
Victor Baranets, observer and old military
I heard about this type of schemas: usually, the site is registered out of the Russian law field.
People take the orders.
The buyer carrys out the payment for automatic reimbursements.
"They receives a photo and instructions where the arms are hidden", explains the secretariat of the Association "Document to a gun", Dmitry Kislov.
Victor Baranets claims that if you request on the site, you can be found without weapon and behind the bars.
The Federal Security Service has distributed a large network of false sites and has increased the desired persons to buy fighting weapons.
"The people fall on food like abused loups and then they found to operate a carbon in Siberia," said he.
A Makarov for $100
The purchase of a illegal firearm, mostly experts, can cost $100 to 900.
According to Dmitry Kislov, the "Treat to a Army" association can buy a Makarov weapon for $100-300.
He needs to wait about a month and a half.
It has expired long-terms by the direction of these average interfaces.
According to the official data of the Ministry, in addition to the period January-October 2011, the number of these crimes have decreased in Russia from 7 per cent and was 22.9.000 while the cases attracted from flights and extortion of weapons, munitions, explosive substances and bombs declined from 7.8 per cent.
United States: fast-food employees and supermarket employees
Nearly one quarter of the American adolescents matches a chaiser work at McDonald's
The last days, a protest vague is mounted against the lower salary operated by the Walmart supermarks and the famous fast restoration chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the time, nobody can predict if this vague will take from the length or smooth fast.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of left associations.
In addition to the increase of modest wages that have overcome basic employees in Walmart and in fast restoration chains, the manifestation organizations wish to obtain the creation of syndicates.
This sector is not now covered by syndical movement.
46 cents per year?
The manifestations started the last week after Thanksgiving, the "New Vendedi" at the time when a delighting race of money was evaporated by millions of inhabitants in America and sometimes deploying slaves.
This day, some employees of the Walmart Society, working in the world 2,2 million people, left their position to organize green plates with syndicates and left-activists in the stores of society whose products are intended to consumers of modest and average classs.
Walmart commercialises everything: swimming beds on the flights through car batterys, aircrafts, eggs and milk.
Products are average 8% to 27% lower than in large overmarked.
That's why many bad employees in Walmart are only their courses on their workplace.
The price and selection of products made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to the criteria, Walmart may be allowed to sell its good market, in particular because of the lower salary of its employees.
These are also difficult working conditions, for example, lack of portrait carriers or scanners.
The participants of the "New Venredi" manifestations requested an increase in salary, complained on the fact that the price of medical insurance provided by the company had increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
For Walmart's basic loan that touches $9,5 from the hour, it's a sum that it can't be allowed.
Californian university scientists show that if Walmart increased average $12, this would cost $3,2 billion.
It's 1,1% more than it's now expensive.
If Walmart transflowed the whole wages of consumer salary, each course in the store would return to 46 cents more.
They will pay $12,39 more than now.
Walmart Party notes with pleasure that protests have occurred in only nine States and have no prejudice to the group.
The "Wendredi black" continued in the 8th evening shops and Walmart sold for this 5000 articles in the second period.
His chains were made in all 100 million transactions for the "New Vendedi".
The Dan Fogleman's company's Port-Party Carrier was entrusted in an interview on the left site of Huffington After all the "Five" employed in Walmart had left their posts and the protest was only a "com" operation between the others.
"Next client!"
The protests continued this week in New York and were not more concerning the Walmart shops (with this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, so they are not yet planted) but the McDonald's and other good market restaurants.
McDonald's announce to sell milliards of portions and after they don't even give you with sickness and don't drink the work you have done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the Military Council of New York
Currently, the minimum salary provided by federal law and New York is $7.25 from the time.
The fast-foods increase them with time, but in average, their basic employees touched in New York $8.90 from the time.
Nobody touchs less than they in this city.
I'm not able to live with this soup in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American adolescents worked at McDonald's after the lycée lived in their parents.
Many people saw their main income source or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today, I'm finding interviewing McDonald's employees who have to have to live with this salary and sometimes have to eat their children with.
Otherwise, on the Wall Street Journal's Forum there are comments saying that it is unfair to make children if you don't know with what you're going to eat them.
The demonstrators who launched the Thursday at 6:30 next to McDonald's 40th street and on Madison Avenue required that the fast-food carriers and kitchens should be paid at least 15 dollars of the hour, or more than two times than current minimum salary.
They also asked for the creation of unions in the fast restoration sector.
The U.S. Act prohibites the administration to oblig and punish the protestants of a syndicate by brimades or licenses.
However, the administration simplifys their lives rarely.
For a syndicat, the rapid restoration remains a difficult task, and this is, for concrete reasons.
One of the main is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They do not agree
Other warming manifestations were close to several of other fast restoration chains.
The moment of the protestation was the middle of the middle of the McDonald's Times Square, with the intervention of several local democratic policies, including the member of Jumaane Williams, the municipal Council, who said: "McDonald's advertising thousands of portions and after they don't even give you a disease and you don't drink the work you have done honestly!".
The demonstrators have been supported by other new-Qyor Democrats in view, including by the candidate at the Major Main Mai Bill De Blasio, who stated that "We must all support fast restoration employees to obtain a fairly and economic well-being that each New York is merited.
New York Times characterized this manifestation as the most important that had known the fast restoration sector in all its history.
But only a few hundreds of people participated there without account that all were not fast-food employees, which work tens of thousands of people in New York.
It's now difficult to say whether this mass movement skill will make smalls.
"To the time, we're only going to middle to touch the brain"
Lastly, fans of new technologies have been used to perceive the reality increased through special lunchs.
At the beginning, it was Google who made its current model at its annual conference and in November was learned that Microsoft had made the request of the patent.
However, it is the maintenance with the director of the 3D interactive technological technological group of Microsoft de Cambridge, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this society, the lunettes are already the former history.
They are trying to manage virtual objects in cloud hands through the creation of open virtual spaces.
- Can you tell us what your search group does?
- We work on the interaction between man and the machine and we are at the same time trying to expand the borders of this interaction.
Humanity in its entireness is remained at the moment in the plat screen pixels and sometimes at the tail.
We want to look at 5 to 10 years before us and to become the radical changes that will happen to this interaction.
For example, the Xbox Console and the Kinect captains are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold without Kinect today because everyone cares about the command by the manager.
- What do we reserve the future?
- Although Kinect has made the physical interaction, many things are throwing on plat screen, sometimes on 3D.
The input of the information was improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for now, does not really.
We're trying to change this and we're working on 3D image systems working on various technologies, including projecting technologies.
We need to get out the world of information in our physical world, to make it more tolerable.
However, it is necessary to identify not only the user but also the space around it.
So we can complement the real world by virtual objects in a more practical form.
And to start, let's get away from these stupid cases of virtual reality!
- What do you think of the voice command?
She's appreciated, but isn't she surprised?
It cannot be the Panacate: the question of confidentiality is, because we are not always desire to inform others of its actions or intentions.
In fact, each type of interaction with the computer is good, but everyone in his neck.
For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we're thinking about wheats, not wide gaps, but rather for discreet, limited.
The samples were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a bracelet brought to the hand that would register bone movements and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theologically possible to reduce it to the size of a show.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: man + voice.
- What do you mean?
- For example, how would you ask me to pass this cantine?
You would do it with the word and the shoes.
- Usually, I'm just talking.
- Oh, it'll be difficult to recognize.
- So you want to force users to adapt what the machine can or not do at a given time?
- Not obligation, but it is a mutual approach.
I think soon we should work in the development of new types of captures that will enable us to identify better human reactions.
For example, capsulars can arise, they produce a very good resolution in deep, and it is very important.
- If we're interested in your work on the Xbox Kinect captains, what do you like in modern cameras?
Are they missing resolutions, deeps or something else?
- In principle, it is on the current generation that we are based on our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be well to get approximately 8 megapixels with a 1000 c/s speed.
But the problem is not the megapixals themselves, but the quality of master and deepness.
With regard to this last point, all current technologies are well enough, and this meets the conceptors of alcohol.
The resolution should be kept in mind in accordance with the X and Y points, but also Z.
The speed also includes much, the number of frames to the second.
Human movements are sufficiently dynamic, and the 30 c/s are not really enough, especially for seeds.
Steven Bathik, of our Redmond Laboratory, has given the touch of captors a regular delay of treatment between 1 and 100 μs, current captors are more close to the second value (60-100).
Everyone does not understand what this affects man and machine interaction.
I would need a device of this kind in my work, but don't need to touch, to have more frames at the second.
- But don't you have to increase the number of cameras?
- The Kinect is today three "cameras" whose one is actually a infrared emittentor and the second, a receptor of the figure.
And the third camera is actually a usual captor of the visible field.
It is not to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras could solve this problem...
Or perform it by increase the required volume of calculations.
It would be interested to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, play with the camera core and see how it could help to define locations.
- While I remember, Microsoft, on the difference of Google, didn't present his lunchs to the public.
Do you not think that in a view of the daily use of reality technologies, the lunettes are one of the most prospects platforms?
- Of course, it's not practical, but that's what I think: the best option would be an increased "transitory" reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass mounts to the smartphone.
The lunets are a very personal device and that is what they do (personal elements are those you are the only to see) and at the same time their weakness: the reality increased from moons will not allow you to work on virtual objects in cooperation with other people.
- Imagine a moment that the manipulation of virtual holography objects in the air is more accessible than to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple death.
There is a problem on which the opposers to this idea point the finger: there is no tactical sensation!
The hands don't feel anything!
What answers are your group prepared in relation to this challenge?
- In my course, I'm often saying that the increased reality is the seventh fall in interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth might be very well added to tactical senses.
For the time, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve image support.
She fully records pressure!
But there are also technologies that are actually intended to assigne Palestinibility to these "images in the air": for example, the interference of several ultrasons directed to a precise point where the finger is found and that gives you the sensation, for the moment yet low, of a air suspicious on the sides of the fingers.
There are also bracelets mixed on fingers that affect the nervous ends of the fingers, they are also a work assumption with perspectives.
- And you tried to touch the brain?
He'll believe he feels what he's normally feeling when he sees something?
- That's a good idea, we've not yet tried.
There is still a job below which it will needs to give worry: the way to believe someone who is physically located in a very red space that he walks in a nearly infine open space - we work on the concepts of the course tastes (will see with those found in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also gender bulbs.
For the moment, only averagely to touch the brain, it remains many years of work.
This is what makes work on virtual reality so interesting for the searcher: Many things are still at the absolute state of fecondation.
The Kingdom of the Goost and not of the culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continued the "Avant-garde pétersbourg" designed to citadins that are advanced, at the front of culture and art.
This ultra-Selective list has already been acquired by artists of the artistic scene of Saint-Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the border of the town and which have found a recognition in Europe after they have been known throughout Russia.
The new heroes of "Rosbalt" is the extracted Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, this man rather barbu, all red clothes that we can grow near the Russian Museum, the Jardin of summer or even in the branched feasts and vernissages.
Kirill Miller's tables are always gathering the peoples, anywhere about their exhibition.
It is one of the Pytersbourg coasts, social and philosophy, one of the founders of the new mythes.
Kirill Miller is an eminent representative of the Pytersbourg Award of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, his appearance makes the inhabitants sore and puts them a good humor.
He recently took a Barbarie orange and became the symbol of this instrument in Saint-Petersburg because he had enough painted for this difficult role of his existence, his philosophy and his image of bohémien.
- Kirill, why are you through the city in red and not in yellow or blue, for example?
- I've chosen the red as a specialized quarter in the appearance and image.
In this world the red is a compromise between the peintre, the creator of image and society.
Even though in society, everything that is not green highlights aggression and negative aggression.
But my provocations are aimed at reaching the debate.
All the story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the debate.
- And when did you understand you'd have to be peining?
- At the exhibition of the Palais of the Nevskiy culture where my work were found.
I understood that it was my way.
Then, the vague of the unofficial elders was passed, and the news, free, in my kind, were uncomfortable.
I began to link me of friendship with the new vague penins, with those of the Postgazonvchtchina who born "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no vague.
I'm interested in the theatre, mode, music, all kinds except words.
And all this was found in your artistic clinic... and it was important for me to find me in the center of Saint Pattersburg culture where the best creative forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I took place in Pouchkinskaya-10, which opened before work a musical and artistic club, a Bohemian club, the house of the petrolsburgh Bohmet.
Many are born there: The NOM, Tequila-jazz, I'm still seeing Chnour coming with the "The earlier of Van Gogh".
Chnour and his friends sing easy playback songs in moulant maillots, they composed between Igor Vdovin, composer today in mode.
When the group began to produce himself alive, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg did not have emissions before Hali Gali's time.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and that's when his great carrier started, but his training and its basic education is that he received them at us.
D137 Gallery, Club "Griboideov": these are the impact of the artistic clinical.
Our employees and employees are departed as inhabited.
I'm a hero of the past century, from the time that culture wanted to say something.
In 2000, a sondage was organized in the press: it was the price "The personalities of our city".
I was named "At the year," and then my kingdom has ended.
It is not intended to work in a new time with old rules, I am a representative of truth, honor and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, but they can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
Your work is characterised by a recognisable style.
- Many of my tables are hits, they have a newspaper and a very strong appetite.
I'll have a programed exhibition "The Russian museum through the clowns".
The clowns are a temporary category.
Before I was a social one today, it's hurt and it's afraid to be like this.
But with the clowns, everything goes, the tragic falls.
I love the grandfather, I have great ideas.
For example, the idea of save the world through total and binding.
Today, this is the accommodation that matters, it is interested in the external mechanism, but not within the person.
Maybe we can't give him his hand, but it's just gotta get him to the dance.
And the lie will be dismissed by the deceased.
Once we saw you in the role of the Barbarie fiery player.
Who else I can play it?
- But maybe the commercial art may also be beautiful?
- Business art today must be signed, delicate, liquore.
A disintegration of culture is to be produced.
Before, people were shared in troops, the boom parties loved something, the nests another.
Today, everything is divided in micro-communities, it's difficult to be pleasant to everyone.
I'm not one hundred dollars ticket to swear everybody.
Today, we need to think of whom you're gonna like.
Everyone sees 100 fans.
But several thousands of people come to see Stas Mikhalov!
- These are people we have thrown out who come to see him, these are the sexual and social side walking.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 thousand will not come and at the end of the account is less management, money, losses.
I have my fans, the main is not to lie them, not to hurt the life.
When I was young, I've hanged the tables that a collector grew up on the side of Falk or Larionov.
I started with the tables that usually are the ones that are shot in the end of life.
Today, we are often confusing the ideas.
They say that spiritual culture, consumption culture.
Consumation has no culture, it has nothing to see.
I am a representative of the culture of yesterday, and I grew up with the example of the painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty, who just rejected money for pearl.
I'm for this culture.
- Kirill, what missing in Saint-Petersburg?
- The good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of the culture.
But all can't work in culture.
Under the kingdom of good treasures, the tsars did not understand the culture, but they understood that he had to keep the good experts.
In Moscow, there are good advisers today.
We have people here in Saint-Petersburg who might be experts, but they are disappeared, because there are higher experts that will correctly evaluate these experts, and they have a path.
Currently, it's the "Regency of the good" who flees.
The same Erarta, but they are different in this sense they say honestly that they don't take all the contemporary art, that there are other museums.
- For you, what's Saint-Petersburg?
- Saint-Petersburg is not cultural capital, there's much more culture in Moscow, there's a land for it.
And on our stones, art is bad to push.
We need a cultural ground and we have more writings than readers, that's bad.
In Europe, there are many curioses that will see exhibitions and concerts.
At home, this cottage is very fine.
We have to make the art to the mode as that was the case at the beginning of the last century.
Project carried out with the support of the bus of Saint-Petersbourg
Accept in space
Earth is in danger.
Climical residuation or collection with a murder asteroid.
Care units of space boats with lands at the edge part of the search for a planet of assistance.
To save humanity, a great question is: How can we continue to make our species in an appointer or still on a planet of help?
I think there's no choice much.
In fact, there are two real planets that you can buy it, it would be only by hypothesis.
"There is Vénus and Mars ", say Vladimir Sourdine, Astronomic Institute of State P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more appropriate for life, the temperature on the surface of Vénus is 500.
We can live there only at very high height or on Vénus's orbite... in space.
It was started to interest on reproduction issues in space, focusing on the flower.
Another half-sept, experiences on plants have been performed.
Four generations of small weight cultivated on orbit are not different in any way of the earthly variety.
Then on the orbits of insectes, small droophyl balls.
In 1979, cattle eggs were sent to the space to see how an embryon was developed.
We get a poussin to the exit completely normal.
It's then that the problems start.
"The problem is linked to the fact that poussin needs to find a support, it must be put on its patches and start to move ", explains the Director of the Laboratory of the Institute of Medical Trade Academy of Russian Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
Without any support, the poussins were designed.
And at the end of 10 hours, the new nests saw their instincts completely atrophic.
Poussins did not respond to light nor sound.
Unfortunately, they would just die at the end of four days.
"We tricked their eyes twice, then we left, because it's just impossible to work with them there," explains Vladimir Sychev, founding the exchange of experience with the powders in the space.
The last "miniature archer" with animals has been sent on orbite 16 years ago.
Experiences will continue at the spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite Bion will not only be abounded by the same kind of sex.
There was a experience with rats sent with their fetus in the space.
In principle, we have not found anything of surnatural.
"Again, it was biosetellite and then is the only experience. This kind of research must be performed ", notice Vladimir Sychev.
After the aircraft, the space rats were born to their progenition.
However, it is not yet possible to perform reproductions directly in space.
It's not a lot of business.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to achieve their sexual instinct.
In contrast to animals, man is capable, in principle.
The wise man puts the abstract thought, it is able to create a convenient emotional fund.
This type of experience is not done for ethical reasons.
But women's going into space for 50 years.
The largest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female body is what mankind has more precious.
Our mood was moving and no one on Earth could say if he would stand after a flight in the space.
If she could give a child after the flight.
" Nobody answered this question ", explains Vakhang Vatchnadzé, relief of the fusion sector and space.
In June 1964, just one year after his flight in the space, the first woman cosmonaute Valentina Terechkova was born to a little girl.
The father of the child, Andrian Nikolaiev, was also cosmonate.
In 1988, the second cosmonaute Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been two times on orbit and even worked in extra-viviculary environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk is lost.
We have little, even very little cosmonautes who have nothing and give birth to full health seed after long flights.
"And if they are long, this presents a danger even during orbit flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaute, heroes of the Soviet Union and heroes of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
However, humanity must seek new solutions in biotechnology, protection against radiations and creating artificial gravity.
hydrology laboratory of the Cosmonautes Centre: obligation to prepare the flight.
There, in any flexibility, cosmonautes lead to extra-vehiculary outputs.
The water likes the apprentice.
If for adults, water is comfortable but foreign environment, for nourrisses, is their real element.
Small amphibian men seem to confirm it: the life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby is evolved around 9 months in the limphic liquid of his mother's womb, it is easier to live in the water then.
It's in logical principle, because since his birth to his first bathroom, it's only two weeks.
"It's very little to forget ", explains the birth teacher for nourrisses, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if the child who comes to be born is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, weight force.
In the appearance, the muscles of the winter are very fast attrophiing, the child's powder capacity lost.
All right, let's ignore this by supporting the adquisition simulators.
Of course, it can be prepared an accruement in a special room, the woman will get out of it.
"And then?" asked Valeriy Poliakov to invite you to think about this complex question.
On the other hand, the child also needs a artificial gravity.
If it does not feel the earth attraction, the body does not form the skelet or the muscle system.
A nourrisson can not be paid as an adult with special combination for training.
It will be quite private of his vital needs.
"And this experience we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will go back to the Earth of a disabilitiesd child, fully disappeared ", provides the Director of the Committee for the Bioethic Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space remains still from the theory.
However, with time this will become real, when the Territorians will come into their boats to a far-term planet that will become the habitat of their seed born in space.
The Chief of the ISC (HOC's Supreme Control Institute) said: "The Independent pseudo work control (in Czech) has failed to cause politicians.
In the field of public markets, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and a quality legislation but it is trafficking for its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala said, Vice-President of the Supreme Minister for Public Finance Control Institute in an update interview.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, it is what is wrong with us," said Kala in its commentary of the current situation.
A joint control carried out by Czech Inspectors and Germans also suggests similar conclusions.
It cited as an example of offensive practice the approach of the " âvarc system " by Petr Nečas.
Mr. Prime Minister has recently declared that ODS would not import entrepreneurs with controls; is it therefore allowed or prohibited?
"The law must be applied in a way or in another way, whereas it prohibites anything, even the chief of the Government cannot prevent acting a authority to go inspect the respect of the law," said Kala.
At the meeting of the Board of Control at the Deputy Chamber, you have discussed a Czech Republic's project in which public market legislation have been compared to these two countries.
What was the question concretely?
This is a parallel control that we started about two years ago.
In simple terms, the European legislation provides how to manage public markets and specific national legislation and a practical practice follows it.
We have collected all this, and although this control procedure has not yet been completed, the very interesting differences have appeared to us: usually speaking, our legislation may be "more severe and better quality," however, according to some parameters, the practice as better is in Germany.
It therefore confirms that it is not sufficient to continue to develop more detailed rules, but that it is necessary to be devoted to the same implementation of the law.
What can this project help you concretely, and what does it result for you?
A common control of this type should just contribute to what we have stopped to do with the customs laws, borrowing and improved seeds, when it is not a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means obtaining the thing in question to a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lower), to exclude all riches and an eventual criminal activity.
But by bailing market seasons, this goal will not be achieved.
It might be that this system would be at such a point submerged by the paper, that those who seek the fashion will find a lot more opportunities than if the soil was left up.
You are talking about internal problems regarding the implementation of public market legislation.
How does the control system operate in Germany?
Is there a similar institution with our ISC or a different organization mode?
With regard to the institutions, in particular to the ISC, operates the Federal Recruitment Court which is similarly organized, also provides a little different advice, but these two institutions are fundamentally similarly processed .
The skills are also, in a certain measure, similar, with a noise compared to our system: Germany is a federal structure, so it also has the accounts of this type at the level of the different countries.
The BRH can only control federal money, which corresponds to the resources of the State.
The public funds of our regions and municipalities are controlled at the level of accounts of the countries.
With regard to national legislation, is it easier than our own?
I wouldn't want to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often designed as a model, but you can't certainly say that it makes better in all areas.
Maybe they have better inspectors?
No, of course not, but I repeat, I don't have comparison data.
However, this country that we consider as a model is also compared to a series of problems.
Unless they had no advantage to cooperate with our institution, aren't it?
With regard to national legislation, which has meaned, as a institution, the amendment of the public market law, are they already feeling?
This amendment has been introduced relatively recently, and it has no impact on our control operations.
As we do controls afterwards, we need to count with a certain late time.
Our comments are only concerning the process of preparation of future controls - we have launched a new instrument of "detection of bad management risks" with which we have passed at the crisis of about 14,000 public markets - these changes will be heard, because the seeds have been modified and the conditions of certain types of calling procedures and so.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law rather than a benefit or a charge oversee for the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope that the future will confirm it.
The problem that can happen is that these rules become more serious and that they can't be respected.
The provider (e.g. regional advice, in the case of regional operational programmes) has already been controlled to accept that any violation of the market law means a lack of budget discipline.
Is it therefore really useful to make the law more severe in this way?
No, not so, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack the system or to hurt it but not punish those who commit formal errors without consequence on the decision-making process.
A such system will benefit to the administration of pressure.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Look at where we're not going.
Received, the first minister said that the ODS would not import entrepreneurs with self-defender system controls - what does that mean?
Is the system prohibited or authorized?
The law must be applied in a way or otherwise, whereas it prohibites anything, even the Chief of the Government cannot prevent the action of a authority to go inspect and to extract the respect of the law.
He may explain, "We'll change the law and authorize it," but it can't say that we're going to act as if nothing was.
The Market Act contains relatively stretch rules on the formalities to be fulfilled, and that is just to protect the calls of offers.
But it is tragic that a submissionnaire will be eliminated only because of formal deficiencies.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, what is wrong with us.
The roads are ill places, but most remain practical.
At some places of the Czech Republic, the roads are shot and are also renewaled.
However, the network remains most practical, some places with increased monitoring.
Karlovy Vary Region
In the Carlovy Vary region, the roads were practical in this morning, but by heated places and also renewaled.
The temperatures have shot and oscilled between -5 ° and -10 ° C but they should easily return on the day.
The snow shoes stopped in the region and remained in the plains only a end of snow.
However, the crystals of the metallic mountains (Krušné Hory) are covered by approximately 30 centimeters of snow.
See the data of the regional maintenance service because of browlard, visibility was reduced.
Quick R6 and national paths in the region are now practical without difficulties.
Nevertheless, monitoring remains being implemented, for example, on some ponts whose clothing can be wrapped and swimed.
All departmental roads and third category paths, including mountain roads, are also practical.
It remains still on some of their thresholds of green snow and places caught by traffic.
Overall in the areas situated in altitude, conductors must strengthen their monitoring.
Pardubian and Hradec Králové governments
The Guideline of Roads and Autorities reports on its website that some roads of East Bohme are threatened by the Verglas training and that snow beds of traffic can be found on the roads in the mountains and altitude areas.
The road support services maintain the conductors against the risks of glass training in the Zone of Pardubice.
There may be glasses in the environs of Lanškroun, Ustí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, and this, mainly on departmental and third category.
Roads I/43 and I/34 were chimically treated by Svitavy.
The snow is mainly located in the mountains of the Genentes (Krkonoše) and the Aigle Mounts (Orlické Hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kn月nou and Trutnov, a snow snow snow kitchen is present on the roads in the areas located in altitude.
In East Bohem, the time will today be seen, the most often declined, with possible cloud crossings.
The wind will soft a low wind and temperatures will usually be busy between -3 ° and + 1 ° C.
Pilsen Region
The roads of the Pilsen region today are practical, although there is a need to demonstrate an increased monitoring and adapting its conduct to the methodological conditions.
He's spend this morning, the temperatures are obscened between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
Following the latest necks and the refrigeration followed, some communication paths may be held by heavy places.
The conductors can wait to pass through brohillard areas, however, visibility will improve progressively.
This provides information on the regional service of road support.
The D5 autoroute is practical almost without difficulties, the road communication services recommends however increased monitoring between the 80-131 kilometers.
The clothing of most of the national roads is severe and yellow.
Some tronches can be held in the Pilsen-South district and Tachov district.
Departmental and third category paths are humble and in this case the maintenance is applied against the lower thresholds.
Managers must be monitored, and this is particularly on the less frequent roads of the OUumva region.
Olomouc Region
Managers in the Olomouk region zones of high quality must be contained today with a snow and mould sleeve bed on the roads.
This breakfast is stayed on the cold says "abervenohorské Sedlo" and on the road in direction of Videlský kííć, after chemical treatment operations.
The snow cracks have bound the road maintenance staff this night; according to the neighbouring services, more than three centimeters were falling in the §umperk district.
In other parts of the region, most of them are practical without difficulties.
"In the heights of the district of †umperk there are remaining snow.
The drivers moved in the direction of Jeseník must wait to meet the cold said "Arvenohorské Sallo" a snow and mould swimming pocket " said today 周TK the Chief of the Services Support Services of the District of Šumperk.
Their colleagues of the district of Jeseník have also been placed during the night; according to these, after chemical treatment, the roads are now degraded and mobled, even in the highest areas.
In Olomouc's district, roads are practical without difficulty, the leaders should not only take attention in forest shoppings to the rest of humble shots.
Ustí Nad Labo and Liberec Governments
Tomorrow, North Bohme's road service reported a number of difficult trailers.
It is about the police data, that more than some snow or glass places, the mountain road from Telnice to Kniniice na Ustecku is closed.
The temperatures will remain under lower height, and so snow and glass should be kept on the roads. In the southern areas, in particular in the south is the Central Plateau of Bohme, there are no problem and roads generally serious.
No circulation difficulties have been reported for the present time.
Travel maintenance services reported the presence of glass, particularly in the area of 周tí.
According to the meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal to its training: rain and snow source during the day, the sky declined and slight during the night.
Since the main circulation axes, difficult conditions on national road 13 on the border between the Ustí nad Labo and Liberec regions are also reported.
The closure of the movement between Telnice and Kniniice is based on the tree branches which have been cut under the weight of the snow until the heat reached.
Šimon Ornest said, "In concert, we want to collect positive energy."
What do you think about that in less than one month this should be the end of the world?
It's only one of these new warnings, the kind of paths in which we like to fall.
In our group The Tap Tap, we are strictly and say we are the only group capable of collecting a positive energy remaining in order to resume or prevent the end of the world.
Furthermore, you go up in December a totally unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you provide more details this project to our readers?
It's a chartative action that we will prepare for two years.
We decided to use the potential marketing at the end of the Maya calendar announced for 21 December to 11:10.
The veil on 20 December, three concerts will be deployed simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will practically end when Maya will end on the Kiribati island of the Peacean Ocean, on an early 12 hours in advance.
Who had this idea?
At the beginning I think it was my idea, then we've all designed with our Creator, Honza Augusta.
Besides the fact that we want to collect sufficiently positive energy to save the world, we also want together with the public to consider the state of the world that we leave to our children.
At the time of the end of the calendar Maya, we created a collection of unique objects, including chausures, T-shirts, sacs, and original keys against the end of the world, buying them online on www.e-tap.c.z people can also support us.
The Tap Tap group has also registered a hymn against the end of the world " Fin of the world canceled " (in the Czech " Conec sv月ta zrušeno " .
She is already very popular on YouTube, will you also hear it in these charitative concerts?
Of course, at the end, if we succeeded and that the end of the world hasn't happened...
It will be shouted by all the interpretations in the three concerts simultaneously.
Hymnes will also be joined at a time given in the context of a direct emission, actually unique, of the Czech TV.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also holds the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X y challent...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We work with other personalities of the Czech show, because we organize many charitative concerts and events...
We strive to make them intensely involved in these projects.
It was noted that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that they are friendly.
What will the benefits of these concerts serve against the end of the world?
To teach the Studeo training centre that is accessible to reduced mobility people and we work on the achievement of the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap Association, and that for six years.
Teachers are regularly conducting students of the Jedličkćv Institute and proposing their activities that are interesting and appreciating them.
The students themselves do not have ways to go to courses, we try to help them in this way.
In the context of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Several music groups and interpretations will go to scene at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria did you choose?
We have tried to develop a program addressed to all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will go to the scene China, Lesbian support, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Ji月í Searchý.
You will find all the details about www.kpks.cz.
Do you also prepare other " mega events" of this kind in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time in the printing of Prague; there we will certainly prepare a quality program with interesting invites.
We would like to play the next year in the Czech Republic's house in New York and personally, once on place in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimal until you played in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
However, the Tap Tap is a group of persons with disabilities.
How will you manage the organization and logistics of your tournaments?
It's not so terrible that it looks first.
We have five electrical members whose engines must travel soft, naturally we triumph a lot of bags and tool boxes....
To this end, all of which was more or less than ever done, ◆SA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they wondered me more than once.
Even to Moscow, from where we've come back recently, everything happened without problems.
Thanks to your journeys to the foreign, you can compare what these countries differ for easy access to reduced mobility people, the attitude of the public opinion on disabilities and so later.
What were your experiences to now?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than in us, we just have been witnessed in Moscow that all are still in a initial phase.
Related with Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to persons with disabilities; there is still not known that one person moves only in electricity in the center of the city.
They have not yet believed as an revelation of giving priority to a person in an ascensor.
Unfortunately, there is also an association that seeks to address the problems of persons with disabilities.
What should we still ratify the most developed countries?
There are many things we're still late...
It is important to mention that improvements and perfectionships are still depending on the efforts made by those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is actually actually that people with a hard disabilities are alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilettes, to the museum, anywhere...
It is not even very frequent there that many persons with disabilities are actively involved in social life, on this point you, The Tap Tap, are rather contrary to the point of progress!
The respect of the public and access facility is a thing, but the situation will really begin to change when we will increase sports, artists, actors, politicians or devoted judges.
For the time, these are only cases of persons who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, returning back a few years ago, what has it made you in 1998 to create this group?
I began to work as a teacher at Jedlička Institute, where I found a lot of young ready to invest in something.
And as I am my own music (I play, among others, saxophone), with a college, we created a music activity.
And then, with time, as said our Moderator Lala Angelovič, we have a bit lost the control of the situation.
The success has been only during the last years, if I don't lie?
It is true that the fact that we can create links with known cantors and work on the promotion of the group has helped us.
We understand that if a job is not visible, it is like if it is not in the foundation.
With the subsidies of the European Union, we can also allow us to have quality professors, equipment, and so later.
Do you have to achieve such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt that there was a potential to change things.
Business show is full of things that copy each other.
In some way, it's logical: everything new is accepted with consciousness and it's hard for a long time.
Rarely are the original projects, and I want to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally pleasure, that is naturally ...
But the happiness is totally unnecessary, because people with disabilities are not suffering, abandoned from all, that we must take mercy.
These are people who can live a whole life and expansion, in the condition of having the necessary ways of sure.
I often say that when people with disabilities get to realize something, it is not only an advance for them but for the whole society.
Is it that your success should not also be due to the fact that you are a requiring leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we must be intransferable in many areas and require a certain discipline.
But I think it's really normal.
Some people coming to us with a romantic vision and the head in the clouds and, when they consider that they should come to repairs two times a week, follow the preparatory courses and take a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But this is the same way in each group who wants to work and achieve objectives.
The Tap Tap Group currently contains twenty members.
How many of them were already there in 1998?
One, there's Angelovič.
We're a group open, people come and go, there's nothing.
Our doors are always open to those who want or wish to join us.
This will be the watch of the planned day of the end of the world, Thursday 20 December 2012 from 21 hours.
This action will take place in Prague in the Incheba Arne, Brno in Fleda and Ostrava in Plynojem, with the participation of twelve groups and other Tschech Republic musicians.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual relaxes when the song of the The Tap Tap " end of the world cancelled ".
The goal of the concert is to gather financial means (25 million CZK) to operate the multi-Financial Student Training Centre in Prague in Jedlička Institute.
The price of a bill at this concert is 400 CZK, the entry is free for children until 12 years, the prevention of bills is opened in Bohemiitick.
Poland and cosmos.
The last week, at the meeting of the Ministers of the European Space Agency, Polonia was admitted as a twentieth member of this agency, in the second Member State of the Eastlock (Tzech Republic has become a member of all the 12 November 2008).
Poland has been closely cooperating with ESA in 1994 and has been participating in a number of projects of the Agency.
The path from Poland towards space has nevertheless started a lot early.
Today before the Second World War, the Polonians were working on space flights; they did not always understand.
For example, I would like to refer to the Conference of A. XXXternfeld to the Astronomic Observatory of Varsovie on 6 December 1933, in which he will present the ideas taken by his former garden work entitled "Introduction to the astronautique ".
The developments of this young engineer (born 1905) left fresh audiences and years later †ternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, †ternfeld obtains the Robert Esnault-Pelterie price and André Louis Hirsch for its work "Introduction to the astronautique ".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) became a large propagator of the astronomy and the astronautique.
He published hundreds of articles in the polonic journals and wrote many works dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a propagator of the global recognition astronomatic, in particular his contribution was rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the hidden face's craters.
Since 1925, it was built in Poland a drain designed to be equipped with a huge motor.
The author or the details of this project are unfortunately known.
It's not clear if the fussed should serve to propulse or flow drain.
The only known information about this drain is the pressure of the time.
Since 1933, the Poland artillery began to sanctify the fusions.
Research were carried out by the Comórka Techniki Usbrojenia in collaboration with Professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokzyckiego.
It is recorded that this research has reached the test stage.
Of course, with the arrival of the German army, research was stopped.
In 1937, the plans of an electrical exchange, designed by the engineer Rohozićski, appeared in the specialized presse and the next year was published "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
These two projects had finally been a military use of fuel motors.
Just before the war, all the projects for the use of the missions were carried out by the Provisional Advisory Scientific Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of war ended at its activities.
After the war, other aircraft work were published in the polonic pressure through the Poland Astronautique Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, there is a company in November 1954 of the Proble Journal, in which four more detailed articles are offered to the aircraft.
In one of these articles, written by professor Subtotowicze, it is proposed to create a society dedicated to the astronautique
At that time, artificial satellites projects had already been launched and it was clear that the area of space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Astronautique Society (PTA) made efforts to enter into the International Astronautique Federation (Created in 1951) and since the 1951 PTA became a regular member.
The next year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became Vice-President of the International Astronaut Federation.
He keeps his function until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has contributed significantly to the short-friendly successful development of the meteorological fusion of RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first polonic fuss to implement scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch was held on 10 October 1958.
This mixed of a 1800 meters port had a length of 80 cm and weighed less than 5 kg.
A improved version, RM-1A was built during the age of 1959, and two RM-2 tests were embedded in the wilderness of Bledov.
This was 1,4 meters long and probably weighed 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should have been able to carry out concrete scientific work - RM-34 wash had had to have a portrait up to 14.5 km and served to observe the wind in altitude.
But in 1963, all development work were stopped.
The Meteor-1 fussed during the period 1962 - 1965, succeeded by the first type of RM.
This fuel, designed with two stars, had a total length of 510 cm and a initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (named Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they were different from the dimensions of the space reserved to scientific tools.
The meteor-1A fuel had a space offering a volume of 0.4 litres, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C of 0.62 litres.
The maximum port of all these types of angin was 37 km.
During the period 1965 - 1968, Meteor-2 was launched in the airline, the first flight trials started in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 fuel had a initial weight of 380 kg and was able to transport a useful load of 10 kg to approximately 60 km.
The versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were then built.
The entry of Poland to COSPAR (Commission for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a national COSPAR committee two years later.
In the framework of the Interkosmos Program, Polonia also participated in the space explosion on artificial soviet satellites and, in 1978, the Miroslaw Hermaszewski pilot became, after Vladimír Remek, the second non-sovical cosmonate of this programme.
The abbreviation of the Law on Public Utility's work is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annuled the Law on Public Utility work.
This decision understood a living discussion in public opinion.
There is no doubt to consider this problem of a broader view.
The economic systems aimed at liberalism, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of non-regulated economic competition.
This means concretely that the various economic entities and national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This results in the principle of freedom of trade and free movement (in limites) of the private capital attached to an explicit financial speculation.
The considerable differences of the labour price (salonary) generates a price tension.
The following meaning should be made under this terms: a producer is enforced by the import of lower sales goods to rescue economic competition by "creasing more " the price of the competitor, in order to remove a greater part of the market and increase its own benefits.
In the largest scale, this means the majority of enterprises: to transfer the production to the foreigner or to buy lower prices or to disappear.The result is an important unemployment in countries where the prices of work are high compared to other economies.
Since the private capital has no responsibility of the social point of view and also of the responsibility of the unemployment to be generated, the State's social charges are necessaryly increased.
All this situation will intensify the perfect desire of immigrants to pay taxes and to compensate the economic and social damage caused to the whole society through this course.
This situation is at a public notorial point that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
Private capital practices generate a situation in which the Governments of the different countries are contrary to start in mutual competition in order to artificially reduce the social level of their own population in order to address the foreign capital at home.
Otherwise, Governments put their own population to the benefit of private capital without taking into account the social fund.
This is mainly shown in the amendments of existing laws.
The goal is to constrain its own population to accept private capital prices, particularly in the field of salary.
This is a part of a system of economic restrictions in the case of long-term unemployment and otherwise by restriction of employment rights in the field of labour legislation.
It results in growing poverty and enhanced differences between the rich and the poor.
In RFA, for years there are public food distribution points for poor who cannot meet their needs with their own work.
The number of people are already considered by millions.
In the context of the increased competitiveness of the German economy, employees must be actually present that they receive such wages that the State is contrary to pay a supplement for them to reach the minimum vital.
For example, such a offence has been updated in the case of employment workers as assistants to the Federal Parliament.
The economic measures of practice all the Member States in the south of the EU, without sure, generate an similar situation in which, under the pressure of a disaster of the society, people are contrary to immigrate (such as in the XIX century) or to live with miserable salary, in marriage of society, in hope that one day the private capital has invested in their countries.
There is a need to be the following question: from where will this capital come?
If it comes from other EU countries, poverty will go from a country to another; this capital may not come, or then a Chinese, India, Brazil, Turk, Morocco, Egypt or African will continue to work for a group of a European salary.
This also concerns the whole Latin America.
Free theory and media say that the State cannot make investments in capitals in its own economy, that the guiding economy leads to economic disasters.
The private capital defends the idea that the State cannot intervene in the economy by regulatory interventions.
It is therefore necessary to ask whether the private capital does not affect and, even, does not manage, in accordance with its own enormous interests, policy and the whole State today.
The answer to this question is without doubt yes.
The evidence is that there is practically a lobby that can and present in all States.
There is a disadvantaged situation in the area of corruption, through the acquisition of mutual benefits, in legislation, where everything is condemnable but not punishable.
In RFA, the situation is that, because of the lack of financial means, national departments delease the development of law projects to closely related laws in the industry.
These draft laws are then adopted at the Federal Day.
The whole power is not from the people, as it explains the constitutions of the Western type, but of powerful financial groups serve their own interests.
It is obvious that the democratics aimed at liberalism are now rapidly compared to the situation described by Appians in its work under the "Crise of Roman empire at Cesar and Pompe": "The State was a full delimitation and the functions were imposed by violence.
Cats of pots-de-vin, the benefits obtained illegally, and the stones and the swords were also used to obtain these posts.
The low-table and corruption were proliferated without limits, and the people had made the elections with already sold voices... "The Honour people were not seeking to get the functions, it was a result when the State remains eight months without advice."... "There really started to say that the movement to this difficult situation was an authentic and that he was to choose an energetic man"... it is true that Appianos had the spirit of Pompée, but that was the César who had transformed the democracy in absolutist regime.
In conclusion, such as the antiquity, the current society is based on the preference of personal benefit, without regard to the interest of society in its whole.
In the meaning of that, the private capital is no longer capable of understanding and dealing with the interests of society in its whole.
It is today, as once again, a decade without prior elections, without any effort to carry out deep reforms.
We must therefore find the causes of the emerging of fascist and communist regimes in liberalization without scruling the economic systems of the XIX and XXe century.
In the current state of things, the disagreement of these systems may be considered to benefit from liberal type democracy as a kind of pause before a new stage.
The fact that the current elections fully ignore the event of hundreds of thousands of losses in human life, humanitarian and social crisiss today, and the crimes against humanity such as we know them from the history of the old and recent history.
The cancellation of the Public Utility Act is not a solution, at least a long term.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at the international and internal European level, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This tendance is actually systematic.
The solution consists of sociopolitical reforms, which will strengthen the capital investment of the State in the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government, and will enhance the position of private capital in the society to the benefit of the State.
Israel: Chaos Lab.
"No one will come out of violence and never can't" says Sting in the Fragile song whose main side is "no forget how fraud we are."
"If my son wouldn't want wars, it wouldn't be there," said Goodele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on his death bed in 1849.
Following the last vague of violence between Israel and Gaza band, many reactions have been high.
Some are taking the part of Israel, arguing its right to the self-defence and putting Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support Palestinian people, calling on the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against Palestinian Arabs and considering Israel as a terrorist State.
I don't want to consider the question of what is wrong and who is victimed in its wounds of recurrent murderers; the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of the self-related territories, are born in this political situation and have not lived the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer the readers a point of view "after the rideau" to which mostly benefits of tensions that have been held over 95 years (with the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a small boundary of the Middle East.
Some of these reflections are supported by historical facts available in the study, others are of my own understanding of that, or more exactly from the individual group, which is the main instigator of the events of the modern history.
The history of humanity is first the story of a struggle for power.
Every time, we can find a Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is to know whether these individualities were acting independently or if they needed their acts at the throne to someone who would guide their acts as a pre-defined objectives.
We need to admit that we live at a time when the world richness is conquered between the hands of some individuals and that this financial concentration which generates some powers could not be made during one generation.
Among the families who have a astronomic richness distinguishes particularly the Rothschild Family, who could be considered as the head of the feet (I don't know if these families have a leader but I don't exclude it).
Peu is written on them.
Of course.
Since the 1990s of the 19th century, they acquired the first World Press Agency (Reuters) to put a term to the establishment of links between their name and serious criminal acts they had been mixed and which had always meaned for them a strengthening of their power, an increase of their force or both.
They have major participations in almost most of the central banks of the world and planned or conducting wars against the countries in which they have not yet participated (for the invasion of Afghanistan, the number of these countries were 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the return of Cadhafia was only 4, between Russia, under the control of the Russian government).
Any person who tried to face this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the Central Bank Bank of Rothschild and made its own money during the civil war (gouvernemental, I hear) and was killed in a theatre in 1865.
JFK began to emit its own money and wanted to dissobed the FED, was murdered in 1963, and the President Louis McFadden was engaged in 1936 while he wanted to try a proceedings against the FED to deploy the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their global power sovereignty at the level has been conducted in the years 1859 to 1871 in the formulation of a three global wars plan by Albert Pike, a 33th-throughd franches at the highest level.
The first war was intended to eliminate the major state monarchines of Europe, the second should remove colonialism, including British, and the third should reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (in such a amount of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), creating a single universal religion (ecumenism is nothing else than the love of such solutions) and finally acquire a absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the most rich families with the Rothschild is to create a crisis and then propose a solution (order ab chaos - the following order).
These solutions are false and always lead to an enlargement of the situation (see the creation of the EDF aimed at avoiding crises, such as they caused in 1907).
After successful deterioration of the first World War by murder in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, heritage Habsburg at the Southern Hungarian throne, they destroyed the Russian Czech Republic by provoking bolk revolution.
The first World War ended by a German capitalation without economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Russian) and it was followed by the damage of Austria and Hungary, Central Europe's power.
For a more easier deployment of the Second World War, the bankers left that politicians create a conflict situation: they have, on the one hand, imposed to Germany for a far-aminable war repairs that generate the conditions of radiization of the mass mass (for example, sufficiently energetic leading, showing the finger of simple solutions) and, on the other hand, created a Tchécoslovakie composed of various nationalities, including a minority that had to play the role (so effectively) of the fifth columns to put fire into powders and disappear a war.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschield inspired the creation of the sionist movement, one of the branches inspired the creation of a Jewish State, preferred in the historic Jewish region with Jerusalem as a capital.
The above-mentioned Balfour statement laid down the bases of a massive migration of Jews to Palestinian and the first frequency with the Arab local population.
Terrorist acts were made on the other hand.
The Second World War, which is difficult to appreciate if Hitler has spread the chains in which international bankers had held it initially; or if all the planned was, it is the fact that the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the bases of the acceptance of a Jewish State by the world.
Israel was formally founded in 1948; as the war refunds imposed to Germany were originating the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel has enlarged a burning flow to cause a third world war.
If international bankers come to delude this war, the Jewish population will be like it during the Second World War, the first victim of wars, the same as the Arab or usually musulman of the Middle East.
Israel is as an immense laboratory, the source of discretion and chaos, not only in this country, but at international level (a suffice to see how people are sharply divided between partisans and defenders of Israel).
Who is offended and who is victim in the Israeli Palestinian conflict, where a torture produces another torture according to a cycle of violence without end and where, in the origin of all, is the punishment of some individuals and their desire to acquire the whole world's power?
This must be the difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as at home, international bankers offer people only their own candidates.
The current first Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascistic politicians, loyal visa for international bankers, which makes it all to deploy a war with Iran, which could, due to the accession of this country to the cooperation organization of Shanghai (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc.) extend to become a global conflict and, given that Iran's control of the departure of Ormus through which 20% of all the world petroleum (the corridor Naval has a wide of 2 miles) and generated a destruction of global economy.
With what light the proposals of David Rockefeller now appear in 1994: "The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order."
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which an aristocratics of finance is served by the rest of human population.
A world in which any new birth is to be implanted to the birth a electronic puce that makes it to be fully controlled.
"They are contrary to all persons, small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves to put on the hand or front of the red iron mark, so that he may not buy or sell who doesn't give the name of this fair beast or the number of his name.
It must be understanded that he who has a good sense accounts the figures of this fresh beast.
This number tells the man and is six hundred sixty-six."
Argo movie: When everything's worse, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a multitude of demonstrators composed of islamist students took about the American Ambassade of Teheran and retained in 52 diplomats.
They had to be freed by Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had escaped to the United States, who supported its regime for several decades.
The situation would not be offered to the American administration of positive savings, but could not, in fact, leave Shah, because it would have seriously disappeared the confidence of its allegeds in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had delayed on the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was not in a position to obtain liberalization of the otages.
It was a hard crap for the pressure of the United States, while even later aggravated by the lack of the tentative of liberation of otages by force.
The follow-up diplomates were finally released 444 days later, following the negotiations organized by the Algerian Government.
Their kind of sort makes the United States a vague of solidarity and an anti-Iranian feeling.
Iranian disappearance was strongly contributed to the departure of Jimmy Carter with Ronald Reagan to the 1980 presidential elections.
The Argo film, of the actor and meter in scene Ben Affleck, describes a episode of this story that offers a small victory to America.
Just before she was busy, six employees were dismissed from the ambassade.
After comprehensive penalties, they found in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA was able to get them out from Iran through a Roombolic cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a touring team who had come to make repairs for the tourning of a movie with a large science spectrum.
Combination of genders
The program of expert in exfiltration Tony Mendez requires the cooperation of Holllywood.
In order to make the most credible lending, specialized stores are undertaken in this film project, press conferences were organized and a physical production society has been evaluated from real offices.
The details of the operation remained long secret, the film was based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Affleck's movie is an insect combination of several genres.
It is a part of a political thriller designed in a realistic way but also a "caper movie", the recital of a successful, a tractory - such as in the Ocean trilogue, twelve and thirty.
The ambitions succeeded: the sequences of the documentary style Teheran (in the subtitled follows are presented from the iconic photographs of the events of time and how, through these photographs, these same situations have been translated in the film, there are no major differences).
easier passengers of Hollywood, treated with irony and a bit of exhibition,
and then scene from the CIA General Square and other Institutions with cosmetic men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the neighbourings and telephones...
Ben Exleck has been able to restart his card remarkablely.
A ridiculous actor, it became a respected scene meter and his actor game stopped sustaining ironic comments.
Argo is the third long-metering of the police shadow Gone Baby Gone (2007) and the thriller "The City" (2010).
It's also the first movie of Affleck who doesn't deploy in his original city, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that put its first films above the hollywood standards.
Affleck also shows that sense of the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Teheran " was held" by Canada.
The best scènes of the film are deployed in the streets, in the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the ambassade chute is impressionant by its clarity that also suggests the shadow and the invisibility occurring when soon, in a given place, is written a history page.
Appleck and its collaborators have an similar effect in the fruity scenes (the fause touring team in the Teheran Bazar).
Too many actions to too much places
The scene meter had to be satisfied with a subject, in fact, only a few Palestinian scenes, in the cinematic sense of the term.
It goes very well, some elements in reality and there, the result is not always too illustrate (the scene where the crisis threat to the Teheran airport is disrupted by a telephone case in America and the continuation on the aircraft is sufficiently removed by hairs).
The weakness of Argo in its disadvantaged nature was to show too many events to many different places.
If it's true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are really charming in their role of hollywoodian co-operators, their personalities would have harmed a greater place and they're not far from there, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's movie lacks a bit of dramatic tension, it has been seen with a moderate interest, appreciating the achievement and the backstyle in the 70s.
It leads the shower, but with difficulty.
As a memory of a story yet, in a certain way, covered to this day, and as an illustration of the exhibition of the representation of secret services as an host and alliance, it is the case.
Rules for the goal of ballons, bananas and circles
The www.bankovnipoplatky.com server, which conducts a public investigation on the most absurd bank costs, has now decided to launch the concours of the regulation or ideas in the coming of the EU document.
"The fact that the EU considers the last time to adopt a 40 percent of women for the direction of the major European enterprises has been on the basis of our decision," said the Pervo journal of this investigation, Patrik Schwer.
Among the absurds mentioned, there are, for example, the recent decision of the European Court to join men and women's insurance premiums.
Women were still advanced for life insurance tariffs because they are Objectively representing a less risk for insurance companies.
People can report to the end of the year any other idea that can be "the EU workshop".
"The vote will be done before the end of February 2013," informed Nacher.
Among the EU controversial regulations, for example, the obligation to add bio components to the fuel components, which have a nervous consequences for the environment, or the prohibition of use of the mercury thermometers, only because they contain a relatively low quantity of a dangerous substance or the Directive on the size of the pools, which has resulted in the increase of the oil price.
Criticals were also issued in the past against the ban of the fact of useing the expression "cover to cart" or of the sale of classic ampoules.
Quality bananas must have a 14 centimeter size.
The European Administration is often reacting to the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby whose requests are usually defended by a State or a group of States (the Czech Republic currently imposes the requests of its banks to merely use its veto right).
The interests of printing groups are, for example, at the origin of the fact that bananas in the Union must not be lower than 14 cm or present a "normal core".
The European Commission has defended himself by arguing that it was only harmonizing non-human national standards that compliance with trade.
The standards relating to the fruit and vegetables have been assumed despite the opposition of some States, provided that the existing directives lead to spilling food density.
The first price may be defined in this investigation to the EU Regulation for the past year in accordance with a warning warning that children of less than eight years should not go forward without additional monitoring.
The EU has refered to an American investigation that the ballons are the first cause of children's death per thoroughly.
An similar restriction is applicable to children of less than 14 years for sustaining in pearl trumpets.
We also have strange ideas.
The following rules concerning European officials themselves are sufficiently absurd: because of the sensitivity of this topic for Greece, any person who has an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedoine" and, at the same time, must speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In cooperation with the "Lassez Faire" association with liberal economists, the Bankovnípoplatky server has appointed in this investigation, including some absurds mentioned above, the Union Regulation on the volume of food reserves on the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves to be found on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeds the volumes set for the savings and risks, for example, a burden amended volumes.
The organizations of this investigation were interested in the idea of paying money for some countries because they do not have access to the sea and the idea of agreeing a subvention to request subventions.
However, these ideas are not originary of Brussels, but of Prague.
"The fact that we don't have sea disabilities.
We will ask for the European Union a remuneration, and, in the year 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the Time Jaroslav Palas, expressed.
He argued that the State was found with full stocks that he had then to export.
According to Palace, the EU had to pay millions of euros because the Czech Republic is far from ports.
Finally, the European Commission has responded positively to the Czech request and organized an appeal for blue purchase in province of countries without maritime access.
The subventions for the obtaining of subventions were proposed to communities by the Ministry of Local Development, assigned by the Minister of Local Development, the Minister of Pavel NIERmec (US-DEU), which should, in particular, serve as requests for subventions granted by Brussels.
The EU states that the strange regulations are rare.
If the Regulations are often critical in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU's efforts on regulation and improving the effectiveness of the Union's operation and in the field of its general development are more elections.
For example, the problems of EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to see with the strengthening of European integration, but which were imposed by Member States in budget negotiations.
The fact that the Czech Republic, such as other countries of the Union, fights in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (light which it does not always go to win) results from emotions in the Czech.
If at the end of six years of battle against the Germans and the Autrichians, the Czechs have successfully defended the name "Olomocuted tvar 周ky", for what was called "Tuzemský rum" which was distant among us in the XIXe century, our producers had to replace it by the name "Tuzemák".
Only canna sugar products, and not on the basis of better sugar, can have the name of rhum.
In the official list of EU-registered products, it is available today in a globally known company, such as Feta or Gorgonzola, the Massepain of Lübeck or Parme jabon, Karlovy Vary’s biscuits ("Karlovarsé suchary"), the pohocelic carpes and Tåebo ("Pohoòлїelický to T月eboský kapr") and the houbon of ◆atec ("Dietecký chmel").
The peak bread of Pardubice ("Pardubický perník") and the festivals called "Cornets de Hoćice" ("hoicked trubičky") may also be proud of their Community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just a friend. Senator Okamura says
Mr Senator, how did you think to present the presidential elections?
It's not to be Senator or President who accounts for me.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I would not be candidate anywhere.
But I do not support how the country is paid for the past twenty years, that the flighters are not under the rocks and taxes and the age of start to the pension.
I had no ambition to become political.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to make a solution to change it.
And as I have more than forty years and I am an independent member of one party, I have no other solutions to influence the situation that I should present to the presidential or Senatoral elections.
You have entered the Senate but you are quickly put on the road for the Chamber (N.d.T.: presidency seat).
Do you not turn the dose to those who have chosen you?
I've always said I'll lay me in the battle for the Cathola according to the results of the senatorial elections
Afterward, I explained that if I were elected Senator, I would be present to the presidential elections.
My but is not the function, this is only a tool that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the largest impact and the most wide mandate.
The problem is not only as a nation relaxing us to bar or before our television post, but it's also that we're likely to be great to those who are trying to make change.
This is added to the pressure that affects the reputation of persons and conformity of the freedom of word with freedom of mentality.
For example, it has been said to my reason that I call the journalists or that I was the Adviser of Jihí Paroubek.
Let's come to your visions.
You have entailed the fight for the Chamber with a battle horse topics of the material and criminal liability of the politicians and retroactive fiscal statements beyond 20 million [CZK].
You have to change the law at this end.
As President, you do not have such power and only the Senate in its entirety can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When as a citizen, I made pressure for tourist leading activities is a liberal profession, I gained a cause.
The problem is policy: if someone comes from the left or from the right with a good project, it is apparently rejected and the citizens detained.
As an independent member of one party, I have much more opportunities to get support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the benefit of power, without categorization and partial dogme, to take from each party what is better for our country and to implement it.
Are you thinking about a right or left man?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people put me to the left.
For me, that's a little left or right, it's not really important.
For me, the interesting is that we've gone out of the front.
What I think is not that people are left or right, but to gather people.
I always support any solution that contributes to the common good, even though it is proposed by the communist or ODS and I am also impartially against bad ideas.
Are you inquire when someone tells you that you're a people's?
But what you said didn't prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a business, you also have a certain optimal goal and a vision.
You're trying to get close to it.
Some can call it to the peoples, but all the proposals I speak have been implemented by the world and acknowledged experts have spoken.
But without the support of the parliament, it remains you only slogans.
You won't survive long in political with this.
Do you think that if you're going to see people and talk to them, for example, will you be able to impose material and criminal responsibility?
I don't have any other option.
I have to convince the politics, journalists and public opinion and try to rail them in my camp to impose it.
If I had chosen President, this would not be a problem to transmit directly to the television, my request to the Presidents of the parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politics, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should then explain why they don't want it.
When there will be a strong personality that will identify abuse, it will be possible to press on the political scene.
For example, take the election of the President to the direct suffice, it was obtained through the pressure of the public opinion.
I admire, without friends, be a friend, not a genius or an intelligent.
I'm trying to find alliance for my opinions and visions.
I came to start in politics and I try to support the majority of my programme.
I'm just trying to make things progress, and if it's not going, I'll stop in six years and I'll return to the private sector.
It's a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a saver.
I know that no one can do the difference, therefore I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to present themselves also to the senatory elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused the amount of work.
At least I supported the journalist of investigation, Jana Lorencová who revealed the crimes of massive.
I've been present because people's really inconsistent but now I'm here.
Sixty percent of people have not voted, and what they did, for most, gave their voice to a representative of stability.
In Senate, we're only two independents.
People have chosen a Senate that can hardly impose changes.
However, I will fight for my vision, for example, the election to the direct suffice of the males and the prefects of regions.
Are you thinking about funding your own party?
No, not yet, because I have no time to verify whether the past of each member is without a cup and then I have no financial means.
I have no money for my presidential campaign, I have just twenty thousand on my "transparent account".
You don't have money?
You're talking about tax statements, what's your own?
I think about 60 million the value of my personal goods.
I have a terrace of 25 million, a apartment of 10 million, another apartment valued 8 million, a art collection of approximately ten million, a Aston Martin, which is 3.5 million and a Superkob superb value of 1 million and a few million on my account.
Soon he said, I put a Aston Martin, because it was a child dream: I have always loved James Bond, who runs in the car, was wandering with women and fighting evil and abuses.
You're moving in Aston Martin, you've got an inheritance of 60 million, and you don't have money for your campaign?
You want to change the Republic but don't you want to invest your own money?
It's not very convinced.
I don't have 15 million for this campaign.
Should I end me?
I've already invested two million and half in the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsor shows that my program is not a great interest.
I don't have the obligation to pay this campaign of my pocket.
My campaign costs are globally covered by the reward I will receive as Senator.
But I can't live, for example, pay the English school of my son that costs 30,000 per month.
If my only goal was to win money, I will not present any choice.
So are you gonna continue your commercial activities to live?
Did you not state that you're gonna make your activities sorein?
But this is not related to the amount of this reimbursement.
As I promised, I partly reduced my activities.
For example, my adjoint will take the direction of the trip agent at the summer.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
Yet, I have to live something.
What was your usual monthly payment when you were undertaking?
I win and I continued to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I was President, I would end my business activities.
You will find this interview in the Saturday edition of the Perva newspaper.
The MVRDV cabinet architects prove that the real aventures are not only a matter of imagination. To convince it, it's enough to contain Speekenze and the newly renewed books mountain - 2 photos
"I find that this building is marvelous, it makes it very futurist, finally something interesting to see," said Lisette Verhaig, a past on the downtown of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer in a great neighborhood company, said to us, "Yes, it's actually good, this building."
But I ask why we still need a library today.
Everyone is on the Internet, a iPad and e-books.
Today, nobody's going to go full of his breathing in one of these ringing libraries, right?
Specifice, a restaurant city that has nothing to go to Rotterdam's doors, contain a quite special record.
The common of 80,000 souls shows the most low education rates in the Netherlands.
In order to return a few neurons to the brain, the city decided, some years ago, to contribute to general culture and to reproduce the seven physical ponts that contain on the euro bills in the form of small miniatures in armed peint.
The success of cultural offensive is limited.
This is how the city authorities noted that there was only one way to repair the hand on statistics: the construction of a library!
Winy Maas, the architect office of Rotterdam MVRDV, the master of the smoke and creator of full spirit buildings and often clinically accepted the project with its usual flow and was presented in 2003 with five books under the arm and face riding.
And while the jury members still looked, decreased and raising the balls, Maas, the faced, puts his election books by order to make it a piramid, and ended its talks of active arrangements by one: "Green!"
This is my proposal for the mountain of Spinice's books, or as we say, the Boekenberg!
Neun years later, the mountain of 30 million euros has thrown from land.
The building also includes a subterranean parking, a supermark, a post office and a few indoor homes and meteoan houses for a total of 50 rooms.
Start November, the book mountain has received the second price "Best Library of NL 2012".
Furthermore, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is so that this small land burden, which until now had nothing to offer only a postmoderne pigeon and a master of an awkward laidder, whose white façades invited to think that they open a lattery, has been enriched by a contemporary architectural work.
The most important, is that Speeken has now the first public cultural building of his history.
Long path to read
First impression: Eldorado of the book under lock.
Of course, an ascensor moves you into the heart of the massif, but the true joy of reading and architecture opens to you when you spend the ground of the building to discover his topografie.
The entire white internal is light and clear, the hollandasic breastplates and the elective reverbs speak without an appreciation of the language of municipal public places.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
It is already looking for the look of public banks, dogs and little boys and girls playing the balloon.
And everywhere books, books and books.
"Otherwise, the library rails are the length of the façade and in the middle are a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and unfair", explains Willy Maas.
We have completely blowned the classical space configuration and opened spaces from the internal reading spaces.
Inside the books mountain was adjusted: the offices, the Internet library, the building club, the environment centre and the Technical Centre.
A special beauty remains in the black races of the library, which are soon lambs, so soon balustrades, soon as of scatter's branches.
A new experience for view, touch and love.
Even architects and engineers in the building do not want unknown materials.
"We want to work with recycling materials", explains Joop Trouborst, head of the project at the sponsorship community, in a response to the Standard.
This is how we have found in a agricultural company a ad hoc waste from the agricultural deficit.
For years of synthetic membrane is used for a millimeter of spring as substrated in serres and fields.
It's a good market and we're winning time.
The end of the membrane is used during one or two series, then you can throw it.
For the library, the membrane was first composed in such quantities, in plastics of a speed of four centimeters.
Under the effect of warm and pressure, the "Landbauplastic" (KPL) is changed and transformed in a dark, homogene and resistant material, which the ood is then earning a new car and sports chausures.
On the top of 105 walks is the top of the mountain.
At the end of almost 500 metres, the literary café offers us an impressive view on the city, but also Hollandese crochets and pot ficus.
These are creating an atmosphere, but mostly contribute to maintaining the ideal level of humidity of the air from the Literature Mount.
Dones for the new soul
"It's incredible, but despite all the surfaces of the glass, this building is a ecology model," trusts Trouborst.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermy.
Although the mountain of books is under a white cloth, the sun is just a little time inside, even the beautiful days of time.
The wooden powders mounted through the glass façade serve like-sole, intercept a large part of the rayons.
Ambient atmosphere is very nice.
The completely automated screens are charged from the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the seventhic information listed, has already been able to enter into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
Cynthia Bogarde, professor of Chinese traditional doctor, also describes Boekenberg as "the soul finally found" of Spinice.
A few weeks ago, during the inauguration, each citizen has been invited to do a free book of his personal library.
This measure allowed to combine the blanks of the library that was not yet completely garni (today, it accounts 70,000 books).
The concept is a success.
Rayons defray everywhere.
For the Winy Maas architect architect, " there's nothing worse than a half library."
"I believe our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if it's just for decoration."
This is how MVRDV has reached the master discipline which is called, in the professional jargon, "the creation of an identity".
Spinzisses wrote a new literature page.
Even if she can look like young and little educated.
It is finally a new start point for the birth of an identity.
Szabo: "The Germans must play a greater role."
Germany elected the abstention in the vote on the admission of the Palestinian State.
According to Stephen Szabo, he expert relations between the United States and the EU, this decision takes Berlin in a delicate political situation.
German Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the request of Palestinians to obtain the State observer status to the United Nations.
But then she chose the abstention.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not appreciate what the Israelites did in Gaza.
Nevertheless, Berlin must demonstrate a comprehensiveness, because it takes special relations with Israel.
But I also think she does not support the American position anymore.
Germany wished to confirm his independence, however, without being too critical to Israel.
During the insurrection in Libya of March 2011, Germany had also chosen the abstention during the vote on the establishment of a air exclusion zone.
Finally, the OTAN imposes this measure.
Does Germany try to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason is that Berlin is now to reveal its external policy, seeking to disappear from a policy that has been defined by the Americans and to establish Germany's external policy.
Furthermore, the lack of coherent and common policy within the Union composes the situation.
Therefore, the Germans are worried to several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used.
I think they're still going to find this role, but they're on the way of a foreign policy "modern more".
External policy, such as France or Britain
What then means the term "normal" for the Germans?
It shows the intention of adopting independent positions of the United States and European partners, including national folders.
I believe that the German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, so by exports and relations with certain regions such as Russia, China or the Near East.
The German economic interests are, in a certain measure, different of those of the other large powers: therefore Germany has to protect its interests.
Did these economic interests influence the position of Germany in the context of the conflict in the Middle East and the abstention in the United Nations vote?
Germany has first deployed interests in the Middle East, especially in the Golf countries.
That is why Berlin must not take care of the public opinion but also of the elections of the Arab countries.
There is no doubt of a decisive element.
However, I would not agree too much, because it is not exclusively unilateral relationship.
But it is, in all cases, a determining element in the German strategic reflections.
Have Germany in his relations with the United States to choose the abstention in important votes, such as in the case of Palestinian?
I think the Europeans and Americans are perfectly understood the German position.
That is why I think that fracture is not so serious that it was in the case of the Libyan question.
Maybe even that Germany will be more respected.
In fact, Germany has shown that it should be taken to the serious as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, the opinions on the Palestinian initiative are different.
On the other hand, the United States announced their veto of a clear voice.
Different opinions between the United States and the majority of the European countries?
There have always been differences because of the US's internal policy scene.
I believe that Obama is secretly proof of a great understanding towards the European position.
But in view of the country's policy configuration, the Government can't hear to defend its public position.
I believe that the real differences of views are not so large as they always appear.
If you see the relationships between Obama and the first Israeli Minister Netanyahou, you will notice that Obama is far from enthusiasm in respect of Netanyahou's policy.
Does Germany try to convene its close relationships with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the large European partners, on the other hand?
I think it does not facilitate things for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little more simple for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not the case.
Therefore, they cannot be included within a broader policy line and must reaffirm their individual position.
That's what they now do in the issue of the euro.
In my opinion, Germany will take a role in the future and will make Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not simple for Germany, particularly because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
But I say, the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that marks more their independence.
Does Germany play a role of weight actor on the international scene? Does Germany just want to take a key role?
Or does it always have difficulties to take the roles of the first plan?
Germany is not always used, but it is still inconsistent to him and, for clear reasons, the country is still trying to play a more important role.
If, for example, the euro crisis is seen, it is noted that every time Germany decides to weep more, many anti-Angland feelings are hearing.
It doesn't simplify things for the Germans.
In fact, it is still the same problem: we don't want to be surrounded by hostil countries.
In this regard, Germany is more delicate than the United States.
It must compose with neighbors and very different opinions, and it is not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European Politics is only to reduce, but it is now that the EU does not combine this empty, then what remains it?
The Germans will just play a more important role.
And even if it be not pleased them, even if it is unfair to them and if they are less appreciated, it's life!

"Market protection" in China: when Puma and Armani becomes Chinese suddenly
Armani and Pool Ralph Lauren are brands known throughout the world.
Armani Polo, what's that really?
Besides this name, there is an official brand set in China, but there is nothing to see with the original company.
The brand plays a protection such as the company that takes the name cannot be deemed.
And even if she could, it isn't sure she would get a cause.
"There is more difficult for foreigners to protect their brands in China", explains Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer of Taylor Wessing, specialized in violation of the property right in extreme East.
Every week, a new folder comes on my office every week.
The followers only need some additional letters to save their brands.
So, instead of Gucci, it is registered Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny.
German enterprises are also copied in all laws, such as Puma, the producer of sport articles.
Pattloch opens a class in which the records carried out at the Pékin's office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company put the Zegna DF Puma mark, a name that the firm artificially created by a part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the house of mode.
It is aware that the Chineses have become the fields of the world of copy and the violation of intellectual property.
In large cities, trade centres are found in several buildings that are practically selling only contraffes.
However, the cases of Pattloch are different: his mandate is charged to approve the fact that the Chinese trade office is officially granted to Chinese enterprises the right to use a name already protected in another country.
The Chineses speak of the "Bang Mingpai" of the parent mark.
The term is described by "Bang Dakuan".
With this term, women who married rich men are designed.
The Chinese authorities say nothing to reprove.
"It's wrong for business, you must fight against this tendance," calls Pattloch.
"The brand is eduulcorated, the unity is disappeared, the damage for the reputation is extreme."
Finance losses and justice costs are ciphered in millions for the sectors concerned, especially in the cost-related products.
According to the CLSA market analysis company, China represents an annual volume of 15 billion euros, the third world market of luxury products and the most fastest development.
However, it is not easy to radiate certain records of the brand record and these procedures cost closely.
The latest can duration up to nine years, and the island is never certain.
Pattloch stated the procedures in which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period, the criticised denomination was “the reality of the market.”
Pattloch explains us that if the blogger had no chance, he may even be bound to throw money to the plate, because he would be bound to his brand in China.
In this area, it is sometimes the law of the Jungle here.
Featured cases also concern graphical elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost legal battle against the Sany Scanner Maskmaker, the same company who had come to raise the Béton Putzmeister pumps producer.
That's why Chineses can use a emblem like Mercedes star.
Geely, Volvo buyer, used before a blue and white logo that remembered the BMW. The conflict was regulated and Geely had to change it.
The Lacoste Lacoste house was lost against the plagaries of Hong Kong and Singapour, who had reoriented the cryodial view in the opposite direction.
According to the Chinese authorities, they are not accused of anything.
However, the CTMO mark office in Pékin admits some difficulties in 2010 because of a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would past the last year of an " emergency situation in the deployment of work to a found normality".
The number of non-opposition procedures would therefore have declined by 22%.
Approximately 57.000 cases of this type would have been closed, which represents an increase in 75% compared to the previous year.
However, 81.500 procedures remain in the office.
To make cherry costs
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
In the past year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million mark depository requests, almost a third of more than in 2010.
According to the office, it is a record, and that means that China is in the tenth time successive in head of classification for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also be for the total number of legal marks, which is 5,5 million.
In 2011, the office would have calculated 1,8 billion yuan right of registration.
In other words, each registration has reported in average 1,280 yuan or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs more, such as it illustrates the case of the German family שמחnberg.
Since more than seven years, the company fights a Chinese plagiary.
Of course, the Germans could have obtained that the illegal manufacture of vehicle components should be suspended.
However, the ismyr could maintain Chinese rights on the joynberg mark.
"It's our family, because family names cannot be protected in Germany", says Hanno Wentzler, President of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The brand office had therefore rejected the objection of the Munichois.
The joynberg has certainly gained cause for the following two instances, but the opposite part continues to fight up to this day.
Watching is to be sent
Today, the case is in particular at the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confidence, he believes in a positive issue of the proceedings and is worth the professionalism of judges.
However, he adds: "The procedure is long, testing and costs a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess internal costs. The service of the archives has even had to review the acts of the last hundreds of years to provide evidence.
Five years ago, joynberg had even proposed in vain to the adverse party a "growth sum in euros to six figures" to regulate the ligue.
"That's what it represents for us," confided Wentzler.
The dangers of the External East are even threatening to disappear in Europe.
This would be the case if the followers of the region would ensure the operation of non-protected marks.
For example, a Chinese producer wanted to put in Germany the name of joynberg for a steel and kitchen production company in Germany.
The company had left this sector for a long time, but she could even prevent the depository.
Wentzler added: "The monitoring is delayed."
Pattloch and it advises the German enterprises to demonstrate great prudence in their trade relations with China.
It does not suffice, according to them, to boast the international law of the marks, foreigners should "save all things that may be protected" as said Wentzler.
However, costs may be more important than those of the registration.
Indeed, if joynberg lost the battle at the last act of its legal drama, the company should pay licence rights to the adverse party for the use of its own name, as explains Wentzler.
Or then we lose our place on the market segment in question.
World Day of combating AIDS: foot taper, singer, help
The Imbongi Cohoral repeated in Heidelberg, and the Swaziland AIDS orphelins are glad about their arrival.
This is the story of a link that breaks more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First of all, we're throwing out the feet: cowboy bottles, baskets, scarpins for the dams and men's moons are looking for the rhythm by striking the land of the feet. Very fast, they find it.
One, two, three, four.
Then, the voices of the songs are slowly - high, low, teenor and overno -, they're taking, calling and following.
Fite Hopf, the Head of 29 years of Orchester is almost lost his toil chausures when he leads the orchester with his stories of a wild soup.
We are Monday, Imbongi chocolate plays a new song in the music room of the Heidelberg Medical Institute.
Five songs and songs from 23 to 69 years came from men’s genetics in human medicine.
"Om'Obani" is not an easy piece, each corteist has different words, all in a very extreme language: the salt, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some regions in Swaziland.
Adjudicated to help
UNSIDA, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS, believes that 34 million people around the world are affected by disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland accounts 245.000 infected persons.
Furthermore, more than 40 per cent of the population is severe.
180 orphelins of the City of Esitjeni have found parishes in Germany thanks to the Association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them are a secondary education institution.
For 15 or 20 euros at least, you can become parrain.
This sum guarantees the child's money for school, a school uniform and a warm newspaper in the Gogo centre.
Immungi means the salt of the "concert of History" or still "looking songs".
No one can couragely speak the banking language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
Since about 10 years, the coral repeated songs in this foreign language which she brought into Germany to bring it to its birth region: South Africa.
For at 8,733 kilometres of bird flight from Heidelberg, north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, Esitjeni is located in the village depending on the vocal power of the German cohoral.
40% of people reached
The village contains approximately 2,000 inhabitants, some of them live in low or land modests and most of them are children.
More than 300 among them are orphelins, because HIV has caused their parents.
In Esitsidei, the lowerness of Swaziland can be observed in Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate and the lowerest hope of life in the world according to UNICEF.
Population does not practically accept male circumcision, a measure which still ensures proven reduction of half infection risk.
More than 40% of the Swaziland population is carrying the immunodeficiency virus and is not rarely to die in the middle of the thirty.
During a group trip in Africa at the spring 2005, the cohoral had been able to discover the village. In particular, the Immunists saw many children in the street which he was not only lacking parent care but also only: food, clothes, education.
In a poor country, without school diplomas, there is no perspective.
At first, it was only some persons who were engaged to send a few euros every year to send a child to school and offer him a warm feast daily.
But unfortunately one year later, the cohoral founded "Voices for Africa", a association which has been concerned since almost professional orphelins of the AIDS of Esitjeni.
Facts concerning sexually transmittible infection
What are the most current circumstances of sexually transmitible diseases?
Among the bacterian IST, the syphilis, chlamids and blanorgy (or gonorhea).
The current IST is HIV, human patolome virus, genetal herpes or hepatitis.
The powder and the gale are the parasital IST powders.
What are the mainly concerned groups?
Syphilis and blennorgy often appear in men who have sexual relations with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute believes that sex contacts are at least four cases of syphilis on five stated in Germany.
In adults, chlamided infections, trichomonase, candida (Fendonic), blanorgy and human population virus are current sexually transmisible diseases.
The HIV propagation rate between heroexual adults is relatively lower in Germany. However, some 20% of the new HIV infections are observed within this group.
In youth, a rate of infection related to chlamids is significantly higher than among other population groups.
The three quarters of all infections concerning young ages from 15 to 25 years.
Furthermore, in Germany, the human population virus is current in youths.
What is the evolution of the number of infections?
It is not obligation to declare all sexually transmisible diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis was more than 10 years of age: the number was passed from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new infections to HIV reduced.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
This represents a decade compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of sexual disease?
Infective diseases may cause abcides at the level of genetic organs, urinary painers, white losses, low-venture pains, and appearance of buttons and green.
However, they regularly have no pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How does they protect?
Preservatives can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect 100%.
The reason is that pathogic agents of sexually transmittible diseases may also be transmitted by lubrify infection or by close corporal contacts.
Therefore, experts recommend each person who often changes sexual partners to regularly carry out reviews.
Most speeded IST may be healed and later seeds can be avoided.
Thanks to parliaments, donations, but especially to the funds of chorists through their whole voice through Germany, the means are accumulated.
"In all, we have already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni", explains Annette Lennartz, President of the Association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a safe woman of himself and who always receives what she wants, is the hand of the money from Germany.
It also ensures that orphelins are well logged in one of their grandmothers, for example.
The gogos are so called the old women in salt, the village pills.
Some of them welcome up to 14 orphelins, they offer to them a tooth and ensure that they turn daily at school in their uniforms.
The orphelin who has no person is accepted in a secure place in Khanysil, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as well as the two kitchens that daily prepare the feasts for more than 200 children.
Furthermore, "Voices for Africa" has created a couture school and allowed the construction of two poulors. With the concours of the US Health Organization, the Association organized a test of HIV for many residents.
This does not happen to himself, even if disease is well visible in all the country, it remains a tabou subject.
A King and his 14 marriage
"The AIDS is a real taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "for it is a subject that touchs sexuality."
It's pretty curious, coming from a country of which the king has 14 official marriages.
The last absolute monarch of black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for its extreme lifestyle.
Poligamy is placed by democracy.
These mixtures sanctified by the State, among others, are responsible for the speed proliferation of HIV observed in these decades.
Migrant workers also disagreed the virus through the country.
However, preservatives are found at each street coin, add Annette Lennartz, "but almost no one uses them.
Culturality is different, flesh against flesh."
In order to promote a bit of cultural exchange, Imbongi chorists are travelling all two or three years in South Africa and encouraging emphasis of nostalgie, comfort, trust and black identity that the number of inhabitants of the black continent still know the time of apartheid.
The bus full of white chanting in African language is a sign of recognition as it generates not only good humor and joy, but sometimes also raises a lamentation of a few cross-border guards.
The bus always emits them to Esitcheni, where the chorists visit their girls.
Even if it is difficult to find the small village on a card, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
"Go to Esitcheni, you will find light there," said people there.
And after a travel of 8,733 km of bird flight, return to Heidelberg, before those chorists that throw foot in the Mountheimer Road repair, the light is also found.
Messenger: NASA discoveres the glass presence on Mercure
The sonde Messenger reported evidence of the existence of glass on the Mercure planet.
The glass cott could reach 20 meters of swimming pound.
The NASA American Space Agency proved the existence of glass on the Mercure planet.
Although this planet is the nearest of the Sun, it opens the iron water, as explains three studies published this Thursday in the specialized "Science".
The sonde Messenger reported evidence of the existence of glass covering in the planet region remainingly stretched into the shadow.
This cover would have a speed of at least 30 centimeters to go up to 20 meters.
The water is likely to be cometes or may be asteroids that would be heat Mercure.
However, no one has linked the water discovery and the hypothesis of a life presence on the planet, it explains the scientific head of the sonde Messenger, Sean Solomon.
Mercure temperature can reach 426 degrees of Celsius.
The discovery could help understand how water and other essential elements in life have occurred in other regions of the Sun system.
In view of the inhabitants of our planet, sounds, theescopes and small robots like Phoenix screen the deeps of the universe.
Otherwise, they send images to the earth, such as small interests through which the end is observed.
The image comes from a photography developed by German researchers of the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our sun system, as well as the nice planet Celese.
As Pluton, which is orbiting around the Neptune Sun, Sure is not considered as a "planet", according to the new definition of the 2006 international astronomic Union.
This detail of a infrared photograph from the Teascope Spitzer shows a "familie port" of the innumerable star generations: the older stars are blue and the rock points, more difficult to identify, are the "new-noved" in the universe acquisition room.
The Telescope Spitzer discovered this region where stars are born, "W5", a very little romantic name, in the constellation of Cassioa, to 6.500 years of light.
The NASA telescope Spitzer photographed the flatboying clash of a star to die.
The circle in the form of attachment is combined of elements that the star projected when it dies.
In the Nebulous Trifid's invasion, 5,400 years of the Earth, gas and powder for new stars.
The Spitzer Telescope has photographed this galactic accommodation room.
The Pleyades, stars loved also called "The seven sisters" may be observed at the cloud eye during the night.
However, the telescope makes more valued colours.
On this infrared photo, the nebulous of Elise, as a red eye, looks directly on the spectator.
It is located in 700 years of light in the Constellation of the Verseau.
His comparisons with a earthquake have valuated the title of North America.
The combination of the normal photo and infrared photos allows you to observe a spectrum teeth.
Only infrared detectors of the Telescope Spitzer could take a image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the largest angles of the astronomics leads to the creation of the Saturne annex.
A theory is that the rings are the remainings of a Saturne moon that disappeared from 4.5 billions of years ago without leave traces.
One of the largest and net photographs that had taken the Hubble Teascope is the Galaxie of the Tourbillon.
According to the tenth, the photographs of the inspiral galassies may become true art works.
The photography published by the Australian Observatory of the United Nations shows the nebulous Trifide in the Constellation of the Summit, to a few thousands of years of light.
The name of Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divised, shared in three), for three powder trains divide the heart from the birth of stars.
Astronoms photographed the prematures of a cosmic carbobulation in the constellation of the Serpenter: 400 million of the Earth's light years, the noils of two fusion galaxies fall one to the other, the collection is inevitable.
The Hubble Telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spirale galaxie.
If you don't like technical refreshings, you can use its name of "austral fire raw" if you don't like technical refreshments.
The photo of the Space Telescope Hubble shows a detail of the Iris nebulous, in the Catholic constellation.
The nebulous is 1,400 years old and is composed of powder grain that are ten-flower than current home powder.
This photo has been developed from the optical and radiographical climates taken by different telescopes.
You can see the circle composed of the black troughs that is at 430 million of the Earth.
Space Telescope has photographed for NASA this group of baptized galacs Arp 273.
Scientists named the largest spirale galaxie "GC 1810".
In this nebulous, the group of young stars is the most light of our lacked way.
The heavenly beauty always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are linked by the Rosette's nubs, also create young stars to 5,000 years of the earth.
In this galaxie to the lighting and smoke of a small black trough, there is still no powder, there is only gas.
Scientists think that he was born a little after the bigbang, when the universe was a large part of hydrogen.
Our view on the universe: the main telescopes
The Telescope was discovered in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey before Galilee uses it one year later to observe stars.
Since the middle of the optical telescopes haven't stopped growing and thanks to them, it was possible to see still far far in the universe.
During 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale of the Observatory of Mount Palomar near San Diego was the largest telescope of the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five metres.
In Arizon, the United States, the Binocular Telescope Large.
It allows to observe the universe through two miles with a diameter of 8,4 meters.
The wind of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, Canarian Islands, is immense. He only reaches a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The middle of South African Large Telescope in South Africa has been seized to make economies.
The diameter reaches all around our metres.
The discovery of the economic construction method is that the telescope is set at the vertical level, which is limited to mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also set at the vertical Angle level.
His speciality holds its great capability of light collection.
Despite a relatively small diameter of mirror, this capacity is approaching those of the world's largest telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe in the research of extraterrestrial signs in support of Arecibo radiotelescope (Puerto Rico).
This radiotelescope is a diameter of 305 metres.
Each person owner of a computer can help the "Serch for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "request the Extra-Terre Intelligence") with contribution to the calculation power of its machine.
Having regard to the Australian European Observatory (ESO), in the Chinese Andes.
This is the Very Large Telescope ("Telscope"), a worthy of his name.
By a total of four mirrors, this telescope can clear the average infraroid spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chili.
His main middle should reach the impressioning size of 42 meters. It will be combined of approximately 1,000 mirories elements.
However, the telescope can not take clicks before 2018.
By 2007, the two telescopes of Keck on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered as the largest world.
They had two miles of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea observer who observes the heaven with the Subaru Telescope and IRTF.
A new big teascope should also be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will be 30 meters.
This example allows it to be admired.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he delivered us images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Space Telescope Kepler seeks explanates, mainly those living.
NASA announced on 2 February 2011 that she had found 1,235 candidates since the beginning of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before launching the Space Telescope Kepler.
The Space Telescope James-Webb (JWST) will be sent to the space at the early time in 2018 at the border of a Ariane Fusion 5.
The first mirror of the infraroid space telescope is a diameter of 6.5 metres.
The Telescope will be in particular for the mission to find light planned by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists think that the South Mercure pool also opens the glass.
However, there is no confidence data on this theory, because Messenger orbits more near the North of Mercure pool.
Radar data indicate the glass presence on Mercure since decades.
By launching the sonde Messenger in 2004, the first to go around Mercure, scientists now have certainty.
Beer daily drink and live until 168 years
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people have reached the worthy ages of the Bible’s patriarchs.
There is even a museum of long-term.
A survey on a country where you are still relatively young to 97 years.
In the south of Azerbaijan, many people have reached the worthy ages of the Bible’s patriarchs.
There is even a museum of long-term.
A survey on a country where you are still relatively young to 97 years.
The travel on the mountains Talysh is an equipped romanism.
At the distance of many road tourers the small bus caught the length of wooden collines, tower rivers and modest closers.
Everything is green and fertilizer, it would be almost believed in the Black Forest.
But here we are in the southern eastern of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few kilometers.
This is here the ethnic Caribbean group named Talysh, about which we don't know greatly if they are talking perfectly to the Persian and Isher and they have a very long-term.
Finally: Teaching.
The small city plast with its too aggressive architecture of the soviet time that does not agree all with the landscape of Pittoric Mountain.
The European tourists are rare here, the trajet from the capital of Azerbaijan, Bakou, is too crucial.
You need eight hours to run the 323 km, because the road is only one way.
The province has not yet benefited from legitimar riches that the country must have to its reservations of petroleum in the Caspine Sea.
However, Pilata Fassayeva, 48 years old, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist place.
"Bakou has become famous in May through the Eurovision assistance, and the next year there will be the festival of the most old people in the world", says Fassayeva.
She is directed from the museum of long-revited, the only museum of the world.
You can discover the life of about eight tens of Talysh from the region that have more than 100 years. Fassayeva shows us a photo in black and white.
This is my grandmother, he has reached 120 years old.
See also a child aged 136
But the contrary star of the museum is Serali Mussolmov, a pastor who had 168 years old.
However, there is no birth Act.
And when we think that the oldest person documented had 122 years, the age of Mussolmov seems more doubtless.
"He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973," specific Fatulayeva.
The man would be married three times and he had 23 children, and in the age of 136, he would have still designed a girl.
Should he be stubborned about a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Schoolz, geontologist at the Max-Planck Institute of Rostock, also heard about the man in the great age of Central Asia.
"In some regions of China, Japan or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan, Schoolz also lives in Sardinia, there are men who live incrediblely old."
However, it is impossible to create a scientific evidence because of the existence of documents, without considering that there was no civil status registration.
Every day, a beer beer beer
However, it is that people in the Lerik region often reach a worthy age of the Bible’s patriarchs.
Currently, 20 people have more than 100 years.
What is therefore the reason for long-term in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the suiker tourist guide, explains that the Talish have special gentlemen.
On the contrary, Fassayeva, the Museum Direction, thinks that this is a food question.
However, it seems not to be pleasant, from a nutritional point of view, that the rich feeds in calories of the Talish, which loves meat, bread, and especially milk products, and which many daily drinks a based drink, are good for health.
Or is it the simple life mode that reserves the youth of people? A small village near Lerik, Vive Rubaba Mizayeva.
With its 97 years, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wood house, as it is typical to see it throughout the Caucase region.
It is sitting on the ground by a barette, which is battle the content inlassible.
Eight people live here under one thick, one of Mirzayeva's sons and a girl, who are pregnant for a long time.
Two little children are also bathed in the house.
In the kitchen, the tea is prepared for guests served in typical weapon glass in winter.
Mirzayeva's white dents are perfectly aligned, and under his foulard hides a long threes of a fountained blond that his son showed us with fierity.
I always washed my hair with milk, and so I never lost them and they kept their colour.
"I never used shampooing," added Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She had always eaten what comes from her own firm: tomats, land pumps and small weights.
Of all my life, I never bought the least food in a supermarche.
Then she talked to us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst moments were after the Second World War.
But everything has been improved when the "good beloved", Heydar Aliyev takes the orders.
The language of the propaganda stands in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the worship of the fatherly figure of the nation, a man who has yet directed his country as a dictator, was almost not known by limits in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham later succeeded him.
Whatever it is, the elders of Azerbaijan do not know the disappearance.
Mirzayeva has a monthly 230 managers (approximately the same sum as in euros) for its pension, a sum which guarantees a good life train in the region.
And perhaps the son of Mirzayeva's grinding son said: "The elders play a great respect in our culture."
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, signed and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The "Rights of man" hated in the Constitution
Revolution returns to the Caire.
Reval manifestations reflect the deep fracture of the country.
The draft constitution based on the char is violently contrary.
The President of Egypt is not aware of emotions.
We need to achieve the transition.
"And this success is my responsibility to the people and to God," said he to the State TV.
His talks were designed to the whole people, but especially to the Catholic Catholics, the Liberals, Muslims and Laychs.
Because all members of the opposition have feared the disagreement and unemployment.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nil in the hands of the mighty Muslim Frères.
Mohamed Morsi stated, almost as it is sorry, with temporary restriction of the competencies of the Constitutional Court and extended itss to save the revolution.
However, Egyptians and the world do not really know what it wants to save this engineer of 61 years, a doctor of South California's American University.
Should the judicial power be returned?
The 234 articles covered by the congregation of 100 islamic majority of persons in a night force tour of 15 hours are effectively concerned in a certain measure.
As in previous constitutions, the project provides that the jurisprudence covers "the principles of Islamic Law".
But what does the word "princes" mean?
It was and it remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that the Islamists use the vague formulation and the margin of legal manager that deployed in order to apply a more closer interpretation of the chario.
In any case, it gives a new article that, as regards all issues affecting charia, the Al-Azhar University must be consulted. The establishment is the most important Islamic Institution of the country and its racing outlaw on all the Sunnite Islamic world.
This may, but it is not strong to say that the clergy will monitor the legislative device, which would actually lead to the full implementation of the judicial power.
A number of points of the Constitution project are to interpretate
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the kingdom of Moubarak, these courts were employed to repress the opposers.
After the decree, the military were detained up to 11.000 civilians.
The State may also be read in the project, protecting "the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promoting its moral and values".
From a legal view, the formulation is so far that the Institutions of the State could even control the content of cinematography and literature.
Of course, it would be just a censure.
Furthermore, no article provides expressly the equality of men and women.
Instead of this, another article prohibites to offer or distribute the prophet Mahomet or his sent.
However, the article does not define what is a crime or how it must be punished.
Any doubt also is the formulation laying to hear that it is prohibited to "office people."
Is it possible to discover a carriage of the President or to tell a denial to a man of law?
So many points are to interpretate in the draft that Morsi submits to the vote and, according to his own words, will be "sighly soon" the object of a referendum to the Egyptians.
"Revolution renews"
The opposition has been mobilized for weeks against the digital sovereignty of the islamists.
Friday evening, ten thousands of demonstrators were gathered in an inhabitable agreement on the place Tahrir in Caire, promised to fall the chario before it enters into force.
"The revolution renews and we're gonna win," Mr. Hamdin Sabbahi lanced the third part of the presidential elections.
The Nobel price of the peace and former head of the International Agency of Atomic Energy Mohamed El Baradei stated that the Constitution project was " to throw into the poubels of history."
On Twitter, the immediate message service, he accused Morsi's parties to encourage a "putsch against Democracy".
"If he proclaims the referendum, we're going to his palace and we're going back," said Jasser Said, an opposite.
"We are not yet fair, the blood of our brothers is not yet expensed," said the Egyptians Khaled Ali, a political man and a member of the opposition.
Furthermore, several judges have declared not to wish to monitor the referendum, which would lead to its integrity.
"The Coran is our Constitution"
On its side, the Muslim confree, well organized, called to an anti-mantifiation not on the place Tahrir by precaution measure, but on the other river of Nil, where a great prayer was organized before the Caire University.
Women who had been in the sandwich, and the fellows of the Salfists, who participated there greatly, cried: "The people calls the application of the law of God."
"Take our country!" they asked Morsi, stated that "the Coran [the] was their Constitution."
A fight for the sovereignty on the symbolic place of Tharir, where everything began, would soon be generated a situation like that of a civil war.
Of course, this is what Morsi's parties wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Fristers said that the opposers to the Constitution project, as its parties, were high and strong expressed.
According to them, it is now time to leave the people to decide by the urines of the direction that the country must take.
The Islamists' project will certainly pay the majority.
"The human rights are not mentioned once"
Hasez Abu Saeda is in anger against this imposed constitutional process which would have been extended until February and integrated all social forces.
The Human Rights Advocate and President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended Muslim Frères when they were in prison or before the courts under Mobucca.
He did it not because he shared their concept of the world, but because human rights are invisible for him.
That's why he was wrapped by cuts, judging and imprisoned.
"And now, the term has not even been spoken once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his intertaining with the world on Sunday.
The extension of Morsi's powers to the three powers defended the lawyer.
These measures are critical damage to democracy rules and they will generate a new dictator in Egypt.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President takes him de facto all its powers," said Saeda.
However, democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels delayed, including the international community, which looks at the battle between the various political ideology on the Nil border with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
This could be paid.
A demonstrator on the Tarir place keeps: "You get a monster that you will not be able to control."
The Norway Rafisk: Is it the most sweetest fish in the world?
The five million people in Norway benefit from one of the highest levels of life, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Should the secret of the success of the country be linked to the appetite of locals for extremely sweet fish?
Take progressed disagreements.
Place them in the middle of a kitchen of mood and selling feet.
Wait a week.
And you get the degrading ood of Arafisk, one of the most captured metals in Norway.
I'm in the small city of Fagernes, about 3 hours of Oslo.
He's snow, the landscape is spectacular - and this oil, all-precedented, impresses the air.
The rafisk consists of sauce sauce and fermentated in water for a duration - according to the ood you want it to exalt - which can go to a year.
When the darkness is installed and cold, Norvegians gather in mass to assist a festival that is located here in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary speciality.
"You eat faithful, then you appreciate a glass of acuvit", explains Havard Halvarsen, full-time pompier local pompier, which is also called "Rakfisk General", responsible for the management of the festival.
Away of us, people valuate small fish pieces and filling a large number of drinks.
"A number of people preferred the aquavit to the racfisk," adds Havard.
The drink is killing the ood.
I'm trying a few pieces.
If you can avoid to pass it under your nest, it's not bad - it makes think of a sushi that would have passed a long hour in a bus.
The racfisk away at a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of the fresh, the fish was burned in storm water barriers at the air and then came into the automne.
Then, during the hiver, once well fermented, the fish is gone out and - without doubt with the senses of the alcool - eated.
For the previous generation, thousands of Norways have been forced to leave their countries to find work, mostly migrating to the United States.
The population is now quickly developed - more than 13% is immigrants, affected by full employment, high salary and full health system.
The Sweden, their old rivers, whose country was, is not so far rich than Norway, through the border to come to work.
Rafisk is considered as something important, a vital element, although he's hot, in the past of Norway.
This makes parts of the sweetest plates.
But it's pretty - a small bicycle or sandwich will cost you 10 € everybody.
Norway does not often speak of her in international newspapers, which is not to spread it.
There, people are not disposed of speaking about Anders Brevik, the extremist law racist that killed 77 persons, including women and children.
When they listen to this murder, they talk about "the Independent of 22 July".
The Norwayians have disagreed to accept that one of them has been able to make such a barrier act.
Since the beginning of the 70s, Norway has to be rich to his petrol and gas industry, one of the most important world.
"But the petrol is not the unique reason that justifys our success", explains Anna, our servant, the blue clothes, and in the eyes of a blue transparent, the image of the northern wellness, with a racfisk plate on the hand.
We're - how you say, you're aware people.
His English, as the most people who live here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we don't like to notice.
Norway has managed its petrol richness with a lot of prudence - but, with the exception of a low percentage of money from this industry, it is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries threw money through the windows, during the years that have leaded us to the international financial crisis, Norway has been able to keep the cordons of his well-bearing.
"That you can skip and make the ransom in the age, we're happy," explains Anna.
"Do you forget the rafisk," adds she in an insufficient ride.
I'm standing under the snow, and I'm doing the cow to buy something to eat - I had my rafisk dose.
In the menu, a hamburger composed of elan, a real discovered, is excellent.
But tonight, the fever of fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many places where the rafisk is served to dinner and where it can be voted for the best one of them - or maybe for the sweetest ones of them.
There is a TV emission where the presenter takes a nig-pappillon, around racfisk sittings.
We would believe in the help of the Eurovision.
"What's the score you gave to the best fish, in the Thor-Jirgen mountains?"
"See us points, Havard."
It's hearing rids and applaudements.
A man falls from his chaise, perhaps because of the aquivit abuse.
Or maybe it's because of fish emanagements.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto knows a difficult start.
While the President enters Enrique Pena Nieto will prepare its functions to Mexico, Will Grant, the BBC, to take care of the difficulties waiting for it and the expectations of the people, which are many.
Route circulation to Mexico is particularly bad at the present time.
In a city where embodiments are legally normal, a security bar has been established since Monday, blocking several key road access in the capital and provocing real chaos on roads.
However, the goal was not to prevent people to work, but to prevent demonstrators to achieve the Parliament.
The next half, the new President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Neo, will receive the Presidentary earlier to become the new President of the nation.
A comprehensive task is waiting for it.
The economy of Mexico is well, the results that the President of Felipe Calderon must come out, but the country is proceeding to a drug war that has already costed about 60,000 people in six years.
"My Government has taken the commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," said Mr. Pena Nieto to the American President Barack Obama in the Ovale Office a little later week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this goal.
Before co-country the President, Mr. Pena Nieto was the manager of the Mexico State.
A very little and attempted state that enters the capital. On his prediction land, the opinions concerning this new leader are divided.
A direct man
For example, it is included in the memory of all.
The locals provide the development of tourism and infrastructure in the community.
To join the city, you can take one of the new authors of M Pena Nono, an important improvement has been provided to these roads, sometimes forests and full of growth.
The name of its name is accompanied outside of a new sports complex and an interactive museum impressive disadvantaged in climate change.
"We focus on him to establish sustainable changes," said his friend Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the Congress and Party of Mr Pena Neo, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy, we hope a real change that our country has so much needed.
After 81 years without power, the PRI was published in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
The member of the Olvera Congress admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party concerning Enrique Pena Nono.
He rejects the criteria of opposers that respond to the new President of lacking charism.
It's a whole, very delicate man, with a excellent vision of the country.
He's an excellent State man and, above all, he knows to listen.
However, it is not always the image that they have the people of their old ruler.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known under the name of Neza, the contrast with the streets of the Bravo Valley could not be more flagrant.
Cacheed under the author's autoposts, it is, in fact, a ban of the city of Mexico.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Before the year, military forces were called to rescue to combat drug trafficking in the villages, and women's violence is particularly serious.
In a synthesis zone, 10 women killed during the last two years have been found in decades.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was a leader, a higher rate than in the very violent city of Juarez - a tristely famous place for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Mr. Pena Neo, the detractors said that he was better not able to enhance the problem of murdering against women when he was in charge.
In the worst, they accused his administration to refuse to see the reality in face.
In a beton house, typical of this deployed neighborhood, Irinea Buendia fighting to keep his dreams when she shows me photos of her defunte daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version has been made of a suspect committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family thinks she was killed by her partner.
"When I came to her, he seemed that his body was washed," says Mrs. Buendia.
Signs indicated that she had been shot, and the body rigidity was already loved.
While his mother tells the story, a photo of Maryna puts the wall, next to a crowd where the word is: Justice.
However, it was exactly what the family had been rejected.
The authorities treated me as if I was an old competitive, a craft of trouble, a lamentation.
They want to accept what they're saying and we're going on.
"But it is not normal that there are so much irregularities and emissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto will receive its saint exhibition, it will be a huge responsibility.
Decades of thousands of families were affected by the crime in Mexico in the past six years and the new President made the promise he would have made its priority during his mandate.
"I hope he will be so good as President as when he was manager," said Olvera, in the Bravo Valle of the Bravo, a member of the Congress.
However, it is exactly what the families of the victims of the city of Neza fear the most.
Bradley Manning did not complain from bad treatments, they explain the prosecutors.
Prosecutors tried to counter against maltracy remedies which Bradley Manning would have been victimed during detention.
The proceedings focused on Manning detention in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
Defence wants to classify the cause that Manning sequestration has been made in extremely difficult circumstances.
The soldier is convicted to put thousands of confidential documents.
The prosecutors tried to demonstrate, Friday, that Bradley Manning soldier -- accused to be originally the largest fought of confidential information of all the history of the American Army -- has missed many opportunities to complain from the bad treatment he was intended to have undertaken in his military detention.
During a questionnaire with Manning, during a preliminary hearing at Ft. Meade, Maryland, Procureur Maj. Ashden Fein stated that a weekly visit records made to Maning by officers for nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia had not revealed any complaints on his treatment.
The questionary -- during a hearing, the defence introduced a request for the case maning to be classified by the reason that Sequence has been made in very difficult circumstances and has made sufficiently severe punishment -- a day after maning had signed his desire to subsequent himself during his detention.
The Military Research Analysis, arrested in June 2010, was convicted that thousands of confidential documents were deployed during its service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never confirmed that Manning was their source.
During the Friday hearing, Fein considered with Manning the forms that officers had filled after their meetings with Manning during his detention in the Military Military of Quantico, where he was submitted to a maximum carcerial island from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked questions to Manning and made his answers.
When Fein said to the formers, Friday, Manning recognized that the treatment that his guards had retained was "excellent" and that the treatment he had in the prison was "excellently professional."
Formularies do not state any complaint for wrong treatment, although officials had asked it directly about its carcell treatment, Fein said.
Maning responded that he had been orally expressed concerning certain problems and that the visitors had discussed its concerns and indicated that they would be occupied, but they did not constitute the problems addressed.
"They have written "no problem" (such as they had discussed concerns), and so much, it didn't mean I hadn't argued problems," said Manning.
The military judge Col. Denise Lind also asked for Manning why he had not been denied of his treatment in January 2011 with the Special Committee, which was meeting to discuss the subsequent thoughts he had expressed written a few months before.
Maning answered that his intention during the meeting was to modify its restrictive status, indicated a "risk of wounding".
The military stated that they had assigned the restrictive status - a level under the monitoring of the risk of suicide - for their protection and security of others.
"I wanted the staff to know that I'd go well, and I wanted to take this status... to benefit from a better quality of life of my view," said Manning.
Maning tested Thursday on his arrest to Iraq and its transfer to Koweït, where he was detained for about two months before being transferred to the military prison of the Mariness Corps to Quantico, Virginia, July 2010.
He said that he was in Kuwait and was disappeared once because of warming.
He added that the fact that it was not understood what he was going to happen to him or what happened in the rest of the world was very exciting.
"My world was driving to Camp Arafjon, to this cage," said Manning, Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this kitchen.
Once in Quantico, Manning said he was the most clearest of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Maning also added that the only objects that he had were a mass, a cover, tongs, clothes and moons.
He tried to stay in move, because to sleep or stay along the day was contrary to the regulation.
Maning also explained that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, allged outside his cell.
If the guards didn't see his face when he returned the night, they wake up so that they could see his face.
Maning's lawyer presented a formal complaint for treatments held by Manning in January 2011.
Maning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, April 2011.
On Thursday also, the judge made questions to Manning concerning an allegation reported in his Thursday witness -- that afterwards had been forced to sleep all night in his cell in Quantico, it was forced to keep the guards and others kept a morning during the call.
Maning said that at any time, he was not allowed to cover up with a cover during the call.
During the questions of the judge, Friday, Manning said that he had taken out the order of his guard that he had to leave his cover that could hide his nakedness, but he recognized that no one had commanded him to lay.
Maning tested Thursday that he was forced to sleep now last night, because he would have tried to prove a officer that he was not a danger for himself.
Maning would have declared the officer that he could use the elastic of his slip or his tons to curse, but he didn't do it.
In that night, Manning tested that his sub-vestments, his tons, and his lunchs were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he has experienced during his detention and that he would considerably reduce his sentence if he should be condemned in the presence of a marriage court, a proceeding which should be held in the beginning of the next year.
The Defence stated that Manning was intended to impose crimes less serious and to combat other charges played too extremely.
The hearing should take this weekend with prosecutors who should argue that the detention conditions were justified.
Pentagone confirmed that Manning was incarned in accordance with the Regulation which recruits the conditions of detention of all detainees in Quantico.
Chiefs of accused against Manning include the flight of public goods or documents, the collection with the enemy, giving the illegal publication of Internet information, and the transmission of information on national defence.
If all chapters of accusation are retained, the criminal exclusion is to be permanent.
But an identical crisis of mexico America
He said that many were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities.
The Mexicons have tend to blow those who are left; they remember the difficult periods, said he.
Navarrette says that the Mexican Americans will be taken between two worlds.
In the recent trip to Mexico, coming to the hall, before the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Similar panels indicated two ways: one for the "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), one for the "Extranjeros" ("Etrangers").
I stayed in a few seconds, not knowing what file I'm leaving.
I grew up in the centre of California, where I was called "Mexicain" all my life.
It's an ethnic qualification, in the same way as my friends of Boston use when they say "Irish" or my friends of New York when they call "italians".
Then I became "Mexico-American".
But here, it was Mexico.
And, on the earth that has seen born my grandfather, no need of special qualification or union trade.
I was just a American.
I speak Spanish, quite well enough to manage interview in one or another language.
But I don't have an autochtone vocabulary, and I can't lose my American attitude.
Then I took my American passport and I turned me to the "Etrangers".
I thought at this time of the week when the new President Enrique Pena Nono visited President Obama, in the House-Blanche.
Generally, when leaders of these two countries meet, their prediction issues are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also desired to speak about the growth of the Mexico economy, which is one of the reasons that make the Mexico to stay in Mexico rather than risk to the United States.
He wished to join the United States and Canada and create a Union for trade on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto engaged to continue the war against drug cards in Mexico, although he had no more details provided.
The relationship with the United States is combined and filled with aircraft.
Most Americans have probably never thought that in 1848, the United States have shocked the Mexico and forced his leaders to write the half of their territory at the point of the flower.
But for the Mexicans, who think in terms of age, and not for minutes, the memories are everywhere.
Therefore, since a U.S. official formulas the less critical regarding Mexico, you're starting to hear -- at the Mexican pressure, and among the elections -- complaints on how the Americans cause the sovereignty of their neighbourhood.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for bathroom.
And yet, for Mexico, the most difficult relationship is that the country shared with more than 35 million of Mexico living in the United States.
Do you want us to address the issue of the aircraft?
There's a lot.
Mexico has its winners and losses, persons for which the country offers opportunities and others for which the country does not offer it.
The only reason that explains the large number of mexicans in towns such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at a time, in our genealogic tree, a person, may be a parent or a great, has found no opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the north.
And most often, this person corresponded to a type of profile -- a fountained hair, little teaching, such as a poor village, etc.
We are their seeds, and we are faithful to them.
Not Mexico.
And even though we live now the American dream, we've gone into good schools and we have good situations, we never have to lose see that it's the American dream that we live, and not the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes corrupted, but our truth is evident.
We agree it to the United States.
In addition, we know that a part of the mexican elite between the leading class does not like us.
The feeling is reciprocal.
We remind them of a humble disaster and they touch us as if we were lower sweet individuals and not sufficiently mexican.
Our Spanish will never be enough, our links with Mexico will never be enough strong.
For them, our existence is a synonym of exchange.
If our families hadn't failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never leave.
And we would not find us involved in the good side of the bathroom, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My woman who was born in Guadalajara and who has legally emigrated into the United States while she was a child, remembers that there are flowers between the Mexico and the Mexico, because Mexico are more stronger than their identity and the Mexico.
Although she is American citizen, she has feelings to become part of two countries.
Furthermore, many of the Mexico I know have no impression to make part of a country or other.
We adorn the music of the Mexican Group, Les Tigre del North but also of Bruce Springsteen.
We've got the best of the two worlds, but we're not racisted in any of the two.
In Mexico, we're thinking like Americans.
And in the United States, we are considered as Mexico.
And now, to comply a little more of the relationship, as I learned it during my stay, some Mexican leaders and a part of the intelligentsia wants to approach Diaspora.
They want Mexico to work as a fellow ambassador for Mexico, representing their interests to the United States.
We should explain to our American partners that Mexico is a great country that absolutely needs to visit and put pressure to political leaders to strengthen links with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
That won't happen.
There's too much amertum.
And, if we consider the inégalité of salary, corruption and drug violence that are all present, many of us are not convinced that it is a fantastic country.
You're gonna want to break you alone, friends.
It's normal.
If some Mexico are not yet ready to forgive the United States for how they have treated Mexico a half and a half years ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexico are still looking for their family members as well as they have been treated.
Hmmmm.
Maybe we were more "Mexicans" than I didn't think it.
Queens, New Middle East
The stopfee between Israel and Hamas is still an echo for peace.
Will there never be a sustainable peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another blood emotion seems to indicate that such hope is vain.
As they continued the same strong arguments to know who started, ten buildings were reduced in powder; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelians were killed; and for the first time the rocks taken from Gaza were shot near Tel Aviv, Israel's metropol, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, although Israel and Palestinians seem to be blocked in their former conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full mutation.
The Arab pressure has made all flights, and the Palestinians and the Israelites are ratified by this regional bottlement.
Maybe their fight will become a little more intensified.
However, there are all reasons to think that this could help them out of this death impairment.
A war that makes no loss nor any winner
First, it seems to be difficult to prove optimism.
Even though the stop-le-feu granted on 21 November remains, the battle of this week strengthened force partners, both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamic movement directed to Gaza since 2007, will be forced to leave Israel, even if Gaza has been a removal.
Although he killed some of his leaders and refusaled the 1,7 million people in Gaza in one of the most miserable and overployed coins of the planet, Israel has not succeeded to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas gains the landscape on the Cisjordania, the other part of the Palestinian currently in the hands of their Rivers of Fatah, the most moderate Palestinian fations.
Furthermore, the leaders of the Hamas could say that time was joined to them.
The influence of the Arabian islamists in the world is stronger, and Hamas made rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a full shelter regional power, sometimes the most closest musulman ellips of Israel, has taken and caused Hamas; as the Kathar, one of the most rich and dynamic states in the Golf.
The members of the Hamas jubileate and say that the Islamist believer run around Israel from Lebanon, in the north, where the Hezbollah military makes his domination, through Syria, where the islamist rebels can turn Bashar El Assad, and until Jordan, where Hamas was threatening the king.
And the most important, on the southern flow of Israel, the mount of the Muslim Frères under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the disappearance that ruled Egypt for 30 years until his punishment in 2011, had little time to celebrate in Hamas.
Together, the Muslim Frères are friends of Hamas, and their leaders are easier to the public opinion.
In the future diplomacy, Hamas can argue as an important actor that could not be excluded even by Israel and America.
During that time, Israel's hard line will bring the reverse conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was sent to a box.
The Iron Dome interception system has proved its effectiveness and many Hamas missions have been destroyed.
The Israelites will be able to sleep on their two ears for a certain time.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its undefectable support, and many European countries have tried to Hamas to be originating the last vague of violence.
But mostly, Israel has continued, including Binyamin Netanyahu, the first Minister, who has fully ignored the peace process.
Although Gaza's rockets had killed approximately 30 Israeli since 2004, Israel has been disappeared by suicide attracts, including through the settlement bathroom in the Czech Jordan, the main part of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects the Jewish colonies who continue to extend, despite their international law illness.
Mr. Netanyahu, whose Part Likud has combined with a more wonderful party, the leader Avigdor Lieberman at the approach of the election of 22 January, has the beautiful part.
Why do these Palestinian fishes give them a state?
If they would lead the Czech Jordan, wouldn't they lay rockets, like their partners did it in Gaza?
It's preferable to keep them behind this wall and struck them since they get out of their head.
Maybe the parties of the dure line will import it; but it may change the Arab printings to the woman.
Even though the islamists who take the power in Egypt and otherwise appreciate little Israel, their priority will be to address problems in their own country.
The Israeli Defence budget is more important than that of its four Arab neighbors gathered.
Starting war with local superpowerance will not assist the new Arab governments to arrange their economy.
Mr. Morsi worked with Barack Obama to get a stop-le-feu that's a good warrant -- and he could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelites should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world that becomes more democratic, pray the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a pool that is intended to explose one day in the territories occupied by Israel - a little like the bus which explosed to Tel-Aviv this week.
The repression has already disastrous the democracy in the Jewish state, and the demography extracts this problem as a result of increased Arab population.
Blood missions against Gaza every two or three years to sound the Hamas will have a price on the diplomatic plan.
The two sides need to be pushed by those outdoors.
The response remains that by reasonable persons on every side, and by most of the outer world and by this magazine: two states, with a territorial movement by Israel in exchange of security.
A little and short-term hope is that the stop-the-feu will give the opportunity to the outside persons to defend this cause.
Egypt, which is now expected to end the movement of weapons to Gaza, in the same way as Turkey and Qatar, is better placed than ever to convince Hamas to accept a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land trades and a shared Jerusalem.
Foreign Arabs should also be pressed on Hamas and the Fatah to assemble.
This would contribute to the creation of a Palestinian state more than the next proposal of a pseudo state to the United Nations.
Mr. Obama also has all interest in what Israel agrees to negotiate.
During his first mandate, he did not present its own peace plan.
Return to the House-Blanche, it seems also resistance to establish one.
It's a very depressed vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital jewel for America.
This is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
The laws for neutral cigarette packages are entered into Australia
Averages and photographs of sick organisms recover the dark green packages that are all identical, whatever the mark
This Act entered into force is a first worldwide, logos and colours were replaced by a dark green oil and horryable photographs of sick organisms and child representations whose diseases were caused by the tabagisme of their parents.
Outside the various photos and health warnings, the only difference between packages since summer is the name of the brand, printed in small characters on all packages.
This is the most strict regime in the world in relation to tabaking.
The Federal Government of Australia said that the goal was to dissuing young people to smoke by removing any glamour representation.
Studies have shown that if people haven't started fuming before 26 years old, there are 99% of chances that never start.
"Même when they are very young, children understood the message of tabac producers through their brand image," said the Federal Minister of Health, Tanya Pluberse, focusing on studies that have revealed, for example, that children had the core of a logo to a prince."
Even though Australia has the lowest rate of tabagism in the world and if these changes have only little impact on the benefits of multinationals, other countries consider an similar development.
Tobacco industry did pressure against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said that it would refer to the black market trade, which will make it easier access to less chryer cigarettes.
"The Negative Consequences of this legislation," said Scott McIntyre, of the British American Tobacco Australia.
The Chinese and Indonesian fausers will sell more contraffset cigarettes on the streets of Australia.
Others said that this law had denied their activities.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the request for cygarettes, including in silicone to mass the terrible embarrassements, increased a few months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco made the law and lost before Australia's high core.
He stated that Zico had sold 6,000 to huge systems and is waiting for the renewment of stock.
The business is good for us.
The only weak, saying experts, is the popularity of social media and the trafficking of population designed by the plan.
After a series of laws prohibiting TV advertisements, sports sponsory and the obligation to dissumer cygarettes, the tabing market is currently available online.
Australia has prohibited publicity on the web by enterprises and local sites, but it cannot prevent foreign sites to do it.
"If you're working in the tabak marketing and you're just a small vitrine to promote your products, the Internet is the unconturnable place by excellence," said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at Sydney University.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some lambda citizens in favour of social media marks such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We need to ask whether this is a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who has been made the difficulty to make a video, or whether it is an orcean marketing campaign?
The British American Tobacco Australia said that the industry focused on the new regulation rather than marketing.
The industry has gone to pay Ukrainian, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to address these new justice decisions - said to the WHO that trade is unfairly disagreed, although none of these countries had been important trade trade with Australia.
A WTO decision should be taken in the course of 2013.
Moreberse said that the Government had held discussions with other countries regarding similar laws on emblems.
Canada was the first country to make an avertising photographs in 2001.
These warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The most serious laws are currently studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
Photos don't hurt me.
I'm gonna ignore them.
"You take a cigarette and split the package," said Victor El Hage at the time to buy a package on which contains a tumor photo.
To be franchise, the only reason you're gonna stop me, it's my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Tobacconist Pack" in Sydney centre, said that embarrassing uniform is difficult to make the scope of packages on the stages.
"Forward, I needed a hour to download a cold, now, I need four hours," said Yu.
"The government only had to prohibite them a good time for all, and we would have said OK, it's good, stop and put the key under the door," he added, leaning the arms into the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to swear.
I've been five hours in a airport during the period of thanksgiving, because our aircraft had mechanical problems and we had to wait for the arrival of another airport.
So I had enough time to think about the neighbourtheme.
I'm not going to lie to you.
Paste a half day in a airport to wait for a flight is enough nice, even when you have books, magazines and iPhons to disaster you (unless forget the deity-free boats).
But further, some university and specialized experts in the development of the child are the weakness of the child.
It's perfectly normal for us and our children, to spend timely, they say.
This forces the brain to impose interesting ways, even though to dinner creativity.
And as we, for most, continually before several kinds of screens, we don't know the well-beings of the whole.
So, should we accept the nest with open arms?
Yeah.
And not.
But I'll come back.
First of all, at the end of many people, I thought that the nice was a very recent phenomenon, including since we have more time.
But that's not the case, says Peter Toohey, professor of history at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
"He's very far away," said he.
On the walls of Pompéi contain Latin graffiti that evoke the ennui, they rise to the first century.
Then there is a definition that we give to the enemy.
The problem is that it has been defined, and in different ways, he said John D. Eastwood, professor authorized psychology to the University of York in the Institute, Canada.
Following many publications and the idea of an approximately 100 people's discussion group, Professor Eastwood and its colleagues have defined the kernel as a experience that is "a want to do something but without going to start in a satisfactory activity."
What differencies the neighbouring of the apathy, said, is that the person is not in the way to undertake a task as well as it would.
With the apathy, he said, there is no desire to do anything.
What is in the heart of the neighbour, has he said, is "the interruption of the attention process, linked to a smooth humor and the feeling that the time passes slowly."
Annue can strongly look like a depression.
But professor Eastwood said that if both are able to be bound, people who do not have to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while the depressed persons think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes, it's going to think that we're enthusiasm while it's a problem of concentration.
In the framework of their study, "The Unngaged Mind: Definition Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues have shown an elderly experience in which the participants listed on the case, the voice of a person in training to read a magazine article.
Some groups have heard, in the coming from the next room, its too high TV emission that had no report, others just heard the TV emission, and the third group did not hear the band.
Those who heard the TV at a lower sound level said they were more naked than the two other groups - they had no doubt to concentrate, but they didn't know why, and they assigned this problem of concentration to the noon.
When you try to concentrate on a difficult or involved task, an interruption of attention may lead to the summer, said J. Fenske, a authorized professor of neuroscience to the University of Guelph in the Institute and one of the authors of the study.
Furthermore, when you do a nice task, "as watching objects on a mount chain, the music can help you not renew you."
In fact, he says, today we know that when we are tortured or we are pressed, these steeps, often considered as an enemy sign, are a good way to remain more physically warrant.
"These studies showed that children who are authorised to manage more and have more information than those who are forced to stay without movement," said Professor Fenske.
We're moving every day or the other - the late of my aircraft, a locutor with a monocorde voice, a particularly nice movie.
But some people are more likely to hurt themselves than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a "predisposition School" in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "Parm the tasks I do, many of them are reprehensible and monotones," and "I have so much interest centres that I don't have time to do all."
In using such a scale, researchers discovered that boys were tending to shoot more often than girls, Stephen Vodanovich said, a psychological professor at West Florida University, and in particular needs many and different stimulations.
But in general adolescents are fast blame.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a individual and Community development professor at the University of Illinois, conducted a experience during which he contacted about 400 adolescents and their parents seven to eight times daily through a beeper.
He pointed out that 32 percent of adolescents would explain to the school and during their debts at the house, while 23 percent would explain to be damage when they were not at school.
On the other hand, 3 percent of the parents said to swear.
Professor Larson said that he didn't know if the percentages of today, or 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that " youth is a period where the nice reached its highest level" in particular because children and adolescents do not have much control on what they want to do.
If I ask my question, is it good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can lead people to take absurd physical risks, make pars or abuse some substances to pass the time, as the studies show it.
In fact, many philosopowers and writers refer to a link between the new and the creativity, said professor Vodanovich, who studies the problem for more than two decades.
"The whole is the way the brain found to make you know that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology to the N.Y.U..
But the brain doesn't always know what the most appropriate thing to do.
If you're wearing and useing this energy to play the guitare and cut, it will make you happy.
But if you look at the TV, it will make you happy at short term, but not to long term.
So if your kid is nervous and you give a iPad, it wouldn't be naked, but he won't have to learn to take care of anybody alone or to self-register, professor Fenske says.
And "these is authorizedly passing from a situation to another," said he.
Your child is not just learning to disappoint, but it's getting more master of himself in other areas.
I don't think we should glorify the neck.
Like I don't think it's just that we should criticize him.
It feels that it feels like that outside the constant bottlement that generated activities and technology is the goal to which we need to be thrown.
Professor Eastwood is agreed on this point.
"We need to shoot more often, but the nest eyes an enormous and fresh desire to be connected to something that has a sense," said he.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to deconnect and appreciate the time of stop.
"In a environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated," he added, "is difficult to find ways to start in something when the voice stops."
In Colorado, no directive for the new Marihuana Law
Anthony Orozco, 19 years, student in a Colorado university and foot player, is included for something that will happen soon in his state: marijuana's ownership and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and some friends were in the midst of a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with the Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a citation to compare to drug and material in order to serve its consumption - minor crimes, each compliance with an amendment of $100 - and a comparison date.
"We are treated as criminals," Mr. Orozco said.
But is he one?
During the weeks of uncertainty followed by Colorado ' s vote to legitimate the consumption of small marijuanas for personal use, the response provided to hundreds of cases involved low drug use, depends on the place than the law.
There and in Washington's state, which has adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involved by marijuana use have been used without further.
Police services have stopped involving adults from 21 years and more for minor possession of marijuana because the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
But the procurors in the most conservative circumscriptions of Colorado have called to accelerate existing marijuana affairs and continue to educate those in place.
Parallus, several cities of Denver's banks are currently voted to the mountains of the West to prevent the opening of marijuana sales trades accepted by the State in their villages.
"The things are evolving so fast that I don't know what we're booking the future," said Daniel J. Oates, Chief of the Aurora police in the east of Denver.
The Washington State regulatory organizations also have no doubts.
They are investigating directives on how to install a delivery system, allowing the production, manufacture, distribution and sale before the date of goods of 1 December 2013.
They say that the Colorado, which will be seen or not, is progressed on most of the marijuana regulations, first of all regards the use of therapeutical purposes and now in relation to personal use.
"The Colorado to a more regulated market, and represents a good indicator," said Brian E. Smith, a Port-Sort of Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, recognized Mr. Smith, can't do any more than suggest what happens.
"There is no previous reality on which we could be based, said he.
The Washington Act, named I-502, takes effect on 6 December, which leaves a legal vacuum of a year, during which the authorisation system will not always exist, while marijuana ownership will be legal.
During this time, practical questions remain in suspension: how to balance the status mandate that guarantees appropriate access to the authorized marijuana and prohibites the installation of cannabis sales trade in a radiation of 30 km around a school, a park, a game area or a crises.
"There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to install a pleasant sale of cannabis, including in the metropolitan area of Seattle," said Ben Livingston, a portfolio of the Cannabis legalization centre, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, Oates, the police head of Aurora sent an e-mail to his officers to announce that the "Actorney City" (Public Representative) would no longer continue the 21-year-old persons and who have little marijuana amounts, and that the police should stop inventing persons for this kind of disaster.
The Chapter Oates stated that the police would apply new justice decisions that regulate the activities of marijuana for medical purposes and that it would continue to continue drug trafficking and dealers.
In Weld County, in the north of Colorado, the "attorney" (Prosecutor of the Republic), Ken Buck, has a closer vision.
After the vote, he stated that his office would continue to take care of marijuana ownership, mainly in order to press on users to desintoxize.
At present, 119 persons are inculted from the possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other incultions.
"Our office has the obligation to engage in persecution against those who have committed a crime in fact was a recognised crime," said Mr. Buck.
Reactions have been complicated even in Russian places such as Mesa County, where the voters rejected the initiative for limited marijuana consumption.
The police in Grand Junction, the largest city of the comit, is no longer comparing additionals for the possession of limited quantities.
The representative of the Public Minister of the Comitation, Pete Hautziner, supported this decision, but also decided not to classify all marijuana detention cases without effect.
"I have no impression to lose my time to continue to apply the law until she changes," said he.
Although 55 per cent of the voters of Colorado have supported the measure, an appropriate legal and government framework for marijuana personal consumption was not adjusted.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in various American cities have cleared the deep ambiguity among local officials in relation to marijuana legitimation.
"There is a cultural barrier" with the representatives of the Public Minister, Sean McAllister, a lawyer of Denver, who represents the accused of marijuana consumption and expresses as a local parliament of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (National Organization for the Reform of Marriouana Laws).
"They have passed a good part of their life to continue in justice of those who consumed Marjuana, too, to accept that it is legal," said he.
As the first states to treat marijuana restricted consumption at the same level as the alcohol, the Colorado and the Washington status are in pass to become a case of jurisprudence for drug legitimation.
While defenders and representatives of the State provide a new border of legal sales, they are concerned about the directives of the Federal Government, which always conceal the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
Defenders of the legalization of marijuana hope that the Ministry of Justice should be held.
Despite some mediated arrests from patients under the seajuana therapeutical and sales, the Federal Government has allowed Marjuana sales trade for therapeutical purposes to carry out in Colorado, Washington and in 16 other states.
If it is true that the police will probably not focus the doors to take small drug bags, it is strongly acknowledged that it is opposed to marijuana trade-related to personal use authorized by new laws, Kevin A. Sabet, an old Obama Administration Adviser, said.
Many cities in Colorado have not been waiting for the Federal Authorities.
Before the votes, some local administrations adopted moratorys on the creation of new marijuana sales trade, even if it is only one year's report.
The last week, the city of Montrose has obtained a moratory of 6 months, and should impose this prohibition next week.
"We don't want to find us in a situation where a permission is granted to someone and then find us faced with a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal advice.
Our community has voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than in the vote of the State.
A lot of questions is made.
Peternella Wyatt: I was mad and excluded from Oxford, because I was a "Tory" (conservatory).
These are not only the students of today who are attacked for their opinions.
So far as I remember, I've always tried to go to the University of Oxford.
My father and my elderly brother studied in what it was for me to know, a kind of Greek Amphitheater of modern times that stimulates the two pills of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I was installed in Worcester College at the end of the 1980s to study the story, I decided to do my valises, provocing the first scandal of my life.
My dad came out and wept.
My friends were disappointed.
The Evening Standard journal said I had left this university, because I had objected the fact that students of the first cycle had sexual relations in the room next to me.
Author A. N. Wilson said with a fax that I was a party after I had been forced to drink in bottled cups.
The truth was less funny.
I'm gone.
Yeah, I was away, because I was victim of intimidations and made an object of constant brimadies.
Not because of my name, rather extraordinary, nor because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for a single and unique reason, and in this beauty of the self-defender, I was victim of a racist and barbear behaviour: my father's regretty, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influenced advice of Margaret Tacher and I was a party of the Conservator Party.
Why to say this today, you'll tell me.
And well, recent studies have shown that a new generation of centre students undermined the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutional hatred of Tory students in Oxford is such as last week, some of them have resulted in protection of their rights, as well as gay persons with disabilities and ethnic minorities.
The members of the students room (JCR) of the Christ College said they were "isolated, personally attacked and feeled inseparable" because of their political opinions.
They want a representative within the University Committee for Equality of chances to be expressed freely.
Their situation was not easily facilitated by the recent document on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The country of wonders: Jeunes, intelligents and driving"), dedicated to the policy of students, and which overlooked the "Tories" such as excentrics and neonazians.
The student Joe Cooke, the former President of the Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA) was found, which moves to Rolls-Royce, a complete silver and moves with a chromic head canal.
In other universities, conservatory students say to be treated as emitted burdens for the establishment of the growth of education costs."
Luke Black, 20 years old, Vice-President of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association", said to a daily newspaper " that there's a leaving party in universities.
People think that we're like the Bullingdon Club without even met us."
Samuel Roberts, a 21-year-old student in history at the Corpus of Christ, who proposed a motion for more protection, said that such climate is "unfortunate," and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years, President of the OUCA, said that there was a deterioration of the attitude of the members of JCR with respect to the center persons.
"It is an injury to the freedom of intellectual discussions and to the well-being of members," said she.
I was the only one to think about this in my first weeks in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, I was 18 years old and a paralysing terrorism.
The hatred of the conservator party was very virulent.
In the previous year, the University had vowed to agree to Margaret Thatcher - an old student - a honorable title, because of the reduction of the funding of higher studies.
Atmosphere was charged by stalin vibrations.
Since the first days of the week of accommodation, when the new students had known with others and teachers, I had a pre-good of what would happen next.
I found that the professors were not only involved in the Sarcasms to the students of Tory, but they took it with pleasure.
It was as if the policy on green minors, privatization and opposition of the government to sanctions against the apartheid in South Africa was decreased in the wood of classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was victimed concerning a translation to English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared there.
"Miss Wyatt", said professor Harry Pitt (learning died), "for example, translate the first paragraph"
I've lost my feet.
Pitt, a little man on a push face, was easily captured.
"Is this that the Czechrists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?" he asked.
The other students have relaxed.
The laughter would burn my eyes.
"I suggest you to take French courses during your free time - finally, if you're not too busy to make you friends," he started from one of your garden.
I'm back to my room, unconsolidable.
At dinner there, I sat alone, then I felt a light shot on my ball.
It was a second student in English study year named James, who was presented as a member of the OUCA.
"I know who you are," said he, gently.
I'm so afraid it's like this.
Every person suspected to be a Tory (conservator) is taken for target.
It's pretty hard for me, but they know that your father's nigh to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be more hard for you.
Most of the young Tory will be workers (travaillists).
Later, at the local pub, I missed tried to hide me.
I stressed that I wasn't agreed with all that Mrs. Thatcher said.
This rating failed.
One student in the first year of philosophia, political and economic sciences who, ironically studied in Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a fascist porc."
You're contained.
Another students have retained the refreshment.
I was supervisor, sale.
"How do the Tories do love?" asked one of them.
They hit each other, isn't it?"
I feel like homosexuals before the law of the sixty-year-old years.
I could only have done a normal life in Oxford?
Did I have been forced to meet people shared the same view points only after the night fall?
Do I have to become the job and resolve my opinions?
In the coming three years, they would like an ostracym and isolation purgatory.
The only open teacher Tory was Norman Stone, modern history professor who teached in my university.
He was desperated not only because he was a conservator, but also because he was advising in external policy of Cecher and one of the authors of his talking.
He's almost never been there.
He described this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its accession to the marxis-determinist view of the history.
In 1997, he accepted a teacher at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I began to make the boat between Oxford and my parents' house in London, found refugees at my family and my friends with more open spirit citadins.
I told my dad that I denied Oxford and I explained him why.
He was incredible.
During its studies in Oxford, in the forty-year-olds, all political view points were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said to me, "but it's the best place in the world."
They wouldn't do this, not in the city to the dreams.
Even my communist friends had in vain ways.
He had the laughings in his eyes.
Let them a chance.
I'm sure it's to touch you.
That would be my heart if you'd leave Oxford.
My frequencies traveled to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, also succeeded the pressure and refused his convictions.
During a work meeting held next week, when another history teacher suggested the most seriously of the world, that I was an enemy of the people, I decided to do so much.
Innerly hontly, I admitted to be victim of my parents' brain washing and treated them with "four fountain".
The receipt was short.
It's my dad who pushed the last bullet of my oxygen.
At that time, he wrote two columns in the Murdoch pressure every week.
My door was stolen.
I stayed tapped in my room, and after five minutes, my followers left.
When they're gone, I made my valley and I took the first train for London.
I never came back there.
You can handle me with a mooded plotnichard pool.
But no 18-year-old should be victim of such intimidation in a school institution.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which has not only produced 14 first ministers of Tory, but also benefited from an inherent reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers the election to notorite"
ABC asked Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous Italian couture clients in the context of the exhibition “Valentina: a Master of the Couture”.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elisabeth Ire d'Angleterre, is the only place of the British capital worthy to accommodate an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
He recognized him during the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of la Couture", a prerespective retrospective that gathered more than 130 high cottage models created for his home in the past 50 years.
"I love this palace," said he with his inimitable Italian accent.
This exhibition is the point of an orgue of a story whose only protagonist is "the Lord" Garavani, but that could not be written without his hungry customers.
Valentino has always been excited by the closed world and part of the nobleness.
In the first room of this exhibition, opened until 3 March, there is an impressioning number of private letters and photographs signed by the crome of the aristocracy, since the Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, passed by the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret de England.
Valentino explains his personal memories such as the trophites of its social ascension: the modest quarter of the city of Voghera, north of Italy, at the image of the international jetset.
There's nothing wrong to love the queen.
"Of less, they don't exclude their mess of cigarettes on your great shoes like they do some stars of the pop music," says the Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza barone.
In the 60 and 70 years, we both lived in the Alpes and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegantity.
"We are all invited to be invited to his Gstaad chalet," explains the former female of "Heini" Thysen, an impotent love of the past time like Marella Agnelli or Niarchos Eugenia.
Valentino has always prefered the notorial election.
And even so, he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, holding a Valentino model
Silver Mannequin, Valeria Mazza, hasn't forgotten the charming of the carriers.
A few years ago, after a problem on the place of Spain, we went to dinner at his apartment.
We were 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his mind in each detail of his apartment, in decoration, food, music.
"Over him, every invitation felt important and appreciated," remembered the "top model", which began to work with him during the week of the High Couture in Paris in 1995.
"It will never pass a mode, because its creations are art works," it ends.
Defile of noblese-limitation
Garavani's life is not a story of obsessions but of shared love.
He loves good people and with the greatest titles and they also love it.
One of the gallerys of Samrset House was transformed in a glass podium of sixty-millar podium that offers exchange of roles: the visitor takes the place of mannachis and needs to difficult on the podium to admire a "public" dream with the main creatures of Valentino, such as the size that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for his marriage with Aristote Onassis, the costum that brought Monica Vitti in the "La Notte", or a dream in the laine and cubrary manteau that had been the farmer Farah Diba.
Among this public of mannequins, names are found like Luxembourg Sybille, Gloria from Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit de Norway, the Rosario de Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Kitarian in 2006
Many of his customers say that the first Valentino clothes are like the first love, "not to forget."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pantalon, a chemise, a "gilet" gilet and a clothing of the automne collection in 1971-1972.
"It's a gift he made me," said Naty Abascal, one of the museums of the carrier.
"I prefer it to all others for his femaleness, his great love of women, and because he is high of our beauty," add the former Feria.
I appreciate the colours it's used, they're lighting and lighting the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The prince and moderate Patricia of the Jovampaol d'Arenberg can, no longer forget the first time she brought a Valentine model.
When she was adolescent and lived in Italy, she revealed that she had the age and the opportunity to carry one of his night robes...
Finally, it was possible to end the 1990s.
I bought my first model Valentino for a party in my neighbor's chamber, the Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red clothes, with a flower jacket, a draped buss and a falling disappear.
"It was a dream becomes real," said the widow of Rodrigue d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is infringent to the mode, it is obliged by the timely," explains the Italian aristocratic that shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The Princess of Arenberg keeps the night's skills with "the greatest care, because a night roof is not only a roof, it is also all the memories that it is a vehicle".
The "roi" of the mode
The great end of the exhibition of Samrset House is the marriage robe of Marie-Chantal Miller ported during her marriage with Paul of Greece in 1995.
There had four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the quarter called his carriers) to realize this shot in ivroes with perles includements, twelve sorts of different dents and a tray of four metres and half.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the upper authority of the specialized presse, this royal represents a historical fact of the end of the twentieth century, "the return of the clients of the high society".
Obnubilated for years by the "being" of the nobleness, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the largest distinction in Italy), Labour Cavaliere, Commander of the Order of Arts and Lestres, decreased from the Legion d'Honneur, Garavani as well as any wife of his customers.
"They are reaffirming, his quiet, his so-called and perfect aspect have always seen in the eyes," he recognized Arenberg.
The last time I saw it, it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum of Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of the Jacqueline of Ribes, one of my great friends.
"He was unable, the years have no effect on him."
If it's a princess who tells him...
The hardest mixture of the world: the human mulls of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the Indian volcanian ports risk their life and health by making 70 kilometres of sugar through scarped stone paths.
There are people for whom work is a wealth and others working literally.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 young men who win their life by bringing the soup of the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the foundation of the carrier, where the sufuric gas emerging from the earth's entrances will be solidified at the air contact.
After collapsed large softer rocks, which are totally about 70 kilometres, he installs them in two bamboo's pools which he charges on his shocks through the shocked roads.
There are only 250 metres to the top of the volcane that colms to 2.386 meters of height, but weared portors put more than 40 minutes to grow this distance, to a painting heat, keeping the balance and measurement of their steps so that they don't trigger and fall into the precipitation.
They know that a false could cost them life, as it happened to a French tourist who made a dead punishment in Kawah Ijen a few years ago.
The men of Kawah Ijen win 5 cents of euro for each kilo of sufre exit.
Once in the top, it was a way between tourists that photographed them as if they were beasts of circle, and pennably turning the harms of the panier, they walked 3 kilometers until the balance that a minor society has installed a little in contrast to 1,850 meters of highness.
This is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that operates the volcano since 1960 and, as well, its employees, which pays 662 in Indonesian ropes (5 cents of euros) per kilometre.
It sells it to 100,000 ropes (83 hundreds of euro) in the petrochem industry because this mine is very present in the daily life and is used to manufacture bulgies, braking fires, cosmetics, dynamics and even to white the sugar.
"When we transport about 70 kilometres, we win about 46,000 roads (3,8 euros) to every journey," Anto explains, which performs three journeys.
Everyone takes 3 hours and it ended, but it allows him to win 138.000 ropes (11.50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although this might be a misunderstanding for such an overhuman effort, it's the triple of what he would win in the fields.
"The minor income is very high here, where the coffee recruitment is paid for 15,000 wheels (1,20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is of two million wheels (167 euros) ", says the portor who worked once again as a mask on the Bali tourist island.
There, his salary was 75.000 ropies (6.20 euros) per day, and the work was not so difficult, but Anto came near his family to Banyuwangi, a neighbour village of the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is so insufficient as the sufre: "I have married a young girl of Bali, where they are Hindouists, and I returned it to Java to turn to Islam."
Anto suffers of asthm, respecting with difficulty, constantly and his eyes are irritant by toxic gas.
By 27 years, he was three of his life to challenge the danger on the Kawah lone, but the summer had already started to pay him the factory as well as he covered the face with a mask and the door of special guests.
Anto suffers of asthm, respecting with difficulty, constantly and his eyes are irritant by the toxic gas rejected by the volcano.
It's the price he must pay to continue his dream.
"I'm going to work two years again, because I want to open a boat or study Spanish or French" he promised in a English more than acceptable.
Malmaled by life, this young sympathetic and intelligent could be touristic, server or receptor in a hotel, but instead of it it makes the work of a mule.
It shares an insufficient wood mass with other ports, rises every day at two hours of the morning because the summer can not stop moving the night, when his yellow color becomes blue and light in the middle of darkness.
In the light of the darkness, Anto down in the screen by lighting with a small lamp fixed in his case, that he bought himself with his own money.
Some 400 ports lay down sugar painters on their balls from the foundation of the craft.
Despite its strong benefits, the minor company has not missed the extraction of the sugar to economize the costs and does not provide any equipment to the ports who work on their account and are paid to weight.
Furthermore, they do not touch one under the 30,000 ropes (2.50 euros) of majority by the device, in addition to the entry of 15.000 wheels (1.20 euros), only the observers of this natural park do to tourists who come to photograph the volcan and its human mules.
"This work is done for the animals, not for humans," protest Madrusin, a corpulant port of 42 years working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years since he left the college.
He's able to bear up to 110 kilometres, to ensure he's not gonna stop working "and he's gonna be able," because he needs money for her three sons, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I won't take my pension, I'm gonna die here because the volcano is all my life.
Although the sufre ends the gorge and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and throws the young men into the thresholds of smoke out of the volcane, they are so stuff that nobody is obliged to suffer serious diseases... which obviously add their usual respiratory problems, arts, paintings in genoux and throats, deformed by the weight of the painers.
Becoming the painter on its dose, Oneinik, aged 53, can only load 50 kilometres.
Every day, his friends and him had 15 tons of volcano sugar, that three camions move to Tamansari's interply, 18 kilometres from there by a train of kitchen invahid by the bad herbs.
"I won't take my pension, I'll die here because the volcano is all my life," said Oneinik by opening the mouth, evolving a few missing demons.
The elderly of his five children, 30 years old, is also working as sufre portor.
The time passes, but the perpetual mercy of generation is one of the most difficult meals in the world: the one that makes the human mulls of Kawah logen.
Singapore search for babys to save the economy
Singapourians are responsible for this absence of children on the carrier, stress and the cost of access to property.
"The population of Singapore must be developed."
I'm a husband and a patriot, you're my wife and a patriot, we fulfil our civil duty and give life!
It may appear incredible that these words come from a publicity for pastles to the menthe, but, though, or perhaps, the video has been spread as a pool of youtube in Singapour at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references as "We'll put a police in the tiroir" to mount Singapour's naturality rate.
BBH, the publicity agency in the origin of the video, hopes to take attention to the problem in a smooth way through this publicity.
His creditor, Douglas Hamilton, said that he wanted to use the music power to make people 'they have national disasters'.
It is solely designed to the Internet, so we could make it fun and lovely.
This is the main problem in that country.
We are the worst in the world in the area of nationality, and we feel that it was a theme that we had to argue.
We knew that the government had tried a number of things like starting parfums to the phéromons or organizing speed-dating nights.
Many of these ideas were creative but they didn't work.
So we say the following thing: what more creative to solve this problem than to make it a race song?
1,2 children
The Government of Singapore does not take it so much as light.
It is estimated to $1,300 per year in politics to encourage its citizens to have more children.
A measure of the Government for marriage and parents granted up to $15,000 per child, reaching maternity grants and distributing tax benefits.
But all this had little effect.
Singapour is a rich state and high technology of South-East Asia, also known for the conservation of its leaders and strict social controls.
Singapour's naturality rate, in accordance with its national population distribution, is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time that he was found above 2, it was considered as the renewing rate in 1976.
Why then the Singaporians do not have any children?
Tan Wei Ming, marriage policy director and family of the National Division of the Population, states that it had to be "effective education" and "a larger choice of carrier opportunities".
"This allowed people to have a wide range of options in terms of life objectives and priorities, beyond marriage and family constitution," explains.
The changes of social standards have contributed to the increase in the number of celibaters and to retain marriage and birthdays, which resulted in a reduction of nationality rates in Singapore.
During time, a immigration policy in order to radically increase immigration in combating population reduction has created a sense in the local population.
In Singapour, there are websites that have a xenophobian hardly damaged against new immigrants, particularly with Chineses who are accused to throw lower and not integrate.
The increase in immigration is also resulted in as one of the reasons for which the party in place in Singapour has known its worse electoral results since independence.
Since the elections, they tried to correct the problem with the establishment of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Insperated consequences
While the decline of nationality rate has aware of economic growth, tax income, health costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has unexpected consequences.
The Government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this began to touch the real estate sector.
The urban development authorities began to control the number of small apartments known under the name of "shake building", which must be built in determined areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale provides a lot of success.
However, the authorities are concerned that they could promote a climate lifestyle and encourage fosters to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the Immobiliary Employment EL Developers, claims that his "sheets" shipments are sell more faster than the larger accommodation.
They are more popular, in the sense where these housings are built so faster than those of greater size.
For this reason, it is much more rentable for our treasure.
However, it recognises that new standards provide clearer instructions to the promoters, which are prior to bathtons in the roads, if they wish to propose too small housings in a project.
Troop of stress
Singapour is a state state.
If these new regulations could be a step towards the growing rate of national national national national nationality, discussing the Singaporens who work in the centre's financial area, it seems that they would not have many effects.
"The people are very stressed, the houses are crowd, as well as education, so people will send it later," says a young framework.
Others may have children.
"But for me, it's important to have my money and time," says another younger of a twenty-year-old.
Gender and women mention their carriers, stress and costs of access to property and education as reasons for preventing children.
Thus, although the Government is trying to convince his citizens to have children, when it is about to do children, these are the Singapourians themselves who have the last word.
What is private outside the line is online
Confidentiality
In accordance with the Dictionary of the Royale Spanish Academy, it is the quality of the private area or "the private life area we can protect from any intrusion."
What is the private area for less than 16 years?
How did this definition apply in daily life and social networks?
Does it understand the dangers it expressed by spread on the Internet of events that it would certainly not be shared outside the line?
The Perudin Journal asked five young boys, aged between 10 and 15 years, frequent users of the toile.
In four cases, they linked the term "the very personal" on the personal plan and "passphrase and user name" when they apply it to social networks.
"I won't miss my most personal secrets in a post," said Jorge, 10 years old when he tries to explain the signification of private terms on websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he puts a account for two years.
"There are very secrets, my mother can know them but not all," said he.
On FB, I post sympathy images or games.
I'm also talking to my friends.
"I'm not going to share one of my photos or someone who would do it in my kids," said he.
The young boy recognized that it was bad to publish obscene photos, disappeared persons, crimes or to write adversary or violent comments.
Jorge is sure he knows his 35 friends on FB and his nine subscribed on Twitter.
Most of the family are.
His mother is partly, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express and write interesting two.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just posting them," he added.
"The social networks are amusing, I can talk with distant parents or with my friends quickly," said he.
He stated that he would never accept the request of an unknown person.
He will no longer trust someone who would recommend a foreigner.
Joseph's case, 14 years old, is different.
The adolescent has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask on this last, he adds not to see 20 of the persons registered on his friend list.
"I don't worry because we have something in common, music, for example," says he.
According to the young boy, no one had made progress for him or asked him his address or his phone number.
"If they put the pressure or exhibit it, I would just remove them from my account," he recognised.
José was subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences you today know under the name of cyberharcèlement are not foreign to the young boy.
One neighbour of one of my friends was recorded on a social network.
They missed it and went out of money.
"He never knows who it was," he assures.
The victim, according to Joseph, did not close his account.
"He just passed it in private profile."
He then explains us a series of manipulations to configure its account safely.
On the difference of Jorge, this young would post photos of knowledge in inconsistent or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I'm gonna do it if I was fucking or drunk.
"If I know it's cyberharclement," he said.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, an English teacher and licensed in education and learning, considers that children and adolescents should be understood that the purpose of social networks is to be informed.
"Internet is a way to search information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rule of the game has changed," mentions it.
Porras reports that the Marc Pressky Academic, who has a master in pedagogology of Yale University and author of the book "Nativas and digital immigrants", uses these terms to explain phenomenon.
The digital births are they, children and young people who are born with technology.
"We're the digital immigrants who have to teach them there, while we're going to learn," said she.
He added that the theme is complex, "for we ask them to have a definition criteria on what it is or not to spread, publish or say to an age where they do not have the maturity necessary to do it."
"We also ask them to be selective, while whatever they mean is to be popular, having thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences" adds it.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to learn confidentiality to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them awareness.
"They say not to do it to nothing," she said.
Then, Porras tells some examples: There are things that you will not tell a foreigner, why are you doing it on the Internet?
Or would it like you to publish a photo of you as a friend you have published?
Do you know what the others publish on you?
When you identify feast photos, will you ask others the permission to identify them?
And, do all need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they should act online as they do it out of line.
That's the same rules.
"In the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, that must be similar to social networks," said it.
Surveillance
Stuardo Guardia, teacher of University, primary institutional and educational advisers, states that parents are awarely reading the conditions for the use of social networks.
As each word, they will have solid bases to discuss with their children of the impacts of the opening of an account on the Internet.
"For example, the age and what it is allowed to share or publish," said he.
According to Guardia, it is necessary to remind children that it is not necessary to speak to the foreigners.
The Summit of the Unasur has been completed without the Lima Declaration
The VIth presidential Summit of the Union of South America (Unasur) has been completed today in Peru without the Public Declaration, although it has been announced previously and theoryly adopted by the seven present mandates.
Efe tried to access the document signed at the VIth Order Meeting of State Heads and Governments of the Unasur, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency reported that it would be informed after the closure of the Summit, and then stated that it would be published a moment on the Internet of the Government of Peruvian.
When they were questioned on the text, they reported that its content was expressed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, during the press statements.
The access of journalists to the summit information has always been limited.
During the day, only the video without the voice of the presidential meeting with the "privacy session, restreint" message was distributed in the press room.
The few information moved between journalists were dataed by the press attachers of some of the U.S. Governments who assisted in the performance, except the Peru port.
The only document reported on the day was the list of present presidents, which caused a certain disease in the hundreds of journalists of various national and international media, which claimed more important information.
Later, the Presidency of Peru sent an email to the media with the "End Declaration" of the Summit, but it was the speakers of President Humala and not of the Official Document which concluded the summit.
In October last, Peru was the 3th Summit of South America (ASPA) and at this occasion, although it was requested by the press, it had not been distributed the statement also called the Lima Declaration, as was previously announced.
On the official website of the APA, you can check that the document was published in March last month.
In the two international performances, the Federal authorities tried to establish secure transmission systems for all journalists, but have limited the maximum obtaining of information.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgement of the Court of La Haye, which translates a different border between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chili, Sebastián Piñera, gathered together in the regional performance and said they would respect the decision of the CIJ to hear the two parties' plaidoyers in the process Lima attempted against Santiago and starting on Monday in La Haye.
"We will respect and implement the deputy that will resume the disputes we are to bring today before this international court," said the President Humala, on the side of his chemical homologus.
"The Chile has always been, and will continue to be a respective country of international law, the peaceful resolution of counterparts, treaties and international courts," he added the President Piñera by giving a manual to the President Humala, on the side of the drapeaux of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents submitted to the CIJ has been held after the Colombia has described this week the Bogota Covenant, which had agreed to submit to the decisions of the International Court, after a decision on maritime limits with Nicaragua, which she was considered seriously erroneous.
The summit was held without the presence of the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended by the Unasur since 2011 after the destitution of his former President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the performance.
The host president Ollanta Humala was charged to open the delivery tomorrow and close the summit a little after middle in Lima.
The officer read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements were adopted and that 31 project lines were set between South Americas for $17 million.
By the adopted agreements, he pointed out that the countries of the United States will place the " important steps to achieve the goal of South America through the development of agreements on residence permits".
He informed that actions would be made to improve the "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for better access to medicines, access to low-price Internet in the total of South America and to coherently assess natural disaster risks".
With a crisis Europe, "Economic consolidation (the Latin America) must not have a triomphalist matrix but has to help increase our productive master and to introduce a better future for our populations," concluded President Humala.
"We decided to privilege a group of 31 emblemmatic projects that improve the connection of South America spaces, particularly in rural and border areas... by joining our countries and by generating new economic circuits," said the Peruvian President.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five were concerning Peru and on the cross-border acces of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two of them were more important connection with the Ecuador, although he had not given more details.
The final document also mentions the political situation of Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process of this country will allow its reintegration within the South America Union" of which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America remains a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and good relations with its neighbourhoods, is another subject addressed at the Summit.
In this respect, the Columbian President, Juan Manuel Santos, said, before starting your regional performance, that he hoped to meet his Homologus of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, the next summer in Mexico to discuss calmly the maritime difference through a judge of the CIJ requested by Bogota.
"It's possible tomorrow (seeday), I have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega," said the Chairman Santos.
"We will review all these ways, and they are not complete, including the treaty with Nicaragua, which will ask for a discussion with this country," said he.
"I hope I can say to the President Ortega that we're going to regulate this in the most widely civilized and respectable way," added the Chairman Santos.
The Chairmans and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico where they have planned to assist the new President of this country, Enrique Peña Nieto.
In the same way, within the Summit, the Ministers of Defence of the Block will prejudice to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which seeks to strengthen the dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chili, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are part of the Unasur, although the last country is suspended.
Peru provides the presidency during the regional block.
"The South America must learn from Europe how to integrate citizenship," said Rafael Correa.
The President of the Ecuador, Rafael Correa, stated today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which "South America, in this case, had to take an example on Europe."
The President Correa, who participated in the VIth Summit of the United Nations South America (Unasur), situated in Lima, said to the State Television Television, "Peru, that Europeans were "interviewed at the Second World War" and in other conflicts, "although they now formed almost a patria".
In that respect, he defended the draft to establish a South America citizenship encouraged by the Member States of the United States.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South America, as already is for the members of the Andine Community, but still remains the reactionary areas we want to be part of the past."
Furthermore, the Ecuador President has been shown in favour of the recovery of the United Nations of the American States (OEA) with the aim to reduce the influence of the English-saxos States and to take into account the signs of the San José Covenant on Human Rights.
Those who turn to us ears never engage, inverse, we, South America, have all signed it.
"It is unrecognisable that the Inter-American Human Rights Commission is in Washington under the financing of the United States," said he, endorsing the political asylum granted by the Ecuador to the WhikiLeaks Funder, Julian Assange.
It is sure that he does not regret its decision, because he has not seen his principles, but in contrast respected its "Democratic values and human rights".
He concluded that "there were suspects based on which Assange would be extraditioned to a third country and that its proceedings would not be respected."
Furthermore, the Swedish justice, which has concluded that he was summoned in his territory to a questionary regarding a presumpted sexual crime while "Swedish legislation allows it to do through video conference, which could be done since the Ecuador's ambassade in London."
Correa stated that there was a risk that Asange’s mental and physical health was deteriorated.
"I didn't talk to him since he was in our ambassade, but the ambassador told me that he had a little pulmonary problem, but nothing seriously," said the Equatorian President.
It is possible that its physical and mental health is deteriorated by the fact that he is weak in a small space without making exercises at the free air.
"There is involved on the health of any one," concluded.
Correa notes that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June in the кваtorian ambassade of London, which would be the appointment of a self-condition that would allow him to go to Equator, is located between the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and the European Judicial authorities and noted that he had discussions in London to find a solution to the removal of the WikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate with human rights, but we do not use this word in this case but there were permanent discussions.
"The solution to this problem is in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and of the European Judicial authorities, as the lawyer of Asange, Baltazar Garzón, has launched a number of procedures at various European institutions," said he.
And he thinks that if the Great Britain had granted the self-conduit tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as in fact allowed her legislation, and as she had already done it in other cases, would ask Mr Assange in the Ecuador Ambassade in London, or ask the Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa had benefited to reaffirm himself as a defender of the freedom of press, and he explained that what he would not be to be "the mediacrite, the wrong faith and the lies that are subject to the freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of the freedom of press are not the malicious or pervers political men, but the bad journalists at the money of aviation, singing and extortion," said he.
Under this angle, it was pleasing that this is not the kind of journalists "no the bankers or the heregemon countries who rule in Ecuador" and, rather than to set up before his election, "which would endeavour the revolution to continue the road and drive the right way."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain Paraguay's livestock within the Monastery at least until the next elections, argued that the organization " should show close and not to the opportunity and detrimental attempts of degraded State," because it had actually destroyed the legitimacy of paraguanian democracy.
Moreover, the Equatorian President considers the desire of his Colombian homologgue, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime limits between the two countries by the beam of the International Court of La Haye, which will strengthen the sea sovereignty of Nicaragua.
At the time, this judgment is not respected.
It is a problem between a South America and a Central America country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will of progress together.
You need to resolve them together to overcome them and go before.
At the same time, he said confidence in the good resolution of the literacy on the Maritime borders against Peru and Chili within the same court and said that he was "a good that Latin America would know international institutions if the two countries agree to accept a judge so closely that it is."
With regard to the event of his presentation as a candidate to the future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to print a third consequent mandate, he reported that he had seen this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa assured that, if he lost the firstborns of February 2013, he would take away from public life.
At the personal level, the power has never interested me, but in both injustes as the Ecuador's situations, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved by the bicycle of the political power.
"My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed this event of victory, but we must accept this responsibility," said he.
If I gain, it would be my last presidential mandate and I will then get away from political life.
If we never lose us, I'll do it too.
"It's my decision," said he.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I came to discuss with Vice-President Vice-President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that a medical treatment of routine was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
"There does not mean a delay of the health status of President Chávez," commented.
The Head of Equatorian State has participated today in Lima at the VIth Summit of State Heads and Governments of the United Nations South America (Unasur) which has completed a call to better regional integration in support of progress, equality and security.
Deaths related to AIDS today are due to a later detection.
Fabrizio had 21 years when he confirmed the result of the test: seropositif.
"It's like if the sky fell on my head," he said, revealing at the time of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make "favorable," in vain.
The young man hided him to his family.
He decided to load himself alone from his disease and began to inform himself about his subject, and his charge was as he was to celebrate his 43th anniversary.
There is no doubt, one of the elderly patients in the HIV unit of the Guadalajara civil hospital, in which he found many battlees in 1994.
Fabrizio lives with human immunodeficiency virus (VIH) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, where there were many doubts, little choice of treatment and more stigmates.
So, even the director of a clinic of the IMSS was prevented to tell him to see "for he was without voice."
At that time, having the sida was death synonym.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and to have a good quality of life.
However, notwithstanding their disease, many people still come when virus has already caused damage, their immunity system and are victims of opportunist infection.
31 years after the appearance of sida in the world, in all cases after the first reported cases, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who started a timely treatment and the population survival is exactly the same", said the Chief of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanuva and notes that this information was valid in April this year in a pre-pre-sidic scientific publication.
Infectiologist and expert in HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanuva commented that since 2008, scientists concluded that the AIDS was no more dead disease but that the number of years of survival and life depended on the level of immunity of patients at the time of diagnostics, with better prospects for those who did not consume drugs: up to 30 years for CD4 from 200 and to 50 years for those reaching CD4 rates.
To speak simply, this means that for someone who would receive a positive HIV diagnostic to 25 years, "and it will remain under control, can live without problems until 75 years," the scientific questioned.
To replace this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that the hope of the life of Mexico is today of 76 years in average.
If it is true that mortality has significantly reduced in the past years, in Mexico, the number of people died from AIDS suites was of 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (the annual report of UNSIDA), but it is also true that 60% of the patients identified on the national database are deceived.
Only in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and 187 were dead until May this year, but we are sure that access to antiretroviral medications is universal since 2005.
So why is there yet death?
I think the problem is not from access to treatment.
That's how I see it is what happened in our hospital.
During the last 12 years, we have never missed medications, the problem is that patients come to very advanced stages because they do not know that they are infected, or then they take it into advanced stages of disease.
It gives us a indiscutable fact "New patients on ten coming while they already present an opportunist infection, which needs to have a greater impact on global mortality, is to realize more precise diagnostics and, for this, need to propose massive exhibition tests, to all those who ask it."
The Specialists and members of the State Council of Prevention of the Side of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as well as the patients themselves, as the Fabrizio, who had made his exhibition test in a private laboratory, just because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, he was already portrait of the AIDS and suffered from the Caposi sarcome, a cancer tumor that is one of the current complications.
Everything changes when you learn you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die and don't want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better that I'm going to say three times a week," they say, "It's not my case.
The change was profitable, I eat well, I do the exercise, I take my medicines.
At that time his parents only know that he suffers a cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I'm a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active sexual life, but co-responsible, I have an attention to me and the other person," says Fabrizio, who accepted share his intimity with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his witness, those who today fear, during the walk of the World Day against AIDS.
They do the test, if they have taken risks, they will first know if they are serious and better, and if they already have the diagnostic, they need to know that we can live like all, being responsible.
His message resumes the slogan of the fight against AIDS in this year 2012.
Preservatives on the container
There are many focuss between health programmes and ordinary citizens, supports Ricardo Salazar, journalist of Guadalajara, who has embraced the cause of HIV.
And the greatest residence in the prevention.
In all places described in this way, "There has actually increased the distribution of conservatives, before we have given it one or two, now we have given it hundred packages, it is very good, but it is a result, that some have not access to preservatives today," said he.
Of the most vulnerable to new infections, adolescents are found.
The question: "What are you going to do?", put on saccame and value judgments by social workers, orientation advisers, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that adolescents do not want to hear, secure the journalist.
It proposes to reorient this ineffective distribution; the preservatives are not only sold to the accounts but are found in the distributors of public taxes and youth places.
It is not to encourage promise.
It is no longer to pay the girls and the engine, as Emilio González had responded to the González González, when he asked whether there would be a preservative distribution within his administration.
"It is not like this functioning sexuality, the best is to provide preservatives to already active persons," said he.
The figures in Jalisco
13.435 cases summed (12.158 of AIDS and 1.317 of HIV).
The State is the fourth State of the country in number of new cases and cases of sida and 13th for the number of HIV diseases.
92% of pollutions are seen by sexual, 6% by blood and 2% by pernatal way.
It is considered that 50,000 people live with HIV, as for each case recorded, there are 4 or 5 persons who do not know it.
A ratified judge, called by a court of the United States, ignore the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro group, allows a commercial fatal in Mexico. The scenario causes a previous nefast for all national enterprises who have ramifications in the neighbouring country and have problems of solvibility.
It would therefore seem that the survival procedures for the company authorized by Mexico's laws are not valid in the country to the star bank, in contrary to international agreements.
In a practical point of view, the sentence brought to the judgment on 15 June by the judge Harlin Hale of the Court of Faillits for the north of Texas, leaves mexican society without defence against the possibility of imbargo of their properties beyond Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the main producer of the Mexico to impose the Supreme Court based on three inconsistents.
First, while the judge of the case indicates that creditors must be registered in accordance with the United States law, the court of call for the fifth round, sitting in the New Orleans, claims that the main procedure is the commercial fatality formally formally formally formally formally in Mexico.
The first point would be to denial international procedure cooperation in cases of undertakings that have a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Modal Law for the Uniformity of International Trade Law has been created to this end, taking the American Law Institute as arbitrary.
Secondly, the judge states that without the inter-associated vote recognized in the critical mass of the commercial fatality, the debts contracted by subsidies of Vitro to the mother society would not be obtained for the approval of restructuring.
However, the Mexican laws recognize this opportunity.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There is a half-duuzaine of examples, between Agremex and Mexico Trade Trade, which was guaranteed by the Federal Institute of Commercial Faillits.
Furthermore, it is that, since the votes of the filials remained, in all ways the creditors of Vitro, who were fighted against it in the courts of the United States, that was the "vacuador" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote would be 45 votes against 37.
A data killed by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro was abolished for the difficult situation that he had been found since 2008 without stoping the serious economic crisis faced by the United States, with the impact of the costs in the country.
For the moment, the family of González Saada will call for the same appeal court to make the vote in its entirety, with the five judges, because only three votes were voted.
The insurance proceedings will recall the non-properties and require the revision of the proceedings by a higher institution, in that case the Supreme Court of Justice of the United States.
The most serious is that the court has ignored a document sent by the Government of Mexico on behalf of the friend of the Court ("Amy of the Court") in which Vitro was detailed in the framework of the Trade Facilities Law, reporting that it would deliver the conventions signed by the two countries to establish it at the same level as paragraph 15 of the United States law on the faillities.
In addition, it notes that the country has extended the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for cross-border instability cases, which ensure the equality of debts and creditors.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes "The basket-ball is all my life"
The globe-troctor of the "Hetin" ballball has passed over 60 years of his life in relation to the ground and, thanks to him, has seen in the whole world.
Many of people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the story of the local ballot as large as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason is that before a cerebral hemorragie condemns it in 2008, Reyes was warmed in this sport for more than 60 years, as a player of lower leather, player of the national basket team, manage and manager of the national team, BSN, with the Bayamón Vaqueros or as President of the Basket Federation.
"I have brought several cases in the bathroom throughout my life, and even many of the same time, as I was the BSN Chairman of the National and Federation Team Chief, for the 1990s," Reyes remembered during a visit of Prima Hora at Bayamón, where he stayed with Isabel, his faithful wife for over 50 years.
"The basketball is all my life."
Reyes are not outstanding when it makes this statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated from photos and memories that remember his skill out of standards, showing.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, the most he affects him are those who remind him his past as a player within the Vaqueros team in the midst of the years 50 to 1982, after having passed 15 years as co-administring or manageing the team.
"This was my best years, the ones I had the most benefited because I had the opportunity to participate in eight Vaqueros campaigns from 1967, as manager, co-management or manager.
This makes many years of satisfaction, including the five campaigns dispersed from 1971 to 1975.
Then I went back at the campaign in 1981, the year in which Jerome Mincy entered the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great manager, took the head of the team," says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who was leading here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me, "I have a costful player for you, he measures two metres.
You want it?"
That's how to start Mincy, one of the best players had Puerto Rico.
Bartow then recommended Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and was one of the best tumors.
I remember that he said that if Minnie had allowed Bayamon to get a campaign, Gausse would help us to try to bring another.
He was glad about the Vaqueros campaign with Gausse, but only from distance since it was the great manager of the Federation in 1988.
At that time, he prefered to benefit from its charges and charges in the national team.
I remember when we first brought it to the United States in the pre-olympic tournoi in Mexico in 1989.
Then, there was the World of 1990, where we arrived on the fourth and where we would have been going to bring the dry medal if that Canadian judge had not made us to join the last match, said Reyes.
Is the 1990 World Team the best national team you saw?
It is part of the best, as well as the team who shot the Dream Team in 2004 Olympics.
But my favourite is that of the Cuban Pan American Games in 1991, when we brought the gold and we set a relaxed to the United States team, which was very similar to the world's bronze.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculin" (Ortiz), there were also young people (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not assist the world of 90 because of a genoux problem.
A team that might not be the best in terms of individuals, but she gave us a gold medal and a great joy in the pre-olympic tournoi of Neuquén in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Paul Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruit in replacement of the players suspended by the isolation of the Pan American Games of Mar del Plata, we brought the gold against all pronostics.
What was the best Puerto Rico player?
Uncertainly, this is Piculin Ortiz.
His statistics at the level of international tournois are impressive.
Nobody in Puerto Rico was home at this level as Piculin did.
And this does not take into account his trajector in the various lines for which he played.
Who was the best portuary manager?
It's very difficult to say.
We had a good team of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I love the work Leo Arill.
For you, what is your greatest success within the Federation?
It is part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that at the beginning of 1990, BSN contained up to 17 teams in a season.
What are you going to do?
There are things I would like to set up, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, the boys of Ponce play only in their area and compare the teams of the other parts of the island in national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while it is not strongly necessary.
At least I saw the benefit of mandatory certifications and courses for leaders, field staff and arbitrators.
That makes me happy.
What are you doing today?
In general, I listen to the music, I look at the clips of my time on YouTube, I benefit from my little children and, in time, I assist basketball matches.
And of course, I benefit from my wife, Isabel, who has always been on my side.
Death of the Actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Wordh (Texas), was globally known by the main role of John Ross Ewing, more known by J.R., in the televisioned "Dallas", in which he incarned a man of business without groups, redoutable and manipulating.
Larry Hagman, which was the role of the no-scruptioned petrole J.R. Ewing in the "Dallas" televised series, became a symbol of warning in the 1980s, is deceived.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who was returned this year in the role of J.R in a new season of "Dallas", was died Friday evening of the complications of a cancer, according to a member of the family sent to The Press related to Warner Bros., "Dallas".
"Larry was back to his crowd-born city of Dallas, playing again the ironic role he loved the most", said the family.
Larry's family and his neighbors were with him in Dallas in the female of Thanksgiving this day.
Linda Gray, who interplyed the role of his wife in the original series and later, was found with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said his press added, Jeffrey Lane.
He made joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, ridiculous, affective and talentous, and he's going to miss me much.
"It was a person of exception and he lived the life at the base," said Grey in a communication.
The doctors had diagnosed a hepatic cirhose in Larry Hagman in 1992 and had recognized a lot of drink for many years.
In 1995, he had detected a bad tumor in the fever and he had made a green.
A number of years before "Dallas", Hagman was known to the television in the role of a ordinary type in the "Jinny of my dreams" series diffused by the NBC chain from 1965 to 1970.
In that, he interplyed the role of Captain Tony Nelson, a astronaute whose life was transformed when he discovered a seducious genius, interpreted by Barbara Eden, and he returned her home to him.
He also played in two commissions that have been a little time at the old, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among its roles in the cinéma, we find the roles received by the crisis in "The group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But this was thanks to his master interpretation of the detesttable J.R. that Larry Hagman recognized his greatest success.
The dramatic series of the CBS chain on the Ewing clan and their neighbours were distributed from April 1978 to May 1991.
The Slogan "Who killed J.R.?" invented to maintain the suspension around an episode full of emotions in which the Haagman person is almost killed, generated speculations in the whole world and millions of dollars played in pars.
By this, among others, the series have reached a record of audience at this time.
When the response was revealed in an episode of November 1980, 41 million telespects were in average before their screen and had made "Dallas" the second world's divertising programme, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million telespects.
It was J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had thrown him up.
J.R. had married her and then threatened her to accuse prostitution if it was not away from the city, but others also had reasons to attack it.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatisfactory man but charismatic sourire: a malhonest undertaking and a unfidal husband who tried to put inside his alcool wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what would be needed for J.R." Hagman said in 1988.
It should be written: "Ci-that's the honour of the citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only part he's lost.
Victoria Principal, coprotagonist of the original series, has been remembered this Friday of Haagman and a man "immensed, both on the small and life screen."
It is unforgettable, and unpopularable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us, who had the chance to know and love him.
The new "Dallas" edition has been distributed a few months ago with a great success on the TNT chain.
The registration of five episodes has already been completed for the second season and a sixth is in the course of achievement, informed the chain.
For the moment, neither Warner nor TNT chain have communicated on how Harman's death will be integrated in the series.
The original of Fort Wordh in Texas, he is the son of the actor and son of Mary Martin, who knows celebration with classic works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a adolescent when she gave him the day in 1931 while she was married to the lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first step on the theatre scenes of New York at the beginning of the 1950s, then served in the air force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
There he met the young decorator of Sweden Maj Axelsson and married her.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived many years in the city of Malibu, where many celebrations remained.
In 2001, he titled his memories "Hello Darlin": Tall (and́ly True) Tales about My Life" (in French: Hello Darlin): The imposable memories of J.R)
"I haven't written anything in this book that could curse anybody or effect it in any way," he said to the press at this time.
After his crowd, he became an active warrant of organism donation and worked as a voluntary in a hospital to assist career patients.
"I advise them, I trust them, I'm coming with them when they're going to work and then," he told it in 1996.
I'm trying to offer them a little comfort, as "Don't be afraid, it's not easy for a little while, but it's gonna be fine to go."
It was also warrant against the tabac and participated in several campaigns.
A course of the "Fin of the World" is starting
Every week students study apocalyptical issues such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germes and climate heating.
This semester, when the professor of religion Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was launching an irregular hamster there: the end of the "growd deompte" of the Maya calendar, 21 December, which turned from many people as the proof of the end of the imminent world.
But professor Charme had no idea of what was waiting for it during the following months: the Ouragan Catholic Sandy, a fiscal warrant that some named "Armageddon of Debt" and a believer conflict involved Israel, the place where Christian theories at the end of time thought it would be deployed.
"I have not seen that it would be the most apocalyptic half I have never known", said professor Charmé to his students of the University of Rutgers-Camden (New Jersey).
If we were analyzing what happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and that we would tell it, this was a very good period.
And it is necessary to remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypsis.
And he is not the only teacher to give courses on "the end of the world" this halfster, which will be, in theory, the last of the history.
In Temple, added professor Barry Vacker provides the course "Medias, culture and end of the world".
Every week students study apocalyptical issues such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germes and climate heating.
"We analyze this because these ideas are proliferated with time," said he, "and how they offer hypothetic scenarios leading a certain human behaviour.
If nuclear weapons fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could be extracted.
This month, students will analyse films with apocalyptic topics and study how they can be compared with real life examples.
"I tried to inform my students about what it was possible, probably, reliable and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvanie, the professor of History of Latin America Matthew Restall and his college Amara Solari, an added professor of History of Art and Anthropology, made a team to give a course, just called "The end of the world".
"We add "2012" to have the opportunity to give the course again, if the world would not be disappeared," the professor Restall said.
Despite the "imminent deaster", students must study, create projects and through their final reviews.
In the Pennsylvanie State, the final review will be overcoming the veille of the Apocalyps, which does not leave students of another choice that to work "the night even in the end of the imposed world," said Restall.
The courses have been revealed enough popular.
"He was completed in two hours," Restall said about his high-level cure for students, composed of 35 students.
We received messages by e-mail several weeks before the start of the half, from the part of people who asked whether there was still a place.
Students, on their part, assure that the course is one of the most interesting.
"This is exciting to see what people can do to strengthen", says Bridgid Robinson, a religious student of 23 years, original of Haddonfield, New Jersey, of Rutgers-Camden University.
Because the fear of the Apocalyps, that it is secular or religious, is only a question of comfort, or not of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a student in the psychology and infirmity of 25 years, claims to have seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I never heard of a course that teached this matter," said he.
I appreciate it.
But no students asked, and yet less a teacher, he told us to believe in the end of the world of 21 December.
"Our first project was the Ma's prophecy, and in a certain way we discredited it," said Julie Vele, a student of last year in Temple, 21 years old and original of West Chester.
The Maya has never predicted the end of the world, it is only a key date on the calendar, said Restall.
But I agree that there is an anxiety related to the west culture, which rises to a number of centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by preventing the end of the world.
Internet has caused an expert of these speculations.
"In other places of the world, people don't think about it," he assures.
It's most of the English world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion of the University La Salle, who gives courses to Philippines this year, quickly answered when he asked whether he knew we were giving courses on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines don't participate in the end of the world," he answered us, as if it was an exception from a higher authority.
We have a thanks to Daddy.
Restall notes that in the years, many dates were spoken of the last sentence, and it states that if nothing happens on 21 December, "The people will start thinking immediately at the next date" or to philosopher that on 21 December mark the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date to the reader.
Many told us that they thought they were going to feasts "of the end of the world."
"After, I'm calling friends and we together", commented Samira Ford, who's 20-year-old communications.
