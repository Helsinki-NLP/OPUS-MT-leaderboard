Norway's rafficky: is this the most cool fish of the world?
Norway's five million people's highest standards of life, not only in Europe, but in the world.
May the secret of the country’s success may be connected to local business in some fishes?
Take the choice of the past time.
Put them in the middle of a smooth bottle.
Just leave one week.
Now you have one of the big Norways to drunk your bulls.
I'm in the small Fagernes town, about three hours far from Oslo.
There's a noble noise, and this cow is always in the air.
Rakephistic and water-- as much of the fish you love, it's fermented for a year.
The Norways will gather here for a most growing feast that is called for the most growing feast.
He says, "It's what you're going to make Festival" and "Rakfisk Generali" Havard Halvarsen, "It's a laughing, and then a bardak swallows."
People are around us eating small fish bottles and drunken drinking in many mixtures.
Havard says, "So many people love aquavites more than the raffixk."
The drink can kill the cow.
I'm calling a few pieces.
If you can escape out of the burden, it's not bad - it's not a matter of a sustainable language after a little long bus trip.
Rakfisk Norveish is a very different product in the spring of water and water in the waters that are expected in the water.
Then, when they are well deep, they will be leavened, and it is new with uncertainly disappeared alcohol.
Before a lot, thousands of people were difficult to leave from countries from Norway, mostly disappeared to the US.
Now the population is wide with speed - more of 13 percent of the jobs, high mass, and shocked up by a system.
The old race and sooner people from Swedish who are more rich than Norway.
Rakfiss is something important, if the past of Norway is a little collected, even a part of life.
You can buy the most pair of the world's foods.
But it's all that's pretty. You'll give it a little bardwich or a sandwich, £9 ($14).
Norway, most of the world's news haven't come from the day, and most people like this.
The people who have been here for the past 77, women and children are not inquiry to speak with the alternative Brevic name.
Instead, it's called "22 kids" about killing.
Norways are difficult to believe that one of them in the peaceful countries is able to make a gaddar and murder.
Norway's greatest oil and gas industries have grown from the beginning of 1970.
Our Garson's magazine, Anna Northic refah, has a long-shaped hair and a blue-sweet eye and displayed: "But we're not the only reason that we're so good to be so good."
We, how you say, you're a prominent people.
In English, most of them are like people here. We're perfect.
We're not a shower, we don't like the chapter.
Norwegian oil riches are very careful — a small percentage of the money coming from the industry, all of which are special to the future benefits of vegetables.
The others, when they had no money, in the years of global crises, joined the wings of the Norway campaign.
"We're glad as long as we can walk in the mountain," says Anna.
"And a raffinetic seventh," he's sweet with a quiet coffee.
I'm standing in the black and I'm waiting for something to eat. I've eating enough.
Now, every hamburger is absolutely different and more disappointed.
But even more than that bathroom.
One of the number of hotels that I have left for dinners, which are the best of mysters here, and perhaps the hardest fire – they'll be fishing.
There is a viable television connection on a carrier on the rake tabs.
It's like the Eurovision songs.
"How do you have the best fish in the mountains, Thor-Judergen?"
"We're here, Havard."
They're dogs, they're dogs.
A man falls from the sandalyse, perhaps in the watervite effect.
Or maybe all these fishes are out of the cook.
The Mexican Enrique Pena Nieto is faced with a difficult start
When the new president of Mexico prepared to go to the office of Enrique Pena Neo, BBC looks at the difficulties that Will Grant and the people were complicated.
It's particularly bad to the trafic of Mexico now.
In the best time, there was a warm city, and there was a huge cause for many mother rotations since Monday.
But the purpose is not to stop people going to work, but the protesters stopped reaching the meclism.
Saturday, the new President of Mexico will take the bird of Enrique Pena Nieto and take the task to manage the nation.
In contrast to an unfair mission.
Flipe Calderon, in the pursuant administration, had a good practitioner of the Mexico's economic actor, but in six years a drug control over 60,000 years of death.
Mr. Pena Nieto said to the Oval Office of OBD this week, President Barack Obama, "It's a great word to the Mexican people."
I'm gonna offer a new security strategy to make our agreement.
Before Mr. Pena Nieto's former law testing in the Mexican operation, Mr. Pena Nieto was deployed.
The crowd around it was divided in a new leader in this area, which grows in the ancient mechanism.
A wordful man
For example, the Royal Valley of Bravo is remembered by love in the Bravo Castle.
The inhabitants here revealed that he's driving the tourism in his place, and that he created the altyps.
You can go from Mr. Pena Nieto's new carriers to reach the town to get a city. It's a great progress on changing roads and all changing ways.
Furthermore, the plates moved on the name of the modern spor center are contrary to the impact of the museum.
"We're looking at her to bring the real and remaining change," Mr. Pena Nieto says, "the concert of the Gabriel Olvera Hernandez's member of the jurisdictional PRI party.
In particular, we hope that our country is very interesting and genuine change.
81 years later, Vicente Fox was sent by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congress member Olvera states that after 12 years later, Enrique Pena Nieto was very waiting for 12 years after the Congress House.
And he refused the new president of the Ombudsher to appoint it as an expensive.
It's a clear man who calls himself with a great country visious.
One man who knows to listen to any more than all.
But it's not the idea that many people have about the ancient roads.
In Nezaa, Nezahualcoyotl, he couldn't be disappeared with the Valle del Bravo's stoned parks.
It's a banker of Mexico City's most of the highest carriers.
And the problems in the household are hard and urban.
This year, it was called to help drugs fighting drugs in the prisons and especially more widespreadly against women.
In two years, we've been killed by some women's body over two years.
Mr. Pena Neo was killing more than 1.000 women in Mexico, and more than the city of Juarez, who was recognized by the murder of women.
Those who operate Mr. Pena Nieto in the best way, said she couldn't start mourning up to the problem of murder.
They're the worst way when they come not to his rule.
In a typical beton house in Irinea Buendia, she's mercy daughter Mariana Luna's pictures.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana in 2010 announced.
But she believes that his family was killed by his partner.
"He remembered the body when I went home," said Senora Buendia.
There was a look that she showed that he was driving, and death was so far started.
When his mother tells the story again, she looks at a picture from Maryna's wall down, and one word found on it: Adalet.
However, he said that this family was exactly denied.
The power officers acted with me as an elderly co-code, who made a problem, and a craftman.
What people wanted to make it easy to accept and shut their knees.
"But it's not true when it's so ordinary and unfair."
President Pena Nieto comes with severe responsibilities on the birth of Saturday.
For ten thousands of our family past six years in Mexico, he promised to priorize them during the new president.
The PRI Congress member, Olvera, says, is a president in the Valle del Bravo.
But this is what the victims of the city of Neza feared the most.
Bradley Manning didn't admire the bad acts.
The soldiers are trying to come against Bradley Manning's bad ideas.
Doubt, Maning Quantico is focused on the time that soldiers in Virginia stayed in prison.
He wants Maning to close the case to the case.
In the army, thousands are accurated to play a secret document.
The soldiers tried to indicate that the greatest secret material deficiency in the Summit of the United States was accused in the army, he was awaiting over the military of Bradley Manning who had lived on the bad behaviour.
Ft. Before the stage in Meade Maryland, he revealed that Ashden Fein Manning had not shown a disagreement of the newspapers of Ashden Manning for nine months in Virginia.
It's just a day later when maning had thought that maning was surely surveyed.
The army who observed in August 2010 is accurated to play thousands of secret documents in Irak.
Materyal later was released by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks never corrected that Manning was the source of information.
On Saturday, Fein studied the forms that Mening had been filled with the maning forms since the year 2011 in the Single Military prison, after the meeting of Maning.
The officers asked Maning questions and noticed their answers.
When he asked for forms on Saturday, he told Meaning's behaviour's behaviour was "feeld" and all the system's behaviour "Multice Professional"
The forms don't show misunderstanding, if the officers ask Meaning's right to do so, he says Fein.
Maning told them that they were talking about the matters and that they were talking about the concerns of the visitors, and they told them to be moved to them, but they didn't keep the matters.
Maning said, "They haven't written anything.
He asked why he didn't decrease the acts of behaviour during the 2011 meeting at Yarbay Denise Lind de Manning during the 2011 Release.
Maning responded that the situation was resolved in the meeting of Maning was "promised".
The army said that they put it in an incredible way to protect him and to protect others.
"I wanted to know something I'm sure, and I wanted to get out of the POI... to bring out the roof of a smoothed life residue," said Maning.
Maning was arrested to Iraq and expressed about the transfer of military in Virginia in 2010 in Virginia, in Virginia, in Virginia, for about two months ago.
He said he's thinking about Kuveyt, and he's felt there once because of the warm.
He said that it was a stress that he wouldn't allow them to know what is on the outside world.
"It's the coffee of that house to Camp Arafjon," said Manning Persempers on the day.
I thought I'd die in that caffeine.
Maning said that most of the days, at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours, were only in a small cell.
Maning just said a bed, a campaign, a finger, a bit of clothes and eyes were given.
He tried to walk, because he said that he's got to sleep in the day and even keeps up the rules.
Maning always said he was sleeping out of the cellar's eyes.
And when the warriers returned, they didn't see her face when they were going to wake up and told him they were back.
Maning lawyer found a photograph of conducts made to Manning in Ocak 2011.
Maning Nisan in 2011 was moved to the Fort Leavenworth soldiers in Kansas.
At the same time, the judge asked Meaning's day in Persian's day, a survivor, who was hard to sleep at a night in Quantico, asked about the warrants in one morning and the other courts were difficult to stand up in front of the crystals.
In the number of maning, he explained that he didn't have a chance to hide himself with the battery.
When the judge asked on Saturday, he told Meaning's order to cast him out a battery to cast him out, but he didn't put anybody out.
The maning's day of Persis, he assured that he wasn't a danger for himself, because he was difficult to sleep for a previous night.
Maning said he could harm herself, but she did it.
Maning explained that that night his dreams, his fingerprints, and their eye cells.
At least the lawyers hopes that at least the lawyers will consider their tests in the prison and that the warrior who is expected to be fulfilled at the beginning of this year in the court.
The war said that Manning would have accepted his crime in smaller crimes, and he was planned to fight the worse crimes.
Duration has been planned to continue in the end of the week, and the surveys are waiting for discussing the situation of the survey.
Pentagon Manning said that all the magazine was observed in Quantico according to the rules on the courts.
Those who are contrary to Manning, helping the enemy, be reasoned to be wrongly distributed in the Internet, to communicate their national defence information, and to denial or record.
If you're in the case of all of me, it's likely to be in prison.
My American identification crisis
Many say that it's difficult to leave Mexico because of the depth of the opportunity here.
The Mexicans are in the course of the departant; they remember difficult time to the Mexico,
Navarrette says that the Americans of Mexico have shot between two worlds
I've been able to go through a pretty close trip to Mexico City, and I've turned back to the ground.
It showed two courses: one "Mexicanos" for "Meksicous", the other "Extranjeros" for "Extranjeros"
I was standing there a few seconds, I wasn't sure where I'm going.
I've been called as a "Meksic" in the center of California for all my life.
In this ethnic steno, my friends in Boston say to their own "Irish" or to my friends in New York.
Then I decided in Mexico.
But that was Mexico.
And my grandmother had no need to stenoya or tired.
I was basically American.
I'm talking to Spanish, I'm so good to manage both sides of a meeting in this language.
But I don't have local words and I can't escape from my American attitude.
That's why I got my passport and I went through for extranjeros.
I thought that when the president of Mexico chosen, Anrique Pena Nieto had visited White Saray this week to visit the President Obama.
Like the two countries' leaders at the day, it is always like when they met two country leaders: let the skin, drugs and drugs.
Pena Neo was encouraging to speak about the growth of Mexico in Mexico to enter into the United States until he was still staying in Mexico.
The United States and Canada wants to be common and to create a tactical blow in North America.
Pena Nieto swore to continue to fight the drug cards.
Relations with the United States to Mexico are full of smooth and unfair feelings.
In 1848, most Americans probably never thought that the United States had operated Mexico and that their leaders had been difficult to give half of their lands with difficult difficulty.
But not minutes, but some centuries are memory for the Mexicans everywhere.
This is why, when a US authorities said something about Mexico, you will begin to hear the decisions that the American neighbourhood has dealt with the Kingdom of Mexico.
And Montezuma's children goes on the way to fight.
And again, it's really a really difficult relationship for Mexico with more than 35 million in the United States.
Do you want to talk about immoral feelings?
There's too much.
The winners in Mexico and the loser people have the opportunity of the country and people who haven't created.
The only reason that many people have to live in the towns like the Mexican pools of Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio is to be a person in a point of view, perhaps a father or a grand father in Mexico, and have to leave to northern.
And mostly, this person dreams a profile – ten, less education, and vs from a fair village.
We are theirs and we will give them.
It's not mexic.
And now, though we live the American Slaughter, we can't see what we've found, and we're never going to get out of what we've found as a good job.
Our identity may sometimes be uncertain, but our trust is clear.
They are United States.
In addition, we know that most of the Mexicans haven't loved us in the manager class.
This feeling is responsible.
They're seeing us as an abusive newsgine, and they look up as a high group that has been uncomfortunate to us.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, and our links with Mexico are never so strong.
Our ability is about the complete deficiency of their eyes.
Our families wouldn't have been lost in Mexico.
And now we have not found us hidden by the backward of the U.S., but have been lost and lost spirits.
My wife who was born in Guadalajara, when children were lawful to the United States, remembers that they were Mexico's people, and that they were Mexico's Americans and Mexico's contracts.
Although it's a visitor, the U.S. seems to be a part of two countries.
At the same time, most of them are not feeling like part of the Mexican American two.
We like to listen to Bruce Springsteen, and to listen to Los Tigres del Norte.
You're getting the best two worlds, but you're not a dog.
We're seeing American in Mexico.
We are accepted as Mexico in the United States.
Now, as I learned in my trip, some Mexican leaders and some of your skills want to reconnect Diaspora.
They want to work to show their interests to the United States, Mexico, the recent Americans, Mexico, as an "Lands".
We're hard to say how beautiful it's a country like us to visit the Americans, and we're hard to strengthen their links with Mexico.
Yeah.
That won't.
There's a lot of feelings.
And most of us are not sure that this is a great country.
I'm afraid you're the only friends.
That's right.
At least some Mexicanians are still ready to remit to Mexico for a century before, then some Mexican Americans still have to accept their family members to be conducted more closely than this.
Hmmmm.
Maybe we're "Mics" more than I thought.
Old wars, New Central East
It may be an uncertainty for the fires between Israel and Hamas.
Should the Arabs and the Jews continue peace between the Middle East?
Another blood smoke shows that such a hope is empty.
Whoso's so much outcoming disputes have turned to a lot of buildings, most of the Philistines and six Israelites killed the great city of Israel, Tel Aviv, and the sanctuary city.
But when Israel and the Philistines seem to be burdened in the former storms, they changed in the Middle East.
And the Arabians took parts from the air, and did not be pleasant, but the Philistines, and the children of Israel shouted in the region.
Maybe this makes them more bloody than the old one.
Yet, there are reasons for thinking that they could disappear their murderers.
What a war that has been lost
It seems to be very hard to get right now.
And if he continued the fireholds accepted in the 21th Castle, he strengthened both sides of war in the week.
Since 2007, the German movement managed Gazze will indicate that Hamas's leaders are difficult to return Israel from Gazze.
He couldn't start to kill some of the leaders and destroy Gazze's 1,7 million people in the world and hold Israel's people in one of the pools.
Of course, Hamas Philistin now wins the middle of Philistines in Fatah.
Furthermore, Hamas's leaders can find the result that they're in their time.
In the Arab world, Hamas had strong and rich friends.
Israel's most widely resurrected regional power in Turkey, Katar, one of the most rich and dynamic duties of the Cruz, was the most wide.
The pleasant Hamas people say that he was an inspired Israeli rebellion, and that the king of Hamas was deployed by the King of the Army of the Hezbulla, who has grown in the north of Lawbour.
In addition to all, his brothers' high-speaking brothers in the southern Arab countries revealed clearly between the most important and important people in Egypt, under Muhammad Mursi.
In 2011, there was much less time for Hamas' Lake Lakes Governed Egypt until the fall of 2011.
At the same time, my sister Hamas's neighbor's friend and leaders are far more about the campaign of Hamas.
The future diploma can be defined as an actor who has not even been banned by Israel and America.
At the same time, Israel's officers will make a relaxed result.
He's laid back back to Hamas.
Demir Kuba proved the value of the anti-country system and most of Hamas was destroyed.
Israel will sleep more calm for a long time.
Diplomaticly, Hamas has decisively condemned Hamas as soon as never America has never been, and most of its European countries also have been engaged in the last warrant events.
Besides all, Israel grew up in Netanyahu’s headship, who had not seen the peace process in great measure.
Since 2004, the rucks from Gazze were killed by about 30 Israelites, Israel, who wanted to be part of the Philistines at the West and continued to expand the Jewish places to protect their local areas because of the intimidable bombers.
Likud Party's election in 22 October, Abigdor's greater warrior group, Mr. Netanyahu.
Why are these false Philistines giving their governments?
If they're actually running the West Jeriah, are they not hot fires like they've done in Gazze?
It's better to keep them behind the wall and cast them up their heads.
Maybe it's gonna gain the officers, and it's still possible to change the Arab guards.
And if the Sustainers won the power in Egypt, and other places like Israel are less, they're fighting for priorities in their homes.
Israel's defence union is greater than the Arab neighbors.
The local sovereign force will not help to resolve the economics of the new Arab governments.
Pragmatic Mr. Mursi worked together with Barack Obama and may have done the starting of something.
Israel's gotta look at a long time.
When the rest of the Arab world is more democratic, the Philistines are creating a busy bus in Tel Aviv a day, which is unremovable to escape in the areas of Israel's business.
The pressure in the Jewish government already blows the democracy, and the Arabian population grows.
He'll get a diplomatic diplomatic, who grows up against Hamas in a few years to raise Hamas.
There's a need for outdoor team on the two sides.
Most of the outer world and of the sensitive people who have been famous in this newspaper remains like two governments that Israel has been designed for security.
And if you're a little hopeful fire, it's a sense that the foreigners will give a little more pressure.
The Egyptian is now a better place to stop the arms of Gazze, Turkey, and Katar, which has been a Jewish government in 1967, accepting the country change and common coast.
The Arabs have to hard to meet Hamas and Fatah.
This is more useful than a secondary government proposal that is close to BM for a Philippian government.
And Mr. Obama is a role when I bring Israel to the table.
At the first time, he agreed to offer his peace plan.
It seems unlike to take into the white Saray.
It doesn't see a huge way.
There's a skill of life in the United States in the East.
This means a peace agreement between Israel and the Philistines.
Sigara's packing laws walking in Australia
Sigara warnings and disease organisms are placed in the left green boxs for all marks
Australia has entered the first laws in the world on cigarettes and drugs, and heats and babys who have been sigarys, and babys who have been sierrately sigarys.
The only important difference between the packages that will be marked in Saturday, with the same small type of letters.
I'm the most fucking drug to pack it in this world.
Australia's federal government says that young people's purposes are to disappear, degrading the shigar.
This, if they don't start cigarettes until 26 years of people, has been encountered by 9 percentages that they will never start.
"You can see that the children's children are working to sell the brands of their children," says, "and even a lot of the age of age," and the children showed the idea that their children are not a pretty logosis and are working with the federal health career of Tanya Pliber.
Although Australia has one of the lower sigar drinks in the world and changes will have much less impact on the fashion of many nations, other countries think that they are likely.
The pillar's industrialists made low lobbys against blood.
She said that the pillar's firms would support the black bottles, and they'll be able to send to the cigarettes more and more accessible.
The British American Tobacco from Australia Scott McIntyre said: "They will be no serious results of Jaasam."
Chinese and Indonesia's hearts will bring more of these products to sell Australia in the streets.
The others say that the laws have increased the work.
Zico Import of a small family company Pty Ltd from Sandra Ha ha ha, two months ago, the Silicion slaughters of the British American Tobacco, the Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco, were shot out of the high bloods in Australia.
Zico says he's sold more than 6,000 and waited for a new store.
It's a good job for us.
In the demography, the people say that it is the popularity of social media in which the potential atmosphere plan is calculated.
A magazine, Australian blood, has denied televisions and sponsority, and many soldiers wanted to hide the skills from places.
Australian local companies and sites have decreased the internet records, but marine sites can't decrease.
Becky Freeman said, "If you're in the area and know your products, this was only a little window in the University of Sydney, it's an officer where you need to join the record."
Freeman marks showed that it was an increase in the "gouvernemental" sites like YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
Does this Marlboro really like the civil skills?
The British American Tobacco said that the Australian industrialist was concentrated with new rules before it was paid.
Industria has continued to pay for the new regulations to the United Nations, Honduras, and the Dominican Cultural Republic, so that these countries have not been deprived by any of the countries in the World Ticaret Organization with Australia's important measure.
It's likely that a WTO decision is in the middle of 2013.
If we are more, the government said that she made them see with other countries who think of the same package decisions.
The first country, Canada, was the Canada's first country who made the advertising photos in 2001.
Now, Brizilia, Turkey and Ukraine were released to more than 40 countries.
England, New Zealand, South Africa and India are thinking more bloods.
Most of Australia's drinking a cigarette.
Images don't affect me.
I'm coming from seeing them.
When he bought a packet with all the lips, Victor El Hage, he said, "Take a cigarette and place."
If you need to be honest, there's just a reason for me to leave, she's my little girl.
Sydney's center said he's hard to hide the only type of package packages in the center of Sydney.
He said, "I've got an hour before I've gone, and now he's getting my four hours."
"It had to do all the people, then, well, our job was finished, we'd say we're gonna stop the board," he said, "to get their hands into the air.
A world's fashionful fishing team is very bad.
When we've lived mechanical difficulties in this thanksgiving day, and when we have to wait for another airport, I was five hours waiting for the airport.
So I've been a long time to think about smoothing.
I won't lie to you.
And if it was half days to wait for a flight in the air, it's pretty hard, books, magazines, and iPhone, I don't even talk about the smoking.
But the growing way some atcademics and children are impressive to enhance children.
They say that it's normal for us and our kids.
The brain is difficult to go to interesting tanks, and it may makes creative.
And most of us aren't able to try the smooths of the smoke because we're depending on the other.
So, do we have to be shot?
Yeah.
And no.
But I'll get back to it.
First of all, I wondered that a new story was a lot of less than many people.
In Canada, the University of Calgary is a professor of Green and Roman history in the University of Canada and says: "Submit: Living Tarih" (Jonevi University, 2011) does not say that Peter Toohey is the same.
"It's actually a very long history of the disappearance."
There's a Latin wall writing on Pompei's walls from the first century.
It's how we're going to deal with it.
This is that it has been defined many different ways and has been discussed, says Ontario, the teacher of the psychological university in Canada, John D. Eastwood.
After looking at the literature of research, he was defined as an attempt of an atmosphere of 100 personalism group, Professor Eastwood and his communications.
He said, "Whatever it's about to be hurt, it's not a person who wants to be impressed?"
He said, there's nothing to do in the mixture.
He said, "the test of the smooth mode and the slow-term feelings of the time are to be destroyed."
It may look like the depression of disappearance.
But professor Eastwood, they may be about but often people who are in the way of seeing the problem around or around the world, but they said people in depression would see their own problems.
Sometimes, when we're just going to be a concentration, we think we're crazy.
In September, Professor Eastwood and the Communities, the Psychologic Scientists, published in the magazine of the Psychology Research, signed a former test of the Destruction Agency.
Some groups have heard a high and high television program in the outside room, and others heard it very smallly, but the third group had never heard it.
Those who hear the television of two other groups have reported more frequently, they have lived difficult, but they weren't sure because it was a problem.
One of the writers in the Guelph University in the Ontario, said that it would be why you tried to concentrate in a hard or intermediate task.
On the other hand, when you read something painful, "Speaking out the bad tools in the one factory, you can help you to distract your attention from draging music."
In fact, it is usually likely to help people to fight with them as a mark of pain.
"There shows that children who have been allowed to be moved and have learned more than children who have been able to be moved," said Professor Phenske.
We're all attempting the trouble in some points, the aircraft, a monoton talker, a smooth movie.
But some of them have more often learned about others.
In 1980, researchers have developed a Destruction Death In 1980.
The death, "Much as I have to do is, most things I have to do again and monoton," and "I have a lot of interest, I have no time to do everything."
Stephen Vodanovich, who was a psychological professor at West Florida University, said that, in particular, researchers, were more and more widely needed to hear the need for men.
However, generally, it's a very bad group of pregnancy.
In 1991, the professor Reed Larson's human and community development in Illinois University made about 400 people and their parents in the day seven and eight times communicating the civilians.
Gentlemen found that 32 percent of their school and payment were shot, but when 23 percent weren't in school.
On the other side, the parents said that 3 percent of their parents were flown.
Professor Larson said he didn't know if the percentages are higher or higher.
But he said that when children and heroes wanted to do it, she knew it's the time of the warranty.
So I turn back my first question: is it good to hurt men?
Sometimes no, because it shows that people can lead to these agreements to play or use material.
On the other hand, professor Vodanovich said that many philosophs and writers have been connected between creativity and creativeness.
The N.Y., professor of psychological in the U.S. Gary Marcus, said, "It's in order to tell you what you have to do. "
But your mind always doesn't know what the most appropriate thing is to be done.
If you're scared, and if you're going to play this energy and use it to eat, it's gonna make you happy.
But if you see the television, it can make you happy in a short way, but it's not going for a long time.
So if you don't give a IPad to her when your kid is hungry, it can't be a bitch, but he doesn't learn to enjoy himself or to get herself, he said professor Phenske.
And she said, "It'll be transfer to the other case of editing yourself."
You don't learn to enjoy himself only, but it's more in other areas.
I don't think we're really glad to be disappointed.
We must not have to do so much elective.
Instead, our goal must be relaxed in far away without stepping China.
Professor Eastwood was taken.
"We need it more often, but it's a painful and unlawful sense," said he.
He said that it's a way to get out of the pit and get out of the empty time.
"It's difficult to find out the ways that we're noticed to be closed around," said she.
No Senaryo for the New Marihuana Law in Colorado
Anthony Orozco, 19th, southern Colorado university, and an university of an university in Anthony Orozco, with an offence to be accused in the nearest event: a few parts of marihuana and a pipe to drink it.
Mr. Orozco September one day, he told his friends to Lamar, when they stopped in the streets near the Kansas border.
When the police was found in the marihuana car, Mr. Orozco took a call for the movement and drugs and was given to the court.
"We have been acted as an offence," said Mr. Orozco.
But is that the one?
In the past few weeks, when Colorado's funeral uses, the Marhuan is a lot of the response of the blood of the small drug drugs.
Any hundreds of the fair offensive marhuana case is already closed in Washington's campaign with a team like therapy.
When the police units were 21 years old and high-level adults in the past weeks, they have left to be accurated to move small measurement to be concealed with him.
However, in Colorado more captive areas, the prosecutors were voting to decisively pursue the cases of marihuana and call for a trial to judge people because they are still moved.
At the same time, there are several villages that have been moved from Denver Banks to the West Mounts.
He said, "I don't know what's going to happen after one."
Washington's editors are driving their heads.
And the last history of 1 January 2013, they're trying to fix a license system for sale.
Now they say that the Colorado is so or that I'm used first or first, they say that it's most of them in the funeral use of the marihua.
Brian E. Smith said: "These will be a good way shower."
But there's no place or system that he can't do any more than it could propose what he's doing.
"There is no real example we're going to go," said she.
Washington's blood named I-502 will go into the 6th Strategy history, and it's not yet the legal license system but it's an uncertainty year.
There are difficult mechanical issues that must be solved at this time, and how the schools, parks, children parks or children look at the centres of the middle of 150,000 feet operating in the sandwich market.
"I'm Livingston," said the Legislative Kenevir Research Group, "the city can't be harder than the city's larger towns, especially Seattle's city region."
In November 21, he sent an e-mail to the officers of the city in Aurora, to go into the city lawyer, 21 years old and no one will open a small marihuana's disease and let the police people have the crime of these crimes.
Captain Oates told them that they would set the city students in the marihua laws and drugs to follow their vendors again.
Ken Buck, headquarter of the Norway Colorado, is a more fresh view in the North Colorado region.
After it, he said that most users would continue to be studied as a way to move Marhua to marhua.
At this time, 119 persons are accused of two or less in marihua against many other crimes.
Mr. Buck said, "When we live in our office, there's a difficulty to discover the crimes inside."
And even in places like the Royal Messians who refused the marihua's entertainment.
The greatest city of the town, the police in the Great Junction, don't have to deal with small adults.
The captain of the country, Pete Hautziner, supported this decision but decided not to close the trials to move in the same time.
He said, "I don't think I'm able to keep the blood until I'm changed."
In Colorado, 55 percent of those who were given in Colorado would never be easy to bring to the legal system.
And the discussions needed to be discussed in the area are a deep range of local powers.
The Defence lawyer and Marihuana Defenders said that Sean McAlister is a "cultural Bariyer".
And he said, "They have made their acts a lot of people, so they still don't accept that it is lawful."
In small mixtures, they are ready to be national testing cases like Marhuana and Colorado and Washington.
At the same time, while lawyers and government authorities are waiting for a new boundary plan for legal sales, the Federal Government is planning to draw close to marihua and production as a federal crime.
He hopes that the lawful advocates should be backed from the Advocate Minister.
In most cases, the Federal Government Colorado, Washington and the other 16 campaigns of marihuana were allowed to arrest high profiles and solds.
In the Governance of Obama, Kevin A. Saturday, the drug agents probably wouldn't have the doors to be drugs in order to deal with a small drug tube, but the pleasure that it was allowed to create new laws.
He doesn't expect a few federal authorities in Colorado to move.
Even before selecting the day, some local governments accepted the payment of the new marihuana discharges, which were nearly one year old.
The last week, Montrose has brought a law for six months in the west, and it's probably likely to accept it in the past week.
"We don't want to give someone a license, and we don't want to bring it to a great federal problem."
Our region was used against changes.
We're looking at that it's the region in which it's on it.
There's a lot of questions.

It's pretty bad for me, but they know that your father's Margaret Tacher is near, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Many officers are the first class of workers.

This tactical failure proved it.
A first PPE student who was in Eton, said, "You're the daughter of a farmer."
You're clean.
The other disciples kept themselves.

So I'll give you the most true, healthy and reliable news at the National Journal and Harbor.com.tr.
I'd like to get a sound file that brings it to the competitive.
We'll take these articles in our sections that will continue in the form.
You can find answers to all questions concerning denial.
You can take your questions that you don't have an answer and take specially concerning you.@hurresse.com.tr.
I'll be in the street to answer you at the shortest time.
What's wrong with?
MALULEN is the unprecedented work of the age of work, at least 60 percent, which could not work in the SSK and Big-Kur's situation, in order to condemn the lives of the SGK, which are counted by the safeguards, which could not be revealed early to them.
When the workers are working, they can't be able to make their vacuums apart from the top, as well as in the situations that they have lost their powers.
Who's going to say?
I write from the diarmaster, my name, Majest Fortlekin, I'm 920 days I'm ensuring security and I'm only 540 days with my military payment, 1460 days.
Furthermore, I'm a kid sick.
I'm connected to the diagnostic machine.
I'm working on a half worker.
Can I get a penalty pen?
- The best Bey's past first.
You haven't seen when you've first worked in your problem.
However, let's just tell you how the deceased is.
First of all, the most important circumstances identified in the blood have been secured since 10 years, and your total first day should be 1800 days.
Moreover, you're supposed that you've lost 60 percent of your work, or case or disease results in the collective force.
However, because you're diagnostic disease here, you're not allowing the 60 percent of the time you're not fitting the summit.
Of course, we don't know how many years you worked.
The day that you have completed your disasters, and the day of your day, in 1800, you shall be revealed to you in a month.
Conditions of real winning for the month
Should there be no one who has been a 1800 days without a decade?
- The prize rate of payment is to be completed in 1800 days.
However, there is a only desire, and he has decided that another is constantly decisive for those who have decided that it has been an safeguard period for 10 years, unrecovered resistance to other circumstances.
What kinds of diseases or disappearance will be defined in the future of our progress in the future.
The situation of the events to be resolved before starting
I'm Ahmet Woler.
I'm taking all the circumstances in the SGK, and they told me, you can't take a back to the first time before I'm sick.
I'm so crazy.
Isn't it wrong?
How am I going to do?
- Ahmet Bey, you've written that you've made all the circumstances in the law but that's one of the mother's conditions, and that's not one of the SSKs and the SSKs placed in the blood before the loss of the diseases.
It's not possible that you can't move this record because you don't have to move it.
Yet, you can be able to make your intentions without prejudice.
- I have 3980 days, and I'm 16-year-old.
It was designed by SGK before I come into my defence.
They told me you can't be a bitch.
What I'm doing in this case.
I'm not going to be smooth.
Will you show your way?
- Yeah, you've heard it.
You can't be a massive.
But in the SGK law, there is a provision for you.
I mean, before April 2008 and then there are two situations.
If you're starting to work before this date, the SGK will always be abolished before you work, you can receive at least 15 years security period and 3600 premium days with an elderly agency number of days.
We therefore suggest you that you will be in the request of a month to join you with the nearest Head of the Society.
- And if you were working after my earlier 2008, then you could have been ensured for at least 15 years since and at least 3960 days of abuse, age and death security.
Do you want to get away from here when you busy?
I'm working as a spot in a worker.
When I went to the hospital, she made me a cancer known to me.
I want to be a bitch.
Do I have to leave the job in this case?
Can't I start a month without disappearing?
I don't want to stay unemployed until you're busy.
- You've heard it.
It's necessary that you've got to be separated for a month-based desire.
But before you start the months, you'll need to be numbered by your SGK blood.
But if you're wrong, it's a month with you.
There is no meaning that a month connection wants to be paid, and you've got a risk to remain unemployed.
It's enough to be your 1800 days for that.
When you're going to SGK, you'll like to love you to one of the patients authorized.
And when you're taking the health report you're taking from here, the SGK will be a reason for you to assess the report in your health, and your cancer disease will decide that you'll have an impact on 60 percent of the month.
However, if you have to fill the 10-year security period, it will be possible to connect you a month.
So, we can shortly say this, it's not an understanding of the SGK's health office without seeing your "related" decision.
But if the guards working in any event, they may ask that the SGK and the disappearance of the situation and the month may be connected.
And if this happens, and the other ways are stoned, it may be a bit early monthly shot for the starter.
Did it be to make the low-Kur borrow?
I'm low-Kur protector.
I'm driving all the ways.
However, they said you can't be deprived because it's my reward.
What I have to do.
- I'm amazing.
He told you whoever he told you.
You didn't write what's the other way but if you think that you're taking these ways, 4/b is difficult to pay your prims.
But I can give you a special tiyo.
I suggest you to pay your tax banks or buildings like this.
As soon as soon as soon as you'll get a lot of months, and you're paying a minute ago.
These buildings will be easy to be paid because they've been abolished from your month.
What is the stage of disappearance?
The SSK and Bach-Kur, and I, of course, worked for the Emekli Sanctuary.
When I'm lying my feet, where'd the month get to me?
If you're working on more stations as the SSK and the peasant, you're the latter, you're in a security fault, so you're safe, and you're going to move the last month from the SSK.
SGK is also the valid hospital reports
How is it going to do?
Can I get a health report from the hospitals?
It's enough for you to start social security media or social security centres for health reports.
I have learned you, and I will love military hospitals with the Turkish Army's hospitals, university hospitals.
However, in the case that you have not revealed, these hospitals can also be adjusted to the highly deployed hospitals of health.
It's possible to love a special hospital, right?
- You know, it's like it.
In the former regulation, only governmental hospitals can be slacked and lived with the risk of risking patients to be made to hospitals, 01.09.2013, which will be able to go into a new administration with SGK, which is now an interacting treatment in the environment and to see another hospital’s lives that can have a personal risk of patients to be improved, and that you have received health reports here.
What are the definitions searching for love operations?
It's enough to be the primary time of 1800 days of the civilization occurred in the SEVK demand.
The hospitals in relation to the hospital will be paid by SGK.
Moreover, 10 years' security periods will not be searched, and SGK looks at this.
In the situation of the disobedience of the month, if the person is in the meaning of an important deficit, 10 years of security period only in 1800 days, according to the report of health.
This is why when the person has come to the first time in the detention of the defence, I think it's likely to be able to deal with the SGK only in the 1800 days.
Remote operation

Well, you knew that you could stop the terrorist with sound technologies, you can operate with a fair sound frequency, you would like to love the person you would like to be able to admit you a secret, or you can allow the world’s ritm.
South Pamir, after the Mimari University ended the Mimari University in England, he took sound diplomacy from the SAE college and made a master of sound technologies at the Middlesex University.
My Communication technological technicians is also expanding sound engineering in the ITM and gives music technology, sound technologies, performance technologies, electronic music and יותר record technologies.
Subliminal message
"What's the sound technology exactly?" The first question.
"A technology that can be used in many places in the world.
Our brain is getting everything with electrical senses.
The sound frequency is a kind of electricity, energy.
You can allow people to move with the command you want."
And one of the most important subliminal messages of the sound technology.
The new message is placed in a frekans out of a flower border, which can't be defined by this top memory, but it's going to be lower.
For example, Pamir's reporting a terrorist attack to that area.
The terrorist field will choose this message to be changed to a changing changing song like "Don't do this attack".
It doesn't understand what it's about, but the lower beauty gets it, and a voice out of the inside comes like she's called "apain".
He will even see it as a message from Allah.
However, there are certainly lawful and punishment in the world and Turkey that these messages are used without social security.
But southern Pamir has been prepared a sublimal message in a conference which was given to students in the United Nations.
"I listened to music during the conference to students.
I put a sound in the music for Suu.
I asked them at the end of my Sun, they couldn't stop the students.
They've told all that they've been very dreaming."
According to Pamir, there are subliminal message users, "There are some radio channels that have done it in our land, but the details are still unknown.
There's a canal in Germany, "Cara Seine Radyosu", a frequency of radial islanders.
The subliminal method is published messages that are commanded to use drug prison.
The German police also knows Turkish police, but it can't be started because they've changed the frecans.
In addition, this kind of dangerous messages was used in the music world.
In particular, some heavy metal groups are...
According to these ideas, there was no terrorist in the aircrafts that entered into the flights, and the direct attack of direct pilots has been implemented with subliminary teams of high knowledge.
Swimmingboard
Sound technology can be used in crimes.
It's from this science in the U.B., especially in bank skills.
For example, when the police moves on the telephone to the theme, they can find out where the sound engineer's bank is, where he's in his room.
A sound metal, the throne, the plastics, the wall or any other material.
And it can be possible to define the size of the room that is in the shadow of the sound format, even the shape of the room, how many oxen it is.
Thus, the sound of the offendant can be advised by what kinds of substances there are in a room and in a way.
And there was a computer program used that Pamir had even made the buildings of a Tataristan's operational building, "I know where 175 holy planning can be provided to the perfect sound regulation.
It's not a paid technology, but $4-5,000."
Sound frequency is also used in the mixture and decoration.
Pamir's got a lot of jobs about it.
There was a regulation where his workmen went, in a relocation of the upper substantive meetings, which the voices couldn't come out of the table.
Only those who are talking at the mass can hear the ones in the table.
Nobody more than two steps can't hear anything talking at the table.
The general system of these types of regulations is: "If you want to destroy a sound, you're decreased in the same frequencies, you'll beat it with another sound and you're going to destroy the sound energy.
If this system is not this, no one could go to the flight.
Because the sound of the air motors is so high.
The voices in the air will be stirred up each other.
Even if your system and your windows are open, you can create a long-term environment in your house."
Have Egypt piramides been made with the voice?
There are other interesting work from Pamir's first sound engineers of Turkey.
It was a regulation that has been made on a open air disk in Availability, a sound of music that can't be heard out of the air disk.
The sound can't go beyond the border, it's disappeared with another sound frequencies.
Even in a room, it can be made quiet after a row.
The Pamir's school spor salon, and the spor and the concert.
So it's used for two.
Because it's gotta need to play the basketbol when it's playing, but it's got to be not in the concerts.
Only in the commenting concerts, there is a sound catalysis that can be heard only with sound technologies.
"We use frekans that destroy the sounds that are disappeared as a ghost, and that will be able to disappear the music.
MTV's very far on this.
He says, it's a remarking concerts, and it's sounding smodyo in the sound area.
The test was like that.
The sound frequencies separates two aliminiums from each other.
There were scientists who described that the piramites were made with the voice of the Egyptians.
They thought it could be removed and placed.
I'm asking, "I'mn't it with an unfortunate use of bad purposes?"
"I was afraid when I read the York University work from the Internet, so he reads others.
For it answers the good persons who are well-knowledged, except the laboratory conditions, and they may cause evil results.
"Dualar's effect by the Arabia."
And the sudden Pamir said: "For all the voices of your ears are reported to the hearts of your ears.
The sovereign people hear that they're only concentrating, but other voices are reported to the brain, and they're getting carefully.
So it's good to be done to walk on the ground, to make the natural walks.
I think regulations should be set up in schools.
So the student will concentre the voice of the teacher's only, and it can provide a longer concentration."
The Pamir said that it's a very rich frequency of the sound frekanses, and if the prayers believed that it's been an impact of the Arabians, it has a very rich frequency of the Arabians, when the words come to the side of their voices, it's a lot of potential effects.
"But you need to read the prayers soundly, and I'm going to read the Yasin wall. "
Frekansla Love Tariff
"Is it possible to love someone with sound frecans?"
Not loved Pamir's, but more true person's feelings to move, saying: "Therefore you need to find the frequency of the person you want to speak when you want to love.
You can affect it using a higher frecans than this frecans.
For example, let's think that the press person's fashion is 300.
And you want to play a music to cancel your feelings.
If you're disappearing music, the only flower flowers of the 300 frecans fall into the strength of the only low-based flowers, and you're still pressing the low-based capabilities of that person.
Maybe this might be loved to the one who is in the presence of that moment."
The Pamir said that they can speak more effectively of the sound systems in the world, when the press sounds have been made up to the plan, a political artist can feel like a highly wonderful one.
And he said, "There is a sound that Mikail's in the day of the sweet, which he has believed to be made, and how will it be? And Pamir's answer said, "There will be a sound close to the voice of the human, because the voice of the people is close to his voice.
"What is a wonderful object, as is produced from human rebellion."
'He's going to rise up.
In Canada, Jennings Capital Inc., an Analist Dan Hrushewsky, said that it was trying to decline the value of the ones in order to reduce their money, so he will continue to be a road for the present higher of the gold.

There's only 400,000 of the TL films that have been taken with the films, there's no big fountainment and cake.
We wanted to follow the story of a real cardinal story today by the Head of Senema.
The skills made in the Acassabat Kissoon and the whole designer players' film, which was the 1980 film of the Tepenin Ushers, was a pleasant picture.

Besides, there is one of the greatest campaigns that they have made on the towns around and a war against the villages on the hill.
It's a long metraya from a smoke movie.
The Senator of the Galada film and Dr. Ismet Era explained about the 80-year-old campaigns:
"When we start to this movie, our purpose was to make a short film.
But the first screens of social media saw so much interest that we were exciting to hear us to take a long metal.
They told us when we went to Itanbul's distributor, "Do we have a player?"
I said, "We don't have thanks, but I've 86, and I've got a cardiac game."

Everything has become a little bit of my immature!
The books of the students who read in common school were recognized and renewed as a media student.
MEB, a year after education 4+4+4 has been transformed all the first schools in Turkey, media and images in the school.
Following the 1-year education period, a new scenario has been re-examining the number of schools in turn, during transformation processes.
In Turkey, all the schools who have been engaged in the middle school in Turkey have come to my day, the "Reversie" of Konya, which was in the Medium Language of Sheker, which was established in the Central Regional Cultural.
1 Year of normal environment
My first school, four+4+4 past year after the edit.
In school, the system currency had studies to be used to go to another school, 3 and 4. Averages with 6, 7 and 8 classes, students.
The school, which served normally as a common school, has been impressed with the end of the 2012-2013 learning year.
I believe, I accepted his students as a student of my school for the first time this year.

"With a number of schools, we've turned back to the bests of students and school numbers, and we've made some schools again with the Konya Valley, and in my head, it's been a prejudice of 15-20 schools in Conya.
Students join the e-chool system with the school codes.
However, the former school is abolished from the ancient school code of the system.
The new school code is to be opened to the system's students.
The schools and the kind of schools used the new code of the school, and the teachers, because they had not been punished in the middle school.
And those who wanted to take their children's natives from these schools and can give them to other schools.
