Triumph of the legal populations in Austria, overall, at 29 per cent
A splendid weakness of both parties of the present large coalition and a significant strengthening of the legal political parties has resulted in the first predictive results of the elections of Parliament from Sunday in Austria.
Specially lost the Austrian People Party (EVP), where the position of the present President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the kippe.
In contrast, the elector of the Congress for the future of Austria (BZE), the host of the Statehauptmann Jörg Haider, for a triumphale return to federal policy.
According to the present results, the Social Democracy (SPE) remains 29.8 percent of the voices in the country, but the last elections in 2006 lost 5,5 percent of the votes.
The EVP is still worse, lost by 25.6 percent of the voices almost nine.
These are the worst results of these two large parties in the Austrian post-age story, and especially in the people party that had requested elections, that is a really catastrophal result.
On the beginning of July, when the EVP was out of the coalition, the People's Party had a clear prejudice before the SPE.
However, the electors have probably disagreed the parties to make the government craft.
In the first reactions on the results, there were specializations about a possible reduction of the participant and to the present Vicecanzlers Wilhelm Molterer.
The observers believe that this could already be on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the Party's Party's case.
This development is likely to be the way to the most likely exit from the chosen box, so renewing the great coalition from SPE and EVP.
In view of the strengthening of both popular parties, the liberty (FPAU) had received by 18 percent of the votes, BZE eleven percent, but the Social Democrats, at the same time, expressed their fear that 1999 could repeat when the People's Party with the People's Debates (the FPU was still unique, in 2005 she had taken himself from the BZE) for a common government, which had even produced sanctions from the European Union.
On this development, evidently, Jörg Haider, who already explained that he was ready to cooperate with each party and leaves from return to Vienna into the Austrian Federal Policy.
The Parliament also introduced the Greek parties, but it was easy lost and in the Austrian political parties from the third to the fifth place.
No other party has probably met the four-procentages and has thus not entered into Parliament.
Blackenberg: Relations with India
If it is not enough to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who have been accused in India because of the illegal collection of bugs, it could be seen by the Czech External Minister Karel Blackenberg in a certain removal of the Czech-Indian relations.
This was the Minister in New York after the present meeting with his Indian officer Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not wise, then safe, then it comes to a certain choice," he explained after a meeting held to a Tscho initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the discussions, the executive can only be difficult.
Nevertheless, he argued that in the case of Petr Úvácha, who was freed by the complaint and received a moneystratee, the central government with the local government in Dardjiling wished, in which the matter is to fall.
" His problem could be discussed," said the Minister.
For Emil Kučera, who has been condemned to three years of liberty, it would be the best view of Mukherdshis if he would go to a higher instance in vocation.
He could like this for liberalization to Caution and wait in liberty for his judgment, so the Minister.
Blackenberg confirmed that his partner was exactly expressed in negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal at a higher court, then a complaint in question," said the chief of the Czech Diplomation.
The only way in which the Tschech side can take into the whole affair is to enhance the "competent legal support", the Indian Minister.
At the same time he said that such a help will already be commanded by the Indian side.
"We have a great interest in obtaining good contacts with India who have a long-term tradition.
The Indians also give it," the Blackenberg brought.
At the same time, the Tschech Pressessage Agency confirmed, before his partner, the Czech Republic addressed the problem of the Czech Demologs.
"We really keep it for a huge mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists," he said.
An answer to the question whether he has received from the Indian side the admission to address the matter, even though the minister.
"Mir has already been a lot of promise," he just said.
A Czech judges the ring around the seaground
He moves to an electronic card, formed by Australia and the border sea areas.
However, it is not the continent, but a small point, lost in the Ocean Blue.
"The island belongs to Australia and together with her the border sea reason.
The area is so large as the continent itself," the Italian jurisdict Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the thirty-hoc worker of the United Nations Division for Oceans and Sea.
His Chief, Director of the Division, the Tsychical Jurist Václav Mikulka, follows the exhibition and complements.
This is the domination of workers and mystery.
The sea reason has only a little known world that is rich from natural sources.
This is to find land oil, from larger heat and other non-early raw materials, but even not known organisms that have the key to develop a medicine against cancer.
A Sea Foundation, greater than the festival
Today, the indigenous countries reported their approach to the new sea areas.
Following a UN Convention, they have used their rights to be assembled in Montego Bay in 1982 to Jamaica.
It is particularly about the area of the so-called continental scene, which is often reaching some hundred kilometres away from the Upper of a country to the sea.
In accordance with this Convention, the Convention has exclusively affected all the sources of the continental board.
"Expressed simply as continental board is considered the part of the sea ground and its soil, which represents a natural continuation of the continent under the sea surface.
He translates the borders of the Uppermeer, often also the border of two hundred seeds of the exclusive economic zone," says Mikulka.
The application submitted by the Commission's country to establish the external borders of the Continental Scheme shall be made by a large scientific documentation, which is maintained by many cost-intensive surveys and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparation work.
"Their tasks are to provide the Commission legally and easily technical support.
The Commission has discussed five applications, including Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Until now, the three recently called countries have been successful," added Mikulka.
On a international Echo strike shortly with Australia's success, which clearly increased its sea areas as the first country.
However, Neuseeland is also a winner - the extension of the marine boundary that has been authorized to the country last week by the Commission is approximately 1,6 million square kilometres, so about six times more than the size of the actual State.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigations.
The gain that will be included to them in the future from the use of the sea ground will be as they promised have an unvaluable value.
Additional States will also submit their requests.
You can do this for ten years from the moment in which they ratify the "come from Montego Bay".
Where the Continental Schelf ends, the ocean boundary which is named by the Convention as "common heritage of humanity".
Then there is no State inside any speciality here.
The right to promote in this area provides an international institution established by the Convention.
"The ocean ground is not a gold-grover country," says the Director Mikulka, and adds the "individual areas are accurately defined and the system is reliable.
Czech in Pacific
A part of the sea boundary is today also of the Czech Republic.
It shares him with other States of the former Eastlock within the common organization "Intertracean metal".
This has received 1991 on the basis of the Convention, as well as the investors of some other States, the status of a "trafficked investors".
The organization has the right to promote the zone ClarionClipperton in the style of the ocean between Mexico, Hawai and Kiribati.
The area to investigate the investor is something greater than the former Czechoslovakia.
The marine boat is in the place, it is a sort of tatra on the seaground.
"Foods can be offered on a area of a total of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area is a real foundation of polymetall concretions containing Nickel, Kupfer, Kobalt and Mangan," another jurisdiction, the Inland Pakshi Rajan.
The Mazedonian employer of the Division Rober Sandev offers such concrement as a pattern.
She remembers a small cartoff or, with something phenomenon, to the famous shame that leagued after the Golem to life.
The German special forces were placed at home.
The Egyptian Government had requested aid from Germany to solve experts.
When it was serious, the specialities were ready, but they did not use.
For the circumstances of release, eleven in Egypt, European tourists are always known more details.
The rescue action was also involved in directly in the German special forces according to the defence and internal defence department.
After this, both federal specialists and officials of the GSG 9, the Federal Police Federal Police, the Federal Criminamt and the Logistics of the Technical Assistance Work on the place of release.
As the speakers of the ministry continued to participate on the Montague, the German forces were not needed because the prisoners had left their prisoners and fled when they had recognized signs for a mighty release.
The Egyptian Government has adopted aid proposed by Germany to join them as a support force.
"There is not happy," said a speaker of the Federal Minister.
The travel group of the five German, five Italians, a Roman and their eight Egyptian meetings had taken out on 19 September in the south of Egypt.
After the introduction in a wilderness in the southern Egypt land, the ships in the border between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Tsjad were disappeared and disappeared.
The identity of the partners remained in the last uncertainly as well as the details of exemption or possible loan payment.
The settlers have arrived in a well-being in Kairo.
Steinmeier said that the free seals would be in the obhut of the German message.
He did not express the details of the release.
At first, in Berlin there was no information when they returned to Germany.
According to "Picture" the five vacants and special forces must be equipped with a air bus and joined in the Sunday in Germany.
US Representative House does not lie to rescue package
The first room of the U.S. Congress has made the 700 billion dollars rescue packages for the financial markets to be completely crafted.
The Dow Jones went out in the deep.
By 206 to 227 votes, the US Representative House rejected the Government's saving package for the financial markets.
Despite all appeals of the US President George W. Bush and leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the program which the Chaos should be assigned to the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the complaints had tried to convince the criteria yet serious packages of the 700 billion dollars.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiations managers, had called the Members to agree, even if the plan was unpopular.
"It's difficult to get political recognition for the disappearance of something that's not yet come," he introduced.
During the vote, the Dow Jones took more than six percent or about 600 points.
For reason, the investors were concerned that the State Rescue Package could create.
It was soon before the end of the vote, so that, after the notes of the shipman, he took place again.
The experts are now calculated with further severe tourbs on international financial markets.
For the entry into force of the programme, the approval of both the Deputy House and the Senate is needed.
Reference higher booking numbers of events
It seems to be a good winter for the German travelists:
For travel books for the coming months, the recurrence in comparison to the previous year has significantly increased, even more than 30 percent of wintersaison.
Despite the weak conjuncture views, the travel losses of the Germans remains unfortunate.
In the bookings for wintersaison, the buses identified a more than 31 percent of the previous year, as the German travel connection (DRV) shared on Monday in Berlin.
The investigation of the GfC market research Institute also provides the amounts of booking increased for the months of origin.
Thus, the expenditure of the travel officers for October 11 percent compared to 2007 was part of the DRV.
The basis for these results is the numbers of the GfK, which are evaluated a monthly booking data of 1200 German carriers and higher for the total market.
The travel books have been completed until the end of August 2008.
The DDR participated through the weak dollar currency, particularly in the United States travels.
This is a third of the booking purchase.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the homework filters with the German special travel targets.
In particular, DRV President Klaus Laepple has been high in the course.
In view of increased energy and food costs here, the costs are "for customers are better calculable than for individually organized vacation".
The money could be used to spare the consumers by early book-based batteries or all-including offers, the Laepple said.
The months also have been very well prepared so that it would be a further expenditure to the previous year - although in a further study the number of Germans who had a trip in comparison to the previous year.

Name of the accident sacrifice from the police
The name of a 63-year-old female female female female who stayed in the hospital after her aged in Essex was known.
Carole Paulson, in the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the accident on Friday afternoon on the Shenfield Road in the middle of the city.
She was led to Queen's hospital house in Romford, but he was late later.
A 51-year-old man was determined after the accident because of the defence on easy travels.
In addition, he was released to Kaution.
Turkey expands diplomatic horizontal
A long time before Turkey joined the European Union, the European volumes were interested in entering deep into the Inland of Turkey.
On the east side of the Bosporus, perhaps just once 20 steps within Asia, is one of the most crucial relictions of this unfair, caiserous efforts.
The Hydarpasha Bahnhof was established by the two German architectures Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
That's at least what the travel manager tell you.
The building remains ritlings at the end of the train road with a tour on each side of the front page and looks like any provincial German Council house.
The rock is terrified.
The whole building disappears about
But if you are once within the busy card shot, there is no doubt about the existence of the project, which was the most western access.
A German consortium was opened in August 1908, the Anatolien-Bagdad Society.
Germany, who was a afternoon in the imperialist game, had to be used before his ambitions to dominate the Middle East, through a join to Damascus, Bagdad, and further after what Saudi Arabia is today.
However, the imperialist projects of Germany were adopted during the first world war.
His railways were attacked by the Lawrence of Arabia and its Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, produced by the unsearchable borders of the war, is destroyed.
The British forces came out of Egypt and drove the Turks and their German commitments from Palestinia and Syria
And there were bad news for the Hyderpasha Bahnhof.
In 1917, a munition moved to the air, and the artistic dance was destroyed.
Turkish sources say it was Saboday.
Since it was slowly disappeared, slowly through the story.
But today, at least, this railway line is to be symbolized as a Tor to Anatolien and in all the eastern ways to expand the expandment of the diplomatic orthography of the ceiling.
The regimentary justice and development Party, the ACP, has introduced a valid new external policy for the country.
The relative isolation of the nearby regions, produced by the borders of the Kalte War, is destroyed.
It is now a policy of approach.
The Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian Splitter groups Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq and, of course, to the European Union and the United States.
In order to assess the eck data of the new external policy, I have taken the night relax in the Turkish capital of Ankara to visit one of the leading external policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish Deputy Suat Kiniklioglu.
On the next morning, about ten hours later, after a holoprig journey to Gleisen produced the same term of the old world in the known documentation "The Night Mail", I came to the Turkish capital, which was a new city for the new world's project to return the ocean past.
However, the AKP, known for their islamist roots, represents a paradigma change in the Turkish unit
This has issued some of mistrusts in Western, especially in Washington.
A Taxi has brought me to the AKP's main office, specially established, supermodern stone and steel construction, in a developed town, for a half completed purchase centres and kitchens in which middle managers are in terms, both men and women, were closed to the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a mid-right politics of almost every other political party of Europe.
Come on, Krawatte, I'm sure he's even packed a blackberry.
"The goal of the external policy of the Party is now to reinforce Turkey with their neighbouring countries.
"The Kalte War was an exception," he told me.
Turkey was divided by their homeland.
Today, it has to look at East and Western at the same time.
It would not be the one or the other.
You should do both.
"But certainly, the Turkey could sometimes," I asked, "the delays are to decide?"
"The Turkey," he said, "If you don't have to make this decision."
He took a point that is the white of everyone with whom I said here, whinnight rutinously replied: Turkey relations, not only to the Middle East, but also to the cookos and around the black sea, are exactly of the benefits for Europe and the United States, as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on the boat, the message seems to be, in translated meaning, Europe can go to east railways east Asia and the Middle East.
Back on the Hydarpasha's Bahhof, after a further late sleeping night, I thought to these two German governments, Mr Ritter and Mr Conu, who had been seen at the construction of this work over 100 years ago.
They were surprised to know that Europe's ambitions in the Middle East now could be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting for the farms to bring me back over the Bosporus, I remembered that Turkey was called "the dark man of Europe" in those days.
At least, at least, it was not a lot of doubts about what continent should have an appeal on this faucing country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical leader since 1962, Vernon was "Tod" Handley (Tod Call on 11 September) responsible for the Guildford Philharmoniker and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded his great youth, Proteus, next year.
He was thinking about youth to 21 years, but when the elector was the last time in 1979, some of us were the end of 20 years -- we refused to leave the elector slightly.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological formswechsler) was for the benefit and ability of the Chores, every musical fitness that was presented to him, either whether it was a madrigal or the Messias, whether a capella or with full orchester.
The musical diversity of such a young chore was often amazing, constantly unique and unique thanks to the inspiration of that man and his reverence for the music, which has never come back over years.
How often we have put on death to "the music to speak for himself."
He tried to say, "The composer knows what he wants."
It's all in music.
So it can't!"
His kind of direction was absolutely clear and precise, never reignly but never overwhelming.
How high the musical level was, he continued to call a more higher.
John Frayn Turner writes:
If any giant had to be killed to the ritter, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well in the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmoniker.
In the last 40 years, I wrote criticians for over the hundreds of his concerts, and I can be sure that I never was disappointed by one - often I was inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal discipline.
He rejected your giants, according to his words, simply went to steal one or two known guards in the world.
Many of us will hurt him.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
In your call for William Woodruff (25 September), you write that "In 1946, he was recognized the economic story in Oxford and received a Houblon Normman Research Stamm... while he studied the same time for a BSc, a MA and a doctorgrad.
This is a conclusion from a author notice in Woodruff's book "It's part of Nab End", yet it does not.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a decent of the economic story at the University of Nottingham, and at this time he wrote a doctor on the British Cautschuk industry under the subjection of professor J.D. Chambers, which was published later in 1958 as "The British Cautschuk industry".
He was in 1950-1951 in the United States in the hill of Houblon-Norman Stipendiums, and was distributed from 1952 to the Universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 Nottingham left finally and went to Illinois.
It is not known why Woodruff wanted to hide this part of his train.

The second round of the outstanding sale at Honda.
In November Honda begins with marketing the second generation of Honda Jazz.
During his advancer model had a large internal space, this large space-life offers a significantly larger.
This will also be the technical features that are allowed to make the benzin easier and flow.
Changes before the previous revolution.
So is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although he has seen a ästhetic, which shows a new Jazz line similar to his progresser, the changes that have been made in this greatly greatly heavy are numerous.
In addition, the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger sizes of the car and the new mechanisms must be stressed.
However, before analyzing the new model, you must say that this new Jazz is six years later after the first generation appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda was able to renew the other producers for a shorter time of this model.
Although Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon, which concerns its sale on the other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where Jazz is the most saled car of 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After the market in Jazz, only in Japan was sold about a million models.
The second paragraph market was the old continent, with about half million cars sold in six years.
However, Honda is trying to increase the sale of the new Jazz model within the segment.
In this way, while Japan’s companies sold a total of 83,000 models of Jazz in 2007, the expected amounts of 10,000 cars are 17% of the accepted increase in the European market.
As regards the Spanish market, Honda has sold 8,000 Jazz models since 2002. These are 6.7% of total sales in Honda in Spain.
With regard to the new generation of the model, the leaders of the Philippal can sell 2 000 Jazz models per year.
Gentlemen, it allows the appearance of the new Honda Jazz Models to complete sales in Spain.
In fact, the heads of the brand hope to complete the year with the total sale of 22 000 models. These are less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this sales purchase, Honda has increased its market share in Spain against the previous year (1.6%) to 1.8%.
At the same time, the Japanese company must reach 2 % in 2010.
To achieve this share, Honda sets on the appearance of a new model.
It is insight to sell a hybrid car with 5 gates and compact size of 4,7 meters long, which Japan’s undertaking offers approximately 200 000 models per year throughout the world.
The market estimates of the Japanese producer shall be sold 50% of insight models in the United States, while the remaining share in the old continent and Japan is distributed.
The appearance of the insight on the market is intended for the first months of the year, first time, its public presentation in Valencia will be held in January.
With regard to the first generation, the new Jazz grows in all its sizes.
His length is 3.90 meters ( more 5 centimeters ), its width is 1.69 meters ( more 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axis is 2.50 meters, which leads to the adoption that it has increased 5 centimeters.
The height does not change and remain 1,52 meters.
Along with the increasement of the sizes, the internal area is also increased.
This success is to thank the new space flexibility program and on the other hand, the central position of the raw material box, a solution that was used in the Jazz model.
The capacity of the carrier, which has a system of the double surface, reaches up to 339 litres, so 19 litres greater than the capacity of the first generation of the carrier.
It should be emphasized that these measures are available at the version with a 1,4 liter benzin motor, since the capacity of the Honda Jazz buying area is with a 379 liter engineer of Honda.
In other improvements, besides additional equipment elements such as leather or the possibility of panorama windows, a better access to the sites will be offered.
The opening of the backdoors is 80 degrees, whereas the first jazz was only 67 degrees.
The engines of the second generation of Jazz are also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 performances of the Benzin motors: 1,2 and 1.4 liters.
The two variables have i-VTEC system, which allows lower fuel consumption and smaller CO2 extracts, has great technical performance and at the same time provides dry-moving performance for the whole motive cycle.
The first variation of 1,2 liter allows the performance of 90 PS at 6 000 threads with maximum dry motion of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1.
This Benzin motor - Jazz's predominant model reached 78 PS - has 5,3 Liter benzin consumption and CO2 extracts of 125 grams.
With regard to the advancer motor reached by 83 PS at the previous generation, he is now able to get to 100 PSs.
The Jazz 100 PS model 1.4 has 5,4 liter benzin consumption and 128 gram CO2 extension.
`Auto-Biene', which prevents collections
In order to predict the development of technologies for accident prevention, Nissan has been inspired by nature, more precisely by the goods.
The Japanese company has developed a robot, whose aircraft returns to the retail of goods and prevents accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car Robot Drive or BR23C and sets the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineerings of the Nissan Motor Co's technical development centre have developed these small robots in cooperation with Research Centre for Advanced Science and Technology of the University of Tokio (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the leader technology-PR and R-D-Brand Management, BR23C is an extension of the fourth Nissan security ships.
This robot will ensure that the cars of these brands are in a position to avoid collections.
During the airport, each good builds its own, ovalfurm airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan security ship.
However, the most important are the factors of the goods that can see over a kitchen of 300 degrees in all directions that allow you to flood in their personal airspace without extending.
The technicians developed the Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notes the obstacles to BR23C from away to two metres and stand at the radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a sign to a border micro processor which is translated directly in signal for the disappearance of the collection
'In the moment when it is noted, the small robot will imit the good flight and immediately changing the direction by turning its wheels around 90o or more winkels to avoid the collection.
The largest difference in other systems is that this extra manager is absolutely instinct.
If it was not so, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles," said Toshiyuki Andoh, the Director of the Laboratory for Mobility and the Head Ingenieur of this project.
In the difference of a good, the robot can not disappear up or downward, but does not also overlook; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows him to move his wheels and not into the infinite directions and infinitely as it makes the goods.
For this reason, Nissan used the rotation function to avoid collections from the small robot.
'This device requires only a couple of seconds to process the information and act after this information.
It does not require the information nor the intuitive logic of the marked managers, so it can continue to work with only a couple of CBBs of the memory area.
It sounds surprised, but it's not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the memory space.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for the immediate prevention of collections, a technology to prophesy Nisan in the next 10 years in the Serbian cars.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are easier and keep longer than a variety of lithium-Ionian batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to lead to the goal and avoid the barriers on the way.
She's the rest before she's charged with a hypothec.
It is necessary to consider that the United States Financial Minister, except that it has sufficient license to provide support, is not without cash.
Before the crisis, and to avoid that US hosts in Hypotheken stories of the best payable banks have been developed, a sustainable and informal game for the Internet Sealer was developed: `Bad Credit Hotel', is it.
Or maybe the hotel of the worse credits' or one another.
The third aspect of this accommodation and particularly its receptionistin is to consider one, two and three times, whether it is the moment to ask no credit.
And especially where you can do what is probably the goal of the game.
Surely she has useful information but without details.
This is more than one side for the teenager than a place for all viewers.
What will happen when the game is expanded?
Well, if a dreamed room appears in the hotel.
At least something, because it's not about buying a better house
Morgan Stanley offers its capital for MUFG
Morgan Stanley annlyzes the income of Mitsubishi UFJ Finance Group (MUFG) in its company, which would be the first bank in Japan to pay nine billion dollars, and 21% of its capital will be taken to be a new news back to a strong case of their barriers currency.
One week after an opening agreement was made, the two banks explained that MUFG 9,9% of Morgan Stanley-Stamps for a unique price of $25.25, which is paying a total amount of three billion dollars.
The accepted price is under 19% of the currency value of the action of 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional six billion dollars in the acquisition of conversionable stocks that will be secured by 10% and can be returned to a price of 31.25 dollars.

However, a printing speaker of the group refused to make more accurate information on the strategic projects of the two new participants.
After MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should be able to provide a payment rate of approximately 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan explained his balance since the end of August's end.
The last weeks were hard for the group who had to look at how their buscreen currency turned to half, while the price for insurance against payment unability fasted.

Letters - The peaceful majority of the culture
A debate on the financing of the culture makes a clothes and is centrally theme of the current election camp.
It's better.
But a area of our cultural life continues to be forgotten.
Who will arise and attack the pleasant somps that are granted the small museums, the archives, the archeological exhibitions or the national historical places that will be degraded?
What politicians will it make to remember the Federal Government that she is engaged in her thought officers and their culturally important constructions?
What is in Quebec, as well as in Canada, there are no right laws that protect our cultures effectively?
Did you know that the French government is one of 3,5 million euros only available for the restoration of the Chinon lock in loiretal?
Our American neighbours are written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of the culture of the Americans is to be protected by this culture, and that this culture of all citizens, all Members and government businesses must be protected, both in mutual vote.
In Quebec, in the jointion of the History societys Quebecs, at least 40,000 honorable companies gathered in 211 historical societys are seeking to be intense with the story to save the numerous private archives and to receive the archeological oversight.
They are also often the observations of our culture, which protest with the power of the disappearance, when the helpers and decision-makers leave their bulleters on our old stones and forgotten peace houses.
When will there be a book for the story and the culture?
Benelux Governments of the Fortis Bank
The Benelux Member States of the Belgian Forest Bank in Turbulens want to take partly on the arms: The three States shall provide the bank and insurance institutions, which remains also in Hungary, EUR 11,2 billion.
The Governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands have consulted at the highest weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Competence Authority of the European Commission.
In the Euro Zone, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial crisis for a year, so that decisions that are taken now in connection with the Bank may have priority characteristics.
In the meaning of the decision taken on summer, all three countries will buy the share of the bank to approximately 49 percent.
The Bank is likely to sell a part of its participations, before all the insurance activities sold by the Holland ABN Amro last year.
The actors of the Fortis last week have started a steel taste, and in the second weeks arose serious crises.
Nevertheless, the bank and its 85.000 employees are a lot too large.
The Institute's value papers are 12% at a 14-year-old level.
Since males, the value of the acid was more than two thirds.
In view of the current agency currency, the market value of the group is at 14 billion EUR, which is inrealistic.
In view of the management, the USD 700 billion is the USD of the US salvation package and the so-called uncertainty of the markets in the Talival of Fortis Actors.
However, the courses are easily reduced on Monday.
On Friday, Philp Derrckx was appointed to the new Director of the Bank.
The money Institute was also on the search for a private buyer, but no interest was found with a skill offer.
The Belgian government, however, was trying to defend - no investors should overlook his money, named it.
The customers have not been cut off, but the fishings of the bank haven't been corrupted.
In Hungary, the Fortis has their own Filials, but they also call Leasing's names their own.
Fucking on Web installation
Because of the medicine consumption, a person refuses to conclude a treaty with a customer in America's life and hospital insurance.
The protection of data experts is afraid that the data market could be uncontrolled.
"There are data protection programmes that are linked to the approval of the concerned.
These should be independent, at least we trust the hooks" - the Washington Post Richard Dick, developer of the program for the follow-up of registration data.
Assurances fix the costs and payment expenditures in the case of damage, dependent on the situation of the customer's health, and the risk should be too high, the insurance will not only be completed.
The customer was previously sent to a medical investigation, and the contract was completed only in relation to the results of research.
10 years ago, Dick found a weitaus more suitable method: In the context of the identification number of the customer, he refers to the data of the last one half years of the apothetics, which were bought the preparations, and the program is calculated by which client disease leads and how his health condition is.
For example, if he regularly bought large amounts of cholesterin unrecognised medically, it was allowed to follow that his blood fat level is unretainable, which would automatically result in a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in the transition - some also define a major risk application, so the insurance needs only to implement the paper screen, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the benefits is that many medicines can be taken for different purposes, such as migrants and heats, but also against depressions.
The last is from the view of the Verstor a high risk factor, while those not mentioned.
For the application and processing of the data, own societys have been formed before they take the data requesting patients for its approval.
In addition, they must do this by law, although subsequents have not been admitted until the time.
Some companies are even processing the results of laboratory investigations and connecting them with the data on the medicine consumption, so they provide an elderly picture on the health status of patients.
Ever more companies have access to the data, and the control of their use is at the same time more difficult.
However, there is a own data protection law for health data, but its effect is only focused on service providers in the health sector and insurance.
The draft of law was already presented to the Congress, which could also control data processes.
Dick Richard believes that it is too little, so he wants to develop its program, so that the data can only be extended with the understanding of the concerned.
Another question is, of course, that the concerned may not be able to undertake the access to its data because the insurance does not exclude any contract with him.
And so the knees are just transmitted as the grace of the fashion.
Global food plan from Marseille
European Union and India doubts the trade
After the European Union and the India leading trade partners of each other, this was the main subject to other global problems in the neighbouring guests.
Today, the French-Individual Gapfel is also held in which mainly discussed cooperation on atomic energy sectors.

Since the exchange of goods was increased between 2000 and 2007 from 25 to 55 billion, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In this respect, the 26 existing civilian flight agreements with India have also been assembled legally to an agreement so that the future air transport is also complicated.
Until 2009, India wants to sign the Free Trade Agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy talked to accelerate the package.
The goal is to create a balance at present unrealised relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is the partner number of the Indians, the New Delhi is only nine on the rang among the EU cards.
The gipfel was admitted to the global attacks.
The situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, in relation to terrorism that both sides have been condemned at the most critical level, was urged to introduce a United Nations conference.
The Doha Round should also be closed, and both sides are debt.
The EU noted that it was fixed at its energy and climate program, which means that the shopping emissions should be reduced by at least 20% to 2020.
This also agreed India, as well as with the proposal to close a sort of global compromise in the coming climate, and to disappear the rail gas production up to 2050 to 50 percent.
The price increase in food should also be fighted, so both supporting the introduction of an international conference on the financial crisis.

In Paris, 20 billion euros for the construction of atom reaktors in India are deemed to be granted.

The middle of the Milliardary Steve Fossett was recovered before one year
The small aircraft of Steve Fossett, which was disappeared on 3 September 2007, was found a billion driver over the wilderness of Nevada.
The individual parts are found on a top of 3000 meters high in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes region between the United States of California and Nevada.
However, there were no human survivors in the airside.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely deployed the last doubt during a press conference: "The aircraft is placed in which a troop was shipped, and now we have the security that it is about the airport with which Steve Fossett flights the day of his discharge."
Mr Anderson also confirmed that no human survivors were found in the air or near it.
The 63-year-old billion was explained in February.
The American Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) noted that there were few hours after the view of the aircraft that identified the machine: it was the Bellanca 8kcab who perded on 3 September 2007 after Fossett in Yerington to a 3-minute airport in Nevada.
Finally, yesterday, they were also found in California, beyond the border of Nevada, some of the personal cases of Fossett by a couple near their house at the Mammoth Lakes.
It is about two exhibitions with the name of the Fossetts, which were emitted by the Federal Aviation Administration ofelonois, Bargeld and a Jacke.
The search for Fossett was issued a month after its departure.
The milliardary had a place in the story through a long consequence of records.
In 2002, he was at the sixth stage, as the first man was the worldball in a heissluft ballon to run: a two-year-old aircraft.
Three years later he moved the world into a single air without inter-landing airport.
Its ethnic records also contains a high flow of 15445 m above the Ande, but this with a co-plate.
Glk, the publication you don't expect
A Suv, which falls through its original design and the special line management, which is designed and its clear winkels out of the original scmata.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to join the new Atem sector with this offroader.
On the basis of its extraordinary properties, the presentation of the Suv Glk will also fall in a convention that will be seen from 17 October in the showroom of Mercedes-Benz.
This will be the Werbetrommel, which will be connected to the appearance of the new model, also in a new clothing, in the form of a 3D campaign – which is a new in the car sector in the recurrent Italy.
A project with a maximum basket that takes the central shopping middle, the Corso will be carried out until 15 November.
The first fase is available from the presentation of the car in form, including 3D letters which are distributed near the Corso, to give a special optic: the new Suv will appear in its nearly real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car is so apparently out of the plact that it has been scattered.
The Elumina8 technology of the new Glk in different moments will be seen in all of its details in order to reassemble it as a whole.
Unfortunately, it is the attraction of Mercedes with this advertisement to introduce a new type of author classs in this old stereotype field.
Is it easy to travel the interest of the future buyers?
Now it's clear who are the Italian Hooligans
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk stadion prohibition
Who only are these 150-200 boys and girls, for which the whole Italy now is shame? You are part of the Ultras Italy Group, which has been backwarded for years of the Italian National Society and who said honestly, until shortly, there are no serious problems.
It has never come to co-staining with Gender Faans so far.
The origin of the group is on the right of Milleu.
The helpers are out of the triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
To these talks in Sofia, other smaller groupings from Kampanien and Apulians.
They take the three-colori on which the cities of the military appear: they were away on Saturday to avoid identification.
Your pictures are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, it was now come to co-sponding with a true legal racial factory of Levski.
The Figc was provided to the Italian Fans 144 cards for the game: all were exposed on name and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also controlled by the Viminal: among those of the settlements to Sofia, no one had a running stadion prohibition procedure.
Four factors of the Italian manager, which have already been charged in this regard, were also refused the ticket and the travel to Bulgaria.
Now, the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to introduce further steps: in this case, the arrested or identified tifosi in the explanations may calculate at least five years of stadion prohibition.
This is an international prohibition that prevents access to stadies throughout Europe.
Our hooligans will therefore no longer put a foot into a stadion.
Good luck.
But now, of course, there is fear of revival plants that could follow this little more than 150.
"This flag must be directly outlined, and that in no case the possibility of justifying" means the Viminal.
Therefore, "Attention in particular with regard to the game of national partnership in mid-eight in Lecce."
Because in Apolonia there is a small corner of the Italian Ultras.
Morning the Osservatory (Osservatory) gathers the Casms that can count on a part of the ice, so the secret services that work with the problem of the Stadion Manager.
"Duce-Duce Rufe and the enlarged right arm during the Hymne of Mameli? In Bulgaria this is not a criminal..."
This is the mind of Domenico Mazzilli (unless joyfully expressed), which has been the director of the Osservatory for a few weeks on the Viminal (on the posts of Francensco Tagliente and Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazilli, President of the police of Trieste, was now a Kerker of Ultras founded in 2002.
It is true that Mazzilli said that it is not against the law to loving the Duke, but certainly, those 150-200 people have been a shame.
"I am not a soziologue – adds the No. 1 of the Observatory – crimes will be committed in the country of their work.
Until this group had been held in the saum, but now it has to be considered what happened and happens.
But we are also talking about the hymne Mamelis during the Hymne: this is not a criminal, but they allow me, because the education is missing..."
