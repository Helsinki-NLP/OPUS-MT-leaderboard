Barack Obama is replaced as the fourth US Presidency for peace price
The American President Barack Obama comes for 26 hours to Oslo, Norway, to meet here as the fourth US President in the history the nobel price.
In addition, he receives the diploma and the medal and a square over $1,4 million for its extraordinary efforts to intensify the global diplomation and cooperation among the peoples.
The chief of the white house comes tomorrow together with his wife Michelle in the north-way metropole and will be working all the time.
At first, he held a visit to the Nobel Institute where he first joined the five members of the Committees who chose him from 172 people and 33 organizations in October.
The President, then, planned a meeting with the Norway King Harald V. and Queen Sonja.
After the afternoon, the visit has reached its high point with the ceremonie at which Obama takes the prize price.
It receives the fourth US Presidency but only the third who takes the price directly in the office.
The white house already advised that Obama will talk to the price of Afganistan War in the removal of the Afghanistan.
The Chairman does not want to extend this topic because he knows that he takes the price as a president who leads war for two countries.
For some days ago, he still enhanced further troops to Afghanistan, which nobody forget his criticians.
At the Zeremonie, Obama also received the Golmedaille, the diplom and the shoe over ten million Swedish krones (ca. 24 million Czech krones).
The money is intended to be paid for certainly active purposes, but he has not decided by a more concrete karitative work.
The plan of events will be presented by a banket with the President and his wife, where the Prime Minister will also be present with the first minister and 250 guests loaded outside the Norway.
Obama was very retained from the beginning of the price.
He gradually added that he felt that he didn't gain the price completely.
Likewise, he reiterated that it was not only the price for him, especially for all that enlarged the same values as he.
Immediately after the advertisement, he highlighted that this is "abortion to act".
Nature defenders shall be accused of the pressure
The Leit-meritz police accused the President of the citizens of the Nature Protection Community.
In several cases he introduced vocations against some construction procedures, he asked for the reimbursement of his jobs from the investors to his benefit, the Leitmeritz Police speaker, Alena Romova.
The Chairman of the Leitmeritz Nature Protection Community Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in Haft, and it's going to make him a prison race from up to three years.
The Sortier multi-containers in Brussels don't sound well
In Prague, people can sort the drinking packages, in the southern regions, you can find again on step and trick the Sortier Multicontainer.
And in Brussels?
There you need to reserve a few minutes to find the appropriate mull tonnes.
I don't want to say that the disappearance in Brussels would not work.
But I think whether the Council Governments are inadequately concerned about this problem, even if we are the second larger city in the Republic.
Brünn is located in the waste trains in the Urwaldliga, not only because we can be able to ensure only paper, glass and art materials, but especially through the number of furnitures for such accidents.
Have they tried to disappear the PET flowers in a collar card sometimes in the centre, for example?
This is also art, before everyone needs time and strong neurves.
The only place I have found at this time is the marketing place towards the affected Gans.
Mr Undka, his colleagues must not be denied, but it is too little to me.
It does not appear that the disappearance is also in other parts.
That's why my friends do not like to share the waste.
It's out of fault.
They are too far from the muscles.
I don't wonder.
I've offered myself after the feast to disappear a few glass and plastics.
But at the Conicova Strasse, I didn't see a color-sound tonnes.
Successfully, I came to the right place.
The mood was almost over.
This is still the center of Brünn, where the whole city is represented, right?
However, ecology and any kind of ethnics are likely to calm the brunesian socialists.
They're better buying the city a Eishockeyliga that makes us shame in the whole Republic instead of buying more mulltones and offering the order of further road materials for a cleaner breast.
I'm glad that I could also confirm my adoption with official statistics after I searched for a time in the Internet.
After the data of the ECO-COM society, Brussels is really the worst of the southern coasts.
The "Poobobuk" Budget has equipped money for payments and hospitals
After the left party, despite the view of the Government, the farmers and officers had more money, the budget is no more money for rewards, hospitals and construction parks.
But not even for the State accused or for the International Court Strategy.
This causes the further problems that will be in the second half of the next year, the financial minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrates and Communists have implemented the increase in the contents of some groups, they claimed that the Government would pay money for the sensitive expenditures, alternatives or hospitals.” This is only a decline of the problems in the future, mines," Janota says.
The credits are appreciated approximately always higher rates, and the money must be returned at any time.
To select where the State Casse is empty.
If social services or expenditures for the State operation are not cut off, the tax must be increased.
For those who have given the left party now more money: the fire water, the teachers, the farmers.
And later for their children.
For the payment or the hospital's money that are disappeared from the account 1,8 billion, people must not be afraid, they get this money.
But for the price that the State is still more excused - in the next year, it is not only 163 billion but far more.
Despite the efforts of the Minister of Janota, the debt will increase so fast and together with this also the costs and interests.
The State will need money for comparison, then it will no longer be sufficient to increase the payment tax or to cut maternity money, as the Government has made in its area-effective package.
In the next year, there will be five milliards for the construction of cars and railways in the next year.
It is most important to the sections obtained by the competition, which are not able to renew and may be prohibited.
Get up at least whatever is not free.
This means translation or introduction of thirty large constructions, also threatened Europe's creature, warned the ministry of the ministry of transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The CSSD proposed that it solves the impact of the salomonic money - it adds the CEZ shareholders in which the State owner of the Majority is, and then the money will be spread to the transport funds.
The problem is that the degree of the divident is never secure, and there is no event of an endless source.
In the past year, the CEZ flights from 18 billion in the Budget.
Annual year the divisions are paid to environmental licensing damage, fill the pension account, and this money is also served as a reserve for the planned reform.
This trick also includes the actual budget performance on the Nieveau of 5,7 per cent of GDP.
But this does not end the carneval of the circumstances.
Furthermore, the budget for different disobediences for the victims of the communism and of criminals or for the prosecution of the court, even for construction parks.
If the State receives the right without this money, it is not sure.
That's your luck game.
If we lose an international trial, we need to pay it as well, Janota is clear.
The Minister must then take the money in the area or in the worst case the government budget.
A hundred million are also missing for the starting two billion project "State" which should allow on-line monitoring for the individual authorities to provide money.
The first stage begins in January.
If the financial minister does not find the money anywhere else, the project should be stopped and in this case, Janota warned.
Your next smartphone will be managed by two operating systems
The Americans determine for the future with a telephone on which the user can switch a single key between different operating systems.
The plans proposed look a lot of advertisement.
It's easy to print only one key, and from Windows Mobile will be in less seconds in the Android Weather.
This is the same way that the American company VMware will present, particularly focused on the development of virtual software for computers.
We allow you to execute two user profiles at the same time on the mobile.
You can switch between these, they can divide them in two home and job profiles.
Both of them will work parallel, defended Mr.inivas Krishnamurti by the company VMware at the interview for the computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and presented to the first time before a few days.
In 2012, it will be on the market.
Virtualization of Smart-Phones is not fiction.
VMware has already introduced the Smartphone Model with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with a RAM player of 128 MB to provide parallelly the Windows Mobile and Android systems mentioned at the same time.
The development of the new Technology for Mobile phones is in full way.
The company VMware is now working together with the European and American operators at the Smartphone Vitualisation and clients in 2012.
Snow manna on the mountains, the owner of the hotel
Sneeless shoes make worried not only the inhabitants of riesengebirge.
The lack of snow also disappears people from order of ski stay in hotels and pensions.
This is why you can still receive rooms for all winter ends. Weather and silver.
Our pages are often visited.
People go through the offers, set the prices, but in particular they have feared to make binding.
And when they call us, they immediately ask whether our views will be on the snow or "up to Matsch", the operator of the information sports Spindl.Info, Martin Jandura.
Whoever wants the silvester's content in the spring mould exactly according to its ideas, should not be able to keep the order.
Whoever prefers the distress and at which the quality of the stay comes first to the second place, he can try to wait for a few days.
The Spidenlmumhle hotel owner offers included the silver day only for weekly staying.
I think they're gonna try to sell them for a long time, but then they're also needed to give them, and they're going to be shorter time.
And then the free rooms will swim fast, estimated Jandura.
Free bed at all winter ends also offers the travel office Ingtours in Vrchlabi.
Now, most of us are interested in the Christmas day, which is not yet sold.
In our offer, approximately half of the places are still free.
This is why we have already prepared a few more precious Christmas stays for the last moment, the Director of the travel officer Ingtors, Petr Schiefert.
The Silver Day in Riesengebirge can also offer the Vrchlabi Reisbursion, but there are less free places here.
Good paragraph also find the first fourteen days in February, the remaining winter ends are sold averagely.
In this year the interest for winter retail also affects the negative impact that the snow is not always in the rain.
People wait if the snow falls.
No one wants to bring the end of the year to the mountains without snow.
If the skins are disappeared within a week, the Christmas Christmas will be sold, I mean the trip.
Return and get something better than in the last year to be located in the hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We are about five percent better than the previous year.
On the Silvester Day and Christmas, we just have a few rooms.
Great interest is in the Poland holidays in Janua, and in February the business will also work well, informed the director of the best Pec Hotel, Karel Rada.
To 80 percent of silver stay is also located the hotel Omnia in the central park in Janske Lazne.
Indeed, Christmas remains free in the last hotel in Janske Lazne and half of beds.
In this year of January, we have already been overlooked at about 60 percent for the time.
A little worse is in the February, but at the moment when the snow comes, the interest in the river's relaxation, the director of the Omnia, Erik Sporysch.
On a greater snow protection, the riesgegeberg hotels were expected, including.
On Thursday, it should be cut off and if it comes to snow, that should be on the mountains of the snow.
But then there's a warmment to come again, JRI Jakubsky informed from the location of the Czech Wetteramtes in Hradec Kingove.
US: Recurrence is the mother of the skill
It is almost funny, with which Barack Obama, the Chairman and his call of the clergy, replys the strategy of his leaders in the Afganist Fraction, which he held himself for the most deepest.
When he finally exposed the Afghanistan Doctrin's seen out, it showed that he was described it on the copying paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario three years ago.
Not only that he used in the text itself once again the term "such as in Iraq", he even has the name of the Bush Declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New forward" uses without sealing the name of the Bush declaration.
The Bush-Idee - Fresh Truppen Contingents in the Irak posted by the citizen war - he criticised as "in responsibilities and in their successive carstrophical decisions".
But in the next months, however, it showed that the Bush Strategy's only possible and that it was very successful that the news on Iraq today had not been speaking anymore.
The call of Bush has not been granted, because objectively he has left his followers a more grateful outcoming situation as it was waiting for.
In Afganist Barack Obama hoped that the wonder is renewed.
In order to resolve the Truppen Contingent, the military requested him again, especially the High Commissioner of Afghanistan-Operation General Stanley McCristal, which even despite the subordinational provisions, criticised in the white house.
He requested 40,000 soldiers to be able to return the situation to the best.
For three months the President, but no better idea has come, and so he has received the General for $10,000 soldiers.
From Europe, he expressed the allocation for more 5,000, even if he originally recovered at least 10,000.
The highest problem of the entire Obama Strategy is its project to cease troops from Afganistan in 18 months, and to complete this process within three years. The whole Obama docturin is left more questions than answers.
Some doubts that half resolve will bring the same effect as the measure in Iraq.
Despite the brother War of the last years, Iraq's society is relatively well-oriented, its leaders honor the values.
The situation of Afghan has been imposed by the contra-indication - no one can be left and there are no agreements.
In these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces living to change their opinion every day.
Political institutions, even if they were formally founded, remains only buildings where Patriarchal relations will continue to grow.
The interesting balance between the various ethnic groups is not usually complicated, particularly because of the invisibility of comparisons that continue to complicate Pakistan and Iran's flooods.
The building of a "double State", which is the minimum goal of the whole operation, is very unrealistic.
Timehorizon of the Obama Strategy is encountered by its Voluntary Artism
Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only been disappointed, and now it is on the border of the explossion.
This is why the small soldiers that are broken in the war record on the "Free Back" here creating a wonder, can only be a really romantic soul that does not allow us to impose from facts.
The political view is the position of the data for the ship-related unlawfulness, because the Taliban is to be taken as the indirect competence of the American disappearance.
The last NATO group showed that the intention of the Europeans to participate in the missions in Afghanistan is nut.
Europe's politicians can and do not want to explain their electoral persons to how the security of Germany or Italy is combined with the war in Industry.
Another possible factor that can affect the situation radially is the development of the events in Iran.
If the situation continues to disappear and increased sanctions not to the Iran, the United States is a very serious question whether the problem is not to solve troops.
This question should be addressed during the period in which America to Obama writes to the campaign from Afganistan.
However, each solution will also mean a dramatic decline of the Afghanese situation.
The only constraint for Barack Obama is the fact that remaining three years until the president's election, and therefore remains enough time to take it to another strategy, if it is a whole case.
The control manager of the Goldman Sachs will not receive primairboni more in bar
The leaders of the American Bank Goldman Sachs will not receive the firstboni in bar in this year.
This has announced the company that reacts the craft critics of their loan practices.
A group of 30 spysmanagers is replaced instead of the money assets that can only be sold in five years.
In addition, the assets may be removed to the managers in the case when they are extremely riskant.
Goldman Sachs is so in accordance with the Agency Reuters to the lines of the efforts to connect the Wall Street Premiboni with long-term performance.
I believe that the Wall Street is aware of the continuing direction in which it was to go, the former banker of the company of JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, it complemented.
Goldman Sachs went to the goal of the critics, after she had been set for the first three quarters of this year almost 17 billion dollars for Primienboni.
The total height of the firstboni in the past of this year is likely to be increased after the Agent Reuters, notwithstanding the measure shown today, 20 billion dollars.
The high primarybony in the bank sector has become the most warm political theme when the financial crisis starts in a number of countries.
Britains reported on Wednesday that it decided to impose the bankers' goods over 25,000 per cent, with a tax of 50 per cent.
Early steps are also prepared for France.
In this year, women gained nobel prices in all of the sections excluded in Physik.
Five Record flowers today have taken in Stockholm from the hands of the King of Sweden Carl XVI. Gustaf the nobel prices of this year in the sections and for literature.
Besides the four scientists, the German literatures were also the Romans of the arrival, Herta Müller.
The Nobel Price for Medicine has received two American biologys, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with her countrysmann Jack Szostak for research in Chromoson.
The price for Chemie has received Ada Jonath together with the American, Venkatraman Ramakrishan and Thomas Steitz, for the declaration of Ribosom Structure and -Function.
The last Laureatian provided the Nobel price for economy, the American Elinor Ostrom and its countrysmann Oliver Williamson have received an analysis of the economic report.
The only section category, in which no woman had received a nobel price in this year, was physic.
These prices today the scientists Charles Kao for the research in the Glasfasser province and George Smith, together with Willard Boyl for the CCD Chip exhibition, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax devices or astronomic Ferrochree.
Each of these prices has received the diploma, the nobel meal and certificate on the purchase of the money price.
It consists of in each category of ten million Swedish krones.
If there are several prices in each category, the money price is divided under it.
According to the tradition, the American President, Barak Obama, received the most expected peacenobel price in Oslo today.
He in his speech recognized the contravery of his name, because he is first at the beginning of his way, and also stands at the street of the country that leads two wars in Iraq and in Afghanistan.
In fact, he added that wars in certain situations are necessary for the fight of world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota considers the reaction. Klaus has invited him to the cast.
The President Vaclav Klaus recommends that the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who considers his residence in the Government, because he was not accepted with the implementation of the State budget for the next year in the form as it was released by the Deputy Assembly in Wednesday.
It will be accepted that the budget and may also be the remaining of Janota in Kabinett will be the topics of the summer meeting.
The budget is also criticised by class.
It is too high that the crisis of public finance continues to extend.
The meeting informed the President, Radim Ochvat.
Over his further living in his function Janota wants to negotiate Janota on Monday with the Prime, Jan Fischer.
Following the budget, which is now subscribed, the Czech Republic should operate with a deficit of 163 billion krones.
However, in the middle of Tuesday, the left party's proposals for money-environment and the money for the officials of the State, the support of the social services and the direct solutions of the farmers.
The Government has understood the proposals of the Social Democracy to increase the budget.
The left party on the one side and the government, Klaus and the right party, on the other side, has therefore been designed an inner political fight, so the question signs of the further work of the fishermen's chabinet, on which ODS, CSSD and Green Party have been connected at the spring.
Criticals say that the budget, as adopted by the Parliament, is practically liquided by the package of Sparities which have been carried out in front of the fisher Government, and that, after their understanding, will be completed the defence of the State.
Claus, which can sign the State Budget Act but does not need, has explained today on the debate with the undertakings that politicians have shown the "resumable deficit" of public finance has been more deployed.
His view is that there is no good solution today.
An improvement could only lead to a strong government that could still build a broader consensus of political parties.
The ODS Presidency, Mike Topolanek, highlighted that the budget is green, and the government should decline its further existence.
ODS Chairman, Petr Necas, said the CTK that the concept of the official chabinet was evidently not worked any more with the CSSD, ODS and Green Party.
The first fisher described similar words in the editor as "stringe explanations".
The CSSD Chaef, Jiri Paroubek, reacted to the Topolank Ware that the Etat Efficient has been green that the previous government of Topolanek had prepared for this year and over 200 billion krons override.
The CSSD evaluated the approval of the State Budget for the next year as a success.
The People Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new film of Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
The South Africans say that the new Hollywood filter "Invictus: The Ungebated" of the world shows many of the country, despite some criticians, the main roles of a American player.
The story tells about sports, races and Nelson Mandela.
The fight against the Racistic Apartance Government system in the South African Republic, and its first black President, Nelson Mandela, is in his life history of the American Oscar Schau player Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the one-ninth year of mandela whether he could put him in Eastwood film.
Another significant role is taken by Matt Damon.
I said to him, "If I'm going to play you, I'll meet you.
The two-seventy-year player who had received the price for his role in the Eastwood Drama of the Box "Milion Dollar Baby" has already made the leader of the movement of the slavery from which to the end of the slavery has become a physical US Presidencies, such as God in "Evan All Pot", but only rarely people who are still alive and for many people as important as mandela.
The former South African State man was for his active activity in the celebration of the Party in the South African Republic for 27 years in prison.
He was set up free foot in 1990 and he was President of the country for four years.
In 1993, he was described with the noble price of peace.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "unprofit", and at the same time it is the name of a timing of the English author William Ernest Henley, which was issued in 1875.
The request was how to speak
The film is a real decline where Nelson Mandela has his forces with the Captain of South African Rugbyteam, Francois Pieiner, concluded together to share the country in some. The new President Mandela knows that his people are still rarely and economicly shared.
He believes that he can make his people through the sport some, so he decides to be some of the rugby players worldwide belonging to external seasons.
Finally, the South African team rises to the World Business of 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela stories on the knoleinard.
He had no other goal to play this role as so much as possible, said Freeman.
The greatest challenge was of course to speak as he was.
The player said that if he and the world politicians would be in the same country, he would try to meet Mandela to eat with him evening and to be his speech behind him.
The most important for him was to protect Mandela's hand.
I found if I'm kicking your hand, I'm getting your energy, it's going to translate, and I had the feeling that I know what you feel, he said.
For me, it is important to become another person.
Matt Damon presents the film of François Pienaar, Captain of the National Rugbyteam, in which the white players have overcome.
The player said he had six months of time to prepare the role in the hard ringby World.
It was a great surprise for him when he met Piezer for the first time in his house.
I remember when I cried to the tourist that he opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: "I see much more."
Despite the obvious differences in the stage of the players in comparison with its actual perspectives, he has received positive receptions under the Register Eastwood "Invictus: Ungelared" and you are also talking about views on a Oscar.
The film criteria of the sheet Daily Variety, Todd McCarthy, made his evaluation together in the following words: "This was very good story, very good outcoming film."
In the film revisions on the web site rotentomatoes.com, Invictus 76% has received positive estimations.
A light secret about Norway: the Russians have discovered a raket
About Norway, a particularly unknown light effect was observed.
The Russian Defence Minister has first found that a intercontinental Ballistic Rakete was discovered from the northern border.
But the start was not again successful and the rakete called "Bulava" which should be originally the power of the Russian army, will be slowly on the space of the Russian generality and the Premier, Vladimir Putin.
His refreshed presence at the raketetest also had no positive effect on the success of the test.
Bulava is mostly not launched or damaged in the air.
In the Russian newspapers, it is already written about "Bulava" as a "related" one who doesn't fly.
A rakete that doesn't fly but light
This is already the 13th attempt, losing in the normal beginning.
At the end of the aircraft, technical damage were again made at the race.
The motor probably explosed at the third level.
This time, "Bulava" started from the Atoom U Boot Dmitri Donskij, which had come under the water of the white sea.
This type of racket allows the end of the U boat.
That is why it is likely that this caused a misterial light through the northern movement was actually the damaged "Bulava".
The Norwegians also have not seen that it is a Russian racket since the first moment.
Generality has kept himself this time and confirmed that it is clearly unable to speak about a misfortune.
The first two steps of the rakete were not falled, and from the accident only the third stage was affected.
In the previous cases, the motors were in the first stage damaged.
Even if no test launched without error, the mining of the Ministry of Defence is only six of three ten to be successful.
The nearly 50% success is thus completed with optimism and thus continues to say that the "Bulava" will be still fled without problems and even until ten hypershall-totomal plots with a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.

Tschechische discovery: a substance that also operates in the elected · HIV seconds
The team of Tschech and German scientists tests new connections that should be bound to the extending of HIV animals in the organization.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that he also operates in the virus that are already resistant against the medicine.
This fact is contrary to the benefit that the connection with usual virus vessels does not operate as strong as one of the medicines already present.
AIDS disease is not yet able to be healed.
The patients may administer medicine but extend life and prevent HIV animals in the body.
However, your adoption is accompanied by a whole number of side effects.
Incomprehensive prejudice of virus improvement also has the development of resistant viruses that do not be more effectively against medicines.
The work of experts of three Institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, the VSCHT (Chemic-Technology High School) and the University in Heidelberg opens the way as you can meet the Virus Resistance.
They have stated that the substances designed as metalocarbone operate on the oil that is responsible for improving HIV virus.
The metalocarbons are connections of bor, waterstof, coal and cobalt.
These connections block the virus increase in other ways than all the medicines used today, so they can overcome the problem of resistence.
In their work, scientists have reached new connections, prepared on the basis of the knowledge of the Molecularmchanism of their binding on the virus testing material.
The metalocarbans have a unique threedimensional structure: two flood heats consisting of bow, water and carbon atoms and are associated with a metal atom, in this case of cobalt.
Home and constant Virus
HIV protease is an emergency substance of the HIV virus, which is incompatible for the virus cycle of life.
Unless the HIV protease scene of HIV-virus infections could not be disappeared with rivial infections.
If we disable the HIV protease, we also disable the improvement of the virus in the body of the patient, explain the scientists in the press report issued by the Institute for Organic Chemical Chemical and Biochemie of the Academy of Science CR.
In the work published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe the whole series of connections in which two couples of the coffee (see table) are linked by a short organic chalet that will then be changed systematicly.
Something wear but reliable
The effect of this series of substances against HIV protease is also shown in reagency glass, including against their competent (resistant) variations that have been obtained by HIV infected.
The effect of the metalocarbs on the usual enzym visaant is not so strong as in clinically used medicinal products, but does not lose their effect on resistance variables which are often ineffective.
The unique effect mechanism and its additional characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low accuracy and opportunity of any other chemical plants, makes metallocarburians interesting connections for further to the development of more effective medicinal products against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, the leader of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of the Organic Chemical and Biochemy Institute of Molekullargenics of Sciences.
ODS has gone to fisher, who seems to be swift
The President of the ODS, Mirek Topolanek, described the approval budget for the next year as "Greenful" and the Government of Premier of Jan Fischer should discuss its opinion according to its further existence.
The exemption of the ODS was described by the President of the Minister as a "State Explans".
It can be time for the analysis.
The ODS Vice-President, Peter Necas, said that the concept of the official chabinet is evidently not worked any more.
After Necas, the President must decide whether he decided to support minority in Parliament if it is about the fight against the growing deficit, or whether it goes to him for his stay in the office, through the Parliament's links.
The reaction of the ODS and social democrats to the problems of the public deficit is diametral, and Necas demonstrated it.
On Wednesday, Parliament adopted the budget for the year 2010, on the basis of proposals of linker party's amendments on more than 12 billion krones.
The Parliament has increased the money for State officials, support for social services and direct payments to farmers.
The Government has understood the proposals of the Social Democracy to increase the budget.
Tschech should operate with 163 billion krones.
The ODS has left the saal before the vote, so she has taken the wish of the Government, as the amended budget is only a less bad variation of the budget provider.
Decrease and uncertainty
The financial Minister Eduard Janota has spoken about his disappearance and feelings of uncertainty, which the first Jan fisher has admitted that the government is still aware of the situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to the case that the amendment proposals would be adopted, the situation would be different.
According to the Czech television, Janota has reported on Monday after the government's first.
In addition, he said that he overlooked his other remaining in the office.
For this reason, it is his disappearance on the defenses of the budget.
As a result of the further fight against the Budget Difficulty, fishermen in accordance with Necas have made the Nomins of Social Democracy (CSSD), which have implemented the changes in the Budget to do nothing in the government.
The Prime Minister should also clarify that it will be resumed when Parliament continues to adopt deficit laws, for example, those related to hospitals and pensions, or the service law-making.
Topolank: The Ministers named ODS did not hurt
This is the case of the first fisher and the whole government.
The ministers named ODS have not made mistakes, Topolanek has brought up in a text message from the United States.
It has been mentioned that in some ministers in a stelling function people who are recognized at TOP 09 who corrected against the budget.
Necas noted that, if fishers decided to address the fight against the deficit powers of public finances, "It's completely logically and correct that he's protecting the left majority that is now in Parliament."
Then he can't be able to calculate the support and tolerance of civil democrats.
I have not seen this, and if it is current, I will take care of it, said the Defence Minister Martin Bartak the journalists in Parliament.
First fisher flight after midday to the meeting of the European Council to Brussels.
The ODS turned back on the desire of the Premier
In the same time, Necas noted that the ODS probably would vote in the middle of Parliament against the amended budget, if the Prime Ministers of Civil Democrats expressly ask for the adoption of the budget.
We don't come as the children of Waisen, we are not small children, then he replied the question whether the ODS has not been returned to the political negotiation on the budget by the absence of the participant in the Parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn't note that my voice would be missing.
I was very sure that in the next months, in particular, on the bowishization of the Parliament and the destruction of all positives, the Topolank itself reacted.

The history of South Africa about each, says Morgan Freeman alias Nelson Mandela
In the next days, the new Hollywood-Film Clint Eastwoods comes to the American Kinos "Invictus: the Ungepowered", which includes a part of the life history of the former president of the South African Republic, Nesona Mandela.
The role of the world-level fighter against the apartity has received Morgan Freeman, which has been elected by Mandela itself for some years ago.
The Legendary Room of the South African Champions in Rugby, Francois Pieiner, has received Matt Damon.
The knostart of the film will also be voted with criticians and public reactions.
Nelson Mandela
He named Nelson Rolihlaha Mandela, born on 18 July 1918 in South African Mvez.
In 1988, he received the Sachar Price, then in 1993 with the Klerk the nobel price of peace.
The President of the South African Republic was elected in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are set in the film because in a time he comes into the Kinos, at one time in South Africa, the preparations for the World Secretariat, but at the same time the media caused the global publicity with closer news about the growing rasenhas and discrimination of the inhabitants on the side of the black dominant.
According to AP's Newsagency, the reactions on the new film in South Africa are first positively, although many preservations against the disposal of main roles with American Hollywoods.
Morgan Freeman, however, is boasting his own words after the new movie.
From this role, I scattered a lot of years and prepared me well.
More times I met Nelson Mandela also personally so that I - as you say - you can receive his energy, he went into the interview after the film premium in Los Angeles.
I think it's good if we can draw this film to the Mandelas personality and his message.
This is a story of South Africa, but she concerns every man, he added.
In the Dress of Rugby-National teams
The film is based on the book of the British writer John Carlin, freely translated into the role of the enemy ́: Nelson Mandela and the game that cleaned the people, the South African defender of human rights within his first president period.
Morgan Freeman is endeavoured in the film to bring together two races and one-year-old population groups and, as Nelson Mandela in 1995, in its role in South Africa's National-Rugbydres at the World Business, which has ever gained South Africa.
For the presence of the rasens in the Dress, which is almost applicable in South Africa as a holy act, Mandela had great ovations, over the white public and has thus gained the recognition of the white population.
The Rugbymeistership may be able to close the people again to a single people, the rugby player Chester Williams who was the only "chnow" team in 1995.
Whether the emerged situation in South Africa is improved, it will only be shown.
But the South Africans are skiptic, for example, in recent interview for LN of the Rugby Fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled from the country to Britain.
The Mastership begins on 11 June 2010.
In Louny's offer, large transformators for more than 10 million krones
The flag was tomorrow on the transformator of the company Ceps in the building of the Vyskov community in Louny.
At the border, we enter six units in the Usti nad Labe, Lukas Marwan, according to the speaker of the beachs of the Usti naad Labe.
Originally, the fire water wanted to burn the transformators, but later she changed the view and now the fire will be removed with a mixture of water - view and special solutions.
The cause was a technical defect, a Transformator Internal Correction.
No one has been harmed that the Havarie was threatened in accordance with the company pressure, Pavla Mantova, the security operation of the management system.
The damage has been estimated at several 10 million krones, more precisely the damage will be marked after the flag.
The destroyed transformator must be replaced by a new manager according to the mandate.
Over 10 years, Ceps' society has not achieved anything extraordinary, errors are rare, it added them.
The power supply was not undertaken in accordance with the CEZ Corporate of the CEZ Society, Sona Holingerova, which did not affect the functionality of households, authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps is active in the Czech Area as an alliance manager of the management system, the electronic guides of 400 kV and 220 kV.
It is undertaken, renewed and developed 39 square plants with 67 transformators, with which electric energy is transferred to distribution systems and drives with a length of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura is enlarged by the disappearance of three heads of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, today raises crimes against three social-democratic leaders.
To Michal Hase from the South Marines, Radko Martinek from the beach of Pardubice and the head of the Olomouk, Martin Tesarik.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute inteview in the radiojournal.
The scope is to work together with the efforts of the company to conduct the regional movement in some cases.
However, all regions have finally signed the contracts with the Czech railway.
All three leaders take us and say we've taken the rozens, so we've only expanded the offer on the level, as it was set with them.
They say that we're too much than the Tsish railway, because we would know the prices of the Czech railway that were completed last week.
So we remain nothing else than impressing us.
Because of this disappearance of the company of Student Agency, Jancura said to the Radiojournal.
At the same time, he understood the evidence of all the persons that they have undertaken their steps in accordance with the law of Europe.
This is why we will prepare an appeal for the European Commission.
Hasek is the exemption of the offences for the further continued medial show of Jancura, which served him as free advertisement for his society and for his own person.
Of course, I am ready to defend my good name, and to defend the right call of my business, and I also call for further leaders.
I believe that it will also be clear to this question that Jancura is, which is the case of regional trafficking, manipulates the public and uses false and unbelievable arguments, has said Hace.
Jancura reported last week that he has invested several million krons in the advertisement, which will be shown at the emergency step of the career.
At the radiojournal he said he had built the campaign after Christmas and wanted to continue this after the new year.
He expressed that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign has added Jancura after the benefits of the regional trafficking with the Czech railway and have not described any descriptions in a high number of 150 billion krones.
In the case of Vancura, such a law-wide behaviour and in contrast to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
In the course of the crisis on the travel movement, Jancura was also a member of the CSSD.
The only drug was if we don't understand that we can also lose the buscenes.
He presented himself as a Deputy of the CSSD, I know who it is, I don't say his name, "Jancura said to the radiojournal today.
Infection against pneumokocks free and voluntary
Implantation against pneumokokes changes the resident from January.
She must be first free and voluntary for the family.
But now there are voices that the obligation implant would be more effective.
Culminate the preparations for the establishment of free vaccination against pneumokocks.
The Arznei Institute has already set the maximum prices of vaccines that need to pay hospital insurances.
The experts are also clear about the vaccination procedure.
New Impact
Insufficient vaccines for August-kinder
Since January, children can be pushed free against Pneumokocks, who were born on August 2, last years and later.
The condition is that they have not received vaccine yet.
Those who have started with the vaccination in the past year or previous, must also pay further rehabilitation.
The first vaccine should be given between the 3 and 5 months of the child.
A quarter of the families had to impose their children against pneumokocks.
The parents payed 1600 krones and more for a dose.
For the vaccination of the latest children, four doses are required.
In general, the teachers estimate that the hospital insurance for vaccination is 300,000 to 450,000 krones per year.
But they flee in the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
To now, the State has issued approximately 500,000 per year.
The compliance infringement was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumocokacs cause medium-sufficient use but also severe infections, including brain hazardous uses and blood disappearances.
Following Pneumocokin infections, we have died after investigation in hospitals for years to 28 children aged to 10 years.
In addition to the Czech Republic, children's commitment to Pneumokocks were introduced in approximately 40 countries.
Should the vaccination be bound?
At the same time, this vaccination may be the future obligation.
From January, it must be paid by the insurance and be voluntary.
This would be better, as the Chief of the Civil Union Nalas, Rudolf Kalovsky, mentioned.
His agreement is already a long time-term for the pneumokock implant.
The experts at the international conference in which we were involved in our agreement were not very satisfied that we had voluntary vaccination.
That's not very ideal.
On the other side, we are glad that it is ready to do at least.
I think that's the way we need to go now, Calovsky led.
However, the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccine procedure against Pneumokocks.
At this time we don't consider this, said his speaker Vlastimil Sesen.
The voluntary vaccination has its benefits, the doctors say.
The Chairman of the Fach Society of Practice Children, Hana Cabrnochova, indicates that voluntary vaccination has their benefits.
If all children would be infringed, then you could think about the reduction of the refund of the number of immunities "In a situation in which the vaccine is so hard, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started voluntary," said Cabrnochova.
The teachers expected that more than 80 percent of the parents would impose their pneumokocks from the next year.
The vaccination against Pneumokocks is also crucial that this is paid as the first places of hospital insurance and not from the State.
Insurances should provide the money for prevention, so that they are flowing for further treatment, raising Cabrnochova.
The doctors must buy the vaccines themselves.
However, a concern is related to the practical child sector that concerns the sale of vaccines.
Following the original project, the vaccines should be bought by the insurance and the doctors will then receive them on the same way, as well as others from the State issued to them.
Some Members feared that the insurance could be "saving money from hospital insurance".
Therefore, the doctors will need to sell the vaccines themselves and wait until the insurance pay them.
Following the sums, individual practical doctors will need to invest 40,000 krones, which is an important sum.
This will not be easy, says Cabrnochova.
US artists participate in the "Museum disaster" steel
The son of the famous American Fantasy artist, Frank Fraretta, was accused of the trial to scatter in the value of $20 million from the Museum of his father.
According to the police of Pennsylvania, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was placed at the invitation of 90 guests in his vehicle with attachers.

The Agency reported that Frank Frametta senior had to have given any permission.
Labour defends food and control increases
The Ministers have defended the tax increases and expenditures reported in the previous report against the criteria of opposition, economic and business.
The Conservatives said that Alistair Darling would have given a "pleasing" opportunity to show it that he meaned the reduction of the deficit seriously by the decisions to the extent after the election.
The sharp cancer also decides that he was assigned to workers with low and medium-sized revenue.
In its main proposals, a 0.5 percent increase in social insurance and a 1 percent of capabilities limit of public loan decisions for 2011.
Social insurance
The workers have protested that the lower receipts are affected for a recession which they have not caused and warned the previous "Problems".
The recovery of social insurance - by about 3 billion British Pfund per year – has strengthened private economy, which says that this is a tax on jobs, although needs to be the attention of economic disappearance.
The increase that is limited to those who gain more than $20,000 per year will be related to approximately 10 million workers.
WHERPUNCATION OF VORAB-ETATBERICHS
Increased social insurance by 0,5 % from April 2011
In this year the growth of the economy is over 4,75 % expected.
New 50%Stuffs on banking boundary
1 percent to increase corporate tax for small enterprises
Business for electric vehicles and wind tourbines
Increased government reimbursements by 2.5 %
According to the treasures of the shadow, someone will be worse than $90 million per year, and someone with $40,000 per year will be worse about 190 £, while a person with 100,000 per year's income will be richer about 110 £.
The Ministers said that their goal of deficiency was meaning "subsequent decisions" until 2013, but they also said that 60% of the charges of additional taxes would be exempt to the 5% of the top managers.
The financial Minister Stephen Timms claims that the skissed tax increases and expenditures in comparison with the necessary actions of "a fall on the rock" would be.
"There are large numbers. They will bring us the deficit and it is also about the period next four years, at the same time he partd with the BBC.
Timms said he was sure that the economy would return to the end of the year.
Previously, the Labour Party concerning the future economic growth, which affects the increase of reproach and the speed of deficiency, has been requested after the shadow cancers were designed to revise previous numbers.
He said in his opinion that the economy is likely to be deployed at 4.75% in this year - weitaus more than the decrease of 3,5%, which was previously prior to April – while the accused of 3 billions would be higher than previously proposed.
"Created opportunity"
The conservatives who want to start a new public campaign on Thursday to warn the "labour crises" of Labour said that the planned accused of 789 billion fund over the next six years.
They added that the Ministers refused to propose a credible plan, how they will reimburse this and be "zynically" before difficult decisions until after the election, which must take place later in June 2010.
"They haven't said anything about what they're going to do," said the Queen Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this, and they have left them over."
"The important warnings are done only after the election who always wins."
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour is concerned that schools, hospitals and police will be kept before future shortages, other than in the proposals of conservatives, which will be seen faster and more deficiencies.
But the Liberal Democrates said that the money that will be gained by tax increases and expenditures would be used to deteriore the expenditures for the next year, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans were " built on Sand".
The BBC's political director, Nick Robinson, said that some at the time of awareness - how the above inflation adjustments to some non-inflammatory clients in the next April – the shadow cancers would just be reimbursed as the money could just be recovered in the next year.
Labour is concerned to provide additional assistance if people need to be the most necessary and that the situation will be re-examined in September 2010.
"Hooler dinner"
Although the ministers have not been informed over 2011, economics say that the pressure on public expenditure will only be in the mid-term period.
The recognized tax research Institute said that the numbers of the skill cancer would be significant in many areas, which may also be in the areas of transport, education, science and defence.
"It's just hanging pain to later," said his leader Robert Chote.
"The important warnings are done only after the election who has always gained", added Roger boats, economic operators in the auditing company.
"This was only the high pre-apartment report. The markets recognize it."
FBI studied "Financies of US business in Pakistan"

Amnesty condemned "Missbrush" in Iran
According to a report of Amnesty International's Human Rights Organization, it is still bad as in the past 20 years.
The report details the "Missuch Modern" by the regime, as well as after the elections made by the president in June.
A man set out in the report said he was killed and burned with cigarettes, another said he was threatened with administration.
Iran's earlier critics of his human rights balance.

Following the election of President Mahmud Ahmadinshaad, thousands of people were arrested in Iran and were killed by decades, which led to the largest road protection since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
During the twentieths and complaints said that at least five people were condemned for death.
The BBC Teheran respondent Jon Leyne, who is now present in London, said that at the beginning of the protester of the highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the misuse remarks and the closure of the Kahrizak Strafanstalt.
But since there was no more tolerance from the authorities, our Corresponsor said.
"Falsche Conscience"
Amnesty International attended the report of Ebrahim Mehtari's 26-year-old information student, which said that he was appealed by the "operation with Facebook networks" and because of the test against the election results.
"They smote me in the face," he was settled.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my knees, on my head. They threatened me with death and they destroyed me."
After five days he signed a false understanding, and it was still blown and half uncertainly left in the street, Amnesty was partaked with.
The killed presidencyskandidat Mehdi Karroubi said that some demonstrators who were taken after the election were arrested in August to death and others were entitled.
The Iranian authorities denied the provisions of administration, but they gave that misblocks had been held.
Amnesty also called the case of an old captain, who said that he was kept arrested with 75 more than eight weeks in a container in a violent steel in Kahrizak.

The group said that in the last three weeks at least 90 people were taken to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was established in the city park

Prices were lost for the best artists carried out on the hog - or tricks.

Can the islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatics in a secular State.
In a time that the Swiss elector has established a building ban for Minarette and has extended concern about the vulnerable islamization of Europe, John Bowen, a American academite, a funded and well-developed report on whether muscles can be integrated in a clearly sensitive way of Europe's societies — and integrated.
Some readers will read this new book from wondering for the last work of the author: "Why the French Don't Like Headscarves, an elegant and close argumenting study of a question that participated in the country over the one of the tens of years, and has also been a real effect today.
Bowens new book offers a greater and cooking spectrum.
As a good anthropologe, he wants not only to know what the politicians and the media say about the islam island in France, but what really happens in the area.
He has stayed months in Moscheen, schools and Institutes, which are now offering 5 to 6 million muslims in France, as the boen is called "Islamic Free spaces".
He is a good hearer, and he gives discussions between teachers and students about the questions which they most concern.
Should a mosm marry in a mood or a council house (or both)?
Do you should teach young muscles about evolution and rights of homosexuals?
Can a muslim woman marry a non-muslimate man?
Is it allowed for a muslim to use a sensitive bank system to get an hypothek?
It is apparently profan affairs, he claims that they make the daily life, in contrast to the political dramas that operate the media.
The author recognizes a new generation of immenses, teachers and intellectuals, no one of them with a known name, perhaps with exception of Tarik Ramadan, one Arab-music teachers and academicus born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open the debate on how it is possible, on the other hand, to be a good model and, on the other hand, a good State citizen in a modern society.
You do not have any arguments on their side.
The conservatives are misstraintly against the idea of a French or European islam.
Those thoughts and active men who have asked the bows are most of their Salafi's skills – the puristic sunnitic islams who are connected to Saudi Arabia – which today shows a small but influential presence between Europe Muslims.
Bowen is the view that Muslim values and French secularism could be agreed.
But a convention requires a loan and acceptance on both sides.
He examines how French political decisions members (and the intellectual Elite, who is so leading to the division of church and State) really obliged to feel the Pluralism.
He pointed out that Muslims may learn a rare treatment as Catholics, Protestants and Jews who had to make their historic compromises with the chocolate Republicismo.
He recognizes more the "forcing of value roads" as a growing practism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, you're pleased to say "Yes but not yet".
The most Sustainable View of the world
The arktis changes faster and dramatic than any other environmental region on the earth.
The iron, which it marks, smells with alarming speed and takes life with himself, which can survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishery interests have been offered in the new open water, with diplomates, advocates and now also authors in their like water.
Richard Ellis, a author and Illustrator, named "Auf Danish Eis" (Original title: "On Thin Ice"), a natural story of the Iron of the north, the icebrary.
In the complex history and policy of the Walcountry, he describes the long tradition of archer researchers who have proved themselves at the jagd on the icebraries.
Admiral Nelson congratulation with a icebber as a 14-year-year-old flower to the sea, which only fighted with the smoke of his muscles, is certainly a lie, but others are true.
The young bulls who were kept when they slept after their mothers recently killed, were brought in Zoos and Zirkus.
A circles in the beginning of the 20th century showed 75 icebbers at a presentation.
Even today, the zooan installations still typically still have a million of life area of a living altar. The climate is rarely suitable: the iron in Singapore was very green from the algen growing in the cold of his hair.

In his new book "New Scientist" (Original title "After the Ice"), Alun Anderson, offers an earlier producer of the sciencesmagazins "New Scientist", a clear and incredible description of the science of Arktis and a packing view to how the future could be developed.
Not that scientists have all answers.
No atmospheric scientists nor oceanographs can explain the speed of changes appropriate.
However, it does not have a lack of explanation.
The pioneer trials from Fridtjof Nansen end of the 19th century and the first time of the 20th century, the packaging was the first time.
Subsequents measure the widespread widespread in the Kale War.
A useful complement is satellite measurements and the large-scale exhibition of Messonden on the iceberges, but it is still a lot to be reached by uncovered people who are out of the cold camps.
Anderson looks at the own, mixed world of the fluid system within the archaetic ice, which is formed by the salt water residual, which is printed at the flight.
But, starting from the ground on the ice to the microscopic little wonders in the ice, all of them are threatened when one ends the summer, which will be measured between 2013 and 2050.

Marine infantry were among 6.000 who were in Arlington Kräze
The Supreme Liberty De'Angello Robinson traveled seven hours with the bus to put a single corn on the tomb of a soldier that he never had touched.
For him and the other Marine childists, who studied the trip from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to the National Peacehof in Arlington to strive saddlers, was the day a tribut to the men and women in which they were walking.
In a few months from where we're always back, we could be this, said Robinson about the affected soldiers.
If we were this, I would like someone to do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered themselves on Saturday morning to put crèmes on Veteran monuments in several sections of the Arlington Federation Court.
Morrill Worcester, inhabitant of the Trauerkran producer Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, founded this tradition in 1992, when he and some others decided to decorate several hundreds in the Friedhof in Arlington.
It is now a 18-year-old tradition and Morrill and his wife Karen, who operate this trip every year, hold in various cities along the way to make events that are assigned to the military and victims of terrorism.
Worcesters also founded a common organization, Wreaths Across America (Kriness throughout America), which also exposed the event on other States.
In this year, more than 16,000 volunteers set up on the Arlington-Friedhof on the Pentagon, on board of the National Friedhof Fayetteville in Arkansas, in the Battery Park in New York and on the Memory of the United Airlines Flug 93 in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Stift felt the second time more than $150,000 for buy and transport of the arms.
Charleen Hunt, 70, from Western ministry said she took the trip to Arlington in the memory of her husband, a dead professional soldiers.
Although her husband hasn't been condemned in Arlington, Hunt said, this is her way to give them something that offers the victims.
She said that this is a small contribution to how civilians can support our soldiers.
It's like the visit of a family busy.
The volunteers, packed in the state of warmer clothing, swimmed the volunteers on the extensived race surfaces and hills of the Peacehof.
The volunteers had older saints from the 1, and 2. World War and the Vietnam War as a goal, since they were not so often visited as the new saints, the events.
The smoke was glad, children played and couples held on the hand while they drew the fresh citrus to the green green stones.
Each round crowd was black green with a small red clothes that was covered on the top.
Section 60, which is near and mainly buried by Veterians of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, remained quiet.
The United Services of the Organizations expired 1.000 forces to strike this section, but the extreme smoke of the current wars filled this area.
Some who wept openly, others prayed, families and friends were standing on each other in the air.
Some read on the names mixed in the stone, while others joined to small black-wheel cards that were covered for those in the burning shame, whose grave stones were not yet completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who forgotten the grave of her son's bitter lamentation.
She is about 8 hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave sites of Marineinfrantary Unit David Shane Spicer who fell in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free... My son has paid for it, she said.

Deputy officer of the US Government of Cuban authorities
The Cuban Government has established a applicant of the US government, the mobile phone and notebook computers in the country, who said the representatives of the Foreign Minister on Saturday.
The employer who has not yet been identified has worked for development Alternative Inc with seat in Bethesda.
Society works on customer projects, such as USID, the US Authority for International Development and the World Bank.
A consultant of the US's interest revital worker in Havana is trying to reach access to the postling arrested on 5 December.
The specific appeal points were not yet published, although, after Cuban law, a Cuban State Business or an foreign visitor could be arrested by the accused of the “related”.
All of the so-called conterrevolutional activities, including easy protein and critical writings, have a risk of arrest.
Government graphics and experts are considered as a serious crime.
Kuba has a growing blogger community, which is introduced by the popular reporter Yoani Sánchez, described the openers, as she and her husband of governments are persecuted and attacked.
Sánchez again requested a approval to leave the country to meet prices, but this has always been rejected.
The determination of an American advocant will probably increase the importance between the Communist Government of the Castro Brider in Cuba and the Obama Government, which has enhanced an "langer" approach to improving the relationship with the island.
The sentence was reported to the first day of the New York Times.
The new U.S. policy highlights the value that the United States will be made a consequence when the Cuban Government understood concrete steps in this direction, such as the release of political prisoners and the creation of more opposition rooms.
Mobile phones and notebooks are legal in Cuba, although they are new and dedicated products in a country where the average service of a government is $15 per month.
The Cuban Government allows normal citizens to buy a mobile cell, which are highly used for sending text messages, as a 15-minute telephone talk would cost a daily loan.
Internet use is extremely limited to the island.
It is in dealing hotels and there for for foreign visitors and some governments, such as universities, available.
Cubans who want to log in must often report their names.
Too many websites the access is limited.
On Cuba, it's the arrest of a American.
Most of the few US busers who are in the prison of Cuba are settled for crimes like drugs, Gloria Berbena said that the press speaker of the US interview in Havana.
Berbena said she could not give any further information to decide.
The determination and the hate are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in each other free society - the release of free mobile telephone - in Cuba was a crime, Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the Group "Human Rights Watch", which was a hard report on freedom in Cuba with the title "New Castro, equal Cuba", a playing on the official establishment of Raul Castro as a leader of the country, which replaced the old brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that the complaints were often arrested, condemned and arrested within one day.
He said that every solution would probably be political and that the Cuban Government often causes a negative reaction in the United States to be moved to more dialogue.
Pakistan Government Vice-Party's Plan to send men to Afghanistan
The Pakistanian authorities discovered a pleasant head of a disappointment designed to send five men from North-Viginia to Afghanistan to kill US soldiers, and said they hoped that this case could help to discover an outstanding terrorism network that seeks the Internet to radiized young men.
An Ombudsman said they were an unbelievable comprehensive, known as Saifullah, who had been seeking the men to Pakistan after he finally made it because one of them in the Internet Videoite YouTube had given comments on terrorisms.
After their arrival to Pakistan, the leaders of these men were tried to help them reaching the landscape in Pakistan's stage, which is the home of Al Kaida and its terrorist training battery.
But a representative of the secret service of Pakistan who was informed on the matter, said on Saturday, Saifullah could not convince the Al-Kaida leaders that the men are not part of an CIA disappearance to the immigration of the terrorist network.
They were held over days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far far away from the inherent mountains in the northern Western, which became a terrorist flighting place.
They were seen as part of a hidden operation.
Therefore they were rejected, the government official said who wanted to remain anonymly because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The Government official said that the men were not dismissed and continued to receive the correct recommendations to receive access to Al-Qaida campaigns when they were taken by the Pakistanic Criminal Criminal Authorities.
The case of the five men, who continued in Pakistan and are asked by the FBI, underlines the crucial role of the applicants in the identification of future terrorists and may be more important in the decision which is reliable.
Since the attacks of 11 September 2001, the US secret service has made it to be higher to undertake human activity posts within Al Kaida.
The applicants of the organization act as a candidate who does not here whose commitment for the holy war is not very serious and those who could be the speech.
Analytics have been studied by A Kaida a special test.
In view of its potential access to US targets and their propagan duty, they will also be considered as an attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, higher Analytics of NEFA Foundation with Sitz in the United States, said that terrorist groups were also a lot of precautionary in the past years on which they allowed access because the US secret services have become experts of their recruitment methods.
If you are trying to introduce somebody in these groups, what better way you could go to follow the re-recordation model that many have already been followed?, said Kohlmann.
The model is now based more on the Internet.
10 thousand demonstrators request Kopenhagen Climate "Action"
10 thousand demonstrators married here on Saturday by the roads and requested the sub-agency officers in the Bella Congress Center of the city's coastal trade in climate protection.
Demonstrators said that 100,000 people were closed to the event, where the police estimates were more than about 25,000.
The event has been relatively peaceful, although a handful massive activeists small scrutiny body was close to some government settlements in the city.
On one day, when the climate negotiations made by the UNO little happened, thousands of actives with transparency through the city, on which "No planet B" and one in Spanish, which explains "The Earth says "Genug".
Some stars concluded the proof, for example, the Danish model, the photographer Helena Christianensen, who said that the trips to Peru, their mother's birth country, had aware of what problems the country has inherent due to the impact of the climate change.
This is part of the reason why I decided to participate in the great demonstration - to extend the word and call to the leaders of the world, to bring a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It is no easy task, but it has to be done now and there is no more way that leads it.
The police decided the demonstrators to get close to the Bella Centre and said they would have taken 19 persons, mainly because they were masked or led to the ticket.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited in demonstrations.
According to a survey that didn't want to be called, as he was involved in climate negotiations, the masked demonstrators in black clothing several bodys near the Copenhagen capital canal, which are nearly several ministers.
They sent them near the buildings, he said and added that they started as a light wheel, but then by "a few large explosions" were followed.
Inside the Congress Centre, people were gathered before television screens to follow the whole afternoonday demonstration.
But the test has not appeared to reach awareness of the main functioning, such as Su Wie, China's Heads of Climate.
When he was asked whether he thought that the demonstration had a constructive effect on the international discussions, he asked English, "This is something I didn't know."
Then he went to Mandarin and said, "For the event is great, I can't hear what happens outside."
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual, whether the demonstration would damage or help.
It shows the concentration of wide public and different sectors on climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "It can also say that they have acknowledged the negotiations or the freedom of other people."
Show trial data card rass climb
The Mathematical Service witnesses were the last week welcome news for public schools in Washington D. C.
Although the Distrit Washington is still far behind the schools of the country, the highest performances shows that the Viert and Eight Colleges have made faster progress in the past two years than Atlanta, Chicago and New York cities.
But what is included in the latest numbers of national educational assessments (National Assessment of Educational Progress - NAEP) is the hard performance light between African and white students, both at local and national levels.
The average point of the white quarters from Washington D. C. increased in the last two years from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), which increased only three points from 209 to 212.
The performance clue increased in reality between 2007 and 2009 from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African Auge College remained under the same reason, he fell on a statistically reliable point from 245 to 244.
The average point of white students was not included in the test data as the highest trial was not enough.
The image of a six-year period is not even more exciting.
The cluft, which was white and black, 2003, turned out when the first NAEP was recorded in this discretion, was 60 scene points (262 to 202).
And although the number of children of both groups has reached is grown in this time margin, the difference has not been reduced now in 58 points.
Some respondents of the Distrikt were concerned that the results of schools Michelle A. Rhee and the democratic citizen Adrian M. Fenty were prepared to the most part of white students who have already been skilled.
This indicates that we have increased the total assessment by the treatment of those at the top end of the skale, which is difficult and difficult, said Jeff Smith, the condition member of D.C. Voice, a common group who introduces the education balance in Washington D. C.
I have not opened and moved for a spane of two or three points, the Democratic Washington Council member, Kwame R. Brown, who has a daughter in the fourth class of the Eaton Greund School.
Brown, a frequent criteria of Rhee's management style, said that the message of the test point is that the Mediterranean schools of the city urgently needed attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, I respect it.
But whatever me is that we do not approve the time and energy that we need to use for our media school.
Rhee said that the district must continue to find better ways to be justified in the needs of the skills' scholars.
For example, some teachers will be discussed to use a new reader plan, the Wilson reader system, which includes students in the above classes of primary schools and medium schools, which have not met the principles of reading at the beginning of their school movement and the meaning of return behind their same classs.
General Mathematics, a teaching plan, which presses from childgarten to the sixth classs of games and experiences in the previous basis, was written under the former Leader Schulin spectrum Clifford Janey to Washington and some of the NAEP projects that have been reported last week.
I mean that we need to continue to make the best steps agreed to students under the notice level, Rhee said.
Others say that NAEP results can address whether Rhee can continue to improve the total performance of the system and continue to provide additional money and resources for performance schools that are available to reduce the climate.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, Professor for Education at the University of California in Berkeley, the stedical test results.
The conventional healing resource is to establish its resources and management reforms on schools that are in the world of Washington D.C..
The objective could develop political impacts against this important agenda point.
The weak point is, of course, as in other stidtical shotspects that it is trying to keep the white and black medium history.
Our focus is to ensure that we create a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our schools in the towns to ensure that all families, independently where they live, can be sure that their children can get a high public education.
Janey, who is now in Newark, said this week in an interview that one of the most important elements for the closing of the performance cluster is to extend the traditional public school year in Washington by 180 days to compete with the Charter Schools.
The school year is approximately 200 days to have the force to change, said Janey, who came to an agreement over 185 days per year as a "one milesstein" in the way to a greater increase in the next Treaty.
High school training for more people as a future view
The travel bus reaches the Gettysburg college with a loud feed.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stands out and blows a moment in the view of the white pillars, the rock stones and the smaragd green rasen.
The parents of Gracielas have not completed the high school in El Salvador.
Before Kurzem, Graciela had also been born in Silver Spring and now lived in Riverdale, never put a foot on a colleague room.
Its holding and those of the other eight colleagues of the Gettysburg group, where the teacher costs $38,690, was more than one honorable visitors than an enthusiastic student.
"Yes! I'll be soon!" cried Graciela, who would like to study medical, when the leader told that they had now come to the building for natural sciences.
"Wow, really?" she said, in fact, when she reported the lower professor to students in the school.
The colleague in Pennsylvania was the 7th, which visited the children in their thirty-day tour and now they took the intended message: the question is not whether you go to the college.
The question is where.
On the other hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of children born in the United States of Spanish immigrants who do not end the High School or are pregnant, but there are also hundreds of thousands who receive colleagues' training needed to increase in the Mediterranean history.
In fact, one of the five of the "averages" of Spain Americans is closed to the college – which is a significant performance, since many of its immigrated parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, who came to the United States without the high school.
Their success stories are important, telling researchers because they are for a generation that will play a great role in the work forces of the country.
Those who investigate the powerful children say that they often have a natural immunity for school and a successful attractive inhabitants.
Many of them also have parents who set their children high objectives and find ways to comply their lack of confidentiality with American schools.
However, consultation programmes also play a great role by bringing the Graciela and millions of children like they help to come to colleagues, especially if these efforts continue a longer time.
When you consider children who do not have experience and feasibility to help them through the system, a single measure will not have to solve the problem at any time, said Patricia Gándara, research researcher at the University of California in Davis, who studied Spanish American students.
We need to consider that we have a network of support for these children from the pre-school to the high school.
The Federal Programme, which has funded the Gracielas College-Tour, is an useful example.
It is known as GEAR UP - A Gang - and provides more than $300 million per year for local school systems to start college preparation programs starting when incoming schools are in the Mediterranean school and continue until they have completed high schools.
According to the US Education Department, the programme has helped more than 10 million students from 1999, from which more than 60% had been colleagues.
Iraq’s Oil Ministery concludes contracts with 10 foreign oil societys
Despite the concerns of violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has able to bring greater oil societys to rebuilding its damaged infrastructure at two boards on Saturday.
The 10 contracts concluded by foreign oil societys are closed to the fact that China, Russia and the European Oil companies are ready to play an important role in renovation of the Iraqn oil industry, which has been established for ten years by war and economic sanctions.
American companies could only be able to provide parts of two of the 10 disappeared fields.
Seven American companies had paid for the participation of the second auction which started on Friday.
The only company that has given a mandate has taken the corners.
Two American enterprises could exclude contracts for the June.
The third sentenced representatives of the American oilmultis in the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysis.
Irak finally opened the battle after 6 years of war and gave an Asiatic and European path to the way, said Ruba Husari, the producer of Iraq Oil Forum, a online news service.
There will be no further offers in Iraq long.
Safety views undertaken by massive coordinated bombs on Sunday and political stability by the US military military have probably stopped American oil societys, so Analysts said to engage more in Iraq, which includes the third widely largest oil reserves of the world.
In some cases, the US-Firsts were noticed because competitioners, especially Chinese and other States controlled energy companies, have significantly lower costs and have more risks because they need not to meet actionnaires.
Exxon-mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies who could conclude agreements with the ministry.
Another US substanties, such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which are in line with the Iraqn Oil Ministerial and have been left with the technical Council in recent years.
The Russian undertakings Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors in two of the contracts in this week.
The State China National Petroleum Corporation has commanded more contracts than any other undertakings and could go home with large packages to contracts for two larger fields.
We all know, said the speaker of the oil ministerial, Assam Jihad, that China is on the way to become one of the great world economy and a technological mass.
We are convinced that the Chinese company can measure himself with his providers and fulfil its obligations against Iraq.
For the chosen mandate, the elected undertakings gave orders compared to the cost for barrel oil that was ready to pay the ministry to increase the extension of each field on the current level.
Al Kaida's Top Planet apparently killed in Pakistan
In a clear US-Raked attack, the Palestinian border in Afghanistan will be killed this week a top-in-law plan of Al Kaida, so reported representative of the US terrorism fight on Friday.
This would be, if it would be confirmed, the second death attack on a high responsibility of terrorism in this area.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arabs that should be killed according to the sources of the US and the Pakistan authorities of the region by a number of raketes, which were taking their vehicle near the city of Miran Shah in the province of North-Waziristan.
The public authorities reported that the rakets were dismissed by a drug type which was used by the CIA in the unlawful term of Pakistan.
They traveled into a white vehicle towards the Afghan border when the car was taken, a representative of a Pakistani civil secret service from Miran Shah per telephone.
Localistics who were in mind to belong to the military, fled to the place and took everything fast to himself, what was left from the "completely destroyed bodys".
The local authorities could not confirm the identity of the victims, but two representatives of the US terrorism fighted uncertain evidence that Somali had been the dead.
Somali was described as a leading military planer of Al Kaida, the operations of terrorist groups outside the Afghanistan region.
He was involved in confusions throughout the world, noted a leading officer who wanted to stay anonym, and in the healthy characters of the US-American air attacks on Pakistan's ground.
If you are taken its central role, this also included the planning of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of Al Kaida and put it in operational plans for possible terrorist attacks.
The second representative of the American authorities said that Somali has been rapidly raised in the Al-Kaida Hierarchie and best connections with other extremist groups in the region.
He may not be aware of some Americans, said the second representative, but it does not, in any case, reduce the danger he made for us and our commitments.
If his death would be confirmed, Somali would have been killed by the second leading Al Kaida or Taliban manager since September, as at a similar attack Naumuddin Jalov, the leader of a military group in the tribe and three other topactivists were killed.
The time of the attacks by drugs of the CIA has returned from the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a common organization, from a average of six operations per month.
The decline can take into account the improved tactics of the terrorist groups, which have taken steps to reduce their angerability and then kill brutal informants in the disappearance, reported the page.
Leader of the UN Chair in Kabul will be returned
The leading sentence of the United Nations in Afghanistan, Kai Eide said on Friday he would be returned from his office in March, which would end a cultural official time, which was deployed by evidence on broadly wide corruption by the Afghan Presidency election supported by the UNO.
Any step has been made when the Obama Government decided to send more than 300,000 US soldiers to Afganistan.
The UN Messenger said that he supported the tyres' increase, but he also expressed its concerns that the US plan for military return which would start in 18 months could allow other NATO governments to disappear their war forces.
We need to accelerate the construction of the Afghan security forces and to send the right signal to the Afghan to trust the international community, said Eide in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long.
The Norway Diplomate also encouraged the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civil helps to help Afganist political conversion.
Truppen increased on the military side must be increased on the civil side, he said.
It was said that he did not lay down his office, but only one of his family-related agreements in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for two years.
He said he wanted the notice to UNO-
General Secretary-General Ban Ki-Monon is now continuing so that he has time to ensure a replacement.
What I said is that he's better starting looking for a follower, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between the way of my passenger and my arrival.
Ban has started searching for a replacement in accordance with UN representatives.
The United Nations representatives say that he has led the Swedish-Thank-Sheat Staffan di Mistura, who has led the UN Mission in Bagdad and has taken into account the French Jean-Marie Guéhenno, which had previously led UN-Friden Operations.
Any position in Afghanistan was made on the test after his previous adviser, Peter W. Galbraith, urged him in September to prefer the President Hamid Karzai in the President's election in the country and to test on the massive election penalty.
Eide has rejected all accuses, but he also said that the accused of Galbraith - the "the mission has made unfortunately damage, because it has already been a great measure of Skepsis in relation to the international immunization of the election."
He said that he recommended the appointment of a leading civil representative to coordinate the support of the American forces undertaken in Afghanistan.
He also emphasized that the United Nations guide allows its follow-up to establish more staff from the United States and other Western countries depending on the Afghan mission, and said that this would strengthen their trust in that their money will be used correctly.
Anybody expressed his disappearance on the restriction of his powers in Afghanistan and said that the comprehensive United Nations institution regulations have understood its possibilities to bring people into it.
The UN rules are so designed that I was since May, he said he could only establish a person.
This is catastrophe and cannot continue so.
US Defence Minister Gates: Iran must calculate additional sanctions
Friday, Minister of Defence Robert M. Gates said that the World Months would soon be binding "additional sanctions" on Iran because he did not participate in conversations on his atmosphere plans.
Gates said during a 7-time journey through the war areas in Afghanistan and Iraq to a group of about 300 US soldiers in Northern Ireland and the view of a military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
In Iran, there are no good opportunities to choose, he said as a response to the question of a soldiers on the probability of such development.
"Any of the things that lies on me is if we learned something from Iraq in the past six years, which are own unprecedented to the war."
The Obama Governance is a sanction package in view of the military and political elite of Iran, but Gates announced that some sanctions could also be regarding the average warrants.
He said that a "potential and negative income" needs to "to convince the Iranian government that it is less protected with nuclear weapons in reality", because "they people will lead to the sanctions" among the sanctions.
On Friday, in a opinion of the speaker of the white house, Robert Gibbs, the American government advised the European Skin politicians to warn that Iran must assess the consequences with the "believing" if he does not receive the requests of the United Nations Security Council and its nuclear monitoring organization, the International Atomic Energy Authority.
Iran continued to reaffirm the knowledge of the nuclear technology only for peaceful purposes.
In the conversations of Geneva on 1 October, the Iran stated that he would re-evaluate the conversations to reduce its atomic programme and to a significant part of his campaign file to extend the exchange for urgently necessary nuclear breeding material for his medical research reactor.
The US Government has encouraged this kind of agreement to build confidence between the two parties and to gain time for negotiations.
However, since this day, Iran seems to have the negotiations to the provisional agreements -- on the part, the experts say, because Iran’s leading is none of whether they should be bound against the United States.
The fact that Iran’s international community, as regards some proposals that they have already been adopted by the beginning of October, was clearly said that the international community, including the Russian and Chinese, had gathered together in a way, as they have never been in connection with significant additional sanctions for Iran, said Gates.
The President Obama has established the 31th time for Iran to respond to these proposals before other options, including those who call for the Foreign Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton once the "private sanctions" will be followed.
In an opinion issued in New York, the Iranian Representation has condemned what she had "based and unfunded evidence" of some members of the Security Council to the Iranian nuclear activities and said that they are ready to continue the conversations with the United States and five other world-wide plans to provide an appropriate long-term solution.
Gates, who should return to Washington on Friday, met with the Iraqn Premier Minister Soloi al-Maliki before he fought in the dead Korean region in Iraq to meet soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdian authorities in Irbil.
The disparities between the courses and the Arab majority in Iraq have continued to be high, particularly in relation to borders, property rights and the allocation of public revenues.
Gates moved both sides to reduce the potential of conflict to prevent the delays of the United States plans to disappear American troops until the end of August 115,000 to 50,000.
Gates also tried to disappear the Korean concern about the previous troops. The US representatives who were located in Masud Barzani, President of the Korean Regional Government, said: "We will receive your security, your prosperity and your autonomie within a unique Iraq.
We won't leave you."
A course change in the former China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up from propaganda platelets that said to them, "Moeder Earth is too comfortable to maintain other children" and "A baby more means a more grave."
These lessons have learned so well that, as government official in Shanghai, who had a lower birth rate and the elderly people in this summer began to change the course and encourage young couples to have more than a child, their answer was directly and finally: "If no case."
We have already invested our time and energy in a child.
For a second child there is nothing else, said Wang, 31, a staff leader with an 8-monate old son.
More than 30 years after the establishment of a Kind Politics in China, which produced two generations of notoricly dick and disordered individual children who are called "learn" lovely "pair" is a crisis of population in the country.
The average birth rate is 1.8 children per couple compared to 6 when this policy entered into force, the UNO is in place.
Division for population issues is determined, while the number of populations of 60 years and older in 2020 will increase from 16.7 per cent of the population to 2050 to 31.1 per cent. This is higher over the average of about 20 percent.
The unbalance weight is in rich coast towns with formed populations, such as Shanghai, stronger.
Last year, 60 years old and elderly almost 22 percent of the inhabitants of Shanghai notified, while the birth rate was located under a child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai city planning and family planning committee, said that couples need to get in the productionable age of babys to "by help to reduce the relationship of the older populations and deliver the work manager of the future".
Shanghai will be so old -- but not so rich -- like the industrial countries such as Japan and Sweden, " she said.
A critical relaxation
In the Constitution of the country in 1978, China must have been the most circumstanced politics introduced by the ruling communist party to this day.
Ehepairs, which are contrary to this policy, must be counted with huge money--- until their three-year content in some regions -- and with discrimination on their workplace.
The Chinese State Representatives have admitted this policy that the critical appeal of the natural country resources could be avoided, in which human rights condemned mistoods have been condemned in the implementation of the policy.
In rural regions, some employees who already had a child have forced to depart.
Many couples were also allowed to carry bad elections, with an unfairly high relationship of men with women.
In the past few years, government advertisers have decreased their position to an Kind Politics.
In 2004, they have allowed more exceptions of the regulation - including town residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both marriage, as well as marriage individual children - and 2007 the sound of many hard slogans was disappeared.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the University of Peking Research Institute, said that Governmentsvertors have even discussed on more radical changes, for example, two couples of children in which a partner is individual.
Shanghai was launched in July to the first Chinese city, which started a aggressive campaign to promote more births.
The places that the families learned to have only a child have been replaced almost by night by directives, which are detailedly described who is asked for a second child and how you can request the approval.
The town management has sent stedical officers and volunteers for family planning to visit pairs at home and to spend information leaves into the doors.
She also asked to provide psychological and financial consultations for the available ones who have more than a child.
The reaction was not exactly encouraging, saying family planning contractor.
Exploiting Reaction
Although officials from a rural small town in the outdoor areas of Shanghai said that a decrease is to recognize pairs' claims, which wished to be a second child after the campaign starting the campaigns, there is no change.
At the municipality of Huinan, a number of 115.000 inhabitants, for example, are still four to five requests.
The skills' officials say that the number of births in the city in 2010, although the campaign is still 165,000, is still more than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juging, Chief of the Family Planning Committee of the Shanghai community Caolu, said that financial considerations are likely to be the main reason why many people don't want children.
They want to give the best to her first, she said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said that they would like two children, and that would also be right.
But they have, as many Chineses, only a low health insurance and life insurance of the government.
Without a social network, they say that this decision would be without responsibility.
People in the West assess the one-Kind Politics as human rights question, said Yang, a builder whose wife is widowed in the seventh month with her first child.
Yes, you're going to get more than a child.
The problem is not just in a policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples give psychological reasons for their teenagers.
Wang, the staff leader, said that she only wanted a child because she was a single child. "We were the family's average point and lived that everyone was concerned about us.
We are not ordinary to take care of others and do not really want this."
Chen Zeian, a 42-year-old who listed to a translation company, said it's unresolved.
For parents from the Medium with double carrier, by which the birth race, he said that it would be successful and that you must be egoistic.
The age group of the 20 to 39 years has increased to see their parents during the early day of the Chinese capitalism experience and they want to live for themselves, he said.
A single child, also said, provides great requirements for the time of the parents.
A mother must give her social life at least two years.
Then there's the room question -- "If you have to build his apartment" - and life planning -- "When the child is nine months, you have already got to prepare a life course for the best schools."
Most of his friends are ready to spend this once, said Chen, but not two times.
Our generation is the first who has reached a higher life standard, he said.
We don't want to offer too many victims.
UNO Group projected emission reduction plan
The climateference of the UNO, which is described by wild poess and mutual accused, has reiterated a difficult point to publish a document for the next 40 years, with the industries in the nearest future should be the greatest burdens.
The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the regulation of the trail gas has shown the remaining obstacles, as well as the path forward.
But he was considered as an important progress in a negotiation that is coming the time, since the next week more than 100 spring politicians from all the world in Kopenhagen.
The text which has been formulated by a United Nations arms group for it is disappointed by the money wages that the rich countries should give to the poor countries so that they can short- and long-term increase.
It also offers a Palette of options for key questions, including industrial and large countries, to reduce their coal-carburant expenditures, and how high the upper limit value of the global temperature growth that would contribute to political decisions.
The process will provide a great flexibility, so John Coequeyt, Leader of the Sierra Clubs in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutiar, which has designed the six-party document, has collected a 180 pages of negotiation text in order to put the middle point of the leading climate protector of the UNO, Yvo de Boer, as "the great whole".
It shows the basic risk of an possible agreement to which industrialities together will reduce their emissions to 2020 by 25 to 45 per cent, compared to the 1990 limit values, while larger developing countries would reduce emissions in the same period by 15 to 30 per cent.
Commonly, the emissions could reduce up to 2050 to 50 to 95 percent.
The European Community has also provided the discussions on Friday by its insurance to prepare over the next three years a year to support other countries to adapt the impact of climate change, from the masters of overwhelms and drugs to avoid disappearance.
On Friday, however, brought the same locked fireworks that had decided the conversations in the last week.
The American climate designed Todd Stern has rejected formulations, linked declines of railway gas emissions for industrial countries, compared with voluntary reductions for larger weak countries, if they are not financed by industry.
This trip announced that the Obama Government is a stronger line with China as a representative of the Bush Government not even two years ago.
The United States will not sign the agreements without taking greater weak countries and take measures, as well as the stars in the fact that the text is not far enough to ensure that the results could be confirmed from outside.
At the time after the declaration of the Chinese Victoria Minister He Yafei, who argued that it was the leading American climate-in-law manager or the "such unfair" of him that he said that the United States would not be financially helping the global resolve.
Since the future economic management of the world's large world volumes, both within the industry and between industry and the low-level countries have been opened.
The current fight relates to the salvation of individual economics, as well as to the salvation of the planet, whereby China and the United States are concerned in their respective obligations, while the two decades of the most influent countries would ignore the scientific need to take negative actions.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said that it is not surprised that the great volumes are fighting who should lead the costs for the combustion of the trail gas expenditure, since even concerned countries have been overcome to get aggressive to the countries with a very high railgase benefit for their work.
This is a very clear game that will develop a new economic pre-region, which is also operating as a regional climate change operator for conservation international in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries that have been the most strongest effect of climate change have given that they would continue to fight a legally binding treaty in Kopenhagen, although the leaders say that the conversations will be conducted in the best case to a political agreement.
The Alliance of the small island countries with 43 Members presented a draft contract on Friday on 24-one.
Artur Runge mechanism, which leads international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said that the opening of the small islands 'conducting political pressure on the whole political process' is partly because they are now deprived and demands from the weak countries such as China and India.
The conversations have been a new trend when the delegations focused on the fact that most open questions are still needed to be closed before the government leaders come to an agreement.
The highest representatives, such as the Indian Minister of Environment Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister, disappeared their aircrafts and rarely by the Bella center in meetings with the closed gates and press conferences to discover the Claims who are negotiated during the next week.
The clean dimension of the congregation -- 13,000 people are in the Congress centre daily and exhibit, playing actors with a nice show in which they make a pleasure about countries that are being consulted and sold, and treaty projects will be continued by hand by e-mail -- there is already a challenge.
Intensity is only based on: Most of all the important ministers are now here and from Wednesday 60 government leaders will be in Copenhagen.
We're coming to the top, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for the global policy of the Organization Conservation International.
The weights are coming.
Britain first 225 km/h speed defines the new Monday feeling
Monday at 5:00 p.m., a feed is moving the darkness to announce assets that represents a revolution in Britain.
The first high speed feed in the country will be reached at its Blitz travel from Ashfort, Kent, to London St. Pancras 225 km/h and stay in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will then be sent to Mrs Kelly Holmes at the border of the first Javelin-Pendler service from London.
He hopes that the new United Kingdom Service will finally be linked to an international railway faster, reliable sugars and will join the large areas of the Middle Eastern, Northern and Scottland to London.
The surrounded province could be made to live pending stations, radially reducing working time and reducing the use of airports and vehicles on the train would reduce national carbon emissions and steel on the roads.
In the theory, the three large parties believe this vision.
But the many billions of British Pfunds that are necessary for the construction of a new national scene, which could still take the breasts of the irregular planning and threats on environmental damages.
High Speed Two (HS2) (HS2), a company based in January, which will provide an outstanding study, Lord Adonis will reach the report on 30 December.
It receives a detailed street card of the next planned level of high speed speed.
The new train line that London will be connected to the West Midlands will lead to a play space of five meters in urban areas and places where the impacts on the environmental are affected.
In the free area, the plan will reveal the concept within a distance of 25 meters from the final street.
HS2 must also create three options for a larger, northern high speed speed use.
Lord Adonis will react to this early.
The preferred option is an Y-Free Street management, which would lead to the West Midland's individual high speed street.
The street would be divided in or near Birmingham, and a disagreement would lead the pennaine to Manchester and Shottland, and another in northern direction to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
An individual line would lead to Shotland.
"It seems to be the best functioning option," said a railway engineer.
After the completion, the travel time between London and Edinburgh would reduce at 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first partstream that would not be opened before 2025 would allow the travelers to restore the street London-Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with something today over a hour.
The disappearances allowed the way to go with a speed of 400 km/h, so that the British rail would be the fastest Europe.
The first street was planned so that 400 meters long weighs with a maximum capacity of 1.100 people.
Before 18 guests could be operated on the street of London-Birmingham.
This would reiterate that a final station in London would be needed to be completed at 20,000 travelers for hour.
In view of the local restrictions in the capital, a existing railway would be built to undertake the high speed network.
Bahn experts say that only St. Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will indicate whether this plan should be continued or not, but the long public consultation and planning measures mean that a final decision will be taken only after Parliament's elections.
But even when he puts the wheels into move, the ship must be built in sections.
First of the high speed lines on existing railways in the north of Birmingham, which would continue to be between London and Shotland in over three hours.
This shall apply as an essential changing point to ensure a weapon from the aircraft to the train is a fair measure for the rail revolution.
The tax payment of hypotheks for 75,000 Pfund orrange of a conservative

The normal stuffless RBS-hypothekenzin was of 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 percent in March of this year where he still stands.
The latest documents published in the home show that Duncan has continued its right to 1.250 per cent for a month.

He said, "I gave my money for my gardens, and argued a lacking part of the things which are listed to.
And I could invite all the bad sums, but I don't do it."
The Parliament's Member, Millioner of his previous carrier as oil-growdr, was the first time in May, acted because of its expenditures, as it was clear that he had requested thousands of Pfund for his garden before he had declared the Fee office that it could be "such as overrided".
A activeist in the Duncan Rasen has buried a loch in the form of a pfund sign after acknowledged that he had requested about 4.000 percent (4.500 euros).
When he was asked about the increased Hypothek last night, Duncan said: "This was both the Fees Office, as well as the following laws on value increase."
He added: "There is not a debate on extents and long-terms, or a breach of rules or extraordinary.
Everything is perfect through viewable and moved closely within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer."

This debate was throwned in the documentary film "Roman Polanski: desired and desired" (Roman Polanski: persecuted and condemned), himself by the lawyer of David Wells.
Mr. Wells had expensively explained to have the authors of the documentary film "belogen".
If the Court of Justice refuses to establish the proceedings, Hummel requests the guide of a process that would allow him to provide evidence for its argumentation.
On the other hand, the complaint has reiterated the proof in the first instance, that a discussion on the resuming of the conditions laid down to the complaint is not seriously understood as long as Roman Polanski has not appeared before the court.
The 76-year registry was flood from the United States in 1978, yet before the condemnation of the criminal proceedings on the "ilegaler sexual relations" with a minor age of 13 years.
Since this time, he hasn't gone back into the United States.
The discipline of Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, explained that Roman Polanski had to be "to have to live in the negotiation."
You would like to spread the message in this matter, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other complaints, which are a flight's possibility?, Mrs Asayma asks.
His view is "bit of the film masters the Court of Justice for a pleasure and respects his authority".
One of the three judges – who now have 90 days to make acknowledge their decision – should even say, "there would be other flight-terms".
Hummel was not the only one who requested the appointment of the criminal persecution against Roman Polanski.
The advocate of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also requested the resurrection of the criminal procedure.
She recalled that her clients wouldn't have to be resolved by any resurrection of the Empire Polanski and added: "No one in this room can say that this procedure was right.
Thirty-two years are enough."
On 26 September, Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on the adoption of an American Haft Command.
After two months later he was sent to his household in Gstaad in waiting for a possible delivery.

The news to Johnny Hallyday are by his son David "sehr positive"
The news to Johnny Hallyday are "sehr positive", his son David certified the Friday at his arrival at Los Angeles airport, where he visited his father who was there for a few days in the hospital.
The news are very positive.
He's very strong, it's really good, and David Hallyday explained the press when the aircraft was exited, in which he came shortly after 13:00 local time (21:00 MEZ) from Paris.
The son of the Sänger, who made a relaxed impression, assured that he would be "stthing" in the hospital of Cedars-Sinaï, in which Johnny Hallyday was engaged on Monday because of a bacterial consequence in effect after an operation at a band chain case in Paris on 26 November.
The song was "the same night in Los Angeles in an artistic coma to lever his strong pain and to conduct his treatment, the press service was known.
Johnny Hallyday was placed by the doctors of the hospital of Cedars-Sinaï in Los Angeles in a artistic coma in which he was offered to Paris on Monday because of a bacterial infection after a bandscheiben operation on 26 November.
The singer had to be held in the night from Tuesday on Thursday because of the patient changes had been re-exacerbated by the opposition.
His wife Laetia took part in the French Gymnasium of Los Angeles, where her daughter Jade went to school on Friday, a photograph of the AFP was established.
The Chief of the Division for orthopedic and traumatological chirurgic in the hospital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the Sänger on Monday in the hospital in Los Angeles.
The producer has made the Neurochirurg Dr. Stefane Delajoux, who has covered the Sänger on 26 November in the Clinique International du Parc Monceau in Paris, hardly charged.
We've been explaining that he has set the biggest mass.
The circles of Los Angeles said that they were completely enthusished, Mr Camus explained.
I heard that a court procedure could be taken, he said.
John-Claude Camus is the view that Johnny Hallyday is "toot fast and that's in place with the permission of the Paris Chirurgen to Los Angeles".
I have called this doctor personally who assured me that he looked at this travel as a whole uncertain problem, what was very surprised me, because I already had two band-shake operations behind me, he added.
Soon before he declared that the snarer appears after the operation "ohne Drainage, without everything" would leave the hospital.
Dr. Stefane Delajoux is very well known in the artist.
He had the player Mary Trintgnant, covered a few days before her death in Vilnius, in a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he had practised at this time.
In 2007, he also covered the player Charlotte Gansburg to restore a hematom after a brain blue.
However, he is also a doctor who has a doubtful call that has already been condemned because of miscarriage operations and not forget, because of tax interview and fraude.
Me Olivier Metzner, the right officer of the doctor, has called him as a "one man without a scrupule" who has "regularly" response to the room and "all others as a recommended".
After a few days of the summer, Dr. Stefane Delajoux gave a statement on his lawyer, David Koubbi.
This explains that the intervention would be "perfective" and postoperative investigations would be "normal".
The operation "written no blood and therefore does not require drainage," he added.
Anyway, it seems to be the tourn of the scanner, whose health problems are settled since the summer.
It is clear that there is something to take for the continued tournament on 8 January (Amania), Mr Camus explained.
The UDF Party (Union for the French Democracy) is energetic and requests the Party to not more use its series
The party party who is monitored by François Bayrou's Party MoDem on Friday has reacted a research of the hill, which was the first part founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing by the Chairman of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, and requested him to use this record on no more.
Hervé Morin publicly announces its intention to take this UDF seal, because he thinks that François Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political heritage after the left hands.
The Minister of Defence, whose Party is the UMP, also wanted to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
To emphasis its efforts, he had received the support of the Deputy Hervé de Charte (ehemalig UMP, now at NC) who raised an approximation on the ownership of the UDF Mark, since he first requested this brand at the "Institute National de la Properties Industrial".
However, the operating office of the friends of François Bayrous's party's attendance overlooked the weakness of the UDF and made clearly understand that they did not understood and placed the ministry as well as the deputy of a Judicial persecution a period to use this seal and to transmit the ownership of the brands.
In the last days you have declared numerous statements that you would propose your political movement to + overcome the UDF Seegel+, the party's allegement wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 officers, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, the Party MoDem, and Senator Jean Arthuis of the Senator.
You also believed that you had the right to print the name of this movement +Newau Centre+, the Slogans + the current UDF+, on their political material and on the starting site.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the UDF Business office explains and calls for the NN Party to "to immediately remove the mention of the name of UDF from all materials and from (e.g.) sites."
It was also requested by Hervé de Charte to transmit the properties of the brand to their legal rights."
If you refuse this, we will be endorsed against you in order to ensuring the law and to protect the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatures will be warned.
In their letter, they remarked that "UDF" has been a complete political movement since 1978 and remember that Morin and his friends had been taken "the election" to leave these 2007 to establish a competitive movement, as it had already done in 2002 to establish the "UMP" parties.
The Party has therefore no right to use the UDF-Segel (EU for French Democracy) according to the signs.
They continue to recall that the last UDF Congress in 2007 has decided the three-year access to Party MoDem and the creation of a business office to defend "the material and moral interests" of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, which was founded by Valéry Gisaing.
What Hervé de Charte requests, then the business office continues, "although he has requested the brand names, it has not been a member of the UDF" but the UMP for three years.
It benefits to scanda solve and deployment, from the lack of the interruption of the UDF Akronym to carry this for himself.
Furthermore, let us think that this disobedience is the best way to turn into a penalty, and ironize the strategie of the NC: "It appears to us in the policy and in life to make itself a name instead of try to come from anonymity by giving a name in abusive way on which you do not have any legal examination."
Affaire Liliane bedcourt : François-Marie Banier is judged because of weakness

The 62-year-old photograph that is known for his Starfotos shall be responsible for the exemption of weakness to the court on 15 and 16 April 2010, a penalty which is entrusted with a trial of a maximum of three years and a moneystrate of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will actually be a process in this business that is worthy of one of the richest familys of France, where mother and daughter are working and at the same time have the bells of the Cosmetikimperium L'Oreal in the hand.
However, the 15th sentence chamber of the 87-year-old Liliane beds, which is carried out together by three doctors.
The Erbin and Main Action Director of L'Oreal has not been denied to undertake such an investigation, especially among the conditions provided by the State authority of Nanterre.
The doctors called on Friday must submit a report before 10 March 2010 in which you know whether and at which time Lyliane bedcourt has been found in a state of weakness.
I think she will undertake these investigations.
I'll talk to her, the lawyer of Ms. Bettencourt, Me Georges Kiejman, after the negotiation.
As a matter of the law entitled by Françoise bedcourt-Meyers, Me Olivier metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the Court.
This is an excellent news (...). The well-knowledge will prove that he has manipulated this old dame that you need to protect.
Since two years, the only daughter of Liliane bedcourt has introduced a criminal object against François-Marie Banier, photograph and Allround Artistler, and accurates him to have used the weakness of her mother years to disappear the total of a million euros in the form of bankschecks, insurance politicians or farmers.
Then Liliane had constantly resisted to be manipulated by the photograph that she looked as a long-year friend.
Although the court should examine the authority of the case introduced by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the placers of the applicants have brought to a great family board on Friday.
Thus the lawyer of Lyliane's bedcourt called on three of her clients sent to her noir (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she missed the marriage of Françoise bed-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Lyliane was added to the following: "Let's please explain my daughter that I have written for fifteen years, one to two times a day in Banier.
I never could speak anymore since her host.'
The State Administration of Nanterre reiterates that the applicant has no right to react, especially because a presidency director has rejected its request in the last days to introduce a prosecution procedure against her mother.
Liliane bedcourt "It's full lawful, is not under protection and has no prejudice.
No one has the right to act on its place," confirmed the representative of the State authorities, Mary-Christine Daubigney.
The Court has now decided to cease a sentence after the process was made to allow Mrs Bettencourt-Meyer.
Manager revolution or the end of the strategic early declaration?
If nothing changes to the leading of the great French company has been our struggle for the development of economic intelligence...
Since a decade, the holding of the management of large enterprises in relation to its employees, the position of the consumers in front of the Marketing Revolution: It is determined to be the best as it was previously involved in the consumer products of the technologies in the work.
In order to make the customers in the middle of the company, the Marketing Revolution has given the market rehabilitation strategy at the place ... although the authorized trial of products separate factors of customer preferences are regularly linked!
A demobilization of employees can lead to death demoralization.
The self-assassins in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the lines of a greater phenomenon, which affects the officials.
This demobilization affects the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, particularly those of F­Eund, which is more important, on those of the economic intelligence.
In fact, IE (intelligence economic = economic intelligence) calls for "to all parties involved a proactiv action and an accession-oriented view"; this is the aim of employees to oppose the instructions of the authorized management.
This is why we call for an operational revolution that would exist in order to establish the employees in the support point of the company's attacks equivalent to the customers.
The very detrimented benefits of internal views
Did the internal views, such as the questionbome, which the Orange has extended his loans, address this revolution in relation to the management process?
I was afraid, I'm not sorry.
- First, because I could find that the entire addment in terms of a new situation after many circumstances finally begins to do this, what has always done.
Although the authorism is to take one of the pathologys of the power proportional to the importance of his own fault.
And finally, because most leading forces have a strongly simplified idea of human behaviour.
Forwards from the great engineer school is its interpretation of the psychology mechanistic.
It takes the old behavioristic theorie reactivated by the US new sciences and unrecognised by research institutions and media.
So and suggesting that it is possible to confirm the "Hebel" (sic) for the engagement of officers, a current Le Figaro.fr survey appeared to the leading forces in a stop to a mechanistic control system that is unfair for the present world.
Identify and measure mobility factors
However, a operational revolution needed for the modern enterprises to adopt a definitive view of human behaviour.
It is to integrate a basic protocol in any transaction or practice of control: for the recipients, the engagement for the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a resource to achieve a part of their dreams, their honor and projects.
At the same time, the studies from the multifunctional analysis will be carried out by this approach to the mobilization of employees.
These studies showed that they assess their companies on the basis of an proposed doctor that allows them to assess what it offers to them to achieve their life objectives.
Thanks to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, the undertakings may control their “social performance”, prevent and move and retain their human resource management on the right place.
Thus, they create a fruitful land that is good for the development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The talk of Oslo: the "right war" brings Obama Lob right
The American rights welcomed Barack Obama's previous talk in Oslo and was satisfied that the noble price of 2009 has defended the definition of the "right war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives that had paid the price allocation of Obama on 9 October applauded this time the speaking of the President, the example of the former Vice-Presidentity Commander at the elections of 2008 Sarah Palin.
I appreciate what he said, Palin explained that the face of the right flow of the Republician Party in the period of day of the US Today and added that she itself had brought the subject of a "timely necessary" wars in their own language.
The war is of course the last I think the Americans want to do it, but it is necessary.
We need to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who has committed two wars of his predecessor George W. Bush, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, has strived to justify the use of violence in Oslo, and a way to explain its decision from nine days ago, 30,000 additional soldiers to Afghanistan.
Another gentlemen of Obama, Newt Gingrich, is the opinion that the President has been working in Oslo "reaching good work".
I found that the speech was really very good, pleased the former President of the representative house, particularly recognizing the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in the words of Obama.
In some parts I discovered this speech completely and even as historically, Ginrich explained that the radio section "The Takeaway" was asked.
The present deputy, who was considered by some of the candidates for the republic appointment of the Presidency election 2012, said he had been happy to have seen a "president of the left" who remembered the members of the Nobel Committee that they would "not be free and could not extend a price for peace if the use of violence would not exist."
For Michael Gerson, the previous writer of George W. Bush and the middle of the Redaktor at Washington Post, Obama kept a very American talk.
Furthermore, it is a "Cosmopolit" as "the always does it," he said, "as a American President," he believed that the Europeans "such as live in a security bulletin that they didn't have created themselves, and they do not much for their protection," as Gerson.
Among the few, unconvincted rights described the former UNO busers John Bolton, a false of the media Bush, the talk on the website of the National Review Online as "langeful, high-review and inspiration."
On the left of the President, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich regrets how Barack Obama defends the resistance to the forces of war.
If you're packing the war under the deck of justice, the masker can be justified to the innocents, he warns.
However, the press of the mixed left remains lovers on the side of the President.
The Los Angeles Times, who still considers that the Nobel Price was forgiven to Obama, described the speaker itself for a ruler like him who is known for his talent as "Monumentalwork".
The speaking in Oslo "provides a final plan to control international decisions against conflicts, poverty and subpression, so the California daily period.
The New York Times believes that Obama was announced the necessary diskurs and describes his speech as "retrous and player".
Televisors: Three Marathons for a agreement guaranteed for Christmas
After a three-third negotiation marathon, the companys of the road trade and the TLF - the only employees who remained until the end of the free day to an agreement, which puts the strike order and the severe supply pass to Christmas.
At the subtitle session at the Freitagend "grateful" of the State Secretary responsible for the transport, Dominique Bussereau, the agreement introduced on middlemorrow after several negotiations was introduced.
Following a second negotiation, the negotiators divided the early Friday in the hope of signing the agreement on the later day.
And this, though the three employees (FNTR, Unostra and ORES) had left the meeting.
However, there were more than six hours from the beginning of the meeting at 11:00 until the end of the agreement and the agreement was signed at 18:00 p.m.
The conflict "to added to the company a lot of damage" and "He was to fear that he would affect the feast at the end of the year," Bussereau.
The Agreement provides an increase in expenditure of 4 % for lower lower oil (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest loan groups (international transport).
The hour rate for employees with the lower lenses increases from 8,72 euros to 9,06 euros.
"It's not very much, but we're going to be small first", says Patrice Clos (FO).
The actives are now designed to not block the supply centres.
"It will always be given some contrary that are not satisfied with the agreement", he adds.
The TLF Presidency Philip Grillot said of a "good agreement", although it was "fair to create these wages in view of international competition".
The increase of 170 euros is a monthly amounted to the lower and 100 to 120 euros for the high loan groups.
"This agreement focuses on the healthy human mind and respect against employees," said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), which Thierry Douine (CFTC) said by "the historical agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) explained that of "related admissible compromise".
The Agreement also considers the increase in travel costs of 3%, and the maintenance of the total net for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will be able to include the subject 13. month content and modernization of tariff contracts.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that "the synthetics of the allocations for employees at 100 million euros" of an amendment of the Government on the Prosecution of the financial statements reported for 2009, which was adopted by the National Assembly at the night from Thursday to Friday.
The Government calls for a vote by the Senate.
The TLF's signature allows the agreement first to apply the undertakings associated with this organization and then applys in the case of extension by the Ministry of Employment for the whole status.
This will be "in shortest time" of the case, secure bussereau.
The opposition of employees can only leave the procedure.
The FNTR shipped a "related trade", because the 100 million euros have already been promised "containing the sector as compared to a part of the carbon tax."
The State Secretariat for Transport has forced us to negotiate as quickly as possible, but not on the basis of a common analysis, but in order to defend the Guans-Esers at the nearest birthdays, the unostra is defended.
For the Contract Otre, the Agreement calls for "the small and medium-sized enterprises of the industry in the coming 12 months."
Lines RER A: Ungratefully satisfactory in this weekend, working with the proposals of the RATP
The stars on the RER A, the largest speed network in France for the Great Space and the île-de-France, continued in the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, on the 2th street between the companys and the leading of the RATP (Independent of Party’s transport management) continued to continue, while warrants with their requests for loans.
At this important shot of shops before Christmas between 10:00 and 20:00. At the Central Street (Czech La Defense and Nation) there was only one of the two tickets and outside the central street only one of the four thresholds.
In Nanterre Prefecture, the SNCF was suspended by the travelers to the rise.
The buy chain Galeries Lafayette, which each day appreciates 200,000 customers, welcomed the fact that "I know the RATP seeks to join large businesses".
The RER A line passes over the Paris Balance Space of West to East.
The area of the RATP lies the places Saint-Germanin-en-Laye and Nanterre as well as Boissy-Saint-Leger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one of two buses was planned for the main movement time, and nearly no one during the movement model.
As already on Thursday, there were no human samples on the streets, since the inhabitants of the île-de-France had introduced to the situation.
So early in the morning, Saint-Germanin-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less overway than other, especially because of the lack of Gymnasiasts.
In Boissy-Saint-Leger (Val-de-Marne) said Jack Nbakina, Ingenieur (29), he would be an extra "in an hour early up to come to work."
The SNCF, which had planned a threat of travellers by service officers and order forces, not to say that there was no complaints in Saint-Lazare race.
The SNCF operated on the RER A, or in direction Cergy-Le-Haut, operating the SNCF on the line of the RER A or traveling from the Saint-Lazare railway to ensure that the metros can be concluded.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main meetings of the streets were revealed while the results were checked after the meeting with the leading pioneers on the afternoon afternoon, as "vail" were entered.
A specific protocol for RER lines in terms of all relevant aspects, working times, professional courses, etc.
However, this is not what the drivers want. According to Thierry Garon (Sud) they call for a long-fall reward.
The CGT was emphasized that the RATP itself puts its payment proposals in clays and noted that the leading pipe is "not able to solve a problem while it was possible for telecommunicators and the SNCF."
The RATP cleared that a new meeting to "comprehensive working conditions" was intended for Monday.
This also shows the commitments that the company is ignored by the end of the week.
On Monday, 150 drivers were looking for the release of a committee in Paris.
Again, it was the leading pipet that dismissed any discussion during the street, and a meeting near after a disappearance of the situation.
On Tuesday, the conflict took place, after birth annotation of Unsa and Independents on the RER B line.
The parties require a payment of 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, from which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Southern, Independents), and the damage of the working conditions on this street, which is on the day of millions of travelers.
The drivers of the RER line, which have over annual training, include a lower loan from 2.200 to 2.700 euros, as well as a loan of 600 to 650 euros for shipping services, as well as a Sonn and Feeding.
Turkish Constitutional Governance solves pro-curdian parties. Decisions with severe consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Governance has known on Friday the resolution of the Pro-Curdian Chairperson of the country; a decision that followed the inevitable demonstrations in the Korean Community in the southern East of the country and in Istanbul.
This decision seeks to stress the work of the Government that seeks to enlarge the Korean Community to make the end of the 25 years during conflicts.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was resolved as it became a "State for Activities which are concerned for the independence of the State and its independent unity," the President of the Constitutional Governance of the Church four days after the decision against the press.
According to the Kilise, the decision would be one of 11 judges, which would be necessary for the majority of seven votes to resolve the resolution. He also suggested that 37 of the leading forces of the party, including the President Ahmet Turkk and the parliamentary Turchin, were excluded by the political event for five years.
Furthermore, the judge announced the resurrection of the parliamentary immunity, the Turk and Tugness, and the confidence of the goods of the parties.
The DTP now has more than 21 places in the Parliament (550).
The parties expressed the sentence that Parliament would like to leave Parliament as part-off parliamentaries.
In 2007, the decision followed a proceeding by the Government of the Turkish Federal Guideline Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, which accused the DTP to follow the 'Commissions' of the Kurdistan Working Party (PKC), which was considered by Ankara and numerous other countries as a terrorist organization.
A number of observers believe that the DTP is the legal policy screen of the PK Rebellions.
The Party ensures that "no connection" to the PKC, however, refuses to describe it as a terrorist organization and calls for the Government to negotiate.
The terms of the Constitutional Governance is the Government who is encouraging to meet the Korean Community and to propose a number of measures to strengthen the rights of the courses, to allow the PKC support through the courses and to establish conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP confirm that a solution could lead to a reduction of the breach in South-East-Anatolys, where numerous demonstrations had been conducted against the conditions of the PKK-Chhefs Abdullah Öcalan in recent weeks.
Since the proclaimation of the Court was gathered thousands of demonstrators before DTP's racists in the Middle of Diyarbakir city, which is overcome by Kurdens.
The Order forces set the dry gases and watercraft when the demonstrators began to throw molotow cocktails and stones.
100 people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
Turkish said that the decision of the Court "the defence will still be deepened".
"The Turkey can not clothe this (kurdic, anm. d. Editon) question by the prohibition of a party," said he.
The Government, consisting of a party who has come out of the Islamist movement, also deployed the decision.
"We oppose the principle against the closure of the parties.
This does not solve the problems," the Energy Minister Taner Yilz.
"This decision is a tourption of the democratic opening which has been promoted by the Government," said the political market observer Ahmet island.
"You can, obviously, behave to a reaction of the PKK," he adds.
On Thursday, the PKK was known to an attack in which three days before seven soldiers came to live in the north of Turkey, and it was one of the worst attacks of the past months.
The snow push can come
A right crazy winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not as he wants to shock the citizens, he says the Winter minister of the FES.
Specially in order to test and control its employees all the vehicle technology.
In the weekend, the meteorologists could be so far first.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to worry about snow and ice.
The EESF will provide a precise plan.
When it is black in Frankfurt, and the temperatures are located under 0ll degrees, 20 A-Streaks will be disappeared with large raw vehicles, Brauburger explains.
This includes main movements and transition routes such as the new way and the Hanauer Landstraßes.
But also fireways, EPNV wheels, footing zones and streets with cases, such as the Atzelberg streets.
The EES service begins at 3:00 a.m.
The approximately 1040 kilometres should be resolved in a maximum of three hours with flat salt, which is better arrested.
This is why the EES starts about three hours by night, "for the streets are free until the professional movement starts."
It's going to be difficult when it's just 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter service manager, "for then no one is ready to make the stripe vehicles place."
First of all, if it is not black, it's the adding and exclusion routes, as well as the Council's Beil Stress, in the series.
The last priorities have pages and side tracks.
There will be a complaint, you know Brauburger.
Tomorrow, the ESF's footline is on the road, dangerous points and transitions.
In order to all its railways, the FES could not mostly worry.
There is a special service in Frankfurt, which is located from 22 to 4.30 p.m. in particular in the eye, Brauburger says.
As it is given on this fast planet, when the temperature falls under two degrees, the street runs.
This will also be called by the police.
The dinosauries
Tawa found out as many other flexibility dinosaur: The two meters long and 1,50 meters great animal slowed on two strong backs, had a slow shelter with sweet, bowed deeps, short arms with sicell wheels and a long weight.
If the kind had lived a few million years later, she would have nothing special.
But Tawa found one of the first dinosauries with these body characteristics, reported Sterling Nesbitt by the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Journal Science on Thursday.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in the today's New Mexico, which at the same time was in a dreaming area of the supercontinent Pangäa.
Tawa opens a new window to the early evolution of the Dinosaurier, says Nesbitt.
He shows us much about the relationships, the extension and the characteristics of the early dinosaur.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other Palestinologists began with a monument on the Spirit Ranch in the North New Mexico.
We sometimes found a decade dinosaurier knock, which is an abstract for delays from the Trias, reports the team member Randall Imis of Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the knees identified the researchers quickly as a new type.
During the exclusion, they gathered the overall of five individuals together.
Fund confirms theories of Dino Favoritory
The name "Tawa" is from the Sunngot of the Hopi Indian.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary fund: "Dinosaurier phossiles from the trias are extremely rare, mostly only individual breasts are found."
Other dinosaurier experts shall not be shared with the enhusiasm.
Specially spectacular is not this fund, but he confirms some theories about the early history of the Dinosaur, says about Martin Sander from the University of Bonn.
After the current learning, the Dinosauriers were first earliered about 230 million years ago.
Many of the elderly focusers are incomprehensive, because the regulation of this Ur-Dinos is mostly contrary.
Thus, the experts discuss, for example, when the Irons were set up in their three most important development lines: the flexibly theopods, which later the Tyransaurus king, the Velocir and the birds counted as "Langhales" four-known sauropods and their people, and the plants of fresh Ornithiski (Vogelbecksaurier), which were the types of Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
After the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa finds a original theropode.
He shows a interesting combination of premium and continuing properties, says Nesbitt.
At Tawa's hair, the researchers found for example indicators on air bags, such as they also have the followers of the theopodens, the birds.
Thanks to the air bottle, the appointment of the birds is more efficient than those of the sugar.
Thua found also the corners of the Wirbel hole were partly filled with air.
Tawa is the most old and primitive theopode with airs, says Randall Irmis.
Since the line of the large sauropodens was later visited air bottles and easy construction buttons, the common risks of both groups had probably been made these useful innovations.
At least three migration rooms to North America
Because the firstly known Dinosauriers lived in South America, the researchers follow that the Irons had first relaxed there.
Furthermore, the three lines of development have been divided early and spread from South America over all the earthquakes that have yet formed a single landscape as Supercontinent Pangäa.
For this reason, the fact that the team together with Tawa found the oversight of two others, not particularly a mutated theopoeds.
Thirds can't deal with a common, immigrated progress, argue the researchers.
We believe there was at least three migration villages to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a comprehensive of the Science Study.
There are also contradictions.
An elder kind, Silesaurus, who was listed to a group of the Dinosaurier, lived in the today's Poland, says Bonner Paloontologe Martin Sander.
His view could be made a disappointed image because in South America, it was easy to get many primitive dino phossicians, while on other continents there is nothing to find.
As the Dinosaurians had created to develop from a relatively rare line of the recptilím to the dominated farmers of the earthquake, it is still rarely.
During the Trias, the Dinosauriers were shared with many other republics, for example, with the experiences of the current chrokodial and the aircraft, and with many others.
At the end of the trias, the Dinosauriers spread around the world and developed many new species, while the captivity was extended to the border of the Trias to Jura.
Success history did not include
There are two hypotheses to explain this thing, says Martin Sander.
It could have given a massive death that survive the dinosauries, but not other republics.
Or the dinosaurians were better adapted so they could smile the competitiveness from the field.
The success story did, in any case, did not.
150 million years later, a meteorit impairment of a group of animals in the flower, which had already developed in the trias and since a slightest season: the shoes.
Solidarity from Wien to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the subscriptors are international.
Professors of the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the United Vienna or Berkeley in California.
Decades from Neapel are from Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen.
The police removal of the settled Casino of Frankfurter Goethe University offers wheels worldwide.
278 professors and teachers of the University of Goethe, but also from high schools throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America are solidary with the protestant students on the West Camp.
In a German and English declaration "misable deployment" they have the police set out by the presidency.
Uni President Werner Müller-Estler had allowed students and decades in the education Street to create the past week because the walls and arts were designed.
Five students have been disappeared.
The skills, urge the subscriptors, did not justify "the powerful solution of self-organized students and teachers by a police command".
The removal provides a "not acceptable impact" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on Vandalism is "deliminating and criminalization of the test" and lacking from the contents.
The Presidency has been dismissed from the necessary discipline.
The tens require immediate prosecution of criminal persecution.
The majority of the owner has not supported the debt, it means.
Test legitimated
Gentlemen of the Verdi and the German Communication Union is also solidary with the students.
The test is a legitimate expression of a growing concern for the own future, says Verdi-Landes Senator Alexander Klein.
The Minister of Science Eva Kohne-Hörmann (CDU) defended the action of the University and the police.
We are grateful to the U.S.
Divorce and order are completely uncertainable resources, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the countryday of Kuwasbaden.
We have understanding for the test, but no understanding for Vandalism, so Peter Beuth's Master's CDU Sunday.
Otherwise, the SPD, Green and Links were seen.
The CDU takes sharing walls on the front to criminalise the test, said Janine Wisler (Linke).
In case of the arguments and requests of students, it has been pleased.
The left has introduced a request request for the minister of the Interior to report on the police use.
New Silicon-Valley
For many years, she became a secret city for Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of the ten places of the capital of Moscow, was a closely guarded location in the Sowjetunion.
Today, the communion with its 216,000 inhabitants is 37 kilometers away from the Moscow Centre, as "russe Silicon Valley".
The important research and production sites are here for micro- and nano-electronics.
Since September 2008, representatives of Selenograds were connected to the Frankfurter Sciencesort Riedberg - with the United institutions and the company of the Frankfurter Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and in middle now signed Selenograd and Riedberg in Frankfurt a "Protokoll for a cooperation".
The Moscow Vize Minister Juri Rosljak and Prefect Anatoly Smirnov of Selenograd brought the Russian Delegation, for Frankfurt subscribed planning designer Edwin Black.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises will be traveled for a seminar to Selenograd.
Science Exchange
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it is also about economic relations.
The company of the FIZ will be allowed to take foot on the growing Russian market.
Returned Russian scientists want to take place in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of the Russian research institutions and companies.
This includes the Moscow Institute for Electronic Technology, the large concerts of Sitronics and Russianskaja Elektronica.
The Common was founded in 1958 as the so-calistic Planet City for Rüstung Research.
Selenograd (extraditional "Greenstad") received its name from the manager's countryside where the research institutions are implemented.
Stuttgary Bremsclot
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 cannot be high enough.
For the project's responsibilities it's easy and simply about the "new heart of Europe".
Right so. S21 is much more than the building of a train court, more than a monströse construction project that will be turned to the City of the Bad-Württembergian City for a tenth year in Hellos building chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was disappeared from the spirit of the 1980s.
Heads with gloves, who were middle of the city, appeared as the 19th century-based focuss that operate as the Bremscreens of modern railway, since it was a lot of time needed to resolve positions from downwards.
Income, hold short, go - so you should go.
And therefore, the head trips should escape: in Frankfurt and München.
And in Stuttgart: a railway course, which is about half streets of the trans-European Sea sector between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava, is the Slogan of the "Herz Europe".
The S21 is now aware, although the visions in the 80s are not more compatible with the reality.
Even very ambitious plans have recognized that it is nearly unemployable in the Hesian and the Bayern city to overcome the saddle.
Nevertheless, the headboards also have no problem of income and exit, since there are modern wheels with train vehicles and tax cars at two ends.
However: Stuttgart 21 is now attracted by the ICE new construction streets to Ulm.
It has been implemented by country and communical policies.
The train is also due to the risks of the largest infrastructure project of the Republic of tax payers and not to the State Contracts.
The project can be justified by towns.
It happens a new city area, which - believes the computer-generated graphics of planners - is equipped with a lot of green.
Shiene for the transport system is damaged S21.
The transitional railway and the streets construction are thought for people to be spelled by the typically 80-year-old growth.
At that time, there was not yet the competitiveness of the pill leather.
Nevertheless, modern transport policy must first be able to strengthen the good transport, since the transport on the ship is significantly more ambitious than by Lkw on the road.
However, the new building street is not for goods of strong growth.
It is even more serious that S21 is also indirectly affecting many other train projects.
All six milliards of euros in Sweden must be deployed in the Sweden.
This is the official number.
Experts keep 10 to 15 billion for realistic.
It is a festival that in the next decade the money will be missing on other notes and installations in the network.
In total, sixty larger projects are on the list of the ministry of transport.
One of the most important is the construction of the good 180 kilometres long streets through the Rheintal.
Since 1987, the traces are built in timely light.
Dringend would need to press right here on the tube.
However, S21 will be operated as a bremsletter.
The Rheintal Street will be on the flying hall for international goods movement: average in the heart of Europe.
Government verifies the sentence of the airport
The country Government has opened a countryday in Kuwasbaden, whether it is governed against the sentence of the Hessian Administrative Court (VGH) to the night flight prohibition.
The CDU/FDP coalition has made experts to allow more than 400 pages to verify the legally relevant VGH items, said the Economic Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The VGH in Cassel had written in this day that the country in the case of the construction of the planned North West Lande Street in Frankfurter Airport had to resolve the disaster of the night flight.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23 and 5 hours, as the country government is forget, is not agreed with the legal protection of the population before the nervous aircraft.
The coalition must be decided until 4 January whether it is contrary to the sentence.
The opposition criticised this deployment and urged the representatives of the Government to revise a review of the Federal Administration Governance in Leipzig.
SPD Group Chief Torsten Chefs of Chef requested CDU and FDP to return to its promises made before the choice to a disobedience of night flight. In other cases, it is a "pool" to take.
It is hard when you can keep his word, said Green-Chef Tarek Al-Wazir in playing on the FDP Wohlslogan "We keep the word."
Minister Posch wants to return the prejudice of shopper gumuls, which seeks the country government to come with "right-to-sheries and Trick series" but still to their night flights.
A exact legal test requires its time.
The coalition does not want to cover on the basis of a "like first impression".
We need a more legal disappearance, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
Thus, as they showed the opposition, the exits of his group to the disobedience of the night flight.
US banks pay helps back

Quick Selection
And then it was more fast than thought.
For two weeks after the ZDF Board of Administration, the official Chief of Nikolaus Brender out of the office, the sender can present a follower.
Yesterday, the Gremium wanted to vote on personality.
As Favorite, Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Haupt City in Berlin.
However, the sender had not been officially confirmed in order to not impose the procedure.
However, it should also have played a role to not continue to threat Markus Schschachtter, and this proposal should not be taken to the Administrative Council.
Frey, Schuerter Candidat, needs nine of the 14 members of the Gremium.
The result of the vote was not yet fixed in the editing conclusion of this expenditure.
Two weeks ago, the Council of Administration had failed to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for further five years.
Only seven members were speaking for breeders, seven voted against him. Brender's selection was a lower ground for shoes, but a expected.
Since the Union's majority in the Administrative Council had been signed for weeks before the election to not wish to confirm the shipments in the office.
Organised had the contradiction against the Hess President Roland Koch.
The argument, among the Brenders, had lost the reporting of the CDF at the rates, decreased a further official time of the high-speaking chief factor.
It was soon before the election to protect the political impact on the DDF.
Lastly, 35 State rights had been initiated in the debate, which were estimated the intervention of coch as a constitutional jurisdiction.
Nothing's protected.
To person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogics and Romanists.
Then he worked at the southwestflock and the Frankfurter Rundview.
1983, Frey changed to ZDF, first to the "Hoday-journal".
Following Stations: 1988 to 1990 personal replies of the Chief Representative; 1991/92 Corresponsant in Washington; until 1998 Leader and Modern of the "Morgenmagazins"; until 2001 Head of the Foreign Policy; since the Head of the CDF Statute Studium.
The Greens have announced, after selecting Brenders, which was elected on middle and on Wednesday by the Branchen Letter Medium Magazin to the journalists of the year, a constitutional cluster.
Cochs Representative in the Governing Council, President of Rheinland-Président Kurt Beck, explained in the past week that the countries should change the CDF State Treaty so that personal proposals of the dumping could not be blocked by politically motivated majority.
However, a exhibition of parties politicians out of the supervisions of the ZDF has also concluded to be covered.
Peter Frey had recommended the Board of Administration with a collapsed shot - he was directly criticing the Gremium after the Brender election.
Thanks to this complaint of journalist independence, it could be shocked without loss of face for the posts of the Chief Advocate and the Administrative Council, without defending to grant a party to the office.
In the partial metic, Frey will be added to the left library.
Study is depressed
Particular success for students: After a year of education, the university ministers of the countries have finally led on Thursday: at a meeting of university ministers and High Schools Conference, both sides are connected to enhance the conditions of study at Bachelor and Master.
Students should be in the future way to be able to encourage their students also.
In individuals, they agreed to reduce test loads: mainly, each study module should only be concluded with a single test.
In addition, the employment of students will be checked and ensured "realistic and defensible" measure.
The policy and high schools also want to simplify the recognition of test services between high schools within and outside Germany.
The countries have expected to establish more flexiblely joint structural requirements for Bachelor and Master studies.
It should not be given to this deprived country regulations.
Reason tests
Since the beginning of the student protest in June, the Minister of Kultus and Uni Rektors hold the pleasant word of the better studyability in the mouth.
Now it was filled with a concrete content first.
The Board of accreditation decided to reduce the number of tests partly drastic: "Each module is finally closed to only a test" means in a 30-page patter that should be partly regulating the authorisation of studies.
With the "depreciated reduction of the test load", the Board of accreditation, Vice-President Grimm, should be ordered to be "developed development containing the ability of study."
Furthermore, the "studibility" should be the future "the decision-making criteria".
Modules such as contents are "equipped to verify it," whether "unnecessed emphasis of students in the selection of the students
Any events would be prevented.
Students would have "request to receive play spaces to enable and promote their own initiative".
The rules for authorisation should be applied, but also for the review of existing studies.
They must be "reackredited" all five years – but it means that it is long until 2015 until all studies have been checked.
In fact, there are ten credit agents who are undertaken by the Board of Créditation established by the countries.
The Ministers of Kaltus had requested the countries in October to affect the agencies that the substance was not too large and that the test regime was not too striving.
In individual federal countries universities and schools have already agreed with the Government Ministers.
As the only country has said that Rheinland's capacity for further development of the Bologna Process to be further developed.
The money will be to establish high-level schools, mainly tutoral programs, and to strengthen studies and foreign offices.
Countries and high schools want to increase 10 million euros.
At the beginning of 2010, the Government wants to introduce a news of the High School Act to Parliament.
After this, only one test should be needed for the end of a study model.
Studentation should be more flexible, also ensure the recognition of performance tests at other high schools and facilitate access to masters.
To the end of the coming years, all studies of the country should be examined on their ability.
Government and opposition were re-elected on Thursday on the conditions of study in the country.
Besides Lob, there were also criticisms in the decisions.
The Federal Statute of the Juo School groups requested that the creation of education policy should not be held any more by the Ministers and High School Representatives.
In addition to education, the students now should also take place as concerned "one words".
Support received the future academics from the President of the High School Recent Conference (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students," she said on Thursday, with a meeting with the university ministers with which HRK served a common reform paper.
The company education and science (GEW) did not have far enough decisions: you are requesting a legal complaint that allows any resolution with a Bachelor conclusion to access to a further master study.
Otherwise, the countries must ensure that for the present generation of Bachelor students available sufficient masters tomorrow with the best possible exchange conditions of studies, the EWP member Andreas Keller.
The countries have to make clear more decades.
However, the minister of the Kultus was not expressed to a fresh access to the master.
More than one footnote to Herta Müller
Income in Germany and from a nice is almost no control..." The start line of a memory of the Lyriker's Werner Söllner, in which this in disgusting scenes the arrival of a disident is the thetematicity wind, but also lost his speech space.
In 1951 in the Roman banat, Werner Söllner had been working first as German and English teachers in Bukarest and later as Lector in a child book detention before he overlooked 1982 to Frankfurt on Main.
Söllner was designed with various literature prices, 1993 he took the legendary Frankfurter Poetic presentations at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he was leader of the Hessic Literature Forum in Mousturm in Frankfurt.
For considerable extraliterary survey, he attended on the past Sunday during a meeting in München, where it was about "Deutsche literature in Romania in the speed and cereal of their secure acts".
Seeingly, Söllner has made a declaration, which he has made before a renewable writer, as well as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Womendorfer, his work as IM for the Roman secret Security.
Along with some of the presents, Söllner 1989 had received the German language price.
The investigations would have started damage, first in 1971.
I am, concluded Söllners, "or someone who has not been able to learn about the survey of the Security."
Lyriker Werner Söllner is IM Walter.
Along with the Nobel Price of Herta Muller and its literaric combination with the dictatoral government, the literature centres and, in particular, the Community of the German authors originated from Romania by a case which makes aware of the basis and the lack of a political system based on monitoring and recruitment.
Whoever is soilers, as far as you can tell awareness, not only thirsts, but also sacrifices.
In his security act, IM Walter played a role, said after the sense of Süllners of the literature scientist Michael Markel, and turned on the positive influence for him of the IM Walter.
He's got him in all of him different points for him at the time, "to shot out" as Markel.
It is a moral need to take this note.
However, the Söllner Declaration was unexpected in the form and before this public, not fully surprised the knowledge of a former disident and its cooperation with the Roman secret service.
Germany was a comprehensive reservation for Security-Spitzel, Herta Müller had already written in July after she had read their own act, 914 pages.
The concerned, therefore, can be suspicious, speculated and in some cases, probably have been aware of what the clear name is in the middle of the Sorin, Vicu, and also Walter.
Otherwise than the very proceedings of stasi acts in this country, the transition with the delays of the Security Survey is still very different.
A systematic declaration is delayed and dismissed in the past years.
One of the Birthler Authority of the National Council on the Security Acts (CNSAS) was founded only in 1999, but the producement of the cases was more difficult.
Since 2005, there is a law regulating the acts management.
The impact of the former Security Members in Romania is still very large, after the notice of the Nobel Price for Herta Müller, an interview in which a former Security Chaef of Temesvar was expressed by the price ownership.
You've got a psychose, finally, you've just seen it once.
The infamy of the power meaned that it was very unforgettable here in the course of the liberty of views.
Of course, the case of Söllners are combined, as often in relation to different, inconsistent issues.
Why just now? Who has been caused? The absolute reaction of the authors on Süllners will hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined rather than by the instruction and shape of this chapter.
To the Genesis of the work of Herta Muller, who at last took the Nobel Price, is more than a footnote.
Separators Champions League
It was actually, as a special clothed outdoor service minister of a completely clean Weather feast, on which a sports producer had divided Goodies, when the new VfB Trainer Christian Gross in the guide of a orange colorable plastics of the exhibition had increased a fourth of hours after northern in a original class C. ■
The man with the marking glass was caffed because of him still a strange city.
Otherwise he could also go - alcohol was finally not in the game, and it was the 55-year-old exactly little.
It was an acquiring evening, but early the work goes further.
Or just go right.
In the words of the first three days, Swiss bonded before: "We have reached the actelfinal," in Champions League, by success against Unirea Urziceni from Romania, "although we do not allow us to hide from the success, it will be a brutal hard fight against the residues."
The "more important task" stands on Sunday before.
Then it is applicable to recover the king class management in Mainz in Liga-Onday.
And the weaknesses revealed after the fast three gates by Marica (5.), Trish (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.).
Exclusion
The actelfinal of the Champions League (Hin games 16./17. + 23./24 February/Return plays 9./10. + 16./17. March) is released on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of the lightminutes of the baby Follower was thus retained.
Not only to the negative healingist who reported the unseened Stuttgarter Profis in the short time of self - confidence, use - and game-friendly.
I went to the players and told them that they should be in their strength, and I stopped to be more motive, explained the sound successful result that had not been attempted under therapeutic baby, but no more effect.
He has simplified a certain magie, gave the Babble responsors Jens Lehmann, "when a new impulse comes in football, sometimes happens things that couldn't be kept."
And Sami Khedira, who, after the time of an abuse, described the best players on the place, tried to describe the word "friendly wind" and the working way of the new representative: "He is a man who requires a ridiculous and discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation."
It was obvious that under the baby.
The VfB Stuttgart is not still over the mountain, warned sports condition Horst Heldt
The VfB Stuttgart but mostly needs the concentration.
Like Gross, the players and managers were also protected to overcome the victory against a rhetoric and completely requested disappearance of the Roman guests.
They were also winned in Glasgow, four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 the bad watch, Khedira had to think.
And sports situation Horst Heldt argued that a saison target was reached, but the other still remains further.
We're not on the mountain.
This Herdt at his 40th birthday itself after the first home since three months after feast, was in the events of the weekend who lived in a form of directly outlined televisions from Torhüter Jens Lehmann.
There are decisions to take the other and not the Jens, the harmful criteria of Lehmanns.
It had shown the manager-guids rate and has decided to move to pressure of public factors.
Although his free day was thrown after games, the gentleman is a sign of lack of sovereignty and miserableness.
Lehmann's explanation are "protected from pure egoism," the Heldt turned back and announced consequences for the lockman.
You're probably not gonna be friends for life more than two fourty years.
However, they agreed with all the others that without the work of the resolved driver team, it would not be possible to player and warmerly strong ideas.
Babble and his assistants “a great part of the success,” said Heldt and Lehmann unisono - and also the man justified with the plastics.
WM weight in weight
Hitzige Duell in Bern: Herbs again caused Kevin Johnson World Master Vitali Kllitschko with words and mess.
However, after 12 hard rounds, Ukrainian defended its weight rate after the WBC version.
The sentence of the pointing directives was unlikely issued.
Hamburg - Vitali Clitschko remains Box worldmaster in weight.
The 38-year-old Champion on the version of the WBC was visited in the night on Saturday in Bern, the US American Kevin Johnson, onely according to points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Kllitschko, it was the third successful title defence after his comeback in October 2008.
The Ukrainian has already been two-fold Masters of World WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, it did not have been met with the K.o. who were all expected.
Klitschko built his balance on 39 victories in 41 Profi wars, two times he had to be killed on the basis of violations.
The challenger Johnson had to take the first time in 24.
Before 17,000 viewers in the Berner Arena, the 2.02 meters great clipsko wanted to draw the fight especially with his left leading hand.
The eleven centimeters of smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Clitschko-Era, always disappeared again the facts of the world's master, so that Clashko could not attain its dangerous rights in the goal.
In total, the passive Johnson was too little for a challenge and tried only to come on the roads.
He caused clothesko with words and messes, and his slaughter was only rarely at the world.
In 2000 he was just the second boxer to Timo Hoffmann, who went with Clitschko over the full distance of 12 rounds.
The challenger had been made before the fight in the Swiss capital for some active.
He planned clipshot as "water zombie", which "not can't correct."
The Champion then triggered on Friday to shoot Johnson the sun brown from the nest, "for to see his eyes."
Four Go to Klatschkos Comeback
Klitschko also remained in his fourth fight after his return on 11 October 2008.
After almost four years old, he had killed the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and returned the "one" WBC guests which he had to be released before a campsite.
In this year, he took the title of John Carlos Gomez from Kuba and in September Chris Arreola from the United States.
In this fight, I only had a slaughter and I was very good in the body, Clitschko had founded the rapid return to the Ring.
But his dream remains the association of all the four important titles in the family.
Bro Wladimir is the World Master of WBO and IBF.
But the WBA's good takes the Britt David Haye after that was able to discover 2.13 meters of the great Nikolai Walujew in November.
Haye had rejected a fight planned for September against Vitali Clitschko in the summer.
At the same time, its promotion society is already planned against Clitschko in London.
Canduz Error
Frontalangriff from the opposition: Green-Green Group Chief Jürgen Trittin has defended Minister Goodtenberg for false information to the customer's workshop as a lie.
SPD and links require a declaration from the cancers.
Hamburg/Berlin - After the latest knowledge to the aircraft of Kunduz, the Opposition Minister of Defence of Karl-Theodor to Goodtenberg (CSU) has undertaken awareness.
The Minister said to the murder bombard on two tanks of September "sencelessly the uncertain," said Green-France Chef Jürgen Trittin on Saturday, in the ARD's message presentation "Tagesview".
It is called the landlord: He has lied.
The command for the murder shall be granted in respect of the rules of international protection campaign for Afganistan (ISAF).
This is the substance of the report which the NATO had read Mr Goodtenberg said Trittin.
On Friday, it was known that it was not only a destruction of the dismissed laster but also to kill two Taliban leaders.
At the German customer Commander Oberst Small US player attack, 142 people were killed or dismissed by Nato.
Green, SPD and Links requested the Saturday of Federal Kanzles Angela Merkel (CDU) to exhibit himself directly before the Federal Day and to clarify what goodsberg really knew about the case.
Mrs. Merkel needs to clarify whether a strategy of the targeted death part of the Federal Government of Afghan is a political part of the Federal Government - and whether candidates, federal weapon and news service have made this new strategy, the requested Jürgen Tritin and Green colleague Renate Art.
Government speaker Ulrich Wilhelm decided the criteria.
He said that the candidate has not taken on concrete taxes of federal weapon in Afganistan's influence.
On Saturday, there were also doubts of the presentation of the Ministry on the basis of the release of General Inspector Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the Secretary of State Peter Wchert.
According to the SPIEGEL information, the two goodsbergs corrected and completely informed the basis of the Tanclaster attack.
Officially, they would have found the existence of the Nato orders and have provided the Minister sensitive details.
However, from the environment of the two stakeholders, they had even indicated the Ministry of Defence, including a two-side document of the commanding chief and a field report.
In addition, a letter should be requested for clarification of the content, the "Frankfurter General Sunday" reports.
He has not received a response until, it means.
The Minister has not expressed himself on Saturday and said that this will be declared in the Federal Day Committee for Review, which wished to establish himself on the next middle of Wednesday.
Travels
Some see in awake state images and hear voices that do not see or hear.
Not only in psychic sickness and in drug race, the borders between imagination and reality disappear.
When it happens to sleep, it's okay.
If we are closed eyes in our dark rooms, we can unfortunately give us the most wild ideas and fantasy images.
However, whoever lives tolerable situations in the washing, sees things and hears that do not see or hear in the modern Western world applies, at least as stuff or drugs, at least as specializing.
However, such images and voices are not only in psychic diseases or in drug race.
The fault has our imagination: the same neutronal processes that allow us to decline homes, to write images or Romans, ensure that the borders between dream, wheat and reality disappear.
Traumatic changed warranty conditions can appear in the most different forms, in the best case we call them Visions, in the worst case of wheat.
Although it is likely to distinguish, the visions of the mystikerin Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age Prophesis Carlos Castaneda, shaman disappearance situations, psychoses and hallusinations will be renewed to similar processes.
Halluzinations or wheat provisions are identified when the balance of the neuronal bottles of the brain - all previously Dopamin, Noradrenalin, Serotonin and Acetylcholin - and the interaction of different cervics is destroyed.
Comprehensive halluzinations and warm thoughts are very often during a spezopophorn psychose.
The weakness has no power more about him
The connection of wrath and dreams has been engaged in Philosophies and Medicine since the antique.
Aristoteles described Halluzinations as a form of dream in the wake state, Wilhelm Greesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatrics, constituted a "great identity of Irishein with dreams," for Sigmund Freud was the dream "one psychics, with all non-interests, wrath education, sensation of such a sensation."
It is Herbst 2001 when Henning T. converted into a comic figure.
His body is two-dimensional and quiet.
The weak force has no power over him, he's moving in the room cover.
He looks like a trick.
Besides him, the demons were disastrosed with blutrotes, hidden pieces, sweet sweet.
They throw him, lead him with severe, flaming grounds, throw him against the walls, he shrinks the pains throughout the body.
Loud, obvious voices drove out of walls and radio.
He can't take them again, the voices that strive and regulate him.
Henning T. rescues two cups from the stereoan station, knocks it to a lock and makes it on a box in the cover.
He roars on a loud speaker and puts the lock around the kitchen.
Springt.
The lock will be solved.
This will be a teacher to you, cry the voices in a thrommel-screen Chor, "Go to the clinic and let you be healed!"
Today Henning T. 40 years old, he has experienced six actors of psychosen, which is last 2 years back, the first 20 years old.
She was solved by LSD.
His diagnosis lays down spizoeffect-paranoid psychosis, also he is manical-depressive, he takes medically against the depression, the mannie, the Schizopenia.
He learned to live with his disease, for three years he was married.
In the psychose, I experienced the worst fear and deepest disappearance, he says.
The truggles are truly reality
Any percentage of the population is sick at least once in life in Schizopenia, in psychiatric clinches it is treated as a second-in-term disease after depression.
In an acute psychosis, at least those concerned can not differ any more between internal and external world, they are encountered in a overwhelmed condition that can lead to hallucinations, sizes, relationships or persecution.
In particular, the votes are extended - voices, commands, comments or dialogue.
Of course, optical hallusitions are not rare.
The concerned may not be important to divide more of unrealised, the brain can no longer filtrate the conscious signs, which is overwhelmed by end presss.
As the dream also opens the psychose's locks for a flow of ideas and Phantasis, deep conscious stories.
The reality of the psychose is subjected, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, the Clinic of General Psychiatries in the University of Heidelberg.
The skipper is located in the center of the gift, everything has an importance to him.
At the same time, he has a passive role, it is, like in the dream, overwhelming from the events and cannot be active.
Thus, skips often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
A reality comparison is most unable to them, the tragic images are grassive reality, survey exclusive.
One time in life has experienced a halluzination
Otherwise than the dream, he says Fochs, "but remains the sensitive and local structure of the reality that is recognized in the psychose, fundamentally receives."
In reality, the disappearance of life is placed in the real framework.
Why exactly kills our brain capriolene, researchers are still present before relaxation.
Except situations can lead to every person to lose the reality at a short time, says Fochs.
But not everyone will develop a psychose.
It seems to be a genetic complaint on the skippery, but it showed that the Genes are not the only defined factors.
Researchers provide minimum damages concerned.
We believe that the neuronal rehabilitation of the brain is disappeared in a early stage of development by a virus disease of the mother during the weakness, for example, explains the fashion.
But it remains a race, as it comes to the disappearance of the neutral system, which would not be demonstrated first over many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - Stress or traumatic experiences can be exclusors for a psychose when the disposition is available.
Oluzinogene drugs can also solve psychosis, since they take into the transmitter system.
When our brain is hot
The depth is that psychotiker leads into their helicopons and driving hardly medicines to resolve them, others give money for drugs to get, the levecker Psychology professor Erich Kastee says.
Whether to be found as accepted or unrecognised, it is often only a question of the position.
Castle gathered reports about hallucinations and tragic events for ten years, in the past year he evaluated his results in the book "The irregular world in our head".
Halluzinations include the typical events of psychosen but also of predominantly many other diseases.
This includes other psychic stars such as border line or depression often diseases such as Migrania, Epilepsie, Multiple Sklerose or Alzheimer and Heating Space.
Overwhelmingly healed in certain conditions the brain of healthy people itself.
Halluzinations, such as boxes, are commonly retained from memory containing that are usually stopped.
They understand when hyrnareal, in which the senses are processed, overactive or too little; if our brain is cold, or even if the stimulation is missing.
Drugs can solve this state as well as hidden wounds or a psychose.
But also reception, stress, love room or other mental exceptions.
In recent studies, one third of the requesters had experienced at least once in life a halluzination.
In the summer 2005, Sarah K. 16 years old, she lives in a small city in Mecklenburgprematures and visits the Gymnasium there.
A very normal girl, actually.
If there were not the images and voices.
In the suspension, it may happen that a dreaming boy says it with a long, dark hair.
If it answers, the students look over it surprised - no one else looks or listens to these boys.
They keep the sweet girl for a bunching dayroom, but Sarah K. doesn't dream, that she knows.
She's wake up, she hears and sees these guys, just as she hears the girl in the bank.
It can even spend his presence, at least for moments.
It's a great feeling that she likes the boy.
I'm crazy, sometimes she asks her.
But she knows that this boy and the other triggers aren't real and disagree again.
Notwithstanding, the appearances are most urgent
Often, the truggles are also a charge.
When she sits in the classroom, it can not sometimes follow the teaching material, because the teacher has just presented a new student, while it explains for all other hearing and visibility in the table mathematical equalitys.
Notwithstanding, the appearances are most urgent.
When she is waiting for her dark room to sleep, which comes too rare and is too late, she can not often distinguish whether she is wake or sleeping, whether the images she sees, franks or girls with the blue sniffs of poor and feet, open or closed eyes.
Let me be quiet, cry to the creatures.
Her parents and friends are not telling them of what they would keep.
Herbst 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She's the ATA file last year and lives together with her friend.
A year ago, the Halluzinations stopped.
Since she took contact with the psychologic box in the Internet, she exactly knows that she is not crazy.
Wahn is also an artwork from disappearance
If someone is socially isolated or lifted by travel, he has greatly likely to be seen after a few Halluzinations, he says Kastee.
I believe that the brain is then under-employed and self-defended for his conversation.
Sarah K., a single child, had fear of other children, often played her alone.
Their cells began when she learned with 13 that the man who calls the Pope since she can think it is not her living father.
Since visual and acoustic halluzinations are the same heat areas which are also operating real pressure and smoke, it may be concerned as Sarah K. difficult to distinguish trug pictures and reality. "Each heritage," says Kastee, "besides in the brain, the reality is formed there.
Halluzinations are also images that allow the brain to disappear, therefore they operate so real."
The modern dream images also appreciates the casts as a form of the Halluzination.
The Halluzinations of members do not differ in the basis of those of an actor psychose.
In contrast to skips, psychic fellowships are able to recognize their trog pictures as irregular.
Therefore, the career calls for his patients to appreciate the Halluzinations as a special ability.
Limitation between dream and halluzination
In our too very well-bearned world will be impressively the most pathologised, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, Professor in Heidelberg and Chefarzt of the clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapiece of Florence-Nightingal diseases in Düsseldorf.
A psychose is a severe, harmful disease, but it also collapses positive, creatives - wheat is also an artwork from disappearance.
Schmidt-Degenhard has studied the so-called unionid experience form, a special form of the traumarly changed knowledge of wheat.
Oneiroide are high composed, detailed Quasi terms that keep the survivor for real and that he can't differ from the washing situation in the afternoon.
The uniroid conscious condition is used in extreme situations of trauma or disease, for example in polyradiculitis patients that live in full consciousness.
If a man is threatened by loss of self- and world-wide, such as a constant, complete movement inability, he replaces the vital reality through a own, imaginative world that is associated by reality, Schmidt-Degenhard.
A kind of border situation between dream and halluzination.
Since the removal of a situation in reality is unable, there is a world change in which the reality is forgotten but in the imagination.
A intensive form of sensation and sense in an indirect situation that allows us to make people own ability to do not undertaken in nothing of the perish of conscience.
Everything is real, even later in memory
Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his unioid experiences in his book "Corz change" as a rescue of the soul.
He is 49 years old when his conscience after a heart clothing operation has been conducted on the journeys of the heart transplantation, while his body is condemned on the intensity of the movement of unfairness.
Claussen visits for strange times and places in a world: he lives as a slaughter, old man, at the border of a dogsantorum, a robot waits for his health.
He lives in the early age of the Mediterranean under Adligen to produce raw products from blood.
If a greeting on the motor road is disappeared in his homeland, it is surrounded in the Firenz of the Alpes and is a corean mafiose.
He goes fully on the event imagined, everything is real, even later in remembrance.
These internal travels are different for closings based on each dream.
A dream is another state, he describes his heritage.
In contrast, the memories from mental trips are overtime for years and in close details.
Increased and more intense than really survivors.
The intensity of this survivor covers the horizon of our other world experiences, says the psychiater Schmidt-Degenhard.
Last ends show Oneiroide, psychosen, halluzination and drug raw, as we are on our internal images of the external reality also are in the washing.
Every change of the knowledge state, resolved the psychologic box, "will lead to a transformation of what we call reality."
A experience that can also be slowly.
The snow push can come

We are carefully regulated for the details.
The question whether they are also active in the company is only in the first time.
The question is also whether they are in the situation.

At first he was responsible for technology.

Burda children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix who would have been 42 years ago.
The appointment of Kallen also is to overcome "10, 15 years," as Burda.
The Holding should also be the future to 100 percent of the family," said Burda.
With regard to the cases of Schickedanz and Schjaffler, Burda said that the family companies were not secure before the exit: "There is always affected families who have left a capital investigation that had been completely speculated and thought they could grow up so much to the big player.
My strategy was never.
He lived "neither worldwide" here, Burda.
I don't see me as the political preceptor of this country, as it was Springer, and I don't want to play in the worldligate with 'Time', these burdens have become too large.

Zapatter sees "a horizontal of the rest" for the vehicle sector
The Government President, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatter, prophecy of the Spanish car industry, which is the great exporter of the country, "a horizontal of the rest".

Mazda3 i-top: Environmental Sports
Mazda wants to demonstrate that sports are compatible with environmental protection.
For this reason, Mazda has introduced the automatic stopp and drive system of the motor, baptized on the name i-top, a preparation which is currently available only for the 2.0 Benzin motor with 150 PSs.
This second generation of the Mazdas 3 produces its good notes to the whole species.
The final processing, the execution of the vehicle, the comfort, its strategic maintenance, the mechanical, the i-top system ...
All of these aspects are at the new Mazda3 "fairly good."
At the presidency, you can find that the previous site offers an excellent ergonomy and a good stop.
Furthermore, the game of the Lenkrad is excellent.
For further consideration of the unit that consists of the tool table and the armor breeding, you can find that Mazda is located with a number of knights and sharps in the blue colors that appear on the same lines as the Japanese trend to a futuristic innend mark.
This style reminds us partly of the Honda Civics style.
This is why without further, that both the Mazda 3, as well as the Civic, both Japanese models, from the nervousness of the German cars, especially from the people's car Golf, who all want to overcome.
The tray of these two Japanese compact cars offers more than each appropriate comfort, so that four adults may first be able to go with the car.
To all this, a green swimming room comes and clearly formed shopping room.
The stopp and drive system is only available for the 2-Line Benzin motor with 150 PS and a 6-style maintenance.
This motor is however a genius. He's focused on his fiancéance, through his lie garden, his performances and its low use.
And all those who are not a lot of kilometres in the year should take into account this i-top with Benzin motorer because of his green comfort at the garment and its small uses, even though, in Mazda, this models are the most saled.
With regard to the exhibition, this is the so-called sport model, as it has a significantly larger number of elements from the Serbian disposal.
The Serbian refund is mainly the Assistant for Peace Purple Change (RVM), which decides the dead winkel, but also the instruments for traction and stability, the speeding, the light-finding internal levels, the border computers with a green screen, the sensors for the park, an independent climate plant, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and audio-luetooth, and the 17-Zoll-Felgen.
In addition, this version also includes, as if it was not enough for exhibition, the package Premium contained for additional 1.500 euros: above other elements, especially the learnable bioxenon drivers and the sound BOSE system with CD drivers.
Facit
The Mazda3 2.0 i-top is one of the best compact cars of his class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, of its maintenance and of the variety of equipment.
Furthermore, those who don't get a lot of kilometres in the year can also buy the i-top version that is only available with a 2.0 Benzin motor with 150 PS.
The only negative of this model is a little high price between 21.770 euros for the Luxury model and 23.270 euros for the proven model sportive.
However, the Mazda3 Mazda3 offers us every day at New High Travel Pass.
A pressure with a lot of glamour
L. A. the red teppich of Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars, clothed in models that look exactly elegant as sexy, more than ever. (Fotos: Gtresonline).
Our "Pe", as elegant as always, decided for a dark "Lady" clothes.
Promises of FonPeek
Peek is limited first to a device with which you can only read your emails without a possibility to see some attachments or to spend through the Internet.
It has seen its five minutes of calm when it had chosen the Zeitschrift Time to one of the products of the year.
To see on the Strategy, it's more incredible, but the idea of herself is, in particular, for young people's interest.
In contrast to the Smartphones, Peek only costs very little and has a very nice flat, for example only half of the iPhone Flatrate.
After the success of the company, it brought two new devices on the market: one that is only thought for Twitter, the other with a long-term gratis service for data, in contrast to the peek, where you have to pay a six-time higher price.
Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the event Le Web, is the European version of this event and therefore its third version.
It has the same borders like his American property, however, has been surprised.
The month undertaking price for the phone, approximately 12 euros in the month, includes Roaming for Europe.
Those who travel with a smartphone for the world already know what it means to check all the data to read his emails when you have overcome the country limit or if you are searching for a coffee with WIFI (or a possibility of connection with a base).
The idea of the Roaming with flatter is incredible and it should have been a long time possible.
It is true that some telephone providers are already offering specific contracts and prices for foreign stays, but my experience has already needed a doctor title in Physik and a good brief to read all the little printed ones.
The recurrent criticisms of the European Commission in relation to achieving roaming rates for Europe are almost always not observed.
On the basis of the own country, it is always afraid to read his emails and that is right.
This is a small device such as FonPeek (in which it is always wonderful that it has the name Fon, although it is not available to Wifi/WLAN) this kind of tariffs, means that the phone providers are slowly, but safely need to overwhelm and start in view of various options as they can use their data network.
Children is another good example, in his prices, the download of books and further questions on the Internet is contained.
Without Vetra and without hooks.
This is a internetable device and it is paid only one time when buying, not a month.
And that's exactly what I also expect a day of FonPeek to buy with a long-term Internet access as the Peek has already offered in the United States.
And it's not because I want to buy it.
I'll read my emails with the phone, thank you.
In particular, I expect this because I think it would be an appropriate model for consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The Feature Colour of Michelle
Gelb is uncertainly the favorite color of the American First Lady.
At the office of Barack Obama, President of the United States, she appeared in a clothing and a manner of this color and has chosen the same color to join him in his, without doubt, two-time moments in his life: the reduction of the peacenobel price in Oslo.
Michelle Obama has handed very similar models: to the one that it was almost the same colour - a bright green yellow - which was the clothes of three parts - clothes, Jackes and mantels from the same substance, and so they took something green grass or a half-three.
It is even so far that it was in the first view that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the form of the Princess of Astury and decided to take the same clothes with more than only one occasion.
However, the two clothes are very different in the substance of which they are created.
When the office was introduced, she took a clothing out of skin and in Oslo of a mixed seed.
The accessories were also different: in the first time green shoes with half-to-rangs and in the second time, a real model but gold colors.
The friar was every time different: the hairs were mounted at this point as a haircranz, when previously they had the hair opened.
75% of vocational mothers have obtained problems in work
Discrimination in work has been adopted in the past years, especially in the recent women who want children.
The CSIC, in cooperation with the Institute for Women, has been studied "Fevibility and Carrier of Women in Spain".
In case of 9,737 women between 15 and 75 years, there is no doubt: 75% of the professional women have been limited their carrier changes in the labour market because of their maternity.
The study opens that there are large differences in the decision to establish a family and the number of children, anytimes whether women work or not and if so, what kind of profession do they do.
Those of them who do not work other activities within the house only half day or have not a fixed working contract shall be more mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women have a fixed order, especially in the public sector, the creation of a family and maternity and therefore have less children.
"Women in the age group between 35 and 49 years with a fixed design receive their first child in average than 3,7 years after the meeting, an increased number of women in 4,1 years with a fixed order that have been used to reach and reach their together and performed the first child a lot later.
In addition, the type of work also has a huge influence on the mothership, even less than the calendar for the Employment Preparation," said the CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor that needs to be taken into account at the age of women at heritage and the first child.
According to the survey, the age is higher at the Heirat time and the first child, at any time higher the level of education.
This difference could also be identified in women of the same age.
For example, women in the group between 35 and 49 years, each other whether they have only the main school conclusion or a higher education in average of 25,1 or 32,1 mother's first time.
Furthermore, after their education level, there is a different difference between women.
While women have been married before their first festival and get their first child, it makes women with a medium or high school lock exactly different and are looking for a fixation and married then and then get her first child, Delgado is set.
Diane Kruger is also worth
The Oreal Paris has added a new name: Diane Kruger.
Since the next year, the German player will be the image of different products of the brand and also the general recognised publishment "For you are valuable".
The main sites of "Joyeux Noël", one of the most elegant players at international level, will be another famous exhibition, both before its Linda Evangelist, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before you were the last who attended this exclusive climate, the players of Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millonaire").
In men, the cosmetic manager also has only the excepters: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey ́s Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Supling School of Evangeline in "Lost").
Price reduction of the British Modern industry
The brites have an important word in the modern world.
Your highest representatives - modedesigners and models, both yesterday and today, are at the annual price reduction stopped in London in the Royal Court of Justice.
At this point, they all appeared.
The Ex-Modell Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, which was chosen to the best model of this year.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent is presented in "Poker of Asse" (Alfaguara, images of Fernando Vicente) to the three real rare images of writers who have joined him in his literary life (and in some cases, also in real life).
He does not use prejudice and fearful genre (Curzbiography, Life and Work), but seeks a sensitivity to the smoothness of the Creator's heart.
The trip is an emotional and Vicent spart neither to fear nor lighting.
In addition, that this book is a beautiful reader, it is also a moved request to read and read again.
Here's some exhibitions from the book.
About Albert Camus: "I found that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but mostly a spiritual, almost reasonable tribes, just as I always found it, without words: the joy in contrast to the unfaithful shape, the moral without fault and the innocent without any God."
About Samuel Beckett: "Nhilist, the Algorian Christ, wrote about what he had not in his mind, between an understanding and uncertainty, with a shopping poetic humor, without any sense, like the messengers that had almost killed him."
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was led by this woman with a suffering life for three ten years, whose flesh is the emotions because of the adultery, a spiritual privilege that is in the sky to come in the way of the destruction."
About James Joyce: "The Odysseus" was issued in Paris by Sylvia Beach in 1922. This is one of the 8000 gulls in the world literature, the northern sleeves on the wall, which is always trying to renew the best mountains."
About William Faulkners: "There was a common box.
He sometimes said about himself that he would be the inheritance of a good owner of the Graphic, and again he said that he would be the son of a black and crocodle.
Both dreams were born from a certain green Greene."
About Louis-Ferdinand Celine: This writer took the swimming clash that was thrown out from a bush from that personality from Munich, so that his Echo was deep to the night of the 20th century on his literarity and way.
About Dorothy Parker: "Your day she kissed and prayed: 'My teacher God, I pray you to do everything in your power, so that I may finally stop as a woman's writing."
About Joseph Conrad: "On his tomb, these verses of Spincer are graved: 'the sleep after the stress,/ after the feast of the harvest,/ the rest after the war,/ after a satiate life, you're like to die."
About Virginia Wolf: "In her bond she also had her depression.
The husband took it with full normality when she said to him that Eduard VII was driving her out between the acelees or the birds on Greece.
There is no other case known where the man was so much suffering and loved in a neurotic, whose literary talent was a lot greater than their disappearance."
About Pío Baroja: "What did Martín-Santos other than try to escape Joyce in Baroja?
So what was Benet if he didn't lead Baroja to the guns of Faulkners?
What then did this to destroy the man except the calamity of that man, so he can make himself on this podest?"
Featured Action
My 70-year-old mother went the last week through our city share in the Fuenlabrada town, as soon as a group of young people from 15 to 18 years next to her and our dog, our dog is a mixture that we took out of the animal home, and the just six kilo was going out of the high heaven, and then they pushed him two feet and laid it hardly.
Our enthusiasm can not be understood in words because it is unwillful to us, since the passport is to be a comprehensive aggression against a small and helpless animal, which is self-detected in the lines.
This is the case of restitution that a woman who had been engaged in the heart, who wanted to justify these persons because of the case, she even feared her own life, because if such a dog attacks a dog, he may also be with a woman, a child, a older master or probably even with anyone who is worse than himself.
The case occurred in a normally quiet city quarter about five hours after midnight at a total Sunday.
The dog took the whole day.
Of course, we have set an indication in a close police office, but we have a great doubt of whether this is going to take something and to predict some prejudices from the beginning, we just want to explain that it was the feather spanish.
Our inflation on the event has allowed us to demonstrate this case.
We can't understand what in the heads of these young people must arise that they find a comprehensive attack on an unencouraging animal, on a animal that gives us love, society and friendship.
We don't know where good education and respect are left against animals and people.
Michelin and fesvial jointly for use of herm
The Michelin producer, in cooperation with the Spanish settlement for Transport Security (Fesvial) has made a campaign to promote the use of the Helm, especially in the recent motor vehicles, as is known today.
This initiative is intended to focus on the importance of the heat use, as it finally is the only element of protection, the head violations or even death in the case of motor radar cases.
Michelin emphasized that this campaign is part of its commitment in relation to the security of the transport, which "a larger includes the removal and manufacturing of products that will be more secure with each day" and confirmed that it also contributes to other pedagogic and informal characteristics to get closer to this goal every day.
This new campaign for the promotion of the heat use on the engine drive which runs under the Slogan 'To be or not to' will be distributed in a first phase on more than 500 motor vehicle devices to achieve the best distribution.
Finally, Michelin noted that the security of the transport is "stainable" of the company, and just because it has been a producer of riffs for two-quarter vehicles, which must be one of their main objectives to be the development of more secure products.
The sale of small load car returns to
After almost two years the car market for small transporters will finally begin to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles authorised in Spain have meaning an increase of 12,6% in relation to 2008, and which is much more important, they are the first upgrade after 22 months in a steadily decline, with the numbers presented by the manufacturer Anfac and the Ganvam bond.
However, these good numbers are only to gear with a large precaution, since the reference data from November 2008, which was particularly bad case year with a decrease of 60% in respect of the previous year.
However, it is necessary to consider that, despite the increase in the last month, the total approvals of these 11 months are still 40 % under the numbers of sales of the previous year.
Since January 95,853 vehicles were sold, but all vehicles consisting of the small market containing: removal of cars, pick-ups, small transporters, small cars and easier small cars and cars.
Furthermore, the same vegetables are still in the sky, which are the most demanded in a partnership, even if some of the cars of private persons are bought, the large part of sales to small and medium-sized enterprises which operate the purchase with a third financing.
Thus, these restrictions, which are the consequence of the allocation of the credit-institutes, other factors with inclusion, such as the increase in the unemployment rate or the duration of the bad economic situation.
In this Panorama and in the difference with the cars, financial supports have been limited to buy a vehicle at the 2000 PlanE.
However, this plan is determined not only for privates, but also for self-employed and small enterprises has a right if they have a small transporter up to 3,5 tonnes with an CO2 exemption expenditure that can not exceed 160 grams per kilometres of dangerous, but the lower sales are speaking for themselves.
Yesterday, Ganvam again recalled that it was necessary, as well as a special attention to this small latter, and of course also to the industrial vehicles (Last vehicles and cars).
The railway processing period for 2010 is a similar year as the past, for which it was recognized with an accident of sales (in personal cars and cars) of 19%.
Support for Bremsmanagers in critical situations is now required
As at the ABS Antiblockerbrems system and as it has occurred now with the ESP Stability Control, the help systems to breach in emergency are to be made in the European cars.
In fact, they are obligation to all new authorized cars and easy small transporters for which the rest of the vehicles have been set to the end of February 2011.
The European Union's decision-making action is aimed at improving the protection of the flowers, but these breast systems can also help to prevent many accidents of danger.
The task of the Notbrem Assistant is to perform more pressure on the breasts in the case of a critical breast manager, which is the system based on the Bremsheet exposed by the driver.
However, this system does not make this pressure up to the end.
In accordance with an investigation provided by the component producer for the wood products, a third of the drivers developed in an accident before the consommate had no longer been extended to the Bremspedal and half of them had not browned fullly.
Up to 1.100 accidents
The Brems help has to be added to the breast system, which reduces the breast time and thus the breast distance that turns back to the breast.
According to a study of the EU, each year to 1,100 death accidents in which the SMEs were injured would be prevented if all cars were equipped with this kind of emergency assistants.
It would even be less accidents - it would be seen that every fourth accidents with persons could be prevented - as soon as the intelligent no-brem systems are popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that recognizes barriers (from Radar or camera) and warns the driver, with a easy pressure on the breasts at the same time.
If the driver responds to this, it helps the system to increase the pressure on the bremspedal if it was necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the coast is already inevitably, the Brems Assistant imposes the maximum pressure on the breasts to keep the wounds as little as possible.
General Motors takes the Opel Plan to January
During the office of Opel Werks in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) already by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, was informed that the production of the new Meriva will be launched at the first April summer, probably on 8, according to Javier Ortega, shows the American vehicle producer that he needs more time to bring the Opel's rescue plan to conclude.
Nick Reilly, the new President of the GM Europe, wants to achieve that the concerned side is already in favour of each individual point of the plan.
And for this reason, the final document, which is first moved to workers and then to the Governments of the countries in which it works will be presented until the beginning of 2010.
The following GM will ensure that it will take a decision on the sale of saab in the next days.
There is no surprise that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American automobiles so that as soon as possible it takes a decision.
The GM also includes contacting some possible new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, who also wants to buy Volvo, however, wins the option of the Dutch producer of the Skyper cars, which has the Russian group of Converg backpack, always increased.
If any of these buyers should come to a agreement, GM might sell some actives to the Chinese BAIC.
The decision that the end of the year should be closed to Saab, if it is not sold until then, will continue to be retained.
At the porsche Boxster Spyder
The engineers used the Boxster S as a basis for the development of their new and very delicate juwels as the Boxster and actually made it easier for 80 kilo, so he now brings only 1,275 kilo on the wage.
In order to create this thing, they looked first to the automatically-played chain, which was replaced by a cell in handling, with a manual appreciation, so it has been seen 21 kilo, thanks to the aluminium carriers used in this model, such as the GT3 "covered" other 15; by the exception of the climate plant yet 13; in addition, it has smoothed the fuel tank of 64 to 54 liters, so that there were also 7 kilo apart; by the construction of sports bacquet seats again 12 and with the 19-Zoll Felgen's 19-Zoll Felgen's.
Then there was also six kilo more and less than 6 kilo through the exchange of the turt touches through griffes from substances the lack of kilo.
Although it is also available with the PDK duplication planet, the trip was carried out with a vehicle with a 6-functioned handkeeping vehicle, mainly on the small countrystraße of California, on mountains that are really very curvig.
It can only give him the notice without disagreement.
However, the reduction of the weight has no case to make it so secure to the Strategy.
It's the contrast of the case: since long, we've already had no longer tried a small and easy model that has a feeling of great security in the curves, even at high speed.
He's a small athlett to make his muscles warm at a low gang in the necessary time until we give him the orders to race, to breathe, to take up and then to take all out of his motor ...
He does everything you're saying to him. The car makes everything we eat with our hands on the Lenkrad, thanks to his lending, which is exactly communical as well as precise.
And he does it with the preciseness of a circle.
A motor sound for all mask devices
The sound of his V6 Boxers with 320 PS (10 more than the Boxster S) is outlined and you can still increase it with the 'sport' option and using a system that can change the motor cell which has already come to the Panamera first to use.
The acceleration rate is unforeseenable brutal, lest whether the steel is out of the steel or the recovery.
The Federations are strong, but not hard or uncertain.
The asphalt on the countrystrae, on which we arrived with the Boxster Spiyder, was quite damaged, but the car showed the balls well.

The manager of Vitoria could replace the significant accidents of Mr.mann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov through a green dose to use and work, even if they were waiting for their victory.
The great range of the perimeter was 16 triples evaluated to their final victory.
The game began with the leading of the blue roads, which were set at the top of the lines on the showboard.
Since the first four corners of the managing out of Vitoria had already come out of the Perimeter, they could already be admitted that they had come to the game field with well-covered hands.
There were English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 end of the first victory.
The second quarter was very different that the manager was decided from Álava for an internal game of Barac and for the game of Eliyahu, who was received at his return to the manager with ovens and applaus, which is his house to build their benefits to stop (34-43).
Teletovic has already started to highlight the best of his mankind with 13 points, even if the "minus six" evaluation of Splitter was already denied that this would not be the best evening of Brazilians.
Nevertheless, the game was, despite the significant benefit in the Pause, was not yet decided long and the Makabaiers wanted to remember the victorians again that they did not win everybody on their game area, and thanks to the continuing "Hand of Elia" they returned to the game.
Eidson and Pnini were decisively involved in the circumstances of the road (50-49).
Further benefits
The team of Ivanovic was dismissed, but all other than the dead, he had to prepare a couple of plays with meeting safety to get the air and immediately came the Pistole of Mirza Teletovic, which with three almost followed triples, and with the support of English and Ribas, was shown on the showboard of a renewable distance (54-67) that the guests were able to disappear (57-67).
The alive were presented in the last quarter of Blue and English and San Emeterio (60-75) announced that no one would allow them to take the victory that they had granted in the first three minutes of honor.
Unfortunately recognized pnini and Eidson, which were not the best of her mankind and tried to give their mankind to the force by three points from the line (70-77).
Nevertheless, and though Splitter was set from the place because of the foul, the team of Ivanovic had not opened, but defended himself well, and although Israelis was still in the last minutes (80-85), the game had already been a victor and Tel Aviv lost the first time in this saison.
Injuries prevented that Unicaya had been commanded the storms
Unicaya lost a loutstark in Greece against Olympiacos and had the leading in the Euroliga group B, and that in a game that was followed by the accidents of the Unicayas, Greece, Lima and Archibald, especially in the internal game, was marked that Greece had facilitated the victory.
Málaga's manager had no fear of the stimming in the hall of peace and friendship nor of the gentlemanship, which might be one of the strongest Europe and has a lot of money.
The Analusier began to dream in the first quarter. A aggressive defence and three on one another, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, hided the guests with 12-18 in 9 minutes.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the One Unicaya, even when the domestic manager with an internal game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis was made that the show table in the 13 min. 22-20 showed its goods, the minutes in which it was almost due to an action to the deterioration between both the two American Beverley and Williams and why both were disqualified.
The Greek team began to finally be warm and his survey on two goats, while the disappearance of the English Joel Freeland, because of an abuse and the three themselves caused errors of Carlos Jiménez, clear springs to the Unicaya.
Their players in the internal area and the Lithuanian player Linas Kleizas, with its triples, increased their advantage in the 19th minute at 44-32.
An uphold was impossible
The third quarter of the game was described by many attacks against the manager of Olympiacos, which despite his 19 losses, and even made it possible to compare the difference of the game issued in Málaga with 66-48 in 27 minutes, which returned the leading in the group.
Unicaya tried to move to the many accidents and the disagreement of the shots that had been shot during the game, Robert Archibald.
Despite the many benefits of the Unicaya came in the 31th minute thanks to the Federation and the Trips of Cook and the use of Lewis again a little hope on 66-57.
Nevertheless, it was impossible because the olympiacos, when he attacked and showed his circumstance with centimeters within the corb area, was not too wide.

Brazil called Zelaya, a date for release
The Brazilian Government has set the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its message in Tegucigalpa.
The Chairman of the Ambassador shall, after 27 January 2010, leave the diplomatic representation, if its manager is officially issued
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian news in the Hungarian capital, confirmed the televisional TV Globo, that "Mel" knows that before this date he had to leave the message he found since September 21, asyl.
"He is sure that he needs to go on 27 January, since his mandate leaves this day and needs to look for a new accommodation."
The sender also settled the former Presidency who confirmed his intention to leave the message before the deadline established: "I'm a position to go as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the Government of Brazil," Zelaya said in the phone.
After the elections on 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo exposed as trigger) Zelaya ensured that he will stay in the Brazilian message until January.
However, he tried to receive refugees in Brazil this week.
However, this was aware of the refusal of Zelayas to recognize the status of a asylum-sector who wanted to resolve his "de facto" government under the presidency of Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you.
After the last days since the spring year in which the inflation of the Acta was the prerequisite screening on the markets, the markets return to the uncertainty, which is no wonderful case because their natural situation is in an area where the mathematic decisions have taken about a nature from an insecurity future.
The market stabilization of the markets was to compare the debts to the direct sale of asset and indirectly allow the liquidity's free hand in the wages that move the nucle to buy the bank's activity in this way.
The Central Banks have already confirmed that the direct purchases of Active are as well as completed and that, without to put their theerodox policy on liquidity, start to strive some sand in the cereal, as the ECB has already been prejudiced with its annual disappearance, the next week.
Therefore, the investors in the ability of the world economy, the economic rise without these erythrodox decisions, and we will just be witnesses of a return to the reduction of risk premises.
The refugees of the buses and the differences in the companyboni are increasing, even if they are far away from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States looked forward to growing private risks and the debts of the State again.
Now, the quality and quality of the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred income of investors, which leads to the increase in the differences of the European Zone in terms of Germany.
Spain was unlikely affected by this episode of stability, but then the standard & Poor's came and drew a new review on the underlying assessment of Spain.
On the other hand, there is no certain uncertainty to bring the defenders of the moral risk that were attempting again to make awareness in the world economic policies to produce what they had caused because they had the damaged effects of the restriction of credits to loss of workers, if they had actually had to say a new day of thanks action.
Instead, what happened in Dubai is going to a tribe war between the emirs to resume the power in the Emirats, and the development in Greece has already been beforeed.
A government, which rejects the State defence, elections and a new government that takes into account the same stress.
Prodi made it in Italy to Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal to Durão Barroso.
There is no sense that Ecofin Hungarn is entitled to the start of the year from the non-emplementation of its foreign payments, and that a European Member State has therefore achieved not to meet its obligations.
However, it is logical that Ecofin has encouraged the Greek government to be transparent and its citizens with the need of the general mask of decisions with the obligation to receiving the stability of the State money.
Yes, we are looking for a episode of normalization of risk premiums, after some exemptions to too high costs, this would now be within the expected.
In the case of Spain, there should be no concern when the differences of the State defence increase with the same speed as the European companies.
However, if the European differences continue to reduce and increase the Spanish, it would be a specific Spanish risk.
The standard & Poor's is a farm. While the indicators presented above are a large part of the market research institutions, their scenarios for the survey and their scenario for 2011, including the OCDE and the European Commission, which returns to a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all despite the warnings are not a long time of life.
Again, it has been a great opportunity to buy Spanish acties, although it is announced at the time of the trip.
Connected pieces
The Chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, held as first before the Parliament's Subcommittee, where, in these days, the strategy on energy supply is discussed in the next two decades.
After his opposition, on which the President of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca followed, Galahan’s pressed some of the points on what he had spread to the Subcommittee behind the closed doors.
According to the President of Iberdrola, Spain has to invest more than 50 billion euros from this date to 2030, under the precondition that the current nuclear powers will continue to operate.
If this is not the case, the necessary investments would be not to 60 billion, but to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola believes that no longer should be invested in increased energy production capacity but in distributed networks and international commitments.
Since 2020, the question will be changed and the performance should be increased.
His proposal focuses both on gas and coal tools with facilities for the starting of the carbon diamond and, of course, on the renewable energy.
In this case, it means that 18,000 MW will be needed more, under the pre-constitution naturally by other "subsidies".
Galán, who is the view that the Slavery for a sustainable economy, which was decided by the Government, was on a line with what he asked by his company, wanted to say something against this law, how to create anhesis for national coal consumption, which would be exactly the contraction of all political policies in the fight against climate change.
His view is "a long-termly placed on this direction, notwithstanding some" contents, as she was described by the President of Iberdrola.
Be as it is, Mr Galán said that now the decisions to the investment, even if they are long-term, should be taken as some time needs and have to be created a stabil massive framework to take it into action.

The construction for it is a tunnel that will cost $1,7 billion (approximately 1,047 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German highest are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane, at the east coast, has become the best opportunity for Acciona to ethicalize in the country as construction companies and car drivers.
The city manager wants to complete the construction end 2014.

The Australian infrastructure market promises strong constructions and privatizations, however, to overcome an access to an internal construction company only.
A strategy followed by the undertakings high-level or balance fingers, added to Asian references, and which must be followed by the Spanish constructioners.
Even ACS has reached the market only by its participation of 30% to high-level owner of the named leighton.
Millions of active
Acciona is higher importance in this geographical area for the industry in which it is already known by its activities as energy providers and in the disappearance industry.
In addition to the activity, it has already been its large wind-freunded wind park (192 MW) in Victoria and leads to the group of companies that were intended to build and manage the disappearance of Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
His intention is now to consolidate himself in these two areas and to use these synergies to obtain access to the building and infrastructure.

This is the view of the great mass to the staird use of the Brisbane Strategy.
The City managing plan issued by the manager sets the report for the summer 2010 and the starting of construction work in December next year.
Even though these master streets should be opened for the transport in the last months of 2014, it is possible that construction work will be stopped up to 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
He has two carriers in each direction, an electronic machine system and a complex solution system.
The Government of Queensland participates with $500 million ($308 million) in the financing.

Crime about 63 million for France Telecom because of the extent of competition.
The Regular Authority for Competition in France has introduced a crime of 63 million euros because of anti-related behaviour in the Caribbean areas involved in the country.
According to the Authority, the provider has limited the competition in fixing network and telephone through the signature of exclusive contracts, prices and reliable programs for consumers on the border of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopolism company has gathered more than 560 million euros in criminals since 1994 because of the disappearance of its competitors.
The alleged crime was even increased, since the Authority waiting for competition is the view that France Télécom has initiated similar droughts in the past and has therefore been reactivated.
Application Trade

The game at the Champions League has introduced Madrid and Barça since the beginning of 476.4 million.
The Champions League has been found in 1992 to a source of adoption for the Fućball club developer.
So much that Real Madrid and Barcelona have taken 476.4 million, which includes the third and fifth place of the Fu月ball clubs that have the most money in the liga.
Leader of this list is Manchester Unitedd.
Leader of this list is Manchester Unitedd.
The Champions League of UEFA will not only be able to win. It is also one of the main sources of the great verse.
The UEFA has divided the 105 million euros (of 12 Spanish), which participated in this event since its creation in the Saison 1992/1993.
Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona have benefited from this distribution.
The chip of the threeth places of Europe, which has the most of the money through its participation, and the one of the AC Mailand who has gained the Trophie three times.
The former Catalynian Master and the last winner of the former Europe Business 1992 is the fifth place.
The list of Manchesters of United States and Bayern München, two managers who also have the most money by participating in the past Champoin League.
And that, though they lost Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only at the third place of the countries that could receive money by the Champions, although it has more titles than all others (except, contrary to four bie Italy, three to England and two in Germany).
Distribution
This clear contradiction is described by the comprehensive monetary distribution procedures that the UEFA applies.
In this year, the organization whose presidency Michel Platini has entered in this year with revenues of 1.090 million by the Champions League.
From this money, UEFA 413.1 million for festival payments have been given: each of the 20 Fu月ball clubs who have participated in the qualification period (including them at the Atletic de Madrid) got 2.1 million.
In addition to the 500,000 euros for each game they were caught.
There is also a good for gains (800,000 euros) and for an union (400,000 per managing). The clubs who have come into the Achtelfinal receive about three million; the four in the four-final, 3,3 million.
The last four will get four million each day.
The winners have 9 million, in contrast to the second, which is 5,2 million.
So a Fu月ball club will receive at least 7,1 million and at least 31.2 million to fixed income.
Barça returned his victory to the European Supercup in August 2,5 million.
However, the variable payments for 337.8 million are still provided.
This money will be granted proportionally to the value of each individual television market.
The Spanish is the first and has 4 places.
The master of the last year requires 40% of the allocation of money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third placed and 10% of the fourth place.
The other part will be distributed according to the number of games they play at the year's expenditure.

Every day, thousands of vehicles that have been developed in an accident, in the workplaces where a Guardian needs to assess the damages that were disappeared and the costs for repair.
No accident is equal and the calculation of the costs for parts and working hours may be a long and complex task.
The calculation of the reparatory costs of between 20,000 and 30,000 euros by hand, including the parts and the working hours, may take up to two or three hours.
However, it is with support of the latest information tools a question of minutes

When a new car comes on the market, the company starts the work.
It is a huge task because each individual of the but a thousand carrier has to be catalogized and put in its price.
Additionally, a "intelligent" graphic image is created by each model on which you can "click" different parts of the vehicle.
If it is a lot of sold model, the work may be completed in a week if the procedure is shortly forward.
If it is a less fresh car, it can take up for a time to three or four months. Currently, it has an Auditx at 99.2% of the cars distributed in Spain about complete information.

Auditx is investing 90 million euros annually in the processing of these databases.
Every month they take 2.5 million data and their customers get the updates every second day.
The development of this huge information flow allows companies to use them in different ways and thus offer different products.
