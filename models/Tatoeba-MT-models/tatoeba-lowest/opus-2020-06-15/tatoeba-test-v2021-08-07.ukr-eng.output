It was not necessary.
The dog was kicked, not the dog of Tom.
It was Saturday evening.
You know, it was Tom's fault.
It was Tom's idea, not mine, not me, I don't have to accuse.
That did Tom.
It was very cold.
She was white.
That's what you suggested to look at this movie.
It's gonna be smooth.
It'll be worse tomorrow.
That's going to cost about fifteen dollars.
It's a long time until he gets it, right?
That will not be so nervous as you think.
It's not gonna cost you anything.
It's working.
You would be the best thing if you did it.
I'm better to tell you the truth.
