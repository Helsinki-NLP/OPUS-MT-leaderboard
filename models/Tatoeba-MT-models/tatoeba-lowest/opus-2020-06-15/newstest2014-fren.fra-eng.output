Spectrum saut in "wingsuit" above Bogota
The Jhonathan Florez sports has Thursday a helicopter above Bogota, the Columbian capital.
Equipped with a wingsuit (equipped combination of oils), it was 160 km/h above the Sanctuary Monserrat, situated at over 3 000 meters of highness, where many bathrooms were gathered to observe the expert.
A black box in your car?
Although the United States's road network planning planners have difficult to find the money necessary to repair the authorised infrastructure in depressive, many are those who submit a solution in the form of a small black box that is set above the side of your car.
The devices, which register all thousands of a motorist and transmit information to the officials, are at the center of a controversial attempt in Washington and in the governmental offices of the planning to restore the absolute financing system of the main American routes.
The sector generally without interest on the planning of the large axes has soon caused a strong animated debate and moved commitments.
Freeers joined ecological groups to make pressure to use the government's small boxes to keep the tray of thousands you move, and probably from the road you move, and then use the information to edit a fiscal law project.
The Tea Party is shot.
The American Civil Liberties of the Union is also very concerned and expressed concerns about the protection of private life.
And while the Congress members have not agreed to know if it is necessary to continue, several States have not waited.
They are looking for how, during the next decade, they can go to a system that allows the leaders to pay in the number of thousands of short-terms.
A thousands of carriers have already embarked these black boxes, sometimes equipped with a GPS monitoring system, for experimental vires.
This is really essential for our nation.
"It's not like we had the choice," said Hasan Ihrata, Director-General of the Southern California Association of Governments, which stipulates that the State begins to record the thousands by each Californian car from 2025.
There will be a change in the way we pay these taxes.
Technology is here to do it.
The pressure comes from the fact that the Highway Trust Fund of the country, financed with the taxes that the Americans are pumped, is financially sec.
The Americans do not buy so much of seed than before.
Cars can move over thousands with a gallon.
The Federal tax itself, which is 18.4 cents by gallon, has not increased for 20 years.
Political men are resticent to increase tax, even 1 percent, while the prices of seizing are high.
"The season tax is not just unrelated," said Lee Munnich, a specialist of the transport policies to the Minnesota University.
His State has recently installed 500 car tractors to test a mile payment system.
"It seems to be the most long term logical alternative," said he.
Wonks calls this to use costs for kilometering.
It is not surprising that the idea seduced citadin liberals, since taxes could serve to change conduct standards in order to reduce greenhouses and gas emissions, for example.
California planning plannings are involved in the system since they are developing strategies to achieve the objectives set out in the ambitious laws of the State on climate reappearance.
But the representative of Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), Chairman of the Transport Committee of the Representatives, said that he was considered as the long-term viable alternative.
The free market partners of the Reason Foundation also appreciate the idea of paying the leaders to the mile.
"It's not just a tax involving in a big black mass," said Adrian Moore, Vice-President of the Political Fundation of Reason.
People pay more directly for their benefits.
The movement was also supported by two older American secretariats to transport, which, in an 2011 report, urged the Congress to go on the way of payment to a thousand.
The American Senate approved a pilot project of $90 in the past year that would be carrying about 10,000 cars.
But the Chamber Chamber's Chamber's Chamber has killed the proposal, responding to the concerns of the ruling lawyers representing elections that have to move for thousands every day to go to their work or town.
Nevertheless, several States and large cities make progress on their side.
The most decisive is the Orgon, which has mobilized 5,000 leaders to carry out the most important experience of the country.
These carriers are soon paying the state of kilometric costs instead of the seizing taxes.
Nevada has already implemented a pilot project.
The city of New York is one.
Illinois tests a limited number of camions.
And coalition I-95, which includes 17 agents involved in road transport in states long costs, is American (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Floride) studied how it could implement the change.
The concept is not a universal success.
In Nevada, where approximately 50 voluntary carriers recently equipped their car from a device, conductors were concerned that the government could follow their smallest facts and stiffs.
“The concerns about Big Brother and this kind of things are a great problem” said Alauddin Khan, which leads the strategic performance management of the Nevada Transport department.
It's not something people want.
Since the test, the ACLU of Nevada warned on his website: "It would be relatively easy to transform these devices into entire localization devices."
It is not necessary to build a huge and amazing technological infrastructure that will be inevitably expanded to keep the records of alliance and daily arrivals.
Nevada is part of a few States who are now engaged in finding an tractable technology that would allow the State to know how many thousands through a car but without knowing the place or the exact time.
If we can do this, he added Khan, the citizens will be more than it.
The research of this technology has brought some State agencies to call for a small start-up from California of the name of True Mileage.
The company was not intended to help automobiles paying taxes to States.
She was seeking to move in the emerging market of the car insurance, in which conductors paid their kilometraje.
But the testing devices have more planning for the large axes because they do not use the GPS and provide a limited amount of information, periodically downloaded by modem.
"The people will be encouraging to do this if you don't register their speed and don't place them," said Ryan Morrison, Director-General of True Mileage.
Great errors have been made in the pilot programmes of some States.
There are much less intrusive means and rather less intrusive methods of proceeding.
In Orgon, planificators have experience by providing different choices to automobiles.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
They may still choose not to have any device, prefering the place to pay a form based on the average number of thousands delivered by all residents of the State.
Other States hope to sell the concept to miserable citizens by allowing devices to do it more than enough.
In the City of New York, transport officers seek to develop a taxation device that would also be equipped to pay for stationing costs, provide a “payout to conduct” and create a set of data on real speed in time by other drivers that cars could use to avoid immigration.
“The motorists would be encouraged to participate in the benefits that the system offers them” said a document on the urban ammunition.
However, certain transport planning planning plannings ask whether the entire mille payment debate is not just a huge diversion.
In the Metropolitan Transport Commission of the San Francisco Bad zone, the officials say that the Congress could very simply manage the highway Trust Fund by enhance taxes.
An additional or annual tax may be imposed on hybrid vehicle drivers and on others whose vehicles do not consume a lot of seizing, so that each pays its right part.
"There is not necessary to restore a radical chirurgy when it is just needed to aspirin," said Randy Rentschler, the Director of the Law and Public Affairs to the Commission.
If you do this, hundreds of millions of carriers will be concerned about protecting their private life and a tax of other things.
David Bowie: four injections in listening
The English music hasn't ended over this year.
From The Next Day, in January, he conceived a luxury revision planned for 4 November, with several injections.
Four were already emerging on the Toilet.
The announcement of the appearance of a new David Bowie album had left everybody a pantoo.
On 8 January 2013, he said that a new album would go out in March.
After ten years of silence (the last disc, Reality, date 2003) and too rare appearances in public, the English music tried that we could still be able to know the pop scene.
A festival for his fans
No surprises, David Bowie had more than one tour in his sac with The Next Day.
The Thin White Duke has thus planned to reform this album on 4 November.
For the opportunity, he conceived a real festival for his guys.
This revision, entitled The Next Day Extra, will be presented in the form of three disks: the original album, injected study sessions and recycling sessions, and a DVD containing the four already delayed clips.
The Next Day Extra will totally contain ten additional titles relating to the original album: the three pieces of the Deluxe Edition, five specifically designed songs for the opportunity, and two recyclings.
David Bowie also made the presentations of this beautiful cocktail in a video.
There are also one of the discos, but also the accessories provided with: exclusive photos and pockets, a card to share their own impressions, a book with the words...
And, especially, he gives a pre-good of his new Atomic title, typically in the vein of The Next Day, with guitars very before and a redly massed rock electricity.
Inadequate already listed
But Atomic is not the only title to divorce his charms.
The reporter, Like A Rocket Man, Born In A UFO are also available on the toil.
The reporter is a double-face: an worried entrance before a light horse that gradually slows to leave a pop ballade.
On Like A Rocket Man, Bowie did he want to make a little reference to the Rocket Man d'Elton John, even in Gravity?
With this title attached, the cantor seems in any case in his element when he has no foot on earth.
Space Oddity, on the side, was much more serious.
On Born In A UFO, David Bowie makes reference to her extraordinaryness: will it come to another planet?
The rivers of guitar, inviting, are desired to leave the earth.
Bowie uses in any case to play the camera with these titles: information tour, man on the side of a fused, the potential of martyr...
He discovered and revealed at the time, plays to adopt various personalities, as he did it throughout his card, including with his personalities Ziggy Stardust and Aladdin Sane.
No wondering what he has a mask in the photograph of the campaign The Invitation to Veage, of the Louis Viitton Mark, whose new face is incarned.
It will appear in one of their public spots, diffused from 10 November.
The Minister of Defence, Rob Nicholson, argued that the armed soldiers were not a summit of the Canadian Armed Forces, and emphasized that a transition process was followed by all soldiers before returning to civil life.
The Liberals and Neo-Democrats to the Common Chamber, Mr. Nicholson assured that before their release, the army members continued a plan of transition in cooperation with their highers.
All wound soldiers receive appropriate care for their return to civil life and no one of them has been released before being ready, has it stated.
Deputy delegates accused the Government to wish to economize money by not allowing military forces to be blessed - who do not respond to the rule of "University of the service" of the army, requiring that staff may be able to carry out a variety of tasks - to achieve the period of acceptability of 10 years required for pension benefits.
In particular, they townd two cases reported by the Canadian Presse, with which one released soldier last Friday.
Head of David Hawkins, a reservant in London, in Ontario, reached after traumatic stress syndrome, was released from the army, notwithstanding its request to remain a year more, so that it might receive a full indexed pension.
The case was occurred after the headquarter Glen Kirkland, who had declared a parliamentary commission on the last month, which had been led to the exit before being ready because he had not responded to the rules of universality of service.
Mr. Hawkins emphasized that a soldier could be prepared with plans and consultations, but that was totally different than the fact that it would like to leave the lines.
"I told them I wasn't ready," said he during an interview with the Canadian Presse.
I asked for months if there was a way to stay, and they said not.
Since the beginning of major fights in Afghanistan, the army is difficult to determine what latitude it can grant the wound soldiers who want to stay in the rangs, but they are not intended to fight.
In accordance with current rules, Greekly wounded soldiers have been up to three years to restore.
If they do not respond to the criteria for foreign deployment, they may be forced to leave the army.
Data presented in the last year to the Parliament indicates that among 1218 soldiers released for medical reasons, 199 had not reached the service period required to obtain pension benefits.
The Liberal Port on Old Bearings, Jim Karygiannis, asked for merried the reintegration of headquarter Hawkins, while the Neo-Democrat Jack Harris revoked the immediate end of "the hot practice".
Disney put on tablets to launch an animated series
The American media and divorce group Disney decided to privileg the tablets to its own television chains for the next exit of a new series for children.
The nine first episodes of Sheriff Callie's Wild West will be available from 24 November on the viewdisneyjunior.com or via your application for telephones and tablets.
His global launch on the chains of the Disney Group is only planned in 2014, detailed the Disney Junior Division.
The animated design, for children from 2 to 7 years, tells the adventures of Callie's chat, a city of the West American, where she makes the order with a magic lac.
Each episode contains two 11 minutes' stories.
"Interact with smartphones and tablets is a second nature for children today," commented Albert Cheng, Vice-President for digital products at Disney/ABC Television Group, which is in the communication.
This type of experience between Disney's efforts to "develop the lifetime of its series and to build new relationships with its public through digital platforms that are more important", added.
A weekend published by Common Sense Media showed the expansion of the use of the mobile devices by young children in the United States: 38% of less than 2 years have been served of a tablet or a phone, and 72% of less than eight years, with respect to 10% and 38% of two years ago.
Snowden is ready to cooperate with Germany on the issue of American monitoring
Edward Snowden, the denonceer of the American information services, said that he was disposed of joining Berlin to demonstrate the German parliament if the United States Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander had not provided any answers on their activities.
The German Deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele met on Thursday Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he benefits the right of asylum to discuss his witness in Germany.
In a letter submitted by the Deputy to the Mediterranees in Berlin, Mr Snowden said: “Although the result of my efforts had been positive, my Government continues to address the difference of views as a flight and seeks to deal with political accusers which it is impossible to defend himself.”
Nevertheless, the truth is not a crime.
In his letter, Mr Snowden wrote that the support of the international community could convince the American Government to leave the criminal charges available against him.
In the framework of the complaint imposed by the American Ministry of Justice, it is accused of explosion and flood of the State.
Hans-Peter Friedrich, Minister of German Interior, said at the Online Time: "When Mr. Snowden is ready to speak to the German licenses, we will make it possible."
The relations between the United States and Germany have been tested on road following complaints that NSA had put on listening the portable phone of the German chance Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Deputy leading the Parliamentary Group overseeing foreign secret services, indicated that if there was a chance to hear Mr. Snowden as a witness “without the risk and complete destruction of relations with the United States”, it had to be benefited.
Mr. Ströbele, deputy Vert German, published a photo of him with Mr. Snowden on his account Twitter.
During his visit in Russia, he was accompanied by two German journalists.
Mr. Ströbele said that, in accordance with the lawyer of the former consultant of the NSA, Mr Snowden could not return to Russia if he was away from the country.
If Mr Snowden temogenis in Germany, it would be necessary to make sure it would be in "safe" there, the deputy said.
Mr. Snowden wrote in his letter that he had made the subject of a “seven and sustainable persecution campaign” that had forced him to leave his country.
However, he said that he was encouraged by the global reaction against "My political expression act".
The citizens of the whole world, as well as the high responsibilities, including the United States, have judged that the revision of an inexplicable system of permanent monitoring was public use.
The letter advanced a collaborative offer with the German authorities “When the difficulties of this humanitarian situation will be solved”.
Cogeco Câble could soon offer the interactive television
Cogeco Câble subscriptions may well have access to applications such as Facebook, Twitter and finally the Netflix Video Service via their television in a future that seems not so far.
The Cogeco filial indicated Thursday that she currently conducted preliminary tests of the beta version of this platform with some of its users.
"These will allow us to valuate more convivial interfaces and more options," explained the President and Chief of the Cogeco direction, Louis Audet, in interview.
Cogeco Câble takes the step to its competitors, as well as Bell, even though the Cogeco filiale has not yet a precise date in what is related to this new platform.
"Adaptation, change or rescue to change and driving", said Mr. Audet.
The last goal remains to offer tools that our customers are not currently access.
The Rogers' telecommunications generator has already indicated that it could offer Netflix if some technical details, which were not towns, could be regulated.
In the U.S., the popular video service said to be in discussions with some major Catholic distributors in order to be available through their distribution platforms.
The p.-d. de Cogeco and Cogeco Câble also welcomed the announcement made by the Government of Harper during its discussions on 16 October.
Ottawa desires to strengthen television providers by cable and satellite offering customers the possibility of paying services to the card.
"That has been almost two years and half, we say that the idea of forgoing consumers to buy important captures, it doesn't work", said Mr. Audet.
However, it is hoped that the consultations carried out by the Council of Radiodisciplination and Canadian Telecommunications (CRTC) will be deployed on interesting recommendations.
"Their discussions will be undertaken a new reference framework to define our new Canadian cultural policy in terms of television", said Mr. Cogeco.
The CRTC conducts consultations to the public since the last week and should continue with the industry at the next summer.
On the side of the results, Cogeco has indicated a net benefit of 43.8 million to the fourth quarter, or 82 per action.
This is a comparative recurrence to the net benefit of 44.9 million or 83 million by action of the last year.
The company established in Montreal explains the reduction of the costs of recruitment related to new acquirements.
Cogeco purchased the Atlantic Broadband Chamber in 2012, established in the United States, for 1,36 billion.
It was the first major acquisition of the company after which had failed in Portugal.
In December last, the showalais company also bought Peer 1 Network Business, a web provider established in Vancouver, for the sum of 526 million.
With regard to Cogeco income, they have recognized a growth of 41.5% in the fourth quarter to reach 504.7 million.
They are 1.8 billion for the current financial period.
The net benefit of its main filial, Cogeco Câble, was 43.9 million, or 90 ≤ by action, reduced by 45.7 million, or 93 million by action, of the last year.
However, Cogeco Câble income has increased 45 per cent for 470.4 million.
The company lost 15 237 clients during the fourth quarter.
However, for the 2013 financial year, the number of Cogeco Câble clients has increased 5546.
Mr. Audet doesn't worry about see the number of customers of such a kind.
For me, it is not the identification of a trend change, not it observed.
This varies from a quarter to another with a very living competition.
Cheval in bovine products
Of the cheval meat was discharged in bovine savings, sold by two small British teachers of lower price distribution, today announced the food hygiène agency.
Robin test tests revealed that the products developed in Romania and sold by the Headquarters Home Barghans and Quality Save contained from the horse DNA from 1 to 5%.
"When the horse flesh is not mentioned in the list of ingredients, it should not be presented in the product," explained the British Agency.
A scandal on the presence of horse flesh in kitchen plates went into Europe at the beginning of the year, following tests carried out in Ireland.
According to the reviews of the European Commission, France has been the most affected by the presence of this type of meat in census products to contain only bovine.
A collection between two vehicles made four wounds early Friday, on the road 131, in Lanaudière.
Before 4:00, a car moved in the north direction, to Saint-Felix-de-Valois, lost his car's supervisor and killed a car coming to the other direction.
The four occupiants of the two vehicles were wounded, but they were not afraid for their life.
The movement was returned to the normal at 6th Friday.
Frontier Airlines is intended to pay handy bags
Frontier Airlines is intended to pay up to $100 to the passengers transporting hand-driving bags on their flights.
Frontier Airlines is supposed to start paying up to $100 for a hand bag and 2 for a café or a suda, although in its mercredi advertisement, she indicated that passengers could impose the not open cane with them at the end of the airport.
The new hand-based bag expenditures concerning the bags set in the upper section, so the small bags installed under the seat will always be free.
Frontier said that she would pay $25 if the costs were paid in advance and $100 if the travellers had paid only once at the boat door.
The Frontier Port, Kate O'Malley stated that the 100 dollars were planned to encourage travellers to pay the expenditure.
"We don't want to pay this price," she explained.
Airlines began paying the first and second stocks recorded in 2008.
Passengers who tried to avoid these expenditures put as many things they could be in the main bags in upper compartments, so there was no more place in these compartments.
These expenditures are a way to ensure that passengers transport less things on the edge.
O'Malley said that these new costs will not really serve to collect money.
It is to understand the most faithful Frontier clients that it becomes more difficult to find place in the upper sections.
The passengers who buy their bill on the website of the air company will not have to pay.
So, a passenger who makes the cotton at a boat door Frontier could be transported freely, while the next person in the box could have to pay $100 for a similar sac.
O'Malley explained that the website and registration procedures of Frontier are now to change in order to ensure that passengers know the existence of these costs before coming to the door.
Frontier's saving costs will not be applied before the summer, although no date was set.
Passengers often run about bags and other costs, but airlines adhere them.
They feel that the maintenance costs are important and that passengers who want this service should pay it.
A lot of people in Wall Street consider the addment of bagage fees like a sign that proves that airlines make enough sweet to cover the air trip cost after years of loss.
However, many of them have not touched the bags costs.
Spirit Airlines Inc. had applied the first hand-shop fees three years ago, and the low-cost Allegiant company followed a little later.
The only other company imposing such expenditures is the Hungarian Wizz Air company, stated the consultant with air companies Jay Sorensen, which follows the costs in addition.
In a December 2011 report, he reported $50 M$ per year.
Sorensen, a former Midwest Airlines framework, recently seen on the Spirit and asked what he was going to find at the door of boat when passengers discovered the costs of inhabitable hands imposed by the company.
"I never had seen a process of smoke as well as flowing of all my professional card," said he.
I was waiting for seeing dent grincements and a bathgarre out at the door.
The airport was full, added, "the passengers are mounted to the light speed."
Frontier also does like the Spirit and applies costs of $2 for a café, a tea, a soda or a fruit juice.
Frontier indicated that passengers who take a suda or fruit jus can make the non-opened candle with them, and those who take the coffee can be free of service.
She'll always distribute free water.
US Airways tried often to pay for drinks in 2008, but returned after seven months later after passengers were complained and no other large air company had followed.
The Frontier's decision to pay hand-payments costs when passengers don't buy their bill with the air company is his last effort to encourage customers to go on his site.
Airline companies pay for online travelers like Orbitz $10 to $25 for each payment sold.
This has encouraged all airlines to encourage passengers to buy directly with them instead of addressing to an online travel agency.
However, Frontier went far more in this area.
In September, she began to offer only half of thousands of reliability to customers who bought their bill through an online travel office.
Wednesday, she reduced the prices of thousands of 25% on a journey.
So, a Frontier travel of 1 000 miles buyed at a online travel agency would allow you to win 250 miles.
It also allows passengers to choose their seat at the advance only if they buy directly their bill on the Frontier website.
Frontier has a faithful client in his city of origin, Denver, but his receiving activity and it lost money.
Receipts have reduced 9 per cent and its flight capacity has reduced almost 13 per cent during the first quarter, according to the financial results published by his mother society, the Republic of Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to restore the financing of Frontier by selling the air company.
The NSA causes an 'inner error' and not the computer pirates for the scene of its site
The National Security Agency opening in the shadow said on Friday that it was a bug that had caused the panne of his public site for a few hours and not hackers as some had been presented on online.
"NSA.gov has remained inaccessible for a few hours this night because of an internal error that has occurred during a planned update," said the Employment Agency in an email statement.
The problem will be solved tonight.
The allegations as provided for in the panne was due to a service denial attack [DSD] are fault.
Learning this evening, online server trackers noticed that the NSA site was in panne for at least 6 hours, and some users can't always access the site.
Earlier, a NSA port indicated ABC News that the internal network of the Agency was not "not all" compromise.
No classified information is in danger.
At least one online hacktivist group claimed to be responsible for the NSA site panne by a DSD attack.
DSD attacks are included a targeted site until the servers are overloaded and the site is found.
The cyber-tatic cyber is not very sophisticated and the attacks are not intended to benefit into the vised system.
Another time the NSA, a time named the No. Search Agency, was found under the fire of projectors and strongly criticised during the last months following a revealing vague about its broad communication monitoring programmes at the national and foreign level – which is part of the secret files of the NSA, flighted and informed by the former NSA consultor, Edward Snowden.
This growing controversia around the agency caused many speculations as the incident tonight was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The Delta Centre-Ville now closed
The Delta Center-Ville Hotel closed its doors in Montréal, after 36 years of existence.
The investment fund that had the building sold to promoters who will transform it into student residence.
Three hundred fifty people worked in the hotel.
One of them, 200 haven't always found new jobs.
Delta promises not to let his employees cut off.
Employers have come to meet employees directly on place, individually met employees to assess their needs.
"This support will continue for the next six months", explains the regional director of the work relations of the Delta Hotels, Félix Biisson.
The closure of Delta is in a very competitive hotel market.
The investment fund that was owner of this building had choices to do.
He then invested in the building to continue operating it, so there were 10 million investments while competition is very cold, there are many new hotels appearing in Montreal.
"Ow he sold it to someone else, and that's what happened," Paul Arsenault explains, headquarter of the Transat Tourism Chair at the UQAM School of Sciences Management School.
Other hotels of Montreal will also be converted in the next months, such as the Crown Plaza who will become a residence for older people.
During time, four hotel projects totalising about 600 rooms will see the two-year day.
For the Titan PDG, "the Building Project of Goodyear Friends start with employed kinds"
After having thrown the answer in January for the partial resumption of the Goodyear site of America-Nord, Maurice Taylor, the US Pneumatic Pneumatic Pneumatic Pneumatics, is now ready to save 333 jobs on 1 137 as well as use.
Arnaud Montebourg, Minister of Product Rehabilitation, had already announced it on Monday, 21 October.
After we have rejected the buyer project in January, you will return today.
You have proceededings of violent attacks and abuses, speaking of "so-in-law workers", which "train three hours" per day, "fous" syndicates in the CGT.
We do not understand this time-face.
Is it to please Mr. Montebourg?
I'm not trying to enjoy anyone.
Except my wife.
Mr. Montebourg, is a young man who is trying to save industrial jobs among the best payed.
If I have cursed someone by my words, I'm sorry.
But France also has a high level of tax and unemployment.
Does the truth blow you?
Working seven hours per day when work in other countries is eight hours with disabilities in France.
In India, in China and in full of other countries, we work 10 to 12 hours per day.
But I don't have any prejudice about France.
What I see is a use that produces good agricultural fingers, has good equipment, is well located and has spaces to grow up.
Why Titan needs this device so much?
Titan doesn't need to buy this device.
But with a correct price and competent workers, this is the case to try.
What kind of agreement do you wait between the CGT and Goodyear?
If, since the announcement of the usine closure, Goodyear would offer employees a good start compensation, I think that 100 per cent of employees would have accepted it.
Now, let's imagine that Titan bought in Goodyear the closed use.
Since then, Titan could move machines to Poland or to any other countries of the European Union, which still have its own currency.
I think Mr. Monteburg knows that.
But he wants to keep the use of the Americas with at least 333 jobs payed.
Titan accepts receipt them from some 1 200 current employees in Goodyear.
So, Mr. Montebourg needs a Titan's commitment before he tried to take the CGT to sit on the table with Goodyear.
The first stage is that the CGT and Goodyear screens a agreement on starting compensations for all employees.
There will be no longer employees in the oil.
Mr. Monteburg said you were ready to ensure these 333 jobs for four years.
Do you confirm it?
The only number I mentioned to the Minister is 333.
I know he would want a guarantee of four years.
But, as I told you, the CGT and Goodyear must first agree on starting compensations.
If all employees accept their employees, the project of acquisition of use starts with the employees.
How can we provide employment guarantees when no jobs remain on the site?
If Mr. Montebourg comes to what the CGT and Goodyear agrees and that Titan buys the uses, we have a good intention to stay in Amiens-Nord over four years.
Bombardier's benefit was lower, while delivery and aircraft road
Bombardier Inc, Canadian aircraft and ferroviary constructor, reported a 15% of its net benefit, under pressure of a decrease of commands and deliverys during the third quarter and contractual problems in its Trains division.
Bombardier, based on Montreal, has no longer provided flight test data for its whole new CSeries or information to know whether the airport will respect its ambitious market service calendar before September.
After the inaugural flight of the test airport it was about a month and a half, the last flowed only three times, and the question was then going to know whether the trial phase was in a good way.
The results were not higher than the previsions and the course of actions was 8 per cent to the Toronto Bourse.
Cameron Doerksen, analyzing within the National Financial Bank, decreased its notice, passing on “performance” to “sector performance” because of the low potential to increase it during the next quarter or the next two quarters.
“Although the decrease of air delivery was largely anticipated, we were really disappeared by the recipient margin in the transport division," said Cameron Doerksen in a note to the customers.
We think that Bombardier will record new orders for its carriers CSeries and then the flight test program will advance.
However, if no new order has been announced during the next months, we hope that the market becomes more stable about the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family can catapulate the lower market segment today housed by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was divorced in March and the first time in September after months of late.
But the number of close commands for CSeries aircraft is modest to this day of 177. It seems that potential purchasers are waiting for the results of flight testing to validate the company’s claims on energy efficiency and the potential of economics of the new line airport.
At the present time, the company recorded a total of 403 orders and purchase commitments to 15 customers and operators.
Peter Beaudoin, President and Chief of the direction, is convinced that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 close commands before the establishment of the first airport.
The leaders also assured the analysis and media Thursday, noting that the programme had been made in accordance with the calendar.
Mr Beaudoin said at a telephone conference, adding that the tests on the ground and software updates were planned during the air ceiling time.
Each constructor is differently planned.
We have decided to process a first flight and to predict a update period and that is what we did.
This will be reproduced throughout the flight programme.

Five repeals: a deputy requests the release of the Grouw Brigitte
The project of the Gymnastic Minister of "relifting" of the signaling flowers in Brussels please not all the world.
For remember, the Brooklyn Minister of Public Works and Transport launched this Thursday in Brussels' centre a test project with the refund of 16 signaling powers of the region to yellow and blue colours in Brussels.
The goal is at the time "to increase security" and "Broxelllantic identity".
The idea is, in terms, to resume all bruxelloic signaling fires for a estimated cost of approximately a million euros.
But the blue chosen by the Minister is "trop founded", according to the Bruxellois Emmanuel De Bock, who speaks of "flamandization" of the capital and requires the "limit" of Brigitte Grouwels.
"No content to pay the money of the Bruxellois in signaling operations to the colors of the Bruxell Bock Region, Brigitte G female continued its capital flowing operations," said Mr. De Bock in a communication.

Five years ago my dad left out of the world of living.
At the beginning I was born to his death, I talked about him at this time,
I was so afraid to forget it, or rather I didn't know how I was going to keep the "sheat."
There is no receipt, employment mode to pass through the wall of the invisible and find its own.
Then there are signs appeared.
The first time, it was the very strongest of his presence on the transition seat when I was conducted.
Another time, a double wake in full night to watch his show that doesn't leave me, put on the night table.
It's the image of my sister dad who joins me in my shoes daily.
Our mother left us after his fight against cancer.
That's at least what I thought on the day when I found his empty body, cryed on this hospital bed with fresh draps.
Likewise, his funerals were a focalized glass around the shelter of the shops that focused on his neck.
I thought she was out.
Even soon, by small daily or night appearances, a little timide, a little effaced, she came back into my spirit, evoluting to the rock and as well as she took her place in the landscape of my thought that believed in the deep.
And then, she revealed all in me with my own faces that I had not yet tried, massed by my relationship with her.
So I learned and understood that I hadn't lost any person of my mother but just a woman I didn't know really, a woman who had incarned this person during her stay in life.
When died, this woman had perfected her life and released the person I loved, and here I found her full and full.
This disagreement of my life's way remains the most unexpected and the most beautiful.
It's a privilege to know that the loved people never leave us.
I'm like my dad, "in the back like the outside," he's paralyzed.
We've always told me.
I never believed it at the time.
I had difficult relationships with him until he becomes old, sick.
There, I wasn't afraid of him and I could love him.
One day, he's dead.
For a long time, he came to me: When I stopped smoking, I was afraid when I was bad...
He talked to me, he encouraged me constantly, he lived my body.
I saw his hands looking at my arms, I ready for him my body.
But it wasn't ever incredible.
I could have a personal life.
He left me intimity.
It's long, then one day he's gone.
Finally, it was comfortable and pleasant to be included, encouraged, advised.
I don't know any more who said that the dead persons are not forgotten but invisible.
My parents are not anymore, but I feel it always close to me.
Every event, every moment of my life makes me feeling in their presence because I always think what would they say, what would they think and what they were doing?
I'm always dreaming of them, perhaps not all nights, but several times per week is certain.
I'm often dreaming in the last moment I have to share with them before it's too late, only there's always something that prevents me to achieve this time.
I'm often wake up when it comes to me, and I'm deeply aware of their absence.
Often, some dreams bring me to the contrary and record in my story and actually, they continue to live and share my life.
The veil of my echography where I had to know the sex of my baby, I revealed that I was wake up, I felt out of bed, my father waited for me on the pillar and he was sick, and he was glad that I was waiting for a little boy.
On the next day, I had the feeling that he had visited me in my sleep to mean he shared with joy what happened to me.
And of course, that was a little boy in my womb.
I like to share this time with him, and I am pleased to tell this common memory dead after his death.
Before five years ago, my grandma would die from a cancer suites.
An year before, she was traveling with my family to Cuba.
That's what his disappointment caused in the young bathroom I was at the time.
I've made my deal so fast.
But she continues to influence my life, including in the moments I'm in difficulty, or when I have to take important decisions.
Learning the Arab and interesting me in the Middle East, at the point of making it a master in a great school, they have not been, with the relaxation, anodin choice.
In fact, I heard him speaking to the Arab in my child, and talking about Maroc, where she had lived for decades - before I rejoined France at the time of independence.
The values she's always present, although it's going to think how she would like me to do at a given time.
It also goes for my attitudes: I try to be at the height of generosity and the right of spirit of the one who was a faithful fervent.
Soon I recognize her as a daily presence, a well-being soul, a salvator spirit.
I see his eyes stand on me.
My mother died in 10 years ago.
Murder after I talked to the phone.
I have passed through all the phases: the incomprehension, anger, pain, the lamentations that are alone, wherever, at insected places, incongress moments.
Then, the time has stopped the penalty.
It was left only that the lack, this empty empty, that needs of her, to trust me, to make me back to the sweet of his sweet.
However, she's there, quiet presence, she's there and looks at me.
All the morning, I see his worried eyes stand on me, I see the censes who love his look, the laugh around the lips that grow the cigarettes, the most who mark the front of the day of concern.
My mother took possession of my face and she looked at me every morning in my wonder.
And every morning, I'll get my eyes off.
My wife and mother of my three children are dead from a cancer to 43 years.
We are continually feeling about his protection, nothing serious can happen to us.
It was his promise on his bed of pain, then we have little to smile, and to pronounce his name is not more tabou but a comfort.
Well, I'm talking to her in the shoes of the night when the absence is too bad, she invites her to dream when the moral is a little reach.
We feel secure and protected in the difficult moments, the relax of the time makes us to realize how she was a chief of orchester and we tried to stay in the way she moved us.
If one is very strongly loved you, the absence can't cut it out of the heart and memory.
In some way, being loved becomes your internal energy.
I lost my father on 22 August 2008 from the suites of a cancer of the friend.
I was very close to him, I always did what he thought or what he was appreciated.
I couldn't assist his inhumation and three weeks after her death, I was born a little boy.
If I have my convictions sometimes different from him, I'm always asking if my actions are in accordance with his vision of things.
I also had problems in my work for these convictions.
For me, it's impossible to go in an opposite sense, I don't sleep and I'm always asking what he's gonna think about it.
I don't know if I accepted his way to be or if I'm just like him: is genetic?
In any case, it will always be my reference.
It was a little like a friend-go, there was no need to talk between us.
Bref, he's on the daily.
I recognize his presence and it makes me happy.
See her about thirty years old that my husband was dead in the age of 33 years.
I had 28 years old, and our son six years old.
The immense penalty that then invahid me was certainly attained, but he's still close to me.
Very often he "debars" in my dreams so precisely, if he lives that I'm still more triste to find that it was just a dream.
The other night, he asked me if I did well, I said to him no, he answers me "I down" but from a sound so real that I was wake up at the upper, angry, and I slew the hair lamp around, and I'm sure he would come.
I always live in the same house, and often, I feel watched and I'm back to see if he's not there, I know that it's he and I'm talking to him.
In all rooms I get his presence and it makes me happy.
For nothing in the world I would leave this house where we were happy and his spirit lives with me.
I'm 58 years old, I've always lived alone since his left, he's and I'll stay the love of my life.
I want to explain that I'm a partner with a complaint with a responsibilities, I'm laughing, I'm my grandma, I'm full of friends, but my heart and my soul applies to him and I'm never talking over him with my son, and I'm never going to the cemetery.

The Cocaino-Avocate who informed a couple of drugs of a police investigation was imprisoned
Basharat Ditta, 42 years, gave information to the lord of the Crime Neil Scarbrough
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction was not revealed on the great day
He was condemned to a three-year imprisonment penalty by the Liverpool Core
A great defence lawyer, who had informed a couple of drugs of an important police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addition was not revealed, was convicted to three years of prison.
Basharat Dieta, 42 years old, gave sensitive information to the Master of Crime Neil Scarbrough concerning investigations on its activities related to drug trafficking after being compromised because of its cocaine consumption usual.
A lawyer, who was surnamed Bash and considered criminals as a "premised importance" in 2011, was arrested at Scarborough in 2011 following the police hearing operations sent to Scarborough, represented in a previous process in relation to the drug traffic.
The police officers recovered Sarborough, 32 years old, to put three cocaine bags to the lawyer's house in Blackburn, in Lancashire, while he assisted a dinner of Barreau with dinners.
The investigations showed that Dirta was a regular consumer of this class A after testing of cocaine traces in his hair, portfolio and credit cards.
During an eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to get illegally information on the arrestation of two men for the Scarborough account and one of his partners.
The four suspects were observed at the time by the police in the framework of an important investigation on heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
With 32 other men, they were deprived after the police had taken heroin and cocaine for a amount of 1.5 million, and more than 200 000 euros in species during a series of raids.
During 42 years, he provided information to criminals because he feared that his toxicomania would not be revealed on the great day.
Today, at the Liverpool Casses core, Dita, who is working in the Forbes Solicitors Chain located in Blackburn, was disgraced after being recognized criminally on two heads of a prosecution of justice after a trial of three weeks.
He had approved cocaine possession during a previous audience.
Avocate's crime was occurred after police undertaking Scarborough, he discovered that he was regularly contacted with Derta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspicion and returned to the house of Dieta and putting drugs, cleanly to 60 per cent, under the avocate poubels in a black golf gant.
A few times after the deposito, Scarborough was regularly in contact with Derta who was at a dinner at the footstation of Ewood Park, enchanting the Blackburn Rovers club.
A lawyer returned to him, discovered drugs, and they phoned at nine times.
The Court heard that Dita was a "regular consumer" of cocainian after testings showed that the drug drug in his hair, cards and credit cards.
This was stopped later but refused to consumer the cocaine. He said he had spoken to the presumed drug trafficking because it was his client and said that their discussions were assigned to a “right privileges”.
During his arrest, Dirta recovered his card and tried to remove several credit cards, but they were all captured and made a hair sample.
During a questionnaire, he stated that he had a office in his home, as well as in his workplace and that customers were calling him to his home for legal questions.
But the court heard witnesses that he called major actors in drug trade, some of which he had represented, after key arrests to tell them what investigators were on the present.
The Prosecutor Anne Quote said: "If anyone must know that it is not to be punished by the law, it is a criminal lawyer."
Mr. Dieta is accused of being abused as a criminal lawyer and being too involved in individual customers.
The relationship we speak is not just a drug trafficking, but a drug trafficking provider from drugs to his own lawyer.
Some of its communications will be uncertainly legal communications because it was his lawyer.
But this was well beyond ordinary limits of a relationship between a lawyer and his client.
He entered the police investigation as much as possible to allow him to continue its criminal activities.
Mr. Dieta did not honor his profession, but deshonorated it.
He has been too disappeared by some customers, particularly Scarborough, and he left his independence.
Dieta refused any illegal action and said: "If I was a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and if I wanted to provide information to Mr Scarborough, I wouldn't have waited for 15 hours, I would have done it immediately."
But after the hearing, the superintendent Lee Halstead of the Police of Lancashire said: “Mr. Dieta has been a criminal lawyer to himself since he began to cause drugs from criminal organizations.”
His addition to the Cocaine has been compromised and has made it vulnerable to the headquarters of the organized criminal groups who have been responsible for obtaining precious information on police investigations.
The lawyers should observe the most closest integrity rules and establish a public trust climate.
Mr. Dirta has led this confidence and tried to open back his profession.
The unity responsible for serious and organized criminality of Lancashire conducted the investigation on Mr. Dieta, which was condemned by the three heads of cocaine possession, and now of the justice, and the engagement of its complaint to pursue criminals in justice.
That the case serves warning the criminals to know that no person is above the law.
We'll find you and bring you to the courts.
Scarborough himself was imprisoned for 14 years after the offence of the complicity of heroin trafficking, cocaine and cannabis.
Thirty-five other trafficking persons were condemned to a total of 153 years of prison for drug trafficking.
On his site, Dita organized a question/reply meeting on himself during which he said that his dream job would be a lawyer to represent customers in the death neighbouring in America, his last invited to dinner would be Mohammed Ali and the inequality would be what would move to work.

New collective application against the Sainte-Croix brothers
A new collective application was made against the Holy Cross brothers, regarding sexual aggression that would be deployed at the Saint-Joseph oratory, as well as in several orphelinats, colleagues and schools.
The application supports the testimony of the applicant, identified as "J. J"., who would have been masturbed in the 1950s, first in Nore-Dame-des-Neiges by his teacher the Submis brother, then by his confessor, the father Bernard, at the orator of Saint-Joseph, where he was mystery servant and his father worked as a pein.
The first sentence was only three institutions, and when we had announced the Regulation, many people said to us: "I was on this place, can I write me?", says the lawyer Alain Arsenault, who defends victims in the two resources.
The collective receipt to be submitted has particularly allowed the addendum of plastics from any establishment where seeks could be made by members of the congregation of Sainte-Croix.
At the present time, the provision gathers the complaints of 25 persons who claim to have been attacked by the Sainte-Croix brothers.
The facts governed are generally older than those mentioned in the first use, since many of the vised institutions closed their doors in the 1960s.
The use also emphasized that the congregation of Sainte-Croix and the orator of Saint-Joseph, which is a different entity, "allowed sexual self-relateds against children," that they have "exercise moral, religious and psychological constraints on victims," that they were "especiated in the course of the perpetrated sexual seeds, and that they have "reconscious and consciously chosen to ignore the problem".
These latest accusations are based on letters prescribed by the lawyer of the Brothers Sainte-Croix, Mi Emile Perrin, in 1990, but also on research made in the archives on this subject by brother Wilson Kennedy, an old brother of Sainte-Croix who publicly described the sevices.
The collective remedie must first pass the step of receipt to the Supreme Court.
Once the Court's receipt of receipt, the second stage shall be proceeded at the second stage or the hearings on the basis.
In the case of the first application, the congregation of Sainte-Croix had accepted to regulate the friendly before hearings were carried out on the foundation.

A lot of opposition to medical assistance to die in the Congress of Palliative care
The Canadian Palestinian care Congress, which takes place this week in Ottawa, is a few days after the vote in favour of the draft Law on Medical Aid to die in Quebec.
This is the opportunity for several Palestinian care associations to reaffirm their disagreement.
If all diseases had access to effective care to slow their sufferings, more than to stay home, very little of them would wish to end their days, according to a Canadian Palliant Association's Palestinian care, Mary Bouvette.
If we focus on Palestinian care in Canada, the approach of ehutanya would be minimum.
The President of the Québec Palestinian Responsibility Network also rejects the draft Law on Medical Assistance to Death.
If it is adopted, Alberte Dery is concerned about the consequences on the next generations.
"This is the sense of life," she deplore.
The majority of Palestinian care houses will refuse to help patients to die, according to the Vice-President of the Palestinian Relief Alliance, Suzanne Fitzback.
Mrs Fitzback, also the Headquarter Mathieu-Froment-Savoie in Gatineau, believes that the service would be inadequately.
We never ask us, "I want to kill, give me an injection."
The Director of the Palestinian Associate Association, Rick Firth, believes that the draft law of Quebec describes the population concerning the vocational Palestinian care.
He doesn't believe the Institute will get the step.
On its side, the Liberal Deputy of Gatinau, Valley Stefanie, claims that the end of life should be clarified before the draft law was adopted.
Kenya presses indicated the law contrary to media
"It is a fearful country, and is lawful to address the following question: Is it what will the Parliament prevent to bail the independence of the judicial system tomorrow?", said the newspaper in response to the draft law and asking what it is declared inconstitution.

He stated that the new media court “the new court will always be part of the government” and that the restrictions on content and publicity would be naked at the place of Kenya in the world economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us, and we ask him to reject the draft law and to send it to the parliamentaries," he added.
According to the magazine The Star, the new law project will allow the Government to have “the manuscription on the media”. The Standard stated that democracy and liberty of opinion in Kenya’s “leaving a hard pit” and the draft law qualifying it from “dracony”.
The adoption of the draft law is in the same time as a train of measures to strengthen national security in the silling of an attraction perpetrated by armed islamists in the Westgate trade centre in the last September.
The Kenyan media were encouraging the wrath of the authorities by dissemining video monitoring images on which the troops deployed on the scene of the attack were decreasing the luxury trade centre.
The officer of the police, David Kimaiyo, replied with two journalists and one of the media responsible for asking them, although the invitation was sent to a resort in the media.
In accordance with the new law-project, media may be feasibility of adding up to 20 million Cyan shillings and journalists up to 1 million with the additional risk of being "raded" or that it can no longer receive official pre-pre-accreditation.
The Court also has the power to impose the goods of a contractant if it has not paid its amendment.
According to the Daily Nation, “the only amendment is sufficient to paralyse the majority of the FM stations. ”
He also said that measures could have a devastant effect on what he described as the “animated blogosphere” of Kenya.
By reducing the media to silence, political men know that they can do what they want to do in any impunity.
"No one will never know", wrote Mutuma Mathiu, journalist in The Nation, described the Kenyan media as a key control source in public life.
“ Political men were delivered to themselves and would bring us back to ransom and kitchen. ”
Cyan lawyers have been the target of the people's wrath in the past.
In May, they took a position against the punishments commanded by the National Salary Commission and retained their mirobolous wages of approximately 532,000 shillings per month outcoming taxes – which contained among the highest world.

However, the CSSS decided not to engage in independent work, which can cost up to three times more precious than a full-time farmer.
Mrs Beaudet has not been used to decade.
It has been rationalised or reduced some of our activities within the planning institution, while things are replaced.
It's sure we have worked strong to interest our young people [representatives in pharmacia] to come and stay here.
There is a concours of circumstances that we have been in a bad situation last year.
Improved situation
After this period, the 2013-2014 year is clearly easier for the CSSS Pharma department.
Déjà, three pharmacists returned to work after their maternity consent and three other pharmaceuticals have been embarked during the last months.
Furthermore, the efforts made by the Department to hold up fruits, as the four students currently reside in Laval also decided to stay at the CSSS employment.
Now, it's going to be much better, he emphasized the farmer.
To this end of the financial year, we will have seven new farmers and three maternity returns.
This will therefore make our exits from the past year.
Needs always growing
However, the situation remains delicate.
Several factors, such as hospital female paintings, or predominance of young women in the middle, make situations like this in 2012 difficult to predict.
For us [the number of effectives] is always precaired, because we have a environment that is young and we are working a lot of young women, so with weaknesses, it is almost always wrapped to three maternity congés when it's okay, she added.
Last year, there were much more and there were no pharmacists available to make changes, so it was more difficult.
The upper 22-year-old model does not begin his card at the cinema by the small door.
The Lars van Trier elected him to incarnate Charlotte Gansburg young in Nymphomaniac, his next film.
This green pornografic drame, in eight chapters that will go out in two flights (the 1st and 8 January 2014), will be the erotic memories of a four-year increase in sex since its adolescence.
The appearance of Stacy Martin with his old is frapped: a brindial silhouette, a diaphane teint and French English origin.
Without forgotten a certain risk gap: the one who has not been able to put nest on the glass paper will be shown in more soft situations on great screen.
An exit from Nymphomaniac made the temperature on Toile: Stacy Martin appears on the bed and is completely exited with Shia La Beouf.
If the provocatory cineaste requested his actors to put their pool into the placard, he had been used to professionals of X for the most busy sex scene, before the fuming of all the bodys digitally: above the ceinture, it is the star; below, the duplication.
From Björk to Charlotte Gansburg, passed by Nicole Kidman, Lars von Trier has usually been able to push his stairs in their last relaxation, always for the best.
Stacy Martin hasn't finished talking about her.

A short-term air missiles load of SA-8 would have been tribted and destroyed.
The new race of Tsahal airport in the Syrian territory (the sixth since the beginning of the year, according to the Israeli daily Haaretz) was not confirmed by Israel or Syria.

Ukrainian approaches the failite
The Standard & Poor's Notice Agency has denied on vendree the Ukrainian solvibility notice, despite the capacity of the former Soviet Republic, in recession for more than one year, to address its financial obligations.
The notice of public debt titles in the country is "B-", focusing on the category of special investments.
It is a negative perspective, seeing at least a chance of three that it is again disappeared from here one year.
"It is at least likely that the Government's strategy allows to ensure sufficient foreign currency to face its high external funding needs," explains the American Agency.
The Agency believes that the change reserves in Ukraine have shot 26 per cent between September 2012 and September 2013 and has provided that the tendance will continue.
This combines the reimbursement of credits taken to the foreign.
These reservations, which are massively used to support local currencies, Hryvnia, defining, judges more likely to be an evaluated agency, which would provide its external debt.
Kiev also needed liquidity to regulate its gas imports to Russia, which has not paid an estimation of $882 million.
This announcement is a bad new for the Ukrainian power in a period of living tensions with his Russian neighbour, an encouraging of the will of Kiev to sign a association agreement with the EU end of November.

His end, still relatively modest, explosed the past years and S&P was 33.5% of the PIB, against less than 10% before the 2008-2009 crisis.
The country, in deficit, recalls the assistance of the International Monetary Fund for months since 2010, which had granted $15,3 billion, and has deployed only $3.4 billion for the time.
However, the Fund refuses to pay any new tranche until the country would not adopt impopular reforms to reduce its deficit, in particular by increaseing gas prices to the population.
At the outcome of a new unfruitful mission in the country, the FMI found that this week "the important needs for external financing" were "a vulnerability" as relevant "the signs of economic improvement".
However, for the Oleksandr Joloud economicist, the Political Edition Centre, "It can't expect a short term improvement."
"There is little hoped that impulsive reforms will be launched in a prelector year," the presidential elections were planned in 2015, with the expert, requested by the AFP.
The only hope is that it is an improvement of international congress.
S&P also reflects the "incerteness" related to the possible signing of a association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, which Brussels conditions to release the opposite Youlia Timochenko.
"Signed the agreement would be positive for long-term trade but there might be short and medium terms related to Russia's reaction", explained S&P, which fears trade restrictions from Moscow.
Russia, which represents the quarter of Ukrainian exports, has predicted that in the establishment of a free exchange zone between the EU and Kiev, it should strengthen its controls at the border for imported goods.

M23 appears on the point of beating after being cast out the north-west localities of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (RDC) that it was controlled since the beginning, 20 months ago.
"We're going to continue M23 and to acquire it everywhere where he's hidden because it's a crime," said Reuters, Colonel Olivier Hamuli, Port of the FARDC.
We don't have to let them reorganize because they martyr the Congolese people for a long time.

The last, according to the Uganda mediators, returned mercredi in Kampala between Kinshasa and M23.
An accroachs are reported in the collines that dominate Bunagana, the latest locality in the hands of insurrects to be falled this week, as well as in Runyoni, a colline where the M23 rebellion has been seen in 2012.
In November, insurgents occupied Goma, head-leader of the province of the Kivu, benefiting from the fleet of government garnage and the passivity of Blue Cases from Monusco.
The Crimination of Goma has brought the United Nations Mission to RDC, the most important world in terms of effectiveness, to strengthen its mandate and to form a fast breeding intervention of South African, Malarian and Tanzanian soldiers.
On its side, the FARDC master status was renewed, and the army was overcome against M23, changed the course of war.
The progress rhythm of government troops today is without previous.
"M23 seems to be touched at its end," a Congolese business expert preved Jason Stearns, on his Congo Siasa blog.
This would be history - that would be the first time the Kinshasa government succeeded to fight a major insurrection.
And this would also be the first time since 1996 that any armed group joined Rwanda would be present in the eastern RDC.
United Nations experts accused Rwanda, who never doubtly support military M23, which is the start of former Military Military Military Military Military Military.
The Chief of the British diplomacy, William Hague, invited the Romanian President Paul Kagame to prove retention, announced a Party of Foreign Office.
The past week Kigali had announced the possibility of military representatives following the obediences falling in Rwanda.
Mercredi, the inhabitants of Bunagana drew the roads of the Bunagana to welcome the entry of the FARDC soldiers.

The company has 2.65 million bpj for this year, with a growth of 25% of the expected production from 2017.
The major part of growth in the coming years will prove from its natural gas projects associated in Australia.
According to these projects, annual investment expenditure increased by $7 billion in two years and should reach $36,7 billion in 2013.
The benefits of the production activities have slightly reduced to the third quarter, while the benefits of availability (by refinance and chemical production) were 45% to $380 million.

School transport: Received complaint
The School Commission of Region-de-Sherbrooke (CSSRS) requires since the beginning of the school year 150 dollars per student (in addition to a maximum of $300 per family) for students who benefit from school transport to two residents, a service that the organization offers when it is able to do so.
Before the changes made to the last budget, no financial contribution was repealed.
"There is a mediation service proposed by the Commission and I was interested", explains Mrs. Lefèvre.
The CSRS was invited to a mediation and requested an additional time to consider it.

The School Commission of the Region-de-Sherbrooke (CSRS) did not comment.
The organization only described that mediation was part of the process in a complaint.
Abroad around the closement of the emergences of the Hotel-Dio
Since several months, the CGT, the Minister of Health, Marisol Touraine, had decided on 10 July to "decade the project implementation calendar, and in particular the date of closure of emergencys that could not be able to intervene on 4 November".
One officially requested "pour not move any risk on the holding of emergency at Paris at the beginning of hiver" but that was not also intended to driving the PS campaign for a few months from the municipalities.
Despite the ministry designs, the closure should even be effective at this date.
Even if, at the AAPHP, we prefer to use the term "transformation" or "change in continuity".
Since 4 November, the pumps that were assured about a quarter of the years ' year passing to the emergency of the Hotel-Diu will have all received to allow you to take the thirty serious cases daily to the emergency of other parish hospitals.
This date of 4 November also corresponds to the renewment of the internations.
At Hotel-Gou, the specialized in emergency internals will be placed on Monday to 5 internal medicines.
With regard to the transmission of internal medicine beds, it is programmed for the current of the month.
"The accommodation service of the emergency of the Hotel-Diu should be closed within the shortest time, and it is 4 November," ensures, without delay, Loic Capron, the President of the AAPHP Medical Committee, which supports the project of the direction.
"The 4 November, there will be no patients brought by pumps, only persons coming through their own means ", confirm Professor Jean-Yves Fagon, the medical license of the new Hotel-Gou.
"But we will continue to accommodate patients in emergency, " tempterly, valuating the permanent presence of SMUR vehicles in place to transfer serious cases.
Ancient senior doctors will also remain in place.
But it is part of the ARS to decide the locking of the emergency service.
"The things are made progressively", answered Nicolas Péju, a port-law of the ARS for which, on November 4, there will be no change in service terms. "
"The Minister has lied us or we have lie," explains the urgent doctor Geral Kierzek.
It is defined as a "abortion lanceer" in terms of a "cynic" decision taken by "doctoral-Administration technological technological technology".
"They are now to see and asphyxiate emergency that have been renewed by less than five years ago," he thinks.
For him, "If other Russian emergency services could enhance the overall, there would be no problem."
But they are regularly undertaken.
There are sometimes nine hours at Lariboisière's emergency.
In the ARS, thirty “dispatched” patients on several sites are not likely to represent a "agalanch" in other emergency services, which will also be strengthened by human means.
The "new hospital model" has already been defended since 7 October and that should continue to receive 30,000 to 35,000 patients per year.
As at the end of the year, liberal generalists should also be involved in the establishment of an "functional care "permanance of ambulatory care.
"Where are we going to ask people to disagrese," asks Gerald Kierzek for which "the emergency concept is no serious" and marks a "regression of medical".
This will happen as for level maternity 3.
People aren't foolish, they're going where there's the best offer of care.
If the Minister does not take a measure in this Monday, we're going to change arms, Christphe Prud Man, urgent doctor and CGT Health member.
We will be still more present in the municipal campaign and we will think to submit a list.
In the Team of Nathalie Kosciusko-Moriet, Vincent Roger, the UMP of Paris and elected from the fourth arrondation, it is clear that "because the Paris UMP was for the maintenance of emergency in the Hotel-Diu, it would be technically and financially impossible to open them if we return to responsibilities".
Anne Hidalgo, the PS candidate, again remembered Monday morning on France intercept that she was pronounced in favour of a moratorium so that there was no closure on 4 November.
If this was the case, she would mark her net disagreement, noted Bruno Julliard, her door-spring.
Even though the restructuring of the Hotel-Gou has its legitimacy on the background, we can't accept it without a acceptable report scheme to the other hospitals.
Obama aims at hearings on the World Bank and the World Bank
Barack Obama has given order to the National Security Agency (NSA) to put an end to the hearing that it had been practicing on the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in the framework of its education activities, a Thursday responsible.
This decision is part of the attempt of the White House to take the hand in the case of the hearings of the NSA after the revealings made by the former Edward Snowden analysis, refugee in Russia.
It is the first time that the monitoring of the FMI and the World Bank was mentioned by the Learning Office since the beginning of the scandale.
The question was concerned, one responsible for the American administration said: "The United States do not lead electronic monitoring on the homes of the World Bank and the MIF in Washington."
Expressed under the scene of the anonymic, the respondent did not clarify whether such monitoring was carried out by the past.
Another official said that Barack Obama had commanded to stop these practices in the past weeks.
This instruction has been given closely at the same time as it ends the hearing of the Onu General Governance in New York.
In this context, the Seminary Commission of Education approved awaiting the Governmental Monitoring Programme, but allowed their continuation.
The Commission introduced new restrictions on data allowed by the Research Agency to collect and imposed a limit of five years for the preservation of these information.
United Nations welcomes the new goals for the fight against poverty
The United Nations will now work on a new series of objectives aimed at replace the Millennium Development Goals (OMD), which had been established for 12 years ago to combat poverty in the world.
Australian diplomats have played a key role in the development of the “social development goals” aimed at replacement of WTOs, which will expire in 2015 before the United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development which started the ware in Rio de Janeiro.
They included the final project of the document, which will be adopted by the world leaders, including Ms. Gillard, during the summit.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon said to the Summit that it was now time to “transfer national interests”.
“I am glad that Member States agreed to launch and adapt the process to establish universal sustainable development objectives (ODD)”, added.
These ODD will support progress in the Millennium Development Goals and will be an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will make the maximum to meet me of the mandate which has been confided by the Member States to achieve our vision of the Goals of Sustainable Development that support the success of the WHO.
The security concern in Mozambique grows in the same time as conflicts are undertaken between powerful personalities.
At the foot of the state of Samora Machel, founder President of Mozambique, at the same time to push them, thousands of people gathered together in the Maputo centre to scann peaceful slogans in a rare public manifestation.
“We want peace to come back, and we want the stability," said Vanessa of Suusa, Director-General of an investment society.
It was concerned about the future of her country, she changed her working clothes against a tea-shirt that mentioned “We want the security” in portfolio before he joined the massed people on the place of the Independence of the Jeudian capital.
During two weeks, it has been practically all the day of the reports made conflict between the Government and the Navio, the worst increased since the peace agreement has been signed over 20 years ago.
Another time, it was a famous rebel movement, supported at the start of Rhodesia governed by white, then the Government of South Africa in the framework of efforts to detach the independent Government of the country.
After a peace agreement signed in 1992, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe that the country should not return in an open conflict, but recent events have spread for foreign investors and local population.
The enjoyment is significant for the full growth economy, since the discovery of large gas reserves of offshore and carbo gas in the north-west could take over $50 of investments in the next years from companys such as Rio Tinto, Brazil, Eni of Italy and Anadarko.
Frelime, the party to the power and the main political force since 1975, and the abuse reject each other the responsibility of tensions.
The Ombudsman states that the Government is originating the recent abortion and that he has launched an attack against his members in the province of Sofala, a traditional basis of the abuse, on 17 October.
The seats on the rebelles then degenerated when the Government forces attained the bases of the abuseo and attempted to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, and Fernando Mazanga, the Port of the Nano, according to the Financial Times.
The Government is responsible for the deterioration of conflict, and the accused of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to minimize the concerns of the instability.
Mr. Guebuza said in mercred to the AFP, the French press office, that Mr. Dhlakama was considered as a "sued" who wanted to use " all the forces he remained to try to prove that he could impose its decisions to the Government."
Frelimo and the nazaro stress that they want to avoid war.
But the concern was great after Mr Mazanga said that the Nanoo left the Peace Agreement in 1992.
He said to the FT he wanted to say that the agreement was no longer respected by the Frelimo.
“We want to take the negotiations, but with the most serious,” said Mr Mazanga.
The previous discussions between the parties have not succeeded to scatter food tensions through a series of conflicts this year.
"There are two large men (Gubuza and Dhlakama) who are not stoping disputes," explained Joseph Hanlon, an open and specialist university of Mozambique.
No one of them can do well, and no of them is ready to make the necessary concessions.
The Nanoo, who is in favour of electoral reforms, had already said that she would boycast the municipal elections before being placed in November.
The presidential and legislative elections are planned next year.
Some comments have interpreted the use of force as an attempt of a diseased movement to obtain consents and a war treasurer from the Government.
The part of the spots collected by the abdome stopped to lower since 1992, while a new party, the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) which was created by an old member of the nicko should get a greater number of suggestions to the elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Guebuza, who should take place at the end of its second mandate in the next year – wanted to destroy democracy in the country.
"He doesn't want a multipartite democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he doesn't want to leave the presidency," said Mr Mazanga.
We do not know exactly what the capacity of the abdo, but it conducted clarity attaques on police commissioners and vehicles on a major north-South author acx.
Most of the accroachs have been placed in the province of Sofala, which is located in several hundreds of kilometres north of Maputo, but where Beira is located, the mixture port, including Rio Tinto and Vale, export the carbon.
In June, Rio no longer could use iron road for about a week after the Nanoo missed to touch the rail line.
Mr. Mazanga was faultly afraid when we asked if the nervous would react this threat.
The Rename wanted “avertising the international community that things are not good to Mozambique” said Mr. Mazanga.
The instability has strengthened the frustrations resulting from the government, says Fernando Lima, the Director of Mediacoop, an independent media society, many people also concerned corruption, development leader and the latter goes away.
“The people think that the future of the country is the government and the President, and that it is the last to find solutions to the problems”, explained.
Omar Sultuane said that people would only want the stability.
“No one is concerned about the abuse or the Frelime, they just want to find peace, they want to have free access to roads” he added.
The author said that myths and legends should be taught to children as "level style of life,"
The Legende of Thor might demonstrate that “the brutal force does not make the weight faced by the sub-style Russia”, while arthurian legends reveal the importance of having a dream.
Since many myths would be "because too violent, both too false and in some cases, although too obscene to be teached at school," Crossley-Holland preconcepted a "mentionary selection" of work adapted to age.
"I find it amazing that myths, myths, and folklore are already part of education," said he.
I appreciate this project for 20 years.
He added that the fact that the authors and teachers are “allowly doctics” makes the children ‘related completely, ’ the messages are “sublimated ” in pleasant stories.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from the English-saxon and wrote The Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales, said: "You may have good intentions, but you prefer to keep them out of view."
Maybe the great difference between a adult author written for adults and an adult writer for children is the need for hope.
Not that everything should be simplified or ended well, but there is a sense of good and evil.
And it must be underlimited; revealed through a story rather than it said.
The well-known base of what it is shown and that it is not said.
A fighter of the Hamas Army Rail was killed this evening and another wounded by a Israeli carrier in the Gaza band, learned from medical and security sources in Gaza.
According to these sources, these activeists conducted a monitoring operation in the border area between the Palestinian territory and Israel when they exposed an Israeli blind.
NSA Spioning: the United States are "agained too far", adds Kerry
The United States have sometimes gone along with Europe on the Mass data collection by the National Security Agency.
After ten days of offence, revealings and disappearances between the United States and their European Alliances, it is the first time that an American government responsible is explicitly admitting practices in the interception of the NSA of communications and data in Europe.
"In some cases, I agree to you, as the President did, some of these actions have gone too far, and we will ensure that this is no longer going to the future," said John Kerry at a conference in London, to which he participated since Washington on Thursday 31 October by video connection.
In its re-transmitting intervention, at the presence of its British homologe William Hague, the head of the American diplomacy has long justified the practices of information and collection of information through the necessary anti-terrorist fight and prevention of eventually attractions.
Inviting the attents of 11 September 2001, Madrid attacks in March 2004 and London in July 2005, John Kerry assured that the American authorities had had had had had many attacks, through the interception of communications and the information collection.
"We have actually prevented aircrafts to fall, to explose immigrants and to be killed, because we were in a position to be able to be now at the top of these projects," said the patron of the American diplomacy.
And, stated John Kerry at the European address, "I assure you that in this process of innocent persons have not been stumbled."
But we try to gather information.
"Yes, in some cases, it was too far away in a way," the secretariat of State, who had already had to express on this international scandal in a week turned to Paris, London and Rome.
He assured Thursday night that President Obama was "resolved to clarify and that he processed a review of these practices so that no one feels injured."
But the controversy between Americans and Europeans continued to engage this week with new revealings in the press.
According to Washington Post, the NSA accepted hundreds of people from Google and Yahoo's users.
The newspaper, quoted documents from the former consultant of NSA Edward Snowden, states that the MUSCULAR "MUSCULAR", and conducted by the British Homology of NSA, the GCHQ, allows these two agencies to receive data from the optical fibres used by the Internet genders.
By believeing one of the documents, approximately 181 million elements were collected during the only month of January - through metadata on e-mails, text elements or audio or video documents.
These interactions would be held outside the United States.
But Yahoo and Google refused any link to these practices.
Since ten days, several large newspapers in France, Germany, Spain or Italy have revealed that the NSA would have intercepted massively data and communications from the United States and their leaders, including the German chance of Angela Merkel.
In the light of the wrath of the European States and when refugees in the American pressure said that the President was not known to such hearings, Barack Obama refused to express himself on this subject by calling national security.
On the other hand, the Master of the Power NSA, General Keith Alexander, said that his teaching agency has taken ten million communications from European citizens.
He has even sent the balloon to the European education services that would be undertaken from these communications before providing them to the NSA.
This would concern military operations in countries where these Otan Alliances cooperated with the United States and would not see Europe, said the General Alexander.
And Polymic was extended on Friday in Asia.
Indonesia has invited the Ambassador of Australia, whose mission is accused of being used by the Americans within a broad international spending network, which has also sustained the wind of China.
Paris Saint-Germain will receive Lorient on Friday without his master's attraction, Sweden Zlatan Ibrahimovic, which is blessed, announce the Ligue Club 1 in a communiqué.
The PSG, leader of the campaign before Monaco to the difference of purposes, distributed the list of new players for this 12th day match, without containing the approximately 32 years.
The communiqué just indicates that it is "batted" without exacting the nature of wound.
However, he suffered an inflammation of the left gentle in the return of election, at the beginning of a month.

For the obsèques of a neighbour, it is the inverse: the French prevailed inhumation (53% against 47%).

There is, with the creation, " a violence made to the loved body," which will be "reducted to a census" in very little time, and not after a decomposition process, which would "combine the phases of the duty".
There are also " symbolic violence", which holds on "effectiveness of unity and distinctional signs" reduced to the "anonymat" of census.
Why is that without pain accepted in some northern and protestants countries, is it still bad in France?
"Because the creation is a new fact," Mary-Frederica Bacqué, President of the Society of Queenology and author of the book Appreciated the death.
It is tolerated only since 1963 by the Catholic Church, which has limited the attempts to appreciate it.
To approve the creation, it is for François Michaud-Norard, Director-General of the Services of the Ville of Paris, preveal for the deficiency of a ceremonium as worthy of which he would have right with an inhumation.
The annual investigation of Ipsos shows a very strong attachment to the organization of the ceremonium.
77% of the French in wanting one, for their neighbours, to be religious (53%), or civil (24%).
Today, 73 per cent of those who have chosen a creature wished to organize a ceremonium.
66% of the athletes or not believers are also wanted.
Crematoriums have been adapted to this evolution of society.
"In a decade of years, they strive to avoid family violence of an expectation, without doing anything for a hour and half, immediately following the census remission," Mr. Michaud-Nareard noticed.
70% of the institutions are now proposing ceremonium masters, which, in the presence of the body, proceeding to the following ritual: welcome the congregation, notice the disappearance, relaxing the others, advocating it, to give sense to his death, to organize the divine.
That's the creatorium of the Father Lachaise, since 1998.
Ceremonium masters are often people who have recovered themselves.
There are also old Catholic priests.
In this context, the creatorium of the Father Lachaise organizes, since 2010, the day of La Toussaint, several ceremonies of memory, lays and non-religious, which he invites the families of persons who have been created in the year.
For the second year pursuant, one of these ceremonies is transmitted bondly, at the attention of those who could not make the movement.
The Crematorium has allowed us to refer to this.

Ben Greenman : Sixth anniversary of New York Wiedy Festival: The New Yorker
It could be said that the city of New York is the place where the stand-up was born in America. It was almost 100 years ago, the Vaudeville Actor Frank Fay, who took the role of ceremonial master's role in the Palace Theatre, on Broadway, began to tell blagues directly before the public, on the tone of conversation.
Fay's innovation has continued to be recently resumed by New York Comody Festival.
Creed and supervised by Caroline Hirsch, the founder of the stand-up club of Carolines, the celebration of its tenth anniversary this year, with more than 60 shows presented in small clubs and large theaters.
"Much of the heads of show were emerging to Caroline, and they have known a great success, until they become too famous to play in a club," he said Hirsch.
We have created this festival in order to continue working with them.
The event of this year will see the participation of Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher and the presentation of “Stuit up for Heroes”, a come and music evening for the benefits of the older fighters, organized at Madison Square Garden, which will be present, among others, Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.

Jenny Silla participated in the emission "Saturday Night Live" and made part of the casting series "Parks and Recreation", but it is still more known for its series of viral videos "Marcel the Shell with Shoes On".
Kroll and Slate, as well as other young comedias to the individual voice (the badest superrealist Anthony Jeselnik, the Ironic Defender of Racial Justice W. Kamau Bell), are clean products from the world decentralized from the American Commission.
One of the major attractive factors of the festival this year will be an interview: David Steinberg discussing with Larry David.
Steinberg started as a stand-up Commander, but it became a cinema and television realistor, as well as a official history of the come.
Between 2005 and 2007, he encouraged a TV country emission that was called "Sit Down Comody with David Steinberg".
The rent is located in the Ville Hotel, in the center of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the Comic DNA of Larry's work," said Steinberg.
He said to me that when he was here, sometimes he was down a rock between two immune and he said, "Well, if I lose my whole money, maybe I'm going to live here."

Remitted on the right to an appointment in Texas
A Federal Appeal Core retained some restrictions to the right of voluntary interruption of grossity which had been blocked by a judge of first instance in the week.
This judgment means that a law text adopted in July and that widely refers to the right to the abort will be able to enter into force.
The sentence by the calling court means that the doctors who will practice IVG must have a "admission Privilege" at local hospitals.
The authorisation privileges is the right of a doctor, under its drug member status of a hospital, to admit a patient to a hospital or a medical centre to deliver it diagnostic or treatment.
The IVG defenders say that the content of the law is risked to be conducted by an immediate closure of a third of the State clinics because these clinics have not been able to obtain this "admissive Privilege" for their practicals.
In total, it would be about 22,000 women who would be private from access to these institutions.
Lundi, a judge of first instance was assigned to the introduction of the law that the provisions concerned by the admission privilege were anti-constitutional.

The cour locks a decision on the NYPD control and pollution policy
A Federal Call Core has blocked Thursday the decision of a judge that requires changes in the New York police programme for monitoring and bottleing and police department and the deployment of the dossier.
The United States Call Core (two round) indicated that the decision of the judge Shira Scheindlin was suspended until the town interjected appeal.
The judge had stated in August that the city had violated the Constitution pursuant to its implementation of its programme to monitor and investigate citizens.
The city called for its correct conclusions and orders, including a decision to grant a supervisor to help the Department of Police to amend its policy and training programme.
The calling court heard on Tuesday arguments on the request of suspension.
The Court of Appeal stated that the judge should be detained from the case because it has released the code of conduct of judges by imposing the need for a judge to avoid any appearance of partiality, partly because of a series of intertainers granted to the media and public statements in which it is publicly reacting to the Criminal crisis.
The judge stated that police officers violated civil rights of ten thousands of persons by targeting the offence of black and Spanish men under their control and flock programme.
It has designed an external controller to monitor the changes, including the policy reform, training and monitoring, and has ordered the establishment of a pilot program to test cameras on the body in the villages where the largest number of controls is discovered.
In August, the city of New York agreed to put an end to the practice consisting of maintaining names and addresses of persons who were rejected after police control.
Audience of the town interjected call should have been placed after 14 March 2014.
Many civil rights defenders have been criticised by the tactics of the control and clash.
This system of control and flue exists since decades in a certain form, but the number of recorded controls has increased in a spectcular manager under the administrative of the independent Maire Michael Blomberg, to reach its highest historic level in 2011 with 684 330 controls regarding mainly black men and Spanish origin.
A judicial action was introduced in 2004 by four men, all of the minorities, and turned into collective action.
The NYPD stakeholders who are working for changes in the NYPD control and flag programme say that they will end the wrong practices, will allow you to have more effective police forces and trust them, and can change how police departments are used from the policy.
Opposers say that these changes would minimize police morals without decrease criminality, represent money playing and would not solve the largest problem of police forces under pressure after the police effects have been strongly reduced during the last decade.
The judge emphasized that it did not end the constitutional practices of control and fraud, but that it reformed the way the NYPD undertake its controls.
Locators must go to vote, because each of them pay average $100 per month on the housing price which goes in taxes to the Ville.
When the owner pays $5000 in municipal taxes, he divides this amount between each accommodation.
We are obliged to increase lowers to help us pay the new taxes.
When voted, we sent a clear message.
We need to change things to the Ville.
All candidates told us that they would touch the scandalous debt.
We don't have the means to pay a 100 000 dollars arts fires, from 4 to 5 million in case where...
Let's vote, it's the best way to express you and say that it's enough.

Coulson used the telephone piratage to check a tube

The Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC declared to the court of the Old Bailey that news of the World had heard a fair ruler in May 2005 according to which Clarke had a relationship with Hannah Pawlby, its “Special Adviser”.
It was reported at the core that the newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire, a private detective, to pirate Pawlby's vocal box and to "Pwlby standing in front of his door," but Coulson also called him and left him vocal messages.
"The accused suggests that Mr Coulson, who is now the Head of NotW, is not the man's man's man to stay before the house of people waiting for surrounding them, is the man's kind of love to present the story to see what they say," said Mr. Edis.
He stated that NotW used three ways to investigate the subjects: telephone piratage, monitoring and confrontation.
The Chief Director is personally involved in the third.
It is obvious that it is on the second, monitoring, it cannot be otherwise.
But what's the first?
Does he know the telephone piratage?
He states the contrary, but we say, “because it is. ”
The rumors on an impliant connection Clarke were first repaird by the NotW editing office when a source, testing sexual attraction to Ms. Pawlby, said that "Don't lose your time with her, she's with Charles."
A band, on which the vocal messages were recorded on its telephone at at least three times, was entered in Mulcaire home in August 2006.
The investigators also found imports on the computer of the private detection concerning Ms. Pawlby and his sister run in a "Projects" folder.
During the period in which the detective had enacted it, Ms. Pawlby had received anonymous calls for them, added Mr. Edis.
Inter-times, the former reporter in Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup oversee the monitoring of minor facts and businesses by Ms. Pawlby.
In a vocal message he left him on 18 June 2005, Coulson said: "I have a story that we prefer to publish tomorrow, with which I would really like to talk to Charles."
Mr. Edis explained that the implication of Coulson in the history followed the same scheme as with other important men, such as the former Minister of the Interior David Blunkett.
The jury heard that Coulson had confronted Mr. Blunkett with a married woman while she had frequently married Rebekah Brooks co-defence, who was also married at this time.
Coulson and Brooks have not been concentrated with others to pirate telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted the telephone piratage.

M23, or a few hundreds of warrants, were relaxed at about 2000 meters of height on the agricultural collines of Chanzu, Runionyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and Jomba, two places located at about 80 km to the north of Goma, the capital of the North Kivu province.
"There was not stopped since this morning, the battle continued evening night," said the AFP, a resident of Jomba, joined by telephone to 12:30, and a girl was wounded by balloon at the morning.
"The attractions intensity has reduced a bit," he added, "it seems that the FARDC armed forces of the RDC have revitaled the rebelles."
According to this witness that wished to stay anonymous, the soldiers had "passed night" to Jomba before moving on the front for a "rating operation".
It was very nice to hear behind him of the dark creatures of light weapons.
From Bunagana, the five political and last strong place of the married rebellion, a journalist of the AFP could hear hard weapons detonations.
According to a source for the United Nations Mission for the stability of the CRD, the fights were "for a final phase", the FARDCs "involving the residual M23 positions to deploy them."
Since the resume, Friday, comparisons between the Mouvement of 23 March (M23) and the Army, Monusco is not directly involved in fighting, but provides Government troops a decisive support for education, monitoring and planning.
At the end of the afternoon, several ten of soldiers, well-approximately in munitions, went up towards the front line.
They were army of kalachnikov and lance rockets.
A little later, on the road leading to Bunagana, post-border with Uuganda, military helped civilians charged a multi-roquet lance on a new FARDC trip, to ensure the resumption of another engin that pioneered the M23 positions on the hills.
The Congolese President, Joseph Kabila, once again called the rebelles to "demobilisate voluntary" in difficulty to be dearned by the force, but opened the Kampala process, where Kinshasa and M23 discussed since December without result.
At the same time, M23 political leaders hope to reach agreement.
"We have completed the talks, but the Ugandaese media to organize the signature," said Roger Lumbala, Vice-President of the delegation of M23, without that this information could be confirmed immediately from the Government.
M23 was born from a monstery in April 2012 of old rebels, mainly completed, integrated in the army in 2009 after a peace agreement.
United Nations and Kinshasa regularly accused the Uganda and Rwanda to support M23, which is Kigali and Kampala.
North-Kivu is one of the most deeply delicate RDC regions, and its sub-region of concurrent minor resources.
In Bunagana, on the organese side of the border, where approximately 5000 people were fought between Monday and Wednesday, the return movement to the RDC, which had been placed in the morning, turned to the mid-day.
"The morning we went back to go into our fields, but the military told us to reply," said Imelda Nyirankusi, around his nine children, a nourrisson on the dose.

The musical come, this scene animal
Classic, sophisticated, popular, English or French productions canded and dance take their ball.
After Broadway and London, Paris finally found his voice.
It's a revolution: French musical is revealed as a successful kind.
Long time, from Our Dame from Paris to Mozart the rock opéra, most of the tentatives were impressed in the ridiculous.
And successful as Cabaret or The Miserable were taking the auree of the mystery.
The arrival of Jean-Luc Choplin to Châtelet and Stage Entertainment to Mogador has changed the woman.
Today, these two scenees have titles like successful tubes.
The first reception, this Christmas, her excellent My Fair Lady and announces for the next world creation of "Un American in Paris".
In Mogador, "La Belle and the Best" might be one of the success of the season.
On the other scenes, musical spectrums such as "1789", "Bastille's friends" and small musical comeds such as " Disco" or "Life and Times" stand at the diapason of success and quality.
Patrick Niedo, author of the reference book "Story of Musical Comeds" and confidence to the Catholet Teacher, analyzes the reasons for success so hardly acquired.
How do French musical comeds develop?
The offer has been demultilled.
First, there are the "music spectrums" that are evolving most of the producers...
Some use beautiful image projects and a real story such as in 1789, the Bastille's friends.
Others are a 15-year-old lounge back in a pretext that we can serve at little any time when we have Matt Pocora's head.
Afterward, we have musical comeds with the sustainable productions of the Châtelet who make us live the gold age of Broadway and discover the universe of Stephen Sondheim, the most living composer.
Stage Entertainment popularised of English musical comeds of diversity in French adapting them.
Independent French producers have a perceived.
But projects carried out as "Rent", "The Baiser of the Advocate Women" or "The Year of Press" have to be funded.
Have we enough capable artists like Broadway cantor, play and dancing?
In Paris, when there are eight music shows in a season, it's a great year.
We have 200 talent artists that turn projects in projects.
In the United States, the beverage of the musical commission is very different.
Teenagers are formed in many schools.
Employment is many among regional theaters, tourned, Broadway, off-Broadway...
The living of talents is so that the number of posts to be tackled.
Why are they turned to the province so much successful?
In the exception of the opéra, the province remains the poor parents of the culture in France.
Many of theatre's teater cut into tour and is often bolevard theatre for adults and not young adults.
Music shows complicate this lack.
These are the same young ones who love television and what she produces as ephod stars...
Proposing young men (such as talentous) in the head of a musical spectacle, is the insurance of these young girls and often of their entire family.
Facebook pages of these shows are freely held by professionals that respond to questions.
These shows are very expected when they come to a Zenith of Province.
Maonnaise is mounted to Paris and degraded by the province.
The show is designed to enter into all the large rooms of France in the same form as in Paris.

The Congolese army was prepared on Friday to a new seat against the latest foundations of the rebelles of the M23 at Bunagana, in East of the RDC.
The goal is to deploy the M23 of the colleagues over Bunagana.
Here, we took Bugina's hill, which over the Mbuzi.
Today, Mbuzi's got to get on herself.
It'll be left only Runyonyi's hill.
"Celle de Chanzu is not very strategic," said the AFP, North Kivu, Julien Paluku.
Mr. Paluku provides a week to Bunagana.
Five political and last strong place of the refusal, this location is located at the Ugandais border, about 80 km to the north of Goma.
It was resumed by the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
Since a few hundreds of air-reductive M23 are retained at about 2.000 metres of altitude on the agricultural collines of Chanzu, Runionyi and Mbuzi, near Bunagana and the neighbourhood of Jomba
In Jomba, a resident who had made wars all the next Thursday showed that the situation was "calm since this morning".
According to him, a woman and his child were killed by the veil fight and were buried.
A girl was wounded by the ballo, and three other persons were wounded, with a grief, evacuated by the FARDC, added this witness from the AFP.
Since the recovery of FARDC and the rebels on 25 October, the two warriors had no balance of loss in human lives.
The NSA reveals increase the paranoia of undertakings regarding State monitoring
By a beautiful day of August, a German police helicopter overlooked the British Adviser of Francfort, Germany's financial capital.
On the order of the Federal Protection Office of the Constitution (BfV), the German Information Agency was a photographer of the US's prior post, situated at at least 5 km from the European Central Bank and from the Federal Bank.
The German media explain that the BFV hoped to identify the presence of audiences and that the operation has undertaken a exchange between the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clapper, manager of American education services, reiterated in September that the United States do not use for foreign education capacity to “flowing the industrial secrets of foreign undertakings for the account of American companies to increase their international competitiveness or to increase their benefits”.
But since Edward Snowden, the consultant became a denonceer, began to distribute its inevitable trend of information on the secrets of monitoring the United States, European Governments and business leaders no longer know if the Director must believe on the word.
Reports, as reported by the National Security Agency of the Brazilian Petrolial Petrol Society and had access to data detained by American storage services providers in the Cloud, including Google and Yahoo, have been more than ever sustained by the paranoia of undertakings regarding State monitoring.
The revealing that the German chance telephone Angela Merkel had been pirated, perhaps even for a decade, was the water wheel that made the vacuum to cut.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be considered, business leaders are certainly also potential objectives.
Snowden transpared the intensive cooperation between American education services and businesses.
I believe that these data can be used in their mutual interest.
“ Germany must rise up,” says Oliver Green, President of BITMi, representing the German SMEs of the IT sector.
The German societys believe that the United States represent a very important risk as China when it is industrial and flight, according to a investigation published in July by the EY Board Chain.
However, in all documents issued by Mr. Snowden, there is nothing that the United States had transmitted foreign business secrets to American companies.
Political men were concerned about the idea that the EU does not have sufficient information and Internet capacity and believe that it should be able to reduce its dependence in the United States.
Business leaders are sceptical on this matter.
A deputy of the German parliament says we should create a Google German.
I can only close the eyes and open them slowly...
"It's not the good way to do", says Hasso Plattner, President of the German company's software society, SAP.
If we wanted a strong European IT industry, then it should not have died before 20 years ago.
Everything is subvented in Germany, from car to cars, passing through farmers.
Only the IT industry.
However, the expansion and sustainability of the American spy-spionage agencies expressed by the Snowden's revealings was a chocolate for some undertakings who thought that China was the largest risk in the terms of monitoring.
A major change is to be done in cloud information because European licensers have taken aware of the fact that the data stored in the United States are regulated under the laws of this jurisdiction and therefore potentially vulnerable.
According to a investigation carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance, some 10 per cent of the non-American members refused their projects to use a US store service provider in the cloud after revealing the Prism Exploitation Program.
Jim Snabe, Co-director of SAP, says: "Our customers today ask us a question that they couldn't have us a year ago: where my data are stored and can you ensure me that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction?"
Many German leaders indicate that the latest reports are only a confirmation of what they already knew, namely that the powerful states want to fly their most precious secrets and that these data should therefore be kept at all prices.
It is not surprising that there is economic immigration.
There's always been it.
“It's a recurrent subject for many years, and it's not essentially changed in the current debate”, Kurt Bock, Director-General of the Chemical Producer Society of BASF.
The Americans express us on the commercial and industrial plan, as we are, because it is in national interest to defend our companies.
Business leaders are usually little to reveal the prevention measures they have established, in the case that would allow the benefit to an adversary.
The large enterprises march for a long time the message that it is at least prevented to recover a free USB key in a professional room or to leave a portable computer without supervision in a hotel room.
Ulrich Hackenberg, member of the Administration Council of the Audi car constructor, states that the collection of portable phones before the meetings of the Council, so that they can't be used as remote audience devices, is a current practice for years.
The BfV of Germany advises its leaders to consider use of simple port phones prepayed during their journeys to the foreign due to the risk of waiting for the integrity of smartphones.
Prepayed port phones are then thrown.
However, we are afraid that small and medium-sized enterprises remain vulnerable to the piratage and monitoring.
In Germany, a lot of PME are global leaders in their special neck.
“BMs often lack experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect their industrial secrets against unlimited access”, the BFV report.
The United States advise their own societys on the activities of economic explosion carried out by other countries.
The National Intelligence Intelligence (NIE) carried out in February by the United States, quoted France, as Russia and Israel, in the second ability to carry out economic piratage acts, behind China, according to The Washington Post.
One member of the German advice Board of a named German society believed that when it is economic immigration, "the French are the worst."
Bernard Squarcini, the former French Release Director, DCRI, said in a maintenance in this month: “DGs will be perfectly well known that all countries, even if they cooperate in the fight against terrorism, reflect their alliances”.
The parents of a adolescent in Georgia, who died in in insufficient circumstances, think that their children were killed
The parents of a adolescent of Georgia, whose body was found in a rocked guard in the gymnase of his lycée, thinking that their children were killed, said the lawyer of the Jeudian family.
Kendrick Johnson, from Valdosta in Georgia, was found on 11 January in a supported box behind the roads of the gymnase of his lycée.
The investigators of the Committee of Lowdens concluded that Johnson was decayed in insufficient circumstances, but the family of the young boy 17-year-old contested these conclusions.
“There are absolutely some of their sons were killed” said Benjamin Crump, avocate of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, on FoxNews.com.
They never thought he was dead as it was indicated in the conclusions of the shelter.
“These think that this challenges any logic, physical laws and common sense," added Crump.
They are convinced that these conclusions were made in the only purpose of covering the persons responsible for the death of their sons.
“They sent their sons to school with a card and brought it to them into a dead sac," he added.
The United States Prosecutor Michael Moore said Thursday he conducted an official investigation on the death of Johnson, noting that several important questions remain without answer.
What's the cause of death?
Is it the result of a criminal act?
Moore was expressed during a press conference after midnight.
I'm going to follow the facts where they're going.
My goal is to discover the truth.
"I believe there is sufficient basis" to open an official investigation, said he.
Moore said to the journalists that the first autopsie indicated that Johnson was died by “aphyxia positive. ”
However, a second autopsie has identified another cause of death, according to Moore.
"Individual questions ask a response or a confirmation," said he.
Moore added that if he currently sets the nature elements to justify a civil or criminal investigation on the death of Johnson, he would request the FBI to conduct it.
The representative of the office of the Lowdens Chamber was not available to give us his opinion when we contacted it on Thursday.
A South Georgia Judge commanded the authorities to submit all the video supervisory records that the investigators had reviewed.
The parents of the adolescent said they hoped that the video images contained indices on the circumstances of his death.
The CDC publises allergy advice on children at schools
Mercredi, the American Monitoring and Prevention Centre has published a series of directives which indicate how to manage children ' s food allergies at school.
This is the first series of guidelines which the United States Government published, since the number of children in school age suffering food allergies has been strongly grimped.
A child is about 20 in the United States today suffers of food allergie.
The CCD found that the prevalence of food allergies in the child has increased from 18 per cent between 1997 and 2007.
The guide contains information for schools on how to know the professional body and the food allergies in the child and on the way to treat them in the case of allergic reaction.
It also recommends the schools to have an epinephrine stock – EpiPen brand injector as the most strictly used – to react quickly in cases of death anaphylaxie.
The State legislative meetings have recently updated the regulations to allow schools to make more easier than stock epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported by children who have an allergic reaction.
Children may say, "I have the impression that something I like the language," "I have the impression of having a horse in the language" or "I have a picot in the language."
The NSA case stresss that the total absence of discussion on recruitment
How does the contrary attitude of the French government, which is publicly offset by the ambassador of the United States on 21 October, and the other prohibited the surrounding of the territory by the Bolivian presidential airport, on the basis of the ruler of the presence at its border of Edward Snowden?
I say, there are two response levels of the French government.
When François Holland's phone in Barack Obama or when the Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius invites the Ambassador of the United States, they respond to a true discovery, which is the expansion of the United States monitoring over all communications in France.
Isn't it surprising reading in the world's columns for a few weeks of intervalle on a part the reproduction of the American diplomatic match and, on the other hand, a condemnation of the hearings of the Quai of Orsay by the NSA?
Didn't it be like a vague hypocrisis on your side?
The newspaper is not a moral position, but the search for the interest and maintenance of information that allows each citizen to make a view.
When WikiLeaks takes the scene on the analysis by the American diplomacy of political and others around the world, we believe that, in view of the American power, this is an important clarification.
When we describe the United States interview systems against French diplomacy in the United States, it is not in any case to describe this practice, it is to describe the world as it is.
Does France benefit from information provided by the NSA on terrorist operations on our interests?
Can we take care of the American cooperation?
The establishment for large 10 years of highly powerful technological interception tools by the United States but also by France has been officially justified by combating terrorism.
Furthermore, in this area, France and the United States have established almost daily cooperation and exchange of information, which are described on the part and other as essential.
For example, Mohammed Merah's presence in tribal areas in Miranshah was reported to French through NSA's means.
For example, France may be conducted to transmit all data blocks on the Sahel region to the United States services, and, in contrapartitely, it has been said, the Americans can provide information to France on other regions of the world.
So the question of the NSA is not both the capacity or the right of the countries to make interception tools, that the issue of the absence of the total pre-debate, particularly within Parliaments, on the justification of such systems, the period that must be to them, and, finally, the question of attainment to freedoms.
What are really risking the United States and a degradation of their image?
We've been happy to deny them, I don't see how they can be punished.
The cutting risk of the Americans may be double.
The first, it is when their allegeds - and that was the recent - it learns that their leaders, sometimes at the highest sum of their State, were monitored.
This is the case of Brazil and Germany, two countries where diplomatic relations with the United States have been held.
Another economic effect may be: more European or South America enterprises, in light of revealings, make their confidential data to US providers subject to the American laws, and therefore the NSA's company.
The following elements: the wide reveal movement of the world's media, which contributes to a debate on the practices of supervision of education services to almost insecurity, could be able to make the lawyers, including Americans, to recover the powers they have given to their education services.
Parents of children with intersection may choose “undetermined sex”
Germany has become the first European national to recognize a third sex for birthings with ambiguous sex bodies.
Gender or female of new births will not be granted, rigidly, to birth.
In the context of the new law, parents will not be able to declare the sex of their child, authorize them to inscrire a sex " undetermined" or "not specified" on its birth certificate.
The goal of the law was to remove the pressure of parents that could take decisions on sexual resignation surgery for their nourrisson, and to combat discrimination against intersected persons.
According to the BBC, one intersexued person would say for years later, “I am neither a man nor a woman. ”
I'll stay the patch work that the doctors have created, constitioned and balphé.
It's thinking that a kid is born about 20,000 every year, not a boy or a girl.
They are intersexempt, the intersexuality of the group of diagnosed diseases such as diagnosed sex development, a general term designing persons who have chromosomes or gonades (ovenary or tests) a typical or anormally developed sexual bodies.
Wallis Simpson could have been intersected.
Sexual identification is not always understood but most of the specialists in the United States say that when sex cannot be determined, it is better to use the best available information to grant it, then to wait and follow the psychological and physical development of the child before considering a chirurgic act, where appropriate.
Dr. Jack Drescher, psychiater in New York and Specialistic on sexual identification issues, said that the new German law “the new law seems to be a good idea”.
Children intersection have an ethical dilemma.
“A number of people suffer extremely serious diseases that require chirurgic acts, but it is not the case of most children” he added.
It is possible to make a sexual appointment without operation, and to see how the identity is developed.
Science that consists of knowing how a child will develop sexual identity is not very precise.
No one can answer the question why this happens.
It's like the mystery around homosexual people.
A report submitted to the European Commission in 2011 described the persons intersexused as different from transsexual or transgenous persons, as their status is not related to sex but rather to their biological constitution, which is not exclusively the person or the one of a woman, but is generally the two in the same time and not clearly defined as one or another.
These characters may be demonstrated in secondary sex characters (e.g. muscular mass, pilosure, petroleum and statury), primary sexual characters (e.g. reproductors and sexual organs) or the structure of chromosomes and hormones.
The report also provided a view of discrimination to which inter-sexempt and transgenous persons in the field of employment, and the increase of acts of harcing and violence and crimes motivated by prejudiced.
Youth boys now have non-conformed camps that are specially designed to them.
Australia and Nepal have already authorized adults to incorporate gender, female or third sex on their official documents.
In June, an Australian of 52 years, Norrie May-Welby, became the first person in the world to have been recognized "nether" after gaining his proceedings in call that authorizes it to keep a “non-specified” sex.
The German passports will contain a third design on the side of M or F – X for intersecute, according to the Ministry of the Interior.
In the neighborhood of France, genre issues are still subject to contradictions, according to a report issued by France 24.
In 2011, thirteen lawyers of the Catholic country have signed a penitation that “theorie of Genes” should be repealed from school books.
The American Catholic Online site also opposed the German law, writeing that “for the world is transferred into a new kingdom where the genre is a choice but where sexual activity is not one, there are two other pills of civilization.”
In Maryland, the mother of a nourrisson also said about Baby Zone that she would prefer a sex to be granted to the children to their birth.
“ Mother’s role is sufficiently stressing without additional restrictions, particularly if you don’t know the sex of your child”, she said on the site for young parents.
Children need stability and security.
Historyly, children born without male or female organs were called hermaphrodites, according to the name of the great Greek divine, who had a double sex.
And so often there was a ten years ago, the medical community considered the same as a flame, that it can be exacerbated and on which we can resume.
But now, many are those who reiterate the ethical foundation of the chirurgy, knowing that sexual identity is complex and that sometimes the doctors can argue, not knowing how a child will feel their sexual resignation when he grows.
“ In the mid-eighth century, it was called a psychiatric emergency, ” said Drescher.
When these children were naked, they were not called the psychiater, they were phoned to the chirurgian.
The dominant theory on the way to treat children of ambiguous sex organs was launched by Dr. John Money, of the University of Johns-Hopkins, who believed that the genre is malicious.
He provided the term “sexual identity” and supported that social and environmental signs – the way the parents are taking up a child – interact with the gentlemen and the hormones of a child in order to be identified as sex or female.
But in an case of 1966, known under the name of John/Joan, his theories were made against.
He had advised the parents of a young boy whose penis had been cut in an encircled circumcision to cast it allly, and he also leaving the testicules, and to remove it as a girl.
"Monney has presented this as a case of successful transition, but that was not the case," said Drescher.
In the age of about 15, he returned a boy and married a woman.
But in 38 years, he was murdered.
Drescher said that some doctors “repeat this model always. ”
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of Internet, those who have survived these sex change operations say “[when] are not satisfied with the result.”
This is the case of Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old of Montana, who is born with male XY chromosome but sexy organs.
The doctors couldn't really say whether he had a wide climate or a small penis and were convinced that he could never have a "friendly life" as a man.
So a little time after his birth in 1976, Bruce brought up a chirurgic abruption of the external organ and witnesses and was high as a girl.
He took female hormones for 12 years.
"I knew I was not a girl," said he about ABCNews.com.
I wasn't happy, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
In 18 years, he made a vaginoplastic.
But depressed and noted that something was not going, he asked his medical dossier.
What he discovered is horrified.
I was stored at the birth, and no one ever told me.
Bruce is born with a disorder of sexual development (DDS) which has prevented its body to produce sufficient textiles so that its sexual bodies could be developed.
After learning the truth, he returned a man, following treatment to texts and was removed the bottles.
The chirurgy made him struggle.
Today, he defends the cause of others in a project interface, called in an interface organization, which is trying to normalize the perception of intersexued persons.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, General Directorate of the Non-Government Organization based on California Advocates for Reportd Choice, fears that the German law “invites the label and stigmatization”.
“Multius activeists are concerned that the German law encourages parents to take rapid decisions and give their children a sex "indétermined" said.
We fear that it encourages interventions.
We think it would be better to grant a male or a female sex, and to wait.
But we have not seen what the law would give, so we can only advance hypothesis.
Tamar-Mattis said that his organization supports Australian law because " it allows adults to choose to be recognized under the third sex calling."
“ adults should take their own decisions concerning legal kinds” he added.
The German law concerns the appointment of sex to birth.
It is not a battle that young children should lead to this age.
When they grow up, they can take decisions concerning their own body.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, specialized radiologue in the Mamografies in Pittsburgh, whose girl is affected by disorders of sexual development and helping thousands of people in a support group, said that the German law will be responsible for parents and children.
Dr. Baratz, Katie, is born with male chromosoms, but suffers of a DDS-s syndrome called full insensiveness to ironics.
Following its receptors of androgenes, Katie has developed female characteristics.
She's got a vagina, but not an urge or an earlier.
At the age of 29, Katie is married and internal in child psychiatric at Pennsylvanie University.
Although it is slow, it hopes to have children through adoption services or portuous mothers.
“The law leaves a certain latitude to the parents so that they have no punishable decisions," said Baratz.
This allows them to make some tests and understand them, and a time before inscriving "Man" or "feminin".
So, it's okay - you can choose your child and love him.
You have a great baby and enjoy the pleasure of being parents.
You don't have to push you for an incredible intervention.
“It brings children into the heart of the decision and demonstrates the feeling of anxiety that moving the parents because they fear not to do what needs to be done” she said.
Finally, the child will decide with what sex he/she feels the more on the ground – and it's something formable.
This allows the child to take the decision for himself.
The confidence of his Government's long-term license
The President of the Italian Council Enrico Letta judges that his Government will hold up until 2015, notwithstanding the strong tensions between the left and the right within the coalition at the approach of the Senate vote to discover Silvio Berlusconi of its mandate.
In a daily interview The print, the leader of the left centre said to have "effectively the intention" to continue to rule with its coalition until the next legislative elections of 2015.
The High Chamber of the Italian Parliament will be held in the current month to decide the type of the former President of the Council condemned for fiscal fraude in August.
Silvio Berlusconi is threatening to retire its support to the Government if the Senate, where he accounts more adversaries than parties, pronounces its destitution.
But a part of his camp, gathered around the National Secretariat of the Peuple of Liberty (PDL) Angelino Alfano, continued to support the government, as the Government had demonstrated its refusal to cease to Berlusconi's injections who wanted to have already shot the cabinet.
The L.A. Times reports that a United States Safety Agency Agency, TSA, and a suspect has been wounded during the exchange of fire cuts.
Pumpers called on the drame places claimed to have responded to a call stated by "Multiple wounded".
"The order forces are on place", explains the airport on its Twitter account, while TV images showed people evacuated in ambulances.

Report: The Obama campaign seems to be locked by Beden for Hillary Clinton
The most closer advisers of President Barack Obama in the secret to replace Vice-President Joe Biden by Hillary Clinton on the 2012 list, according to New York Times.
This revealing is the most marking event containing in the very expected book of the 2012 campaign Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
Times received a copy of the book to observe and told the Thursday night that the neighbours of the Chairman had conducted “developed work in groups and dreams final 2011” to see whether the Biden Evaluation could help Obama in order to resolve the hopes.
According to the corresponding policy of Times Jonathan Martin, the book provides a detailed analysis of the work of the high-chairs of the campaign and of the Maison-Blanche, namely the old secretariat of the Maison-Blanche Bill Daley, to measure what effect the replacement of the Vice-President by the old secretary of State Clinton could have on the scrutin.
The possibility of exchange is a secret that has been strictly kept within the Chicago CG campaign and within the Ocean Office.
Only half thirty-duuzaine advisers from the President – including Daley, the former campaign Chief of Obama Jim Mesina and the elders of the Maison-Blanche David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew that the change was in the study.
"Double Double Down" indicates that Daley has carried out the charge to replace Biden, despite their 'related personal links' before finally decided to change when the figures showed that in the presidential list, "neetheless improvement of Obama's success opportunities."
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the administration had actually considered to replace Biden by Clinton.
"I said I was considering a series of questions, and it was one of them," said Daley in the newspaper.
Do you understand that at this time the President was not formally, and so we said, "Lord, what can we do?"
As Daley had qualified the review of "consolided", Martin told Anderson Cooper of CNN that the election campaign had much invested to discover whether the change would be profitable at the scrutin.
"The campaigns are not a lot of money for their surveys and discussion groups unless they consider seriously to take measures," said Martin on AC360.
However, we don't know whether Obama was in the fact that his team considered the replacement.
Martin said about CNN he asked Daley if his boss was on the case of the eventual refund.
Although Daley said he was not thinking that the President was "the current" of the possibility change, the former secretary-General admitted that it was "a possibility" that Obama had known.
Martin added that Double Down Down't respond to the question of whether the political songs had occurred on the Obama Office.
Cooper asked Martin if he was seriously thinking that Obama did not know that Biden's evasion of the presidential list was considered.
“ Maybe, ” answered Martin.
Do you want a flower glass?
A British entrepreneur created the first fluorescent glass world-based medal.
Charlie Francis took part of the fluorescent properties of this marine animal to develop lightning collection.
It was the idea that after reading a study on the meds, he convinced Chinese scientists to recover a chimical protein.
The glass crystal reacts with the language by enlarging the protein pH to make it light.
Chris explains that, since the glasses starts to learn when she reacts to the hot of the mouth, more laughs, more it becomes brilliant.
Charlie, the founder of the glass society "Lick Me I'm Delicious," said, "It's something incredible but we're still only at the beginning of production, and 2 g of this thing costs about 200 £ ."
The protein that we use in the glass reacts with the pH neutral language.
So when your mouth rehass the protein, the pH level increases and the glass starts to light.
We tested it over the past months and it seemed like to share it with all at Halloween's time because she gives a brillant effect.
It's probably the sweetest glass I created because the meds lightness is four times more than gold.
So every bucket costs me about 140 pounds.
But she's pretty good!
The company at the experimental start of Charlie, based in Bristol, is known for its inhabitable glass, such as beverage, dining, eggs and gold sheet.
But his next creation is more ambitious.
He added: “I really want to develop an invisible glass.”
It is intrinsously impossible because of the refraction caused by the glass crystals that represent the glass crystal, but I think I'll find a way to get there.
The glass uses fluorescent properties of the synthesis made by Chinese scientists.
Lou Reed died during a meeting of yours who
The cantor Lou Reed died while he did your chiuses, revealed his wife Laurie Anderson in a letter published by the Regional magazine "East Hampton Star" and appointed for the inhabitants of the city of Springs, where the couple had a house.

Halloween 2013 : Endigits
When I was little, Halloween was magic.
My sister and I were allowed to eat goods, to go to sleep later and leaving us to go into the neighborhood.
Today, I've become more tired.
The last two years, I haven't distributed one goodbon, and I will certainly not do it this year anymore.
But the states show that I'm the galliant flock when we talk about Halloween.
The majority of the Americans – in fact 158 million of them – will celebrate Halloween this year, paying a total of $6.9.9 in goods, declines and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation.
What I'm waiting for with compatience at every party of Halloween, these are the trends.
The detrimentation should represent $1,2 Md for the expenditure of $6,9 billion, according to NRF.
This year, inanimated sex objects are grieved.
Women need no longer to be sexy professionals; they may also be sexy foods such as pizzas, hamburgers and carottes.
For men, I wait to see many zombies, thanks to the Walking Dead television series, and I appreciate that men of the space of Daft Punk will figure among our photos Instagram this year.
According to Google, the most searched disorders are zombies, Batman, pirates and sorcery.
I guess there's no wrong to stay traditional.
We disappeared our dogs last year and, in my wonder, they were not the only ones.
In fact, the Americans will pay $330 in detrimentation for animals this year, according to NRF.
It makes a lot of pretty curious dogs in hotdogs.
When it's good bottles, we're not hurrying.
The Americans will cost $1,9 in goodbons this year, according to the Niels Cabinet.
This represents approximately 272 million kg of Hershey bars, sucettes, Milk Duds, Twizzlers and Clark bars.
It's a great new for the 41 million children who are going to escape the bulls in their neighbourhood, according to the American Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy and, not tell us of stories, consume 41 million of chocolate kg during Halloween.
The Mai Bonbons are the only thing we don't want to eat; and however almost 16 million kg are sold for Halloween, according to the National Confederations Association.
This represents approximately 9 billion grain grains.
It's a mystery that I haven't come to choose.
Nor is any more representative of Halloween than the haasted houses.
They have the best names, such as "Terror Behind the Walls", "Hol-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
Actually, there are 1 200 housing houses officially recognized to the United States, which operate about 500 M$ of receipts, according to America Haunts, and this includes these former photos of you in train to pitch on you that your friends put on Facebook and you can't remove and you can't remove a type that you love a comment on the "Green Head" style.
Finally, talk about citrops.
Charlie Brown presented us La Grosse Citrilla when we were children, and splash a circle in the form of lantern, is like to decorate a Noël tree – that's something we're done since we're all small.
Congratulations for us, the “intensance of the baby-citrilla” started only the last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us has scattered these pumps and did not have to sit in there.
This year, the Americans will pay approximately $106,000 in circles, according to the United States Census Office.
The angle cytroughs that slowly flying on your house's porch were likely coming from Illinois, where 542 million citroughs were built this year.
If you are trying to make more comments, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon to Napa, California, and try to sculpt their 922 kg cits.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will create an internal deficiency structure ("Base Bank") grouping 38 billion books (45 billion euros) of the most rising actives, measured to extend its relations with London and to accelerate its reprivation.
The bank wants to reduce from 55% to 70% the proportion of sustainable assets in the coming two years and hopes to have fully cleaned it in the three years.
RBS also said that it would include a provision for the decrease of comprehensive credits from four to 4.5 billion of books on the quarter, a writing related to the constitution of the cantonation structure.
RBS also explained that this internal restructuring would free from 10 to 11 billion capital books, strengthening its capacity to provide.
The Bank and London emphasized that the "Base Bank" would allow a treaty on the past, the Government which was particularly accused of acting in RBS management.
"We can now go before, worried about the future and 90% of the assets that represent a real good bank and build a large bank for the United Kingdom and the United Kingdom," said the new General Director Ross McEwan at press.
Land Rover announces his parliament of a series of rallyes
The interior has bathrooms and harnais ceintures at 6 points, and an intercom system.
Among the options, including improved guests, a service provides access to mechanisms Bowler Works, logistics support and the disposal of the vehicle between two events.
Drew Bowler, Director-General of Bowler Motorsport, said: "The Rallys Loveers who join Bowler have changed."
They are not all experts, some seek the excitation and adventure and real access to international events.
We are really happy to offer such an approach in partnership with Land Rover and MSA, and we are convinced that this will be a new way to try to different forms of rallys in the United Kingdom and in the international, and to prepare the rivers and realities of raid rallys.
We had great pleasure to develop the defender Challenge vehicle – the campaign will really be palpitant.”
Furthermore, the Defender Challenge will propose a day of training and testing in February and the opportunity to participate in events in North African and the Middle East.
Pumps were called to help a lost chiot after staying coincided at 15 m above the ground on an instable corn in a cart
Ruby, a cocker shot, was escaped after an accident of the road without gravity.
She was recovered three days later by a person who pronounced her dog involved in the card
Pumps are down in memory of the long of the fall to recover dog and save her from a certain death.
A chiot had a chance to escape the worst after the pumps were called to recover it in all safety while it was because it was 15 m above the ground on the instable sail of a false.
Ruby, a 9-month cocker shot, escaped after an accident of the day after midnight road and survived for three days only before he was saved in a mercred card.
His owners, Scott Alderson, 25 years old, and his little friend Becky Hall, 20 years old, went to the Flappit Card in Denholme, West Yorkshire, to find Ruby and rewarded the Western Yorkshire.
They were desperately seeking their dogs to lose an appeal on social network sites after she was disappeared in the card following an accident without seriousness.
On the 14th Friday, a person on the highlighted view that pronounced his dog returned Ruby on a corner in the card, contained at 15 meters above the ground.
A technical assistance team of the Cleckheaton pompary box rose on the places and is down in memory to save Ruby by using an animal civier to transport it up to the top of the pearl.
Andy Clayton said that she was in a precaire situation.”
She was in the middle of the pearl, 15 m from the sum and 15 m from the ground.
She didn't absolutely bout during the saving – she was washed.
But she's okay now.
She did eat biscuits after.
It was a very inhabitable call.
It's incredible that someone's noticed the dogs.
Peter Lau said: “Roy had a lot of chance to get out of it.”
She could be seriously wounded or worse.
Ruby was conducted in the veterinary for control; its general status was satisfactory, degrading and dehydratation.
Ms. Hall, from Halifax in West Yorkshire, said: "I was terrified by watching the help."
I didn't think she was here first.
It was surprised to have him again in his arms.
The veterinary said that if she had been too shot and she had been disappointed, she would probably fall.
The pumps were wearing.
What they did was really comfortable.
They are so grateful, each of them has been absolutely shameful.
Mr. Alderson, from Keighley, added: "We were afraid she was to be buried but she didn't move."
The pumps were over.
I can't believe she was there.
Mick Jagger said he never drew Katy Perry when she was 18 years old.
During an intertaining in Australian radio emission this week, the pop star stated that she was careful about the Jagger's song "Ald Habits Die Hard" in 2004.
Perry said to have been dinnered with the rock Veteran and explained, "He dragged me when I was 18 years old."
She added, "It was long ago, and he was very nice."
In a Thursday, a representative of Jagger, 70 years, said that he had never been Catholic to have made progress in Katy Perry.
The representative added: "If she may conform with one another."
Perry was one of the songs to make a look at the rolling Stones tournament this year.
His new album, "Presm", has been deployed at the first place of the charters this week.
Pékin conceived an Islamic Movement of Turmine
"Islamic Movement of Eastern Turkish, based in Central and Western Asia," said the Chef of Chinese security bodies at a Hung Kong television chain, according to a Thursday online video launched on a web site.
Meng Jianzhu, who is a member of the Chinese Communist Party (PCC), expressed to Tachkent in an official visit in Uzbekistan.
It is the first time that a Chinese license provides a special organization after Monday attent.
According to the Chinese police, three Uyghours of the same family of the Xinjiang Muslim dominant, cross-border of several Central Asian countries, disappeared their car for self-employment bids against the entry of the City prohibited in Pékin, in an attack made by two dead and 40 wounded.
The driver of the car, his wife and his mother died in the fire of the car.
The Etim, which states to be fighted for the eastern Turkish independence, old name of the Chinese Xinjiang, was classified by the United Nations in 2002 among the associated organizations in Al-Qaida.
This movement is often designed by the Chinese authorities as responsible for sporadical troubles in Xinjiang, but its real influence is unfortunately made by several experts.
George Kerevan: Exclamation of Europe gives the choice to Ecossas
Another day, another story concerning independence.
This time, we are expected that an independent Economist would be able to join the European area of free movement in order to join the EU.
And here we are hearing passenger control stories in Berwick and a barbled son border on the wall of Hardrien.
If it is true that the newspaper of Strathclyde has indicated the economic retombed events of a greater freedom of circulation with the rest of Europe, it was not in the largest titles (and it was to predict).
No one has said that the EU Member States have a large part of their time to comply with their formal rules when it is set out.
Since Ecosse is not part of the Schengen Space for the present time, a non-continual remark of rules would be a missing consent that Brussels could offer in contrast to what she wants to obtain Ecossas.
So this is a story that is not one.
And a story as old she is now fitting: for the first time I heard the bobard according to that "independence means the control of passports" has been more than 40 years ago.
However, we forgot a interesting point in this interpretation of an old poussy account.
Why should an independent Economist follow the instructions of Europe in fact?
Why do we exchange London playing against the Brussels, particularly now?
This is the real currentness of Europe: the great following warning plan is defined at the dead point.
With the euro crisis, Europe's project is officially dead.
Along with Europe, the parties affecting the EU or which are missing for the left of the euro as a common currency, gains the field.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Party for Germany, based only this year and reached no part, gathered almost five million votes in the federal elections of September and left the Democratic Democratic Party (equality of our Liberal Democrates) from the Federal Assembly.
There has always been a national opposition to the creation of a Federal Europe project.
However, the current economic crisis has marked a tourist.
The austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, associated with the carcan on national economies through the intermediate accession to the unique currency, conducted many people to think that Europe's project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has not much to see with the national governments who register extensive budget deficits – that was only true for Greece.
The European System has rather worried its members of the favourable change rates to German exporters – what the German political men want to keep.
Without the possibility of an evaluation of the national currency, the countries of Southern Europe will be found with an intrinseous productivity problem in Germany.
The only use is to make shadows in loans and public expenditure – encouraged by Berlin.
Besides current budget and monetary problems, there is a deeper disease related to productivity in Europe.
Following the energy policies imposed by Brussels – which are a reason for supporting French and German companies from the consumer energy sector – the European industry pays two times more for electricity and four times more than the U.S..
This is an inconvenitory in terms of costs, as we already saw it in Grangeouth.
All salary wages in the world will not prevent the European petrochemic industry to be punished by a good market-shirt of the United States.
The revolutionary revolution, particularly in France, is one of the large EU minors.
After the war, the French political election considered the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on an equality foot with Washington.
But Berlin has no need for Paris as a passport of its political legitimacy and has imposed its own economic policy in Europe, laying the French economy to diminish.
The results: the extreme right part of Marine Le Pen, the National Anti-European Front, is here to bring a crucial part of the election, sending socialists to the power to the third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24% of the suitcases – an opportun warning for the British Working Party, which recalls him that it can not be able to make it automatically favourable to the left.
What does Marine Le Pen do with his new popularity at the French white works class?
It wants to serve European elections of the next year to create a unique anti-European anti-monnaie block within the European Parliament.
If the anti-European parties have a good figure in these elections, whatever possible, such block could be able to control the European Parliament for the first time.
This is what I think: very soon, the feelings of anti-European and anti-monnaie in Europe will join and end by killing the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but it will return to something that will be like “Europe of the United Nations (Sweden)” freely privileged by the General of Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite economies could reserve the euro, but France and southern Europe will find their own skills.
I hope that the United Kingdom takes its distances in relation to this project, and I hope it will make the eyes slight to the United States.
However, the growing interest of Washington for the Pacific would like to think that Britain will be left in Atlantic.
And the Ecosse, in all that?
We can decide to be a region of the small England (especially).
Or we can defend our own economic interests, including sending Berlin and Brussels.
I believe that Ecosse could be accompanied by a more free European agreement, provided that we were keeping our own views.
Cooperation with other countries with similar views would be easier in a non-Foveral Europe.
However, we should follow Norway and keep our economic independence.
The Government of Ecocia is – and it is to note – the political anti-external movement which has been the best success in Europe, as he provided a most spectrum in 2011 based on its opposition to the proposed sharp cuts (and implemented) by the Chairman of the Working Chief, Alistair Darling, and the conservator/Democratic coalition that followed.
It would now be ridiculous for the Economist to vote for independence if it is to accept the austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels.
Precoce Puerto : Viillir early
Studies show that young African and Spanish girls have tend to reach the age of puberty early than white girls.
Physical changes do not mean that puberty is imminent
Nothing proves that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts think that the obedience epidemic could be a decline of the precoce puberty
Tendency to a precoce pubert is not also pronounced in the boys
The old corresponding CNN Pat Etheridge is a journalist specialized in family and health issues in the child.
Does a mother worry about whether the pubs and pools of his daughter start pushing up to 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which held this week in Orlando, Floride, Dr Paul Caplowitz, Pedo-Ancrinologue, explained that these precise physical changes are sufficiently current among young Americans and represent a new standard.
"I'm going a lot of time to resolve parents – in general, this does not indicate a rapid evolution to the full puberty," said Caplowitz.
Evidence of development signs, such as the bunkering of ovens, the pools under the pool and the pub zone and the body oars, appear early in girls.
But there was only a lightly advanced age of the first rules during the last four decades.
In the United States, the average age is 12 and half years, while it was 12 years old in 1970.
“Aften the teeth began to develop, at least two or three years before the first rules are appeared,” said Caplowitz, as well as the author of “Early Puberty in Girls: The Essental Guide to Coping with this Common Problem”.
The time is the most precise test to know how to develop puberty.
There is a debate on the real appearance of the puberty, but it is considered as "precoce" when the development of the petroleum is accompanied by a sudden growth before the age of 8.
In most cases, development slow or stop – it's something that a penitarian can follow nearly.
A faster evolution can justify tests carried out by an endocrinologue to disappear serious problems such as tumors or kists.
There are treatments to delay the appearance of the first rules and prevent other consequences: prematured anti-matured bones that can solve growth and small size at adult.
The recommendations on medical and hormonal treatment are based on child age, development rates, growth rates and affective maturity.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is careful with medicines but it recogniss that “the fact of controling puberty can argue some of the behaviour and feelings for young girls to be different from others. ”
The other big problem is understandable: parents do not just want their very young girls to have their rules.
“They fear the risk of pregnancy or even the way they will manage hygiene issues” said Capluitz.
“ It was a chocolate, ” she remembers a woman whose girl had the first rules in 10 years.
Even if there were signs and we had spoken of rules, it was not emotionally prepared.
She went back from the painful school and bounded to be the first among her friends.
There are many theories brought to the public on the causes of precoce puberty.
However, there is no coherent theory that the hormones contained in milk or other foods, chemicals present in the environment or sexual communications which are conducted by media are responsible.
The boys, like girls, reach their puberty early.
Caplowitz states that the most credible hypothesis is the epidemic of obedience.
He participated in a study conducted on girls aged 6 to 9 years, which reads the percentage of fat fat for puberty density.
Other discovery supports this conclusion, but there are many other influential factors.
In this country, young African and Spanish girls tend to reach the age of puberty early than white girls.
There are several clarifications.
At the world level, the precoce puberty mechanisms seem to be influenced by all means of climate economic conditions, through genes.
Another problem: Although boys have pools on the face and in the younger population, trend towards a real precoce puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP conference stressed the complexity of the subject.
The appearance of the acne and pubian pool is current, even in the nourrissons and all-petitives.
“We must be wise about how we identified the true appearance of puberty” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pedo-endocrinologue working in the hospital for children of Goryeb in Morristown, in New Jersey.
Parents should not urge the advice to ask their pensioner to know how to talk with their child.
“It can mean having an early conversation than planned,” explained Caplowitz.
If you're quiet, your child will react in general.
Girls whose puberty is precoce must be recognized in the fact that, even when it happens early than is planned, the process is part of life.
Brothers Coen' damage
"Inside Llewyn Davis" of the Brothers Coen, the great price of the last Festival of Cannes, is a nostalgic and ridiculous film on the Greenwich village of 1961 and the folk music that was just starting to reson, before the arrival of Bob Dylan.
Joel and Ethan Coen, whose films were to make a retrospective to the French Cinémathèse, took the gold palm in Cannes in 1991 for Barton Fink.
Unable to embark Dylan or the triumph Peter, Paul and Mary, Joel and Ethan Coen have thrown their devolution on the volcanic star of the American cinemam, Oscar Isaac, 33 years, but also on the planet star of Justin Timberlake.
In this humor film where the music is a central person and the songs interpretted directly, Oscar Isaac shows a musician and folk song, while Timberlake, his friend in the film, leaves the pop for the folk music with a contagious jubilation.
With regard to Carey Mulligan, she left the rich attorneys of Daisy Mulligan in "Gatsby the wonderful" for less solving clothes, a sweet voice when she warms, but the jury deployed the middlete when she talks.
"Inside Llewyn Davis" tells the tribulations of a folk song that doesn't come to shot and flood with the whole earth.
It is accepted to reduce the replacements at feet up in the studios.
Without housing, he makes the tournament of his friends who want to receive him well.
A documentary air
"Their relationship with the success is tortured, that's what he interested us: a mechanic of maliciousness, a guy who is not here at a good time, who is not a carrier but integer, with an autodestructor behaviour," said Ethan Coen's pressure, co-roned with his brother Joel of many Oscars and prices in Cannes.
If Llewyn Davis has not existed, the two films of folk music fans have built their story on true personalities of the time, such as the folk Dave Van Ronk music.
The idea was to show the time before the arrival of Greenwich village, this village of New York called to become "the pic between the pool music, which would generate international stars" as written by the journalist Elijah Wald, friend of Van Ronk.
The film then takes documentary alliances, the label of invahi music of 33T invented inventories used by an impayable secretary, the musical selection of the time studies and the caffeine where the cantors were produced.
The Magie of Brothers Coen is still working in integrating a smoke of personality through the film: a great red chat in the scaring view, a strong manager of Llewyn Davis.
I wondered how he composed his personality, the actor and cantor Justin Timberlake had remembered "growd in Tennessee, bailed by the blue and the country."
"My first music lessons were given to me by my grandmother who learned me to play the guitar," he added.
For Justin Timberlake, if the work is necessary for "becoming considered as good," "the hair can also run the card of someone," and "of more today."
As Llewyn Davis, who refuses any compromise on his music, the pop star explains that in a card, "the most important is not allowing us to join everything that can prevent us to express."
Gordard of Villiers, the author of "SAS", died.
He would never have known the retained word.
The French edition Phénomène, Gerard de Villiers, died Thursday to 83 years, was just coming to publish his 200th SAS, "Cremlin Vengeance".
In February, New York Times dedicated it as "the author of Romans of spionage that was too well known."
He was then coming to 10 days in Afghanistan, theatre of the 198 and 199 work of the famous series of spioning Romans.
It was physically reduced by a very serious heart accident in December 2010, which was delayed during the journey with a deambulator.
And before Afghanistan, he was also divided in Libya, Russia, Lebanon and Mali.
With four SAS published by year, Gerard de Villiers, born on 8 December 1929 in Paris, would be able to ignore the exact number of books sold since 1965 and the publication of "SAS in Istanbul", the first of the series, about a half-eight centuries.
"Subsequently, between 120 and 150 million all confounded countries," he arrived in March last.
His Birman chat on the genoux, in the room of his immense apartment of an immeuble Avenue Foch at two steps from the Ark of Triomphe, the malicious eye under his white hair, cited some of the languages in which the SAS aventurs were translated: Italian, German, Russian, Greek, Japanese or Korean.
"In view of the pirate editions, he added, designing a skill of books on the low table between the irons and the irons reported from 130 arpent countries to place his Romans.
For the price of a cygarette package, the lector has right to the traditional cover with the photo of a young woman in the advantageful weight, with a weapon or a smooth.
Inside, his sereinism summit (SAS) is the prince Malko Linge, Austrian Aristocrat, and the contracting agent of the CIA to pay the repairs of the Family Café, starts to the shapes of all the wicked of the earth, communists of the 70 and 80 years, then jihadists from 90 years.
Each book receipt: a large dose of geopolitics and exotics, a few hard sex scenes, a seest of violence and torture.
"I never had the detention to be a literary author," explained Gerard of Villiers.
I think as a container who writes to distraction of people to whom I don't send a message.
He worked "such as the great war reporters, the type of Albert Londres, who were on the place and returned with true and long investigations."
The SAS's father was saying "the genre of geopolitical sheet".
"I'm still my dossiers (Afghanistan, Syria, ...) before you leave", added Gerard de Villiers.
Instead, I meet journalists, including AFP, diplomats, people of services I know for some of the 20 or thirty years.
In fact, many of its SAS are often premonitionary: so, a month before the attack of a Syrian command center who killed a number of high responsibilities, he told the history of the "The Chemin of Damascus".
In the "The Fous de Benghazi", he was the first to reveal the existence of a secret CIA command centre in this city, the beach of the libian revolution.
In 1980, he put the murder of the Egyptian President Anouar El-Sadate in "The Caire Compliment" a year before the attack.
In October 2012, in "Panica in Bamako", he refers to the columns of 4X4 jihadists based on the Male capital.
I'm not a divine, I defended Gerard of Villiers, I'm just doing hypotheses from countries I well know and, in time, some of my hypotheses are realized.
After these trips in areas often embedded, he was installed for a month ago his machine to write IBM at branding dated 1976 "with all the pieces have been changed."
300 pages later, he wrote the word "FIN" and corrected each page at the stolo.
At the walls of his office's office are accompanied by AK-47 asylums, erotic photos and author's photos with African war masters.
Regularly encountered for machisme by women and racism by human rights organizations, Genard of Villiers dismissed these accusations in two phrases.
Some women are sexual objects in my books but others are beautiful, intelligent and comfortable women.
I'm always well welcome in Africa where I'm accounting of very many readers.
Gerard de Villiers said, "Malko Linge, like all heroes, has no age."
He won't die and won't go back.
Not more than me.
The aircrafts calls on the width of the seats, while large commands are playing
The dispute is rare between the large aircrafts on the width of the tourist class's seats on the long-term flights, opening the way to a swimming confrontation in Dubai airspace which is a month.
The conflict takes on the width of the proposed seats on long-mail flights to economic passengers – which are not always the most shortest by air companies, but the allocation space is essential to increase effective gains in the latest devices presented by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
This week, Airbus called the airline industry to establish a standard that imposes a seat size of at least 18 pounds (45.72 cm) in the economic classes, but its great American rival Boeing states that it should be the air companies to decide.
The disagreement was spread while the aircraft seeking to sell a further larger versions of their long-term aircraft, hopeing probably a record of orders during the event that will be completed from 17 to 21 November.
The way the seats will be available behind the aircraft – in particular, there will be 9 or 10 front seats – is essential for the economic performance of the "mini-jumbo segment".
Boeing states that its re-amended "777X" will be able to accommodate in economic class 406 persons in larger than 17 pounds, and will be configured with 10 seats by root.
Airbus indicates that the concurrent version of its A350 will be transported in economic class 350 people in 18 large pool seats, configured by 9.
The aircraft genders often exchanges technical issues by publicity in professional pressure.
Today, Airbus calls it directly to the public before Dubai airline, where 777X should take step on its competitors with more than 100 orders.
Recently, what could be the beginning of a new public war with the presentation of a photo to the finances showing three persons against each other in the restaurant, entitled "Do you accept that?"?
“Being offers long-term flights in closer seats than in regional turbopropulsors airports” said John Leahy, Airbus Trade Director.
As food standards change, people grow, but seats in aircraft have not radically changed.
From the beginning of the 1970s, when 747 Boeing has defined the modern long-mail journey and the centuries of the age, the average America's weight has increased from 10 per cent in the United States Department.
The middle America's 19th century tour is 39.7 pouces, according to American health statistics.
Airbus states that his rival was reached to a seat concept dated in the 1950s, when the circumstances of the frankly baptized 'jet set' was closer.
Airbus adds that it has commanded a study that indicates that an additional weight at the level of the width of seats would improve the quality of the sleep of 53 %.
Boeing contests the numbers of Airbus concerning the width of seats and states that it is not the manufacturers to decide how airlines balance the bill prices and equipment.
He also said that the study shows that the care experience is not only depending on the width of seats.
"There is really to bring flexibility to airlines and to allow them to do what they think to do for their activities," said Kent Craver, under the pleasure of passengers at Boeing.
They don't want to tell them what will allow them to be rentable.
They know their company better than nobody.
For passengers, it is more to have a certain freedom of movement, but for providers, it is a question that could affect their results.
On the basis of the dispute, a course is hidden to the airline commands for a amount estimated of at least 700 Md dollars at the market price in the coming decades, sufficiently to decline the balance of the US and European exports.
As Reuters said for the first time in July, the seat configuration is exactly what the battle between all the latest devices.
Airbus and Boeing return a seat performance in their latest long-mail models 20% higher than the market leader in this segment, Boeing 777-300ER of 365 seats.
The performance reported by Boeing depends on the comparison between 777X configured with 10 seats by road and a 777 original model set up by 9.
The gain in terms of unit costs is low compared to the device configured with 10 seats at current service.
“Being does this to make more seats and make its most competitive airports in relation to our products”, said Kevin Keniston, Confort Governor Passager at the European Airbus airport.
On the other hand, the analysis said that the cabins configured with 10 seats in the 777 existing suggest that many passengers have been offered in favour of a more dense configuration, which can go to pair with less sweet tariffs.
“A 18 powder width would be perfect for passengers, but the reality is that the Airbus proposal is motivated by the threat of 777," said the expert inside Mary Kirby's cabins, founder and redactor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not provide seats but offer a catalogue of providers between airlines.
Several aircrafts that make the world tour even make a meter with them to check the concurrent settings.
Although all constructors are proposing comfortable devices, they also offer aircraft with strong density settings to lower-cost airlines and regional travels.
Airbus offers a A350 configured with 10 seats by road but indicates that it has not yet been sold.
By recently, Airbus emphasized the need for a greater personalization of cabins by offering larger seats on some of its airports.
Without the support of the only only large constructor of modernly large devices, experts say that it is less likely that his call to the airline industry to establish a size standard for the seats, but that he could forget the sales vague of 777X.
Ilison's actionnaires of irritating the Elison Salary
A majority of oral actionnaires voted on Thursday against the proposal for reimbursement for the founder and Director-General Larry Ellison, in view of financial performances of his group.
The vote is not bound, but it comes to throw the image of Larry Ellison, the third world force just along with the victory of his ship to the Coupe of America.
The billion is also 25% of the capital of the software group that has co-funded for 40 years ago.
The last year, Ellison had made a negative vote on its reimbursement.
The Minister of Orcle rejected a $1,2 million for the period 2013 closed because of the bad performance of the group, which lacked its growth objectives, but had been about $77 million related to stock options.
His fixed salary is only a symbolic dollar.
On the whole financial year decreed 2013, the net benefit of the Order has increased from 3,5% while the Busses course of 27.5% overforming the S&P-500 index that took 24% at the same time.
New anti-nicotine vaccine could remove the pleasure of fuming
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could remove the pleasure that we are taking to smoke a cigarette.
One dose of vaccine could protect mouses from nicotine's dependence.
Other tests are required before starting human tests, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College of New York stated that the first signs were encouraged.
“We really hope that this kind of vaccinal strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop, extending all the methods available today on the market, but discovering that their addition is sufficiently strong to overcome these different approaches," said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an inoffensive virus that has been amended to transport genetic information necessary to conceal anti-nicotine anticorps.
The virus infects selectively the fever cells, which then starts to produce a regular anticorps flux.
Anticorps trappe all nicotine molecules present in the blood system and neutralize them before they reach the brain, which prevents the fumer to have its dose of nicotine.
In the tests, the museums that then given nicotine have normally continued their activity.
But the mouses that had not been vaccined " were paid" said the researchers, signed that nicotine had reached their brain.
Experiences are described in the Translational Medicine Review.
The previous vaccines against the tobacco were ineffective because they contained anticorps.
Injections should be repeated so often that the levels of anticorps remain high that they were too unfair and few practical.
But the cost of the new vaccine should be very lower because it transforms the petrol cells to anticorps.
The professor Crystal said that if the future vaccine with human use was completely safe, it could be managed to children before they tried to try a cigarette, which would prevent any addiction to nicotine.
But it is more likely that it is used by smokeers who want to stop fuming.
“They will know that if they are recommending fuming, they will not take any pleasure because of anti-nicotine vaccine, and that can help them to lose their bad usuality," he added.
British scientists said that the results were interested, but they reported that higher research was needed.
Chief of the Pakistanian Taliban killed by a drone
The chief of the Pakistanian movement, Hakimullah Mehsud, was killed in a slaughter of a American drone on Friday in Pakistan, learned at security services.
The death of Hakimullah Mehsud was announced to several reprises already in the past.
But those who were responsible for the recruitment, the army and the active movement said that he had lost life in the north-Waziristan region.
"We can confirm that Hakimullah Mehsud has been killed in a drone road," said a high security license.
The Veille, the Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif, moved in London, informed the British Government that discussions were undertaken with the Tehrik and Taliban Pakistan (TTP), the movement of Pakistan Taliban.
Tripodi never be influenced by Obeid
The former employee of New Galles of South Tripodi will make an investigation of the State's anti-corruption regulator.
The former Minister of New Galles of South Joe Tripodi refused to change trade bottle policy at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had interests hidden in three goods located in the controled area.
Friday, the Independent Commission Aganst Corruption (ICAC) extended its investigation to know if Mr. Obeid had pressed on several ministers of the State to renew its bottles in Circular Quay, where the Obeids had two restaurants and a coffee after expiration in August 2005 without there was a call for offers.
It is now investigating the allegations that Mr. Tripodi was on the secret interest of Mr. Obeid in these properties, following the witness of the former secretariat added Secretary-General by Mr. Tripodi, Lyne Ashpole, Thursday.
During the 2005 discussions, the Government expressed pressure for the bulls to make an appeal.
Locators were against and also wanted longer periods.
In 2009, Circular Quay's bulls, reported to Obeid approximately $2,5 per year, were renewed without there was no call for offers.
Mr. Tripodi, who was Minister of the Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, was a favorite start of the calls.
But he refused to change its policy on the request of Mr. Obeid, who, recognized Mr. Tripodi, made a change of government policy in the field of bottles.
The transscription of telephone conversations submitted to the ICAC showed appeals in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeid, Mr. Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a high official who had come to the Ministry of Ports after worked under M. Obeid to the Ministry of Prüfers.
“Is the subject discussed during these telephone conversations to be the development of trade bottles policy?” asked the adjoint Commissioner Anthony Whealy to Mr Tripodi.
“No,” said Mr. Tripodi.
I don't remember what we talked about, but at any time, that wasn't about it.
Of course, not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli war aircraft designers to Syria said a license
Israeli war airports reached a target in the Syrian Port town of Latakia's night Thursday, confirming a military manager in Fox News.
The responsible did not precise what the objective was, but said that there was at least one.
The Asociated Press reports that the target was Russian manufacturing missiles SA-125.
At least two times this year Israel made air battles against missile loads in Syria.
Foreign workers in possession of a 457 visa may have an authentic test
The Government is currently examining the possibility of establishing an “authenticity test” for foreign workers in possession of a visa 457 while it is intended to extend repression measures.
The test, if it is adopted, would be applied according to a criteria aimed at preventing visa 457 to be used to take unqualified positions or as a displaced means to bring his family and friends in Australia.
A Government's work document has been devoted today while the Deputy of Working List Maxine McKew denied the Government's discussions on foreign workers, saying that it could offend the neighbours of Australia.
"Frequent statements on the "lands returning to the end of the file" and "employment for Australias" are an unacceptable return at the time when the unions requested a protected work market," she said to Australia India Institute today.
Historyly, this means that the work of the Whites should be protected – and I would not be surprised that some countries in the region see it as an echo to this historic artefact.
The work document has been made out of the 12 measures previously considered by the former Immigration Minister of Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who was in Sri Lanka to meet high liability to discuss trafficking of human beings, has implemented five of the recommended changes, the others in the course of review.
If the “authenticity criteria” was adopted, a visa applicant may be checked to know if the offer of employment is an authentical in the case where the candidate is a relationship or a personal partner of the owner or the person concerned within the sponsory company.
The enterprises could also be kept to declare the number of 457 visa detentors after some of them, having intended to sponsor a small number of workers, have actually been employed hundreds.
During time, a 35-year-old asylum requester would die from a heart crisis after coming on a boat transporting asylum requesters to the Christmas island this week.
The son of the man's age of nine years went to Australia with him and found some comfort since his father's death was married at an adult neighbour who was also on the edge.
A man was emergencyly transferred by Australian authorities to the hospital of the Christmas island, where he was deceived.
A study aimed at multipliing the benefits of HS2 railway project for Ecocia was launched by the British Government.
The work made by HS2 Ltd would like to think that large speed services will be starting from the opening of phase 1 in 2026.
The Minister of Baron Transport Kramer stated that the “United Kingdom will gather.”
The Economic Minister of Transport, Keith Brown said "excelled" to the idea of working with the British Government on the project.
Phase 1 will take on a new high speed line between London and the West Midlands.
When Phase 2 is finished, the lines will serve Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government revitalised the estimated cost of the construction of large speed connection between London and the north of England, between 32.7 billion and 42.6 Md.
The British Government, which is in talking with Transport Scotland, requested HS2 Ltd to study the strengthening of rail capacity and improve the duration of traffic for Northern England and Economic.
This should include the possibility of trip periods between Glasgow and Edimbourg of three hours at the latest.
The Kramer barone said: "Our goal for HS2 is on a real national network that will approach the United Kingdom and its cities."
We put the HS2 project because the benefits that it present are widespread.
Without him, we are compared to a problem of the capacity of our railway network.
But it is also to develop connectivity between the 18 major British cities, including Glasgow and Edimbourg, in order to improve links between them through HS2.
The British State Secretariat for Escosse, Alistair Carmichael, added: "The news is today a good news for Ecosse."
For the Economic Government, Keith Brown called Mr. Carmichael to support the inclusion of the Ecosse in the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: "The high speed train has the potential to provide significant economic benefits to Economism, but it also brings the economic weight of Ecosse in the global railway network project throughout the United Kingdom.
"We are therefore encouraging the idea of working in partnership with the British Government to consider the options to bring the high speed network to Ecosse, creating a advantage for all and complementing the Glasgow-Edimbourg line that the Economic Government is already planning.
“I am encouraging to read the review report with the British Ministers in the next year and we will then decide together with the next steps.”
The rules relating to the use of electronic devices on the boat remain for the immediate operation in Australia
Australian aircraft passengers will continue to expand their tablets and smartphones during the deployment and the aircraft, despite the United States manager to comply with electronic devices.
The Federal Aviation Aviation of Americans left the open door to the US transporters for change of their procedures so that passengers may read electronic books, look for videos or play games on their devices during the critical flight phases, provided that they are "atterage" mode.
Passengers can already do it during the largest part of the flight, but many people are in a penalty that they cannot access their electronic books during the disappearing and airrising.
Australian transporters consider the decision that the US transporters are obliged to carry out an important work in order to meet the requirements, but have not been able to change their procedures immediately.
The Civil Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it was examined the advertisement but emphasized that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices during the critical flight phases were still in force in Australia.
“CASA does not have specific regulations that regulate the use of aircraft electronic devices” said.
The question is of a regulation which requires aircraft operators to ensure the maintenance of security and passengers to comply with the safety designs given by the equipage members.
Virgin, who already spoke to the CASA of its intention to extend its use of its Wi-Fi-Technology, was open to a change, but she said it would follow the regulator.
“We would welcome a revision of the CASA that would allow the use of electronic devices because we really think that this would improve the customer experience now that we have (the Wi-Fi technology technology system) on our airports," said a portline.
Qantas stated that it had respected the current rules for the present time.
"In accordance with our current policy, electronic devices can't be used during disappearing and airrising, and we have no intention to change this," she said.
The decision of the AFA is applicable to the American airlines.
However, we are always interested in regulatory evolutions that could benefit to passengers, and we will be examined closely the FAAA decision and the reasons of that.
For the American transporters, the impact of the decision will be different from a air company to the other and will depend on the age of their fleet.
Transporters should demonstrate that their aircraft can remove radio conferences from electronic devices, as well as seeing manuels, training material, hand-based bags transport and designs provided to passengers.
“Although a airline has checked the tolerance of its fleet, it can allow passengers to use light portable electronic devices, such as tablets, electronic book readers and smartphones at all heights” said FAA.
In rare cases of low visibility, the equipage will request passengers to disappear their devices during the aircraft.
The Group also recommended that the harder devices be set up in any security under seats or in upper sections during disappearing and airrising.
Pia: at least four wounds in a violent bagarre
The small municipality of Pia has known an inhabitant over Thursday evening.
Three gendarmery vehicles, two ambulances and an approximation of a thirty people according to reciprocal witnesses...
On the day of Halloween, the evening was moved on the side of Pia, where a rixe involved several people have moved on the side of the Post.
Four light wounds at least would be deployed.
Advertised, the gendarms have been made on place to separate the slaughters and to ensure that the wounds are undertaken.
Singapore leaders benefit from average classes which are limited to the ceinture
In a trade leader of Bendare in Singapour, Janani Amirthaling presented a bracelet, a bague and a pair of ear bottles in the gold to pay the school fees of his girls.
“ My husband and I have come to buy a house, so my whole money is gone from there," says Mrs. Amirthalinga.
Although she wins $3,000 from Singapour (2,400) in a month as a man and works like her husband, the monthly income is not enough, she said.
In fact, the demand is such in some of the South-East Asian parties – where the female ending increased – which ValueMax, where she has performed its transaction, became the third company of goods to be introduced to Singapour.
Bearing eggs is not only a speed way to get liquid money – $1 300 from Singapour in the case of Ms. Amirthalinga – but it's almost so good that the ungarned bank loans are not guaranteed.
In general, Singapore leaders have an effective annual interest rate of 17 per cent, just over 15.4 per cent offered by the United States Overseas Bank, a local fund loan with a successoral in the same commercial centre.
However, the guage priests have the benefit of not seeking solvability or proof, and can deploy loans faster than banks.
As a result, millions of people through the region turn to gender priests while families feel the pressure that increases the cost of life and the overcoming of female and consumers.
After five years of solid growth since the global financial crisis, and the good market foodd by a too laxistic currency policy in developed economies, low and medium income families turn to the leaders to understanding the difference while their economy know a frequency.
This week, the Standard & Poor's Notice Agency focused on the growing endeavourment of female feeding, mainly on the increase of hypothecing loans, as a risk factor for the solvibility of Asian banks.
She stated that Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore registered the ratio of the worst and gross domestic product in Asia.
Malaysia was 80 per cent of PIB, while 60 per cent in 2008 increased.
Economys also fear the high level of consumers in Thailand, which has been a few of these weeks from a technical recession.
Thursday, data have shown continued weakness of exports and increased the demand of consumers.
“Balan is that with the increase of costs, people in the middle or down [of the wages] seek to complement their income as they can,” said Song Sing Wun, economicist at CIMB, a malaria bank.
The historically high gold prices during the past two years have made people to make their personal effects to touch the value in species of their holes.
In Singapour, approximately 70% of the articles conducted in the 200 bottles of the City Guide are gold.
People say, “the gold price is high, put the chain in the big mother's gold and we will come back to find it on the next month.”
In Thailand, EasyMoney's largest pretty boutique operator, recorded an increase in 20% of the number of customers using its boats in the last months.
The growth is such in the sector of the guage presumption that ValueMax, the operator of the boutique in Bendemeer and 15 other boutics like this in Singapour, intended to develop not only in the nearby Malaysia – where he already accounts four butics – but also outside Asia, says Ja Lee Ching, its General Directorate.
The company will fund them using 60% of the 66 M$ in Singapore that she has led this week in the introduction of Singapore.
Although some lower rate lower fees examined the critics for exorbiting interest rates they practice, Ms. Yes indicates that the management offers not only less higher rates than other prêtres, but that it is not directly due to debt.
“Clients are hypothetics of the goods they already have, and the fact of currency of their personal goods does not increase the female reward," she said.
Implementation is better accepted socially as a means of obtaining a short term guaranteed financing.
Those who are in the guage priests are not only those who have financial problems.
Singapore people will also go in the valueMax pretty bottles to make gold linen or Rolex shows, which may represent up to 60% of their purchase prices in species.
We see clients of all the beds of society.
“It may be aggravated persons who need to impose short term for commercial activities or investment, or small enterprises that have needs to move a difficult capture," add Ms. Yes.
Sometimes, they just need money very fast.
Juvenile pornography pattern in New York
A young pasteur in the Alfax region in New Escosse is accused of young pornografie.
Aaron Hudgins, a 30-year-old, was arrested on Friday morning following investigation at his home and the National Council's research office.
The baptism church of Timberlay, where the pasteur was officious, was deeply attracted by this news.
In a communiqué, the church officials indicate that Mr. Hudgins has released his post.
The passenger was left under conditions.
It should not, in particular, communicate with persons of less than 18 years and access to the Internet.
He will compare the provincial court in Halifax in December.
It makes a uniform nazi to overmark, before being cut
A man clothed by a brassard of a brassard brassard with the gammed croix was prayed to leave a English supermarche, customers still complained at the direction of the police office, indicated the Friday magazine.
"We received a few clients' complaints, so we asked him to leave the store," explained a port of the Assda supermarched chain.
The household called the police to the rescue, but "the time that it comes, he was already gone without screening," she added.
I was doing the shot when I saw a woman who looked up.
People were bound by mouth.
"You don't go out so in the street unless you want to take attention," said a client, Rosina Rusin, 60 years old in Cambridge News.
This incident occurred Thursday, the day of Halloween's festival, where it was about to deal in the monster, but it was difficult to know if it was a canal.
A Cambridge's man returned the responsibility of this act on his Twitter account, where he posted images of Adolf Hitler.
"I bring a black brassard SS two times a week for three years at Asda," said Paul Dutton, explaining the suffering of "human problems".
Tswanian health system savings 325 M$
The Federal Government maintains that the rescue plan of $325,5,000 for the vacuum health system is subject to severe conditions to ensure that the government of the State will not pay the funds.
The Federal Minister of Health Tanya Pluberse announced that the Commonwealth currently takes urgent measures to end a crisis caused by the older population of the island state, the high rate of chronic diseases and the limits of the system.
The funding for four years was decided after Government consultations with the independent representative of Tasmania, Andrew Wilkie.
"The Government has proposed a emergency saving plan, which will, according to us, regulate the unique difficulties that the State is compared today," said Mrs. Pluberse.
The $325 M$ plan includes a $31 M$ campaign for non-retroactive chirurgic operations.
2 600 additional operations, including orthopedic chirurgy and cataracy, will help ratifying the delay.
Funds are also planned for clinics without rendering to Hobart and Launceston, best external care, medical training, mental health services and the removal of electronic medicines in local hospitals.
“Investments respond to the idea that, according to the first line clinics, it is the best way to support the health system of Tasmania," said Mrs.
The Minister stated that the Government of Thailand would be compared to a strict settlement for reporting and account refund.
The State should maintain current funding levels in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and prepare monthly reports on the sectors where additional funds are paid.
A committee composed of three persons will be established to ensure that the State provides services in the most effective and efficient way.
Mr. Wilkie has said today that the $325 would not be considered for large-chose " unless they are followed in a real reform that allows to consolidate the public health system in Tasmania. "
However, he congratulated the Government to have responded to the request of urgent assistance submitted to the First Minister of Mai.
"I hope that the federal aid plan will contribute greatly to the removal of the public health system from the black list," said Mr. Wilkie.
According to the Government of the State, these additional non-Agency procedures will largely impose the recent offences.
But the port of the opposition on health Peter Dutton believes that the announcement of today is a "a force solution".
“The reason for which we are here is that the State's worklist has retired $430 from its health system," said he on ABC TV.
We can't have a State government that raise almost half a million dollars, and the Commonwealth, which is about $300 million, and is proclaiming that it is a fast day.
Mr. Dutton visited Ms. Pluberse in order to ensure that any dollars of the saving plan will be transferred to additional office.
The adaptation by Guillaume Nicloux of the Roman de Denis Dignot is a remarkable artistic direction and a minutely reconstruction of time, but it is also more harder than it should be.
In France in 1760, she tells the shadow of Suzanne's story, a young aristocrat sent to a couvent by her family.
When she rebelled, she faces the cruelness without birth of a Saudily Saudily dismissible mother and becomes a erotic object for another.
The film never turns into luxury or sensationalism, and it's a good problem.
The solennial consciousness of the narration could also become a pentecost for the public.
Syria destroyed its capacity of production of chemical weapons, the monitoring body
Syria has destroyed essential equipment for the production of chemical weapons and warmings full of toxic gas, the international organization of monitoring chemical weapons on Thursday, while overwhelming violence in the north of the country, close to one of the sites where toxic agents were stored.
A group of Syrian military wars also stated Thursday that more than 120 000 people were killed since the beginning of civil war in the country has been about 3 years ago.
Announcement of the Organization for Chemical Weapon Prohibition (OIAC) has occurred with a progress day on the limit date of
1 November laid down by the organisation based on the Haye commanding Damascus to destroy or to make unutilizable" all chemical weapons units and machines aimed at mixing to the toxic gas and filled munitions.
The completion of what is mainly the initial destruction phase is an important stage of the ambitious calendar to destroy chemical weapons from Damascus from mid-2014.
With the destruction of equipment, Syria will no longer produce new chemical weapons.
However, Damascus must still begin the destruction of existing weapons and reserves.
The country has approximately 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons, including the motor gas and the sarotoxic neurotoxic agent.
The advertisement was made when the fights were driving in the town of Safira, which opened a production unit of chemical weapons, as well as storage sites, reported the Syrian Observer for Human Rights in Great Britain.
The military group, following the evolution of the human bilance through a network of military forces based on Syria, said Thursday that 120 296 people were dead.
Among them, there were 61 067 civilians, 6 365 children.
On the side of the Government, 29 954 members of the armed forces of President Bachar el-Assad found death, 18 678 of which were pro-governmental forces and 187 military forces of Hezbollah libanais.
Among the dead, it was also seen that 2 202 were deserts and about 5 375 of the fighters of the opposition, whose well-beings were foreign.
On 25 July, the United Nations felt that 100 000 people were dead in the conflict since March 2011.
She didn't update this number since.
Some 2 million people had to flee from the country because of the conflict.
El-Assad's troops fight against rebels, which are a lot related to Al-Qaida network groups for several weeks in Safira.
The Observer stated on Thursday that there were loss of both sides, but did not give any specification.
The fights emphasized the importance of the dangers confronted by the inspectors for chemical weapons while they must complete their mission, which is to escape Syria from its toxic arsenal in the middle of a civil war that perishes in serred terms.
An OIAC statement, which worked closely with the United Nations, indicated that its team was “actually satisfactory to control – and saw destroyed – all stated critical production and machines for mechanism and filled.”
It added that “no other inspections activity has been planned for the present time”.
More early in the week, the inspectors stated that they had completed the first stage of the verification work, visiting 21 of the 23 sites declared by Damascus.
They could not visit the latest two sites because of concern about their security, the inspectors indicated.
Thursday, OIAC said that the two sites were “limited and... the elements of the chemical weapon programme that they contained were moved to other declarated sites that were inspected”.
It was difficult to first see if the Safira unit was one of the two sites that OIAC's inspectors could not visit.
Syria has presented a comprehensive destruction plan of its chemical weapons, which was approved on the following month by the Executive Committee of the OICAC.
"I welcome the moral force and the strongness you all have proved in the context of the most difficult mission never undertaken by this organization," said the Director-General of the Ahmet Uzumcu organization, in a comment published by the OIAC.
Now in its third year, civil war is mainly opposed musulman rebels from the Government of Elasad and its security forces, which are supported by members of the aluita sect, a branch of the chip islam.
Furthermore, the Director of the Sirian Observer for Human Rights stated that there was a strong merchant explosion in a air defence base in the Syrian Coast Province of Latakia.
The explosion cause remains unknown, added.
Coller causated by the punishment pronounced against one of Bali owners
The survivors and neighbours of 202 people killed in Bali attacks in 2002 have reacted with an encouraging penalty against the last conspirants to be delivered into justice, saying that Umar Patek should be escaped by a piloton of execution.
Patek, who has been fought almost 10 years as one of the most searched men in South-East Asia, was condemned at a penalty of 20 years of prison for its role in the manufacture of explosive engins used during the attents.
It could be released at the end of 15 years under conditional release.
The 45-year-old man was acknowledged by mass murdering for attractions on two night boxes in the Kuta's popular tourist area, which caused the death of 202 people, including 88 Australians, and made many wounded.
It was also acknowledged by many other prosecution leaders with terrorism, including a vague of attractions to churches throughout the Indonesian veil in 2000.
Prosecutors requested a perpetual penalty, but they could ask what man, qualified by "Demolition Man" for its reputation of expert in the manufacture of bombs, would be condemned to death.
The decision endorsed penal memories for June Courten, a Perth's mother who lost two jumales of 39 years, Jane and Jenny, in the destructions perpetrated by Patek and the other conspirators about 10 years ago.
On the side of the laugh, she said that Patek had to be condemned to die.
I really think he should have followed the same way as the other men.
“It should be translated before the implementing piloon” said Mrs. Corteen to the AAP.
I have to live all the days without having other kids, nor see my girls.
The Sari Club was completely destroyed when a huge bomb, charged in an outdoor quartonette, explosed just after 23 October 2002.
Peter Hughes was at the Paddy's Bar when a camikaze made it to cut a paddy's pocket with a dose charged explosion at least 20 seconds early.
He fell in the coma on the next day of the attent and was left unconscious for a month, and he was "mortal" three times when he was under respiratory assistance.
Mr. Hugues said that Patek had to have known the same way as the three other members of the terrorist cell of Jemaah Islamiyah, responsible for the carnage – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who have been executed four years ago.
In fact, this man should have been condemned before the others.
Keep him alive, why, there is no reason to keep him alive.
Past 20 years in prison after killing 202 people and wounding hundreds of others, it's not much.
Patek is the last of Bali's owners to be delivered into justice.
He had been able to avoid the capturing of almost ten years but finally arrested in January 2011 in the Palestinian city of Abbottabad, where American forces would kill the former Chief of Al-Qaida, Oussama Ben Laden, less than four months later.
During the proceeding, a FBI agent stated that reports of education services had been revealed that Patek was in Pakistan to meet Ben Laden in order to restore links between the South-East Asian terrorist groups and Al-Qaida.
“It has not been done,” added Mrs. Corteen.
To recently, he was obviously moving of the chagrin that he could cause others.
The 10th anniversary of the attracts that will be celebrated later this year and marked by ceremonys in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of weeping this year," said Mrs. Corteen.
Patek may, however, call for his condemnation.
FAA: Air passengers can now use aircraft gadgets (but don't pass a call with their port phone)
Airlines can use their door porta porta devices to read, work, play, look movies and listen to music – but don't talk about their portal phone – under the new very expected directives issued by the Federal Aviation Administration.
But passengers should not expect immediate changes.
The speed with which the change will be placed will vary from a air company to the other, said the FA Michael Huerta's Administrator at a press conference.
Airlines should prove that their airlines are respecting the new directives and updated the training manuals of staff members and the rules relating to the device range to be complied.
The FAA stated that she had already received plans from certain airlines to expand the use of electronic devices on their airports.
Delta and JetBlue are part of the companys that have already submitted plans.
“In the context of the plan, we might be able to approve an enlarged use of electronic devices nextly” said the FAAA in a statement.
Currently, passengers must eject their smartphones, tablets and other devices since the airport is closed.
They are not ceased to ralent them before the air reaches a height of 10 000 feet and that the commander gives its green fire.
Passengers are supposed to disappear their devices during the aircraft before the aircraft and do not flood them until the airport is laid down.
In accordance with the new directives, airlines whose aircraft is correctly protected from electronic interference may authorize passengers to use their devices during displayment, airrising and land road, the FAAA said.
Most new line airports and other aircrafts that have been amended so that passengers could use Wi-Fi to higher heights should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Asociation of Professional Flight expectants, welcomed these changes.
“After the new policy implemented in all security – and we will work closely with transporters for this – it will be profitable to the world”, explained Glading in a statement.
We are explicitly excited to feeling as "room supervisors" when this matter is.
But it will always be prohibited to connect to the Internet to surfer, exchange emails and SMSs or download data below 10,000 feet, said the Agent.
Passengers must put their smartphones, tablets and other aircraft devices.
So not always by Words With Friends, the online style player Scrabble played by the actor Alec Baldwin on his smartphone in 2011 when he was thrown out with a sound of a American Airlines aircraft after he refused to get out its device while the device was kept at the door.
And the hardest devices such as the portable computers must always be rolled because they could hurt someone if they fly through the cab.
The port phones on the boat will also be prohibited.
The regulatory power on portfolio phones belongs to the Federal Communications of the Commission and not FAAA.
FAA can prohibite some electronic devices during disappearing and airrising
Last month, Mark Rosenker of National Transport Safety Board, National Transport Safety Expert on CBS News, stated that portable phones were always considered as a risk.
"The portable phones are really a problem, not only because they could possibly create interferences with navigation instruments, but because we know, according to the FCC, that they could perturb the mobile telephone lines if they are used on boat," said Rosenker.
A industrial consultation committee created by the FAAA to consider the problem has recommended the last month that the Government authorizes a broader use of personal devices.
The pressure on the FAAA has been strengthened in the past years in order to complement restrictions on their use.
Detractors such as Senator Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., believe that there is no valid security reason for these prohibitions.
The restrictions are also more difficult to apply because the use of devices has become absolute.
Some studies indicate that at least one third of the passengers are forgotten to enhance their devices, or they do it solvedly.
The FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1996, following interference reports with navigation and communication instruments when passengers moved radios, high-tech gadget.
The new line aircraft depends much more of the electric systems than the previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed to rescue the electronic interference and approved by the FAAA.
Airlines allow their passengers to use the Wi-Fi at crowd heights for several years.
The modified aircraft for accommodation of Wi-Fi systems is also better to interference.
The wide majority of line aircraft should allow larger use of electronic devices under the new directives, Huerta said.
Electronic devices today are generally emitted by radio transmissions more low than the previous generations of devices.
The readers of electronic books, for example, are only emitted minimum transmissions when a page is turned.
But the transmissions are stronger when the TV devices are money or send data.
Amazon.com is part of those who make pressure for enlargement of restrictions concerning the use of electronic devices by passengers.
In 2011, the company's leaders charged a Learning Line of Child Book Readers and flighted it to see whether there were problems, but there was no.
This inspired members of the Advisory Committee of the FAAA’s feelings with regard to the question of whether the use of devices present or not a risk.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he thought that the interference from devices was real, even though the risk was minime.
Other members of the Committee stated that there were only anecdotic reports from pilots that indicate that devices can interfere with a aircraft systems and that most of them are very elderly.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAAA authorize pilots to request passengers to complete their devices during the aircraft to instruments in low visibility conditions.
A train industry group welcomed changes, calling them full sense arrangements for technological travellers.
"We are happy that FAAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not incompatible with security", said Roger Dow, President and Director of the U.S. Travel Association.
A heliterated bird of a platform in the north sea was left in the nature
A bird, helitroused after being found out on a petrol platform in the north sea, was released in the nature.
The water wheel was mounted by a helicopter in direction of Abdaen the last month before it was thrown on foot by the SPCA in its rescue centre of Alloa.
The centre director Colin Seddon said: “This water rid of likely was a winter migrant who came from Northern Europe and found it in the middle of violent winds in the north sea.”
It seems that the eating bird would be successful to find refugees on the petrol platform.
He added: "It was not able to move again, so we were contacted to bring our help."
The water wheel was in a good health when he was left.
Is the European election ready to do business with the Great Britain?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the promise of gathering businesses and to define what the creators of riches and employees want to see change in our relationship with the EU.
To do this, we have commanded the broadest and full survey to the British leaders and asked them what they thought about the Great Britain, the firms and the EU.
YouGov asked more than 1 000 enterprises, globally representatives of all business sizes, sectors and regions of Great Britain.
The findings of the investigation will be a surprise for many.
We have discovered that the wide majority of enterprises are now trying to export outside Europe, focusing on countries modernising and developing while the EU is wandering States.
They want to see the Government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil rather than to enhance in the long and harsh process of reform of European institutional arcanes.
When they are requested their opinion on specific political points – through the regulation of monopolies on products — the majority of business leaders believe that the control of these key skills should return to Westminster's hands.
The unique market has offered a general comprehensiveness, the enterprises say that the cost of Brussels is disproported in comparison with the benefits of the European exchange zone – 40% of the larger enterprises, traditionally the most pro-European, are also agreed.
Finally, and whatever we are talking, our investigation at the heads of business showed that a majority wanted to see Britain's Great Britain to continue the initiatives to change the treaty and development of a relationship with the EU based on trade and not policy.
This conclusion, which is found in all large groups and enterprises of all sizes, shows that the world of the enterprises is an " significant change" that reduces the power to the United Kingdom.
The bonds are high – to change the treaty and better represent the interests of Britain would allow 16% of the votes for the maintenance of the EU in a referendum.
The First Minister should not doubt one moment: this investigation shows that British enterprises support this plan to renew the terms of accession of the United Kingdom to the EU.
It also shows that enterprises hope that the renewal will be a significant change in the current balance of power for return to the United Kingdom.
It is possible, and further needed, to represent the interests of the British enterprises, as the euro area engages on the way of a closer economic and fiscal unit.
The priority must be the employment and growth in Great Britain and, as the conclusions of our survey shows that, for the enterprises, this means to re-enable the focus on trade and a fundamental change of the regulatory approach in Brussels.
The United States in Halloween's Colors
In the United States, President Obama has not dismissed the tradition of Halloween.
With his wife, last night, he distributed flyings to hundreds of children invited in the gardens of the Maison-Blanche in Washington.
Last year, Halloween's festivals on the coast is the United States were canceled because of the Ouragan Sandy's transition.
This year, the festivals were therefore ratified.
In New York, thousands of cosmetics participated in the organised parade in the area of "Greenwich village".
Everyone is over-except, tells one of the participants, Andrea.
I could finally put the costume that I had planned last year.
We're fucking like fous, added Rhonda.
People are happy.
He's a good kid, it's cool.
We really need that.
Halloween is a Palestinian feast dedicated to the guard of allsaint, mostly in English-saxons countries.
Alexei Miller de Gazprom states that the Gazprom gaz in Bulgaria is a new gas rail
The starting of the South Stream construction in Bulgaria marks the launch of one of the largest energy projects in Europe, the Director of Gazprom said.
"A historic event has been done today: the construction started in the South Stream bobbling part of the South Stream, the most important project in Europe", explained Alexei Miller, the Director-General of Gazprom, in a Thursday declaration.
This project is a key element of energy security throughout the European continent.
South Stream should enable the diversification of Russian export paths to Europe.
A contractual disparity between Gazprom and its Ukrainian homologgue, which passes the largest part of the Russian gas intended to Europe, increases the level of risk relating to conventional paths, adds the director.
Miller added that the direct mission to Bulgaria, member of the European Union, means that geopolitical risks related to transit countries are eliminated "forever".
Bulgarian consumers will receive the South Stream gas to a reduced rate since the whole project will be set up in 2015.
Gazprom stated that construction should be launched in other countries at the end of the year.
The gas was designed for an annual capacity of 63 billion meters of natural gas.
Pitcairn wants to create the largest sea reserve of the world
Pitcairn island wants to create the largest sea reserve of the world, announced Thursday The News of Tahiti, taking a radio information from Australia.
This island, on the east of the Gambier Archive (France Polynesia), is the last British region of South Pacific, in mid-chemin between New Zealand and Chili.
This territory measures 47 km2, if there are three other nearby small islands.
It is British since his occupation in 1790 by the Bounty Municians, episode of the history of English marine, which has led to three hollywood adaptions.
Some tens of inhabitants, most of the Bounty's inhabitants, are still Pitcairn, and their income depends on 95% of the generosity of London.
The Island Council voted one-way for the creation of a marine reservation around the small archipelago, as well as 836,000 km2, which correspond to its exclusive economic zone.
A member of the island's island in London went to ask the Great Britain to validate this request.
Mike Warren, Pitcairn Maire, thinks that the creation of such a protected area would be a first step towards the financial autonomy for its island.
The project must be accepted by the English Governor of Pitcairn, resident in New Zealand, and by the British Government.
The establishment of such a marine reservation would allow the United Kingdom to sanctify these 836,000 km2, however, in the condition of having the means of monitoring it, which is not the case.
There is no airport in Pitcairn, which makes it impossible to base one or more airports granted to the survey of the area, and there is no port where putting military monitoring vessels.
With regard to France, it must already take the very costful air monitoring and maritime of five million km2 from French Polinesia, near Pitcairn.

Life Price for a old Chinese vice-governmenter
A former Vice-President of the province of Jilin, north-west of China, was condemned on Friday to life prison for corruption.
Excluding the Communist Party in July 2012, Tian Xueren was accused of having touched more than 19 million yuan pots-de-vin, reporting Chinese official media.
Between 1995 and 2001, the Vice-President, who was also the President of the Jilin Bank, a public institution, helped businesses and companies to obtain contracts, prêts or promotions for money or cadeau exchange, said the first Intermediary Court of Pékin on its microblog.
The President Xi Jinping, who took its functions on March last, made the fight against corruption a national priority, considering that the phenomenon was a threat to the Communist Party itself.
If the Chief of the State promised that justice would also be iniquitable with the powerful "tigre" as with the "muchles" - the sub-altern officials - only a poster of high-rang licensees were condemned, including the former frameworks of the petrolier Petrochina.
The recent case was the old chief of the PCC in Chongqing, Bo Xilai, who was condemned to live in September for corruption and abus of power after the highest functions in the State.
But the Government did not demonstrate the intention of reform the system of combating corruption by for example creating an independent body of the party.
Two employees of the MICA accused of sexual aggression by allegations formulated against Jonathan Lord, in a hearing of the Royal Commission.
Two employees of the Southern New Galles were accused of sexual aggression against children following allegations formulated against Caringbah teachers, Jonathan Lord, in 2011, in an audience of the Royal Commission on Children's Self-Againstance.
But in its opening statement before the Commission, the MICA stated that he had never to address a problem of sexual attack on children within his organization.
The Director-General Phillip Hare was questioned on two cases: a MICA employee was accused of infringements regarding child pornographie and a physical education currency of YMCA Caringbah Hall was recognized by sexual attacks on children in the centre where he worked in 1991.
Mr. Hare said to Gail Furness, advisory lawyer to the Commission, that he had known the first case but that he was not on the second.
It also admitted that the opening declaration of the MECA was inadequate, “the external controls of the MICA were carried out and indicated that children ' s security was an absolute priority for the organization”.
It was demonstrated before the Commission that MECA had been informed that it had received the worst seconds of four institutions in an audit quality of the Department of Education and Communities in August this year.
Mr. Hare, who began to work at the 21-year-old YMCA, agreed that the management of the staff was an outcome with the Lord's recruitment and that he refused to verify that employees knew they had to report any violation of the security policy of children.
Before the year, Lord was condemned for sexual attacks on twelve boys during the two years in which he worked at MICA.
He was condemned at a 6-year-old prison penalty.
But Mr. Hare rejected the idea that the MICA would have a cultural problem which prevents staff to report the lack of Lord against child security.
The members of the staff stated that they had observed some misconditions, including the fact that Lord remained alone with the children, who kept them privately, assembled them on their genes, said he loved them and let them play with his portable phone.
Danielle Ockwell, who was headed by the Lord and asked for a training on children ' s protection because she was concerned of her behaviour, showed that she was responsible for the children of the MICA Caringbah, Jacqui Barnat, who would lead to the Lord “really intimidable and difficult to approve the most of the time”.
The Director-General said that he rejected the witnesses of the staff, as they were retained to report these lacks to their higher herarch.
Instead, he stated that the friendly relations they undertaken with the Lord broke their judgment, which they did not report its actions.
Mr. Hare declared that he had expressed its view before the MICA Council of New Galles of the South Wales, saying that, for the organization, the lesson sent by the "Independent Jonathan Lord" should not be concerned "signification" by the staff, and the advice was agreed with him.
Mr. Hare said that the decision to sign the staff of confidential agreements, notwithstanding the allegations, was taken by the Director-General of the MICA for Children's Services, Liam Whitley.
He stated that this decision was intended to avoid any pollution of evidence, but that it was a “soil exceptive” and that it had been badly implemented.
The Southern New Galles YMCA was not a secure organization for children at the time that Jonathan Lord had been employed between 2009 and 2011, the expert on sexual violence on children, the professor Stephen Kleinbone of the University of Griffith before the Commission.
He stated that there were serious problems in recruitment, control, initiative, training and supervision of staff.
The audience was earned until 20 December.
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to return the Prime Minister, but it recognizes that his return is little likely.
In an interview last night with the fifth anniversary of his start at the end of his mandate, the man of 59 years had known his opinion on various national policies.
Since its decade in June 2007 after a decade to the country's head, Mr. Blair largely avoided discussion of the British policy, limiting its comments to foreign affairs and its special role of the Quarter for the Peace Process to the Middle East.
When we asked him if he would like to find the job of Prime Minister, Mr Blair would answer, according to the Standard Evening of London: "Yes, of course, but it may happen, so..."
When many experts in extreme events were gathered in Cardiff to face and bring the trough of the Cheval of the year, they knew that the competition would be red.
But nobody expected to win Fenton Kirkland, a child of three years.
Not yet at school and just a few months after having made his first arms, all-country and his position Shetland Toffee shot over the three tours with great easyness and fetched the first price behind them the 30 other adult concurrents.
The two inseparable – which are the same size – have been welcomed for the presentation, attitude and style during the annual concours that took place in the Sonnybank Strip, Rudry near Cardiff.
Becoming against men and women in elective holes, he put his box on the side a little depressed way to challenge his placey Toffee's two-year place around the track.
Fenton was welcomed by judges for its natural qualitys of little common clothing for a child of his age.
And Toffee received very good notes for his presentation and personality.
Fenton had Toffee in cadeau for her 3th birthday in March last, and entered with his place Shetland every day.
Her mother Donna, 30 years old, said: “Fenton and Toffee are a excellent two. ”
They were presented towards and against all, but both shot the cup in gold and the rock.
It was only the second time he concoursed with Toffee and we were crazy of joy he gained.
On the street, people who didn't know him thought he was so fenomenal that they wanted to make a photograph with him.
This young boy, from the village of Nantyglo, near Ebbw Vale, in the south of the Galles country, follows the traces of his turtle Sharon Howells, who participates in extreme concourses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Howells said, "There was electricity in the air, and everybody encouraged it and applaudied it."
He moved all the length of the current track and even if he seemed to be very small, he made a wonderful work.
Fenton is fool of animals – he loves horses, traders and rural worlds and has two pools where he cares.
In the way he started, he will certainly take part of the Cheval’s manifestation of the year – and I am sure he will make a beautiful performance.
An annual earliest manifestation port stated: "Fenton has only three years but he knows how to lead his place."
They're for a good team.
The judges noted that Fenton and Toffee had well presented and the way they challenged on the street.
They are looking for an effective team work between the placey and the owner – Fenton and Toffee were the best on the track.
I'm sure his beautiful clothes helped Fenton, he was really funny.
A Chinese magazine who started a call “It will be restored ”
A Chinese journal that has launched an appeal on the first page for the release of an accused distributed journalist will be restored, says a regular pressure regulator.
The New Express based on Guangzhou published a rare public call for the release of Chen Yongzhou journalist.
But Mr. Chen later admitted the television that he had accepted pots-de-vin to produce stories on a half-populated society.
The New Express will now submit a "comprehensive refund", said the regulator.
The order of "Re-response" is of the administration of Guangdon for Press and Edition, Radio, Film and Television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the New Express, belonging to the Yangcheng Evening News Group, had published several erroneous articles on the zoomlion company between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editing of New Express was unorganized,” said the regulator in a statement.
He stated that he had decided to "impose an administrative sanction in Chen Yongzhou by taking his press card".
He also commanded the Yangcheng Evening Group to undertake a complete refund of New Express, and recommended that he conducted an investigation on persons responsible at New Express and immediately retain the journal management team.”
Mr. Chen wrote several articles for the New Express on financial irregularities provided by a producer of cancer engines called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, his newspaper published a first page call for his release, writeing that he supported his journalism.
But Mr. Chen's then appeared on a public television chain where he admitted false stories against money.
"In this case, I dismissed Zoomlion as well as the media industry and its ability to gain public confidence," said he in the CCTV public televisioned network.
I did it mostly because I'd run after money and celebration.
I thought about my mistake.
Following the excuses by Mr. Chen, New Express published its excuses in the first page, writeing that he did not correctly verify its articles.
Several major suspects recently made televisioned.
The experts say that people are systematically prohibited to make their abuse, despite a change in the law which has been voted early in the year, prohibiting the authorities to force any one to defend himself.
Char-de-Gaulle is "insufficient"
Toulon, the door car is rade.
The radioactive vapour flight on one of the two nuclear chauffers of Charles-de-Gaul, the mid-October and when the ship was found in the sea, was "such dangerous for marines," but it is not without consequence for Marine.
The Royale is in fact to confirm us "insufficient" of the ship until the mid-November," "the time to take the correct measures imposed" on the reactor.
On its side, the DCNS, specialist of the Defence Naval, ensures that its teams and those in Airva, which are described in the Var for the opportunity, "the airports are currently involved."
It is, among others, to change a pump on the defective chauffure.
"All is implemented so that Charles-de-Gaulle can make its planned deployment at the end of 2013," DCNS explains.
And the National Marine to certify that it does not rely on the nuclear activity programme.
Remember that the carrier Charles-de-Gaulle is out of a six-month intermediary period of maintenance.
He appeared from Toulon at mid-octobre for a training.
This, inter alia, to qualify young pilots.
A "avarian competence", surrounded in the reactor's confidence space, was then produced on the friendly ship of the French fleet.
According to the National Marine, the equipage was not exposed to an eventual radioactive pollution.
Since more than one year, I have also found a strong comprehensive part of the people I meet: monstery review of their own properties, tax deployment, allowances of all kinds, administrative costs to no longer end.
Bref, unlimited synthesis of our poches.
Millions of dilapidated dollars could be disappeared in order to allow greatly respectable taxation of those drunks.
Any money taken from force to contributions reduces their freedom of consumption and contributes to their support.
In Shawinigan, despite the closure of all major enterprises, it is not aware of the summer expenditures and the maintenance of drinking canards: deficiency cultural centre, strong subvention in the Energy City, etc.
If these installations are not rentable, they are selled to the private company or disappeared.
There is also a view to the expansion of several properties in order to acquire a major industry that has never come.
However, I give a honorable mention to the transformation of the old Wabasso in a kind of industrial incubator, but what costs for tax payers?
This is not the public pallets to invest in such enterprises, but the private sector based on the application of the consumer.
Citizens were happy to learn that the Lakes in the Preche and Piles will continue to approve the city in potable water.
Following the start of all industry (group water consumption) and the large population decline, water use has significantly reduced everywhere in the territory.
Without intending to play it, the city will never miss water and severe regulation for its use could be greatly adjusted.
In summary, it is very easy to realize great things with the money of others.
I'd be ashamed to defend such a budget.
With a huge debt over $200 million, this city is not even more capable of buying a stylo without passing through an implant regulation.
We've been driven for over 40 years by cravates with beautiful diplomas for most, and I don't think that a moonshearer makes worse.
Discover of a tunnel of drugs between the United States and Mexico that have their own iron path
One of the most sophisticated tunnels served for drug trafficking between the United States and Mexico, available from its own lighting, ventilation and electric rail systems, was discovered.
The American authorities described the tunnel of 4 feet by 3 as one of the secret pasts that they never had seen.
The tunnel, zigzagans a length of approximately six football terraces, railing the interposite near Tijuana, Mexico, San Diego, the United States.
The area of undeterminable interfaces, which allows to easily dissolute drug camions.
The tunnel has been closed before drugs were sent out inseparable, the authorities said.
The authorities have provided 8,5 tonnes of marijuana and 148 kg of cocaine after the discovery of the tunnel, according to the judicial dossiers.
Three men who, according to the authorities, were working as chauffors, were accused of marijuana ownership and cocaine with the purpose of sale.
They call for a penalty penalty from 10 years to the perpetual conclusion if they are condemned.
In Nogales, the trafics in Arizona operate large subterritory draining channels.
The tunnel is the eighth important transition found in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the largest tunnels have been discovered following marijuana recruitment in Mexico in October, with a challenge for drug cards which must quickly deliver their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found an approximately 700 degrees equipped with iron roads from the kitchen of a Tijuana house and went up to two apartments of San Diego.
The British police delivers an extradition mandate against Asange
Today, the British police has issued an exchange mandate against the WhikiLeaks founder of Julian Assange, who has fled to the Ecuador Ambassador in London and asked the political asile.
Scotland Yard said that she had released a “release opinion” against Australia for 40 years, asking him to present a police commissioner, adding that if it did not, it might be arrested.
Asjor may be extraditioned in Sweden following the allegations of sexual offence, after exacerving all possible ways under the British law after the Supreme Court had invalidated the appeal he had interjected against his extradition at the beginning of the month.
In fact, Stockholm authorizes its transfer to the United States, he found refugees to the Ecuador Ambassador in London on 19 June, requesting that South America's political asile country.
Scotland Yard has “released an advisor against a man of 40 years that asked him to present himself to a police officer at the date and time of his choice," said a speaker.
It continues to free the conditions of its release under precaution.
Ambassade refused to comment the release of the opinion by the police.
He is afraid to be extraditioned from Sweden to the United States where it could be accused of spionage, after exhibiting more than 250,000 American diplomatic chambers on the WikiLeaks website against secret information.
How biometria will cause our lives
Find the ticket password to access your smartphone or pay your purchases?
American, French or Japanese researchers predict a future where we will be recognized by biometric captors of telephones and computers.
Bernard Didier, Adjunta General Director of Morpho , believes that the centuries will be biometric.
Only biometria will allow you to ensure the identity of a person who performs transactions in a universe as transverse and transnational as Internet .
The organizations devoted to the protection of private life confirm this engagement for biometria, but are concerned.
In 2011 and France, the National Commission for Information and Freedoms authorized 774 systems of recognition of the emperor systems, the form of the hand or the vessel of the hands in enterprises, administrations, cantines...
"All the world will soon be identified, anywhere and anywhere," said Justin Brookman, responsible for the private life of consumers within the CDT (Center for Democracy and Technology), Washington.
The reasons of such optimism, at each, and evilism, in others?
Biometria will support new technologies, which will allow citizens and consumers to provide new services.
Today, in France, the most used biometric data are digital printings, the main account and the veining of the powder or fingers.
But every one of these techniques poses its limits.
"For example, some people who work the beton have the very abborded fingers and their owners are unfair", says Philip Robin, technical Director of the identity at Thales Communications & Security.
And the recruitment as well as the verification of the vessel and the accounting of the hand must be a voluntary and specific manager of persons.
It's now a security - you can't capture these data from their insu - and unconvenient: the procedure may sometimes be repeated and then take time.
Consequence, research are carried out for a 20 years on other approaches, such as the recognition of face or income (the colored part of the eye).
By increased the specification of captors and calculation of computers required for the analysis of the data, these techniques become operational.
In the past five years, Cyrille Bataller, R-D-Accenture Laboratory Director was multiplied by 10.
With our assistance, the United Kingdom and Holland have developed automatic border posts using facial recognition.
It is now possible to identify a face or a movement.
"Today, we have research on the recognition of the voice or how to walk in the help of sound captors, but we need a quiet environment," says Mrs. Iyengar, manager of security research at the Labs.
The DNA also arise hopes and concerns.
"In the current state of knowledge, it may be considered as the last biometric data," confirms Sophie Vulliet-Tavernier, Research Director, innovation and prospective to CNIL.
But the DNA analysis is still very long and very costful.
The NEC proposes the judicial police services a cost cost of EUR 90,000 to analyze ADN samples on the place of crime and at an hour.
Biometry uses are divided in two groups: identification (reconciliation a person among others) and authentication (as ensure that the person is the one that is to be).
The identification was to present the release of papers of identity: it must be compared to the biometric elements (empty, photos, going) with the information that the State has on all already established citizens.
This allows you to ensure that no person is trying to use the identity of one another.
This comparison principle may have other applications.
The NEC offers the recognition of VIP at the entry of a hotel or a store.
"We recover the pictures of monitoring cameras and comparisons with the photos of certificates that are freely circulated on the Internet", explain Dany Nassif, charged at the NEC France, of commercial development for biometric identification solutions.
Another use: take in photo one who makes the shock in a store, follows its progress through the facial recognition and calculating the waiting time.
The authentication was on the start of physical access (borns, protected places, cantines...) or logical (allowing a computer).
There has been recently added to the presence control.
"An biometric pointer avoids the phenomenon of the cop that points for another", justifys Cyrille Bataller, d'Accenture.
However, further, the authentication will also concern transactions, particularly those carried out from devices connected to the Internet.
In Japan it is already possible to remove money from some distributors by introducing his card and puting his hand on a biometric reader: this man replaces the flag of the secret code.
An similar technology is tested at Villeneuve-d'Ascq and Angolaême by Natural Security Society in partnership with banks and teachers of the large distribution: at the time of paying a store with its bank card, the customer does not touch its code but introduced his finger into a reader that scanns the veins.
Experience is planned for six months.
If it is concluded, biometric readers could soon come to the French traders.
Paths to re-user users
There are three ways to make the biometry seduced in the eyes of the great public.
The first is to explain that it can gain time.
"If a client remains in thirty seconds at least, it is appreciable," said the director of a great surface.
The second is to offer personal services: in a few years, a voice server can recognize your voice and offer options on measure.
And, finally, re-ensuring precautions to protect databases.
"The digital printings are stored on a first server; the person's identities are in a second basis: the correlation between the two numbers is encrypted and stored in a highly secure bottle, which is blocked if we try to move it," reports Philip Robin, of Thales.
But, a fault of comprehensive studies, it is impossible to know if these speakers are really convinced by users.
The specialists of private life protection continue to worry about them.
"The progress of facial recognition, the multiplication of cameras of monitoring and the large number of photos available on Facebook, Flickr or Picasa, make me afraid of the worse: a generalized monitoring," said Andrew Patrick, Commissioner for Private Life Protection in Canada.
A roaring driver at 210 km/h with a warm drink between the legs appeared to inflict a middle of $1,000
A motorist was introduced by an amendment of $1,000 to be rotated at 210 km/h with a warm wine set in balance between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35 years old, from Tiptree in the Essex, was returned to his Mercedes Benz on the A120 height of Braintree on 27 May.
When the police stopped it, they discovered the drink to bear between his legs.
In the Court of First Instance of Colchester, Howie approved the infraction of behaviour without awareness and the necessary attention.
The seven points taken on its authorisation have resulted in a 6-month release.
Howway was also condemned to pay expenditures at $90, and a surtaxe for the victim of EUR 100.
A tax on foreign property owners to make the Londres bottle
The Treasury has expected a final decision by Mr. Osborne in 2012, which included 7 per cent for the costs of more than 2 million and annual costs for buyers who choose to hold properties under a company instead of individual title.
The right of the ceiling is already applicable to the resident properties of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, and represents 708 M. on the financial year 2012/13, which exceeds the total amount of Northern Ireland, Galles, Economia, Northwest, Northwest and the Yorkshire region, and Humber.
Mr. Cook said: "Suced to increase the bottle right on great value properties and the introduction of the Anti-Ejecting Law in the matter is very difficult to advance that large value properties are undertaken independently of the effects of the absolute housing tax system."
"But this change could make for foreign investors retaining the idea of buying properties in London or current owners to the sale", added.
The immobility of prestige – 5 to 10% of the highest prices in the real estate market – in the south-west sector of Londres, which lived from Fulham in Wimbledon, has increased a 11.8% record in the past year.
The prices in the centre of London shown a regular growth of an year by 5,6% but have been explicited by a "Internal Market" in full growth, the southwest of the city (7.4%) and the east (6.5%) with a recovery, according to Savills’ studies.
Scientists are going to light how the dog's dog movements are bound to his humor.
Previous studies showed that the dogs had more happy moved their right (on the dog's view), while nervous dogs moved it more to the left.
But now scientists say that dogs can detect these sub-tile differences and answer it.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientific of the Trente University, said: “Allone knows that, in man, the left side and the right side of the brain are differently involved in the stimules that experiencing positive or negative emotions.”
Here, we tried to see what he was in other species.
He added that as in man, in the dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for the movement to the left and ahead of the verse, and that the two hemifers played a different role in emotions.
In order to learn more about how dogs respond to disordered dog movements from other dogs, researchers followed animals to look at films with other dogs.
They measured the heart frequency of animals and analyzed their behaviour.
It will certainly not need long before we understood why their neck is sometimes on the other side and sometimes.
Professor Vallortigara explained: “We have presented the dogs of other dogs – or a natural version or a silhouette to avoid any other factor of confusion – and we could move the shock move and present it as to the left or right.”
When the animals saw a dog without expression refer to the right (in the view of the dog retreat), they remained perfectly spread.
But when they repeated a head turning to the left ( again once again from the dog's point of view, their heart frequency has accelerated and they had anxious air.
Professional Vallortigara said he was not thinking that dogs were communicating freely among them through these movements.
It is thinking that dogs know experiencely the movements they should or should not worry about.
He added: "If you meet several times of other dogs and if you notice that most of them, the movement of their rock towards one side is linked to a more friendly attitude and that the right side leads a less friendly attitude, you will react in response to this experience."
Researchers indicate that the results could allow owners, veterinaries and leaders to better appreciate the emotions of their animals.
John Bradshaw, Professor for Veterinary Science School of Bristol, explained that this was not the first study to consider the importance of the left and right at the cancer species.
In the past year, a Lincoln University team found that dogs turned the head to the left when they looked at aggressive dog and right when it was a happy dog.
And in another scientific study carried out by the University of Victoria in Canada, he stated: "The dogs were easier to a rob dog when his knee moved to the left rather than to the right, instead of become anxious, the inverse of what is in the Italian study."
He stated that the differences could come from the fact that dogs who participated in the various studies did not fully consider film animals or dogs like dogs.
A study on how dogs respond to true dogs could be useful, did it explain.
“Although many elements, covered at different mammifères, indicate that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, many details must still be specificed – and dogs do not exclude," said he.
However, given the easyness with which their behaviour can be registered, it will certainly not need long before we understood why their rock is sometimes moved from one side and sometimes from the other.

The Dad François gives his first cardinals in February
The Dad François nommers of new cardinals of the Catholic Church for the first time on 22 February, announced the Vatican Vatican Thursday.
The cardinals are the men of the highest church in the Catholic Church behind the Pope, and those who eligite it, so François will notify his first group of men who will choose in definitively his successor.
It is now 201 cardinals.
However, since a cardinal reaches the age of 80 years, it can no longer participate in the selection of a Dad – so it becomes a group of 120 “selected cardinal”.
In a statement announced the new, the father Lombardi, a Vatican Port, said that a meeting with all existing cardinals would be held before the ceremony during which the witnesses will be high to the cardinal dignity known under the name of the composition.
“Pabe François decided to communicate its decision to convene the composition of February to facilitate the planning of other meetings that need cardinals from different parts of the world” said Lombardi.
Jack Valio de Catholic Vix says that from February, the number of election cardinals will probably decline.
He said that a dad was named in general as much of cardinals that he had to do so that the number of cardinals elected is 120 and so many cardinals aged over 80 years he wanted.
The consisting of the next year will be important because it will be the first since the election of the Pope François in March of this year, said Valero.
For now there is a kind of tendance to privilege Europe and especially Italy.
“It will be interested to see if the new nommer dad of the rest of the world to restore the balance” he added.
40 per cent of the Roman Catholics live in South America, but a small number of cardinals represent them.
The cardinals will also be the first to be chosen since François has formed the cardinal Council, an eight-cardinal group of the whole world in order to review the ways of reform the church.
Before the dad decided to be alone.
"Deshormais, François chosen these eight cardinals to be aware of it," explained Valero.
He added that it was "actually possible" that François asked cardinal advice.
But we never knew such a situation – it's totally new.
Valero indicated that the dads were generally eleving large representatives of large communities at the cardinal road, but that Francis was “pleasing surprises — so we don’t know who he is nutzing. ”
GM reminds some of its new captures to the United States to repair the home folder
General Motors Co reminds about 19,000 of all its new chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 2014 to address a problem with manually inclinable maps, according to a Friday declaration of the American security organization.
In some cases, the seats were able to present a standard at the level of an enclosing mechanism.
Consequently, the maps do not comply with the federal security standards of the vehicles in relation to main support.
"If the vehicle is damaged by the back, the head-up cannot be proteined correctly by passors, which increases the risk of wounds," as shown on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The models mentioned were built between 1 August and 10 September.
The GM discharge began in June and represents the most important starting of vehicles for the first American vehicle since its faillite and restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the standard capture owners during the first 15th of October.
NHTSA could not consider the information letter to the owners because of the 16 days of government activities arrest, which has increased the growth of vehicle sales in October.
Silverado and Sierra's sales, who have been resumed for the 2014 model, increased approximately 20% during the first 10 months of the year, said GM Friday.
In October, GM sold 42 660 Silverado and 16 503 captures Sierra.
The GM's action course was 1,4 per cent to reach $37.47 at the start of New York on Friday.
A worker dies under beton blocks
A construction worker is surrounded under tens of beton blocks, Thursday before middle, in Montreal.
The drame occurred at 11:00 on the Marquette street, all around the street of Beaubien, in Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie.
According to any indeed, funding work had been moved to this place since a certain time.
A meteo-based wall came to be erred during the last days.
The accident occurred when the victim was coming to the cancer to recover its tools.
I went through the car and I saw the wall smoking with a great smoke cloud, said Sylvain John, who remains near the cancer.
I was disappeared, and I went to take the big bricks that could find him.
We've seen a part of his dose, it's so bad.
According to the authorities, the victim is an age in the 50-year-old who worked for a cooperative company.
Reanimation managers were designed by emergency services but without success.
Man hasn't overlooked his serious wounds.
A Inspector of the Commission on Health and Working Security has been described on the places to investigate circumstances around this drama.
Crisis to disappear an Obama's election
I voted two times for President Obama, believed in the possibility of change.
He said that Obama had made a pleasure efforts made by the obstructionism of the Republic's Party
Obstructionnisme does not excuse the difficulties of the Obamacare site, nor dron attacks
The memory of the 2008 campaign of Obama is a triste memory of what could happen
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year-old medical doctor in Harvard’s Faculty.
I'm now reading a crazy book these days.
It's a book that I thought would encourage me during the 2nth year of doctor's morrow and would resolve the hope.
His name is "The Audacity to Win" and is the memories of the President of the Barack Obama campaign in 2008.
When I ended my patients' medical accounts evening and sleeping, this book tells me when the policies inspired millions of people and where the speakers could cut you.
The election was completed by a extensive victory and the newspaper presenters took time to consider the historic nature of the time.
My camarads laughed with gladness, and my parents kept all the newspaper they found.
A young visioning team came to the House-Blanche and the nation was ready to change.
During the transition period of Obama prior to its work in 2008, 82 per cent of views were favourable.
And then I'll close the book.
The return to the present is a difficult wake, it's like out of a dream.
It is difficult to recall these full days of optimism, these are as far as memories, a triste memory of the opportunities of the past.
The change occurred in the years which followed the first time I voted.
It had nothing to see with what I imagined.
I lay down the credit of Obama's great achievements, since the transition of the Approvable Care Act (Oussama Ben Laden) until the start of our army, through the end of the "not known" and the murder of Oussama Ben Laden.
Furthermore, I believe that the Particing Obstructionnis has destroyed too many efforts to make our nation progress in the field of immigration reforms, public health care and the locking of Guantánamo, among other things.
But after many times I have defended Obama's administration faces my pairs and my colleagues, I can't provide explanations.
I'm on the side of the political disappearance.
Republic Obstruction cannot explain the hearing of foreign leaders, or the attacks of unfair foreign children by drone.
It cannot explain that the National Security Agency recovers data on the Private Life of Americas, or the Appeal of Denonceers that reveals the mereless of the Government.
It cannot justify the murder of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, without proceedings, or the removal of public financing and the expenditure authorized during the presidential campaigns.
She cannot justify the conclusions of a report that says that the efforts of the House-Blanche to reduce the media to silence are “agressive... since Nixon’s administration”.
And, less recently, she cannot excuse the possibility of obtaining a simple Internet website for more than three years after the Chare Act has been ratified.
I don't know if it's what I'm waiting for.
If, at 18 years, I was supposed to understand that the government could contrary to the political campaigns previously.
Of course, the electoral function is not predictable, because the opposition policy party and the events that happen by harmfulness, such as the Newton Mask, affect our public conversation.
However, all the examples I have revealed above appear to be mostly the choice of the administration.
That's what I'm worse.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was enthusiased by his candidate.
Middle Romney presented a confusional and little raffined alternative that could not be able to determine its policies or positions.
I felt that Obama, elected for a second mandate, freed from the pressure of future elections, would hold the promises that we had been talking for so long.
However, while the favourable viewing indicator has lowered by 45 per cent this week, it is even more difficult to return to 2008 through this book.
He wants me to desire the many promises that have been made.
This week, I read the part of the book that describes how Obama had lost great benefits from Clinton to Pennsylvane Princes.
During a following campaign meeting, he said to his team that they should turn on the right way and remain faithful in their cause.
"I want us to recently on our talent," said he.
We have to remember who we are.
We are five years later, Mr President, and I am not along with you.
The point of view expressed in this comment is only those of Nathaniel Morris.
Friday, at 15:00, a violent collection between a moto and a car produced Retinne street in Fleron.
The motard, Jonathan, 26 years old, from Fleron, wasn't a case.
Despite the rapid intervention of aid, it is dead during this border collection.
Clive Palmer claims that Tony Abbott has an interest conflict on the parental congé system.
The Deputy of Clive Palmer advanced that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has an interest conflict on the parental consent system because his girls could be married and benefited from this system.
The majority of the mining extraction, which affects the payment of a carbon tax of $6, has dealt that argument to try to disappear questions concerning a possible conflict.
The United Party Palmer could control up to four voices in the Senate, which might be crucial at the time of decideing whether carbon and minor taxes must be removed.
But Mr. Palmer said that only ministers could have an interest conflict and stated that Mr Abbott’s girls were ready to benefit personally from these policies.
“There will be an important interest conflict when it is going to pay the parental consent, because if one of her daughters is married, he will have direct interest in the fact that it will receive or not a congé," said Mr. Palmer.
Two months after the election, the electoral commission officially declared Mr. Palmer's seat of Sunshine Coast of Fairfax by 53 votes after receipt.
Mr. Palmer has developed the idea of a re-enforcement of the provision system to accelerate the process.
Tony Abbott, France and Bridget girls.
Should this election be decided two months after the vote is finished?
"We need a better system," said he.
Why could we not have a system in which you can enter, enter your coordinates into a computer, vote immediately and have the result at 6:30th morning?
Mr. Palmer also criticised the use of paper warrants to mark vote bulletins.
Is it to be able to do the result if someone is not agreed?
From our days, there's a charming paper seems extraordinary.
The electoral Commission studied the possible options for the electronic vote and recently published a joint reflection document with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer, 59 years old, said that his political project included an international airport for Sunshine Coast and that he would take its new functions "really serious".
The exercise of public functions is a question of public service.
"We are not looking for reward, except the reward of the story because we need to serve the community at a critical moment," he added.
A Biologist team directed by the Wildlife Conservation Society of New York has identified a new species of dauphin to the width of Northern Australian coasts.
The Thibaut Bouveroux, a scientific mission on the Observatory of Conservation and Experience of Animaux and Military Marines (OCEAMM) is the Express on this discovery and explains the long process of identification of new species.
The discovery of this new species of dauphin to the wood?
That's a good news, but it's not me special.
In the past, species have been described and identified on morphological, anatomic and geographic basis today, the development of new tools such as genetics allow us to improve our knowledge in sciences of species classification.
It is also impossible that these progress in genetics and molecular biology reflect the classification or belonging to a genre, a family, even a order.
In the beginning of the 19th century, morphologists classified animals on the basis of morphological differences between species.
Today, some of these classifications are transferred due to the progress of genetics.
Likewise, two very close species of morphologically have been distinguished through genetics.
This is the case of the new kind that is to be identified.
A ten years ago, the scientific community recognized two species of this sub-familie: the ocean wood dauphins and the Atlantic Wales.
Recent analysis allowed to distinguish four species.
Why is it an important discovery, as stated by the Wildlife Conservation Society?
In a view of conservation, it is essential to know these genetic differences in order to protect the species and therefore genetic variability.
If this population had already been known by the researchers for a long time, they didn't know that she was part of a new species, just on this place.
As a result, if a massive mortality problem caused by a viral or accidental capture epidemic in the region may be caused to extinction of a species, rather than to a local disappearance of a population of a more widely expanded species on Earth.
This loss of genetic heritage would be much more problematic.
A species is considered threatened or by extinction according to the number of existing individuals on the Earth, i.e. the stock, and the possibility that it has to restore from neighbouring stocks.
For the species of Chinese Sousa, the population of the new species discovered, its stock is automatically low, making it more vulnerable.
Why is it rare to discover new species of marine mammifers?
Marines are located above the food chain.
They live in homogenous habitats open, in which there are many genetic exchanges between populations and individuals.
This brassing of gentlemen limits the creation of new species.
Inverse, the closest ecosystems favour genetic island, which can finally generate new species.
We need to know that the marine environment is the least well known environment.
It is preferable to send robots on Mars, to know what is living in the sea of the Marians, to only 11 kilometers from the surface of the sea.
More money is given in life research on other planets than in marine research and it's greater time that changes.
RBS suspends two traders on the change market
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders of its market division of changes according to the two sources of the folder, which shows a new time that the world's regulatory investigation on the subsequents of the vis-à-vis market is starting to bring its fruits.
Some of the largest banks in the world, including UBS, Barclays, German Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with regulators in the framework of the most important financial market investigations, where $5,3 billion changes every day.
The two traders are the first employees of RBS to be suspended in the context of the enlargement of the investigation that has resulted in the provocation of manipulation of the Libancaire rate.
The bank, who refused to comment suspensions, confirmed that monthly received information requests from the part of the regulators.
“The investigation on this case continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators” said a representative of the bank has two weeks ago.
The last month, close sources of the dossier stated that RBS had transmitted from e-mail and immediate messages, sent to and by an old trader, to the British regulator, the Financiary Manufacturer Authority.
This trader Richard Usher left RBS in 2010 and would have been suspended from its European Trade Responsement Officer for the reviews at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, the European Translator for Change Trading at Citi, has been granted this week, while Matt Gardiner, old currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended by Standard Chartered this week.
No one of these traders has made any complaints.
Mr. Usher's folder included immediately sent messages to and by bankers working at Barclays and Citigroup, added close sources of the folder.
UBS explained that she had tried a action against some of its employees after the Swiss Regular Finma said he was concerned about change market manipulations in a number of Swiss banks.
In the world, at least six authorities – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss competition authority Weko, FCA, the American Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – consider the allegations made on bankers that would be heard to manipulate the rates on the change market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Crédit Switzerland also launched internal investigations or received information requests for regulators.
The banks explicit the immediate messages and emails sent for years to find cases of claimable acts.
The news on these investigations have been expanded by traders in a sector which was one of the largest growth engines of the investment banking units during the past years, but has been transferred in this year because of the low gaps that limits the opportunities for specialists.
Some bankers have tried to minimize the case by saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the large market of strongly liquid changes, but the senior traders explain that it is not necessary.
A senior trader said that, despite the high volume of the daily change transactions, the fragmentation of liquidity between exchange platforms and the more frequent use of the banks of their own internal platforms "hears that it is possible to start having an impact on the market at a few costs".
The news came even on the day that the Swiss Crédit announced that he had sent a worker in his office of the funds negotiated by London this week after the loss of $6 million last year.
The Bank quickly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with the regulators.
"We are convinced that the trader has acted alone and that the case has been secured," said a representative of the Swiss Credit.
Rob Ford Major investigation has been observed, supports a lawyer
After the police had confirmed had put the hand on a copy of the video that would show Rob Ford smoke of the crack, Me Clayton Ruby never supported a "sounded survey".
Ruby told me to believe in the Canadian Presse that the police had "ignored or minime" evidence against the master.
This Thursday, the police arrested the occasional friend and chauffeur of Rob Ford, Alexander Lisi, aged 35, and accused him with regard to the video.
Alexander Lisi, previously accused of drug trafficking, was in common contact with the sea.
The police also said to have observed this man who was led to the Rob Ford, showing new cour documents.
Ruby qualified me of "nonxplicable" the fact that the police had never shot Rob Ford's vehicle or his home or listened on his phone, supporting that the police officer Bill Blair had chosen a reason to not act against the maire.
In accordance with the law, the police, being witness of suspected transactions in their own hands, would be very well able to intercept Rob Ford's vehicle, stop the master, and carry out a survey - even without mandate.
It would also be able to request an immediate investigation mandate, if necessary.
The police chief did not comment, but his parliamentary Mark Pugash has qualified the proposal of Me Ruby's "effective and unestimate," to turn to media in a case which does nothing about it.
In the press conference, Mr. Blair said that there was nothing in this video that could constitute "which reasonable motivations" to conduct the deposito of criminal accused against the sea.
European borses are low to mid-ses, except London
On the exception of London, the main European Bourses are developing by mid-seven mid-seven middle feeding by some news of deceived companies, while Wall-Street is expected to grow up.
In addition, investors remain skillful because they feel that the Federal Reserve of the United States could renew its quantity policy as previously provided.
Inverse, after an inflation of 0.7% for the entire euro area, the idea is extended to the market operators which the European Central Bank (ECB) could comply with its monetary policy.
The futures of Wall Street are allowing the opening of the US actions, after two consequences of reply.
In values, Renault (-4.63%) registers the most strongest response of the CAC 40, posted by the advertisement of his partner Nissan Motor Friday.
Royal Bank of Scotland (-6.26%) mark the worst performance of the EuroFirst300, after also published results in decrease this morning and announced the creation of a disappearance structure ("Base Bank") with 38 milliards of active books.
On its side, Vodafone (+2.45%) maintains the growths of the EuroFirst300 in reaction to a press information that AAT-T studys an OPA eventual.
On the change market, the specifications on the evolution of the ECB monetary policy will be a good train, as John Hardy says, strategic at Saxo Bank.
The unique mandate of the ECB has always taken into account the inflation, so Mario Draghi and its team have more reasons to take action at the next week meeting.
We anticipate a strong low potential of the euro.
In this context, the euro continued its response against the American currency and touched a lower than two weeks to $1,3517.
These same conjections support the obligation market in the euro area.
The Supreme Court is valid the Obama Health Reform Act
Great victory for Obama administration: the U.S. Supreme Court has stated today that the Law on Reform of the Health System ratified by Obama was constitutional.
By 5 votes against 4, the judges have valided the individual mandate of the Palestinian Protection and Comprehensive Care Act (law on the protection of diseases and affective care) – which requires citizens to subscribe health insurance from here 2014, in order to impose a amendment – and said that it was constitutional under the Government's imposing power.
The Chairman of the Supreme Court, John Roberts, welcomed the four official members of the Court, while the judges of Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy expressed their decline.
The Court has also valided the other sections of the Law of 2 700 pages, and has also considered that the provision of the Reform of the Health System, which calls for the decrease of the Eligibility to Medidid, in order to lose all federal funds of the programme, was coercitive in accordance with the Constitution.
The procedure for blocking the law was undertaken by 26 States and the National Federation of Independent Business.
All major candidates to the presidential election during the 2012 primary, including the appointed candidate Mitt Romney, have been severely opposed to the law.
Vibrant damage made to the old fighters in Menton
In the heart of the Traject cemetery, civilian, religious and military authorities, as well as many patriotic associations, have made that Friday after midday, a damage to the soldiers and dismissed of all wars.
The two of the three military carres of the cemetery were placed by Mr. Jean-Claude Guibal and various personalities.
Accommodation between Palestinians and Israel at the Gaza border
The four fighters of Hamas were killed and five Israeli battle soldiers were slaughtered on Thursday 31 October 2013 at night at a violent race at the border between Gaza and Israel, the most serious incident in the Palestinian territory for one year.
The only electrical center of the Gaza band stopped functioning on Friday, 1 November after a extension of its fuel stocks, announced the Palestinian power Authority of the Palestinian force.
A local commander of Brigades Ezzedine Al-Qassam, Khaled Abou Bakr, and another framework of the Hamas Army branch, Rabieh Barikeh, were killed by a charm bus tour during an incursion of the Israeli Army at the east of Khan Younès, in the south of Gaza, according to local medical sources.
Two other local responsables of the Brigades Al-Qassam, Mohammed al-Qassas and Mohammed Daoud, found the death when a Israeli helicopter opened the fire in the same region.
Their body were discovered later.
According to Palestinian security sources, the four fighters conducted a monitoring operation in the border area between the Palestinian slave and Israel.
An attack against a tunnel made by the Palestinians
According to the same sources and witnesses, a Israeli char and a blind bulldozer made an incursion of a hundred meters in the middle of the territory prior to leave.
A half-hour period in terms of witnesses.
In a communiqué, a Hamas Port Port, Sami Abou Zouhri, made the four "heroes" fault and stated that Israeli soldiers had found death during the confrontation.
Hamas welcomes the heroes of Al-Qassam who fell down by defending the territory in an incursion of the sionist occupant in Khan Younès.
Several enemies were killed and wounded during the operation.
"The Hamas is sure that Gaza will be an affair," he mixed the door.
At its side, the Israeli Army stated that the target of his operation was at the start of a large tunnel grown in Israel's territory since the Palestinian army, discovered on 7 October and designed, according to the army, to the " terrorist activities".
Hamas returned the use of tunnels to fight against Israel, expressing that the purpose was to remove Israeli soldiers to exchange them against Palestinian prisoners.
The operation was intended to prevent future terrorist attacks using this tunnel, explaining a Israeli military communication.
During the operation, Hamas declared a explosive engine on Tsahal forces (Israel Army) and wounded five soldiers.
Israeli attack in the north of Syria
"This mission was imperial due to the risk of use of the terrorist tunnel for attacks against Israeli civilians," said Peter Lerner, also.
In addition, Israel hit a military air base in the north-west Syria to load a missiles designed to the libanais Hezbollah movement, reported on Thursday 31 October the Satellite chain Al-Arabiya.
A American license confirmed a Israeli flag but has not given details on the goal.
"In the past, the targets were transferred to Hezbollah," he pleased to add.
The officials of the Israeli Government refused to confirm any information on such an attack.
As the "exclusive sources" not designed, the Saudian Capital Chapter stated that "the bombardization had a planned air missiles designed in Hezbollah in Lebanon" in reference to the powerful Libanian Citizenian movement that fighted rebelles on the side of the Syrian forces.
Earlier, a Syrian NGO, the Syranian Observer for Human Rights, had made a number of Mercurius explosions in a air defence base in Sonar Jablé, near Latvia, on the Syrian Coast.
This organization has not been able to identify explosive origin.
Back to black and white for Marie Chouinard, who presents in Enge its two new group choreographies: the first inspired in the Hienri Michaux skills and poems, the second insufficient by the alone Gymnopedia planet.
A evening that allows you to see all the premature of Chouinard, the art of the tics and black inch into the white.
A white screen serves back wall.
On the tapis, as well as white, in the space entertainment which is the Teaster Maisonneuve, advanced, of profile, end as a line and dressed to black, a body.
On the screen, a kit of Hanri Michaux is designed.
The body, simple traffic, takes its form.
And this form will be the whole piece: a flat of physical emotions of dessins.
The dancers, fullly dressed to black, only hands and face discovered, wait every side of the game area, smooth when the next graph appears, the incarnant, are present.
This black and white game of Henri Michaux is made in relaxation with onlys, in a group of unisson (a mass that only does), in a large group of twelve onlys where each performs its sign.
It is thinking "Gloire of the morning", where, only Chouinard had performed a series of choregraphical tasks written on cards, online on the front-South front.
It's the same principle, good PowerPoint version.
Here, the music is strong, elektrical slaughters and guitars.
Energy is high, the rhythm is always fast.
There will be cut when Carol Prior will escape under the dance tape, to deliver, micro on hand, without sobriety or retain, a part of the mixture, monocorde and monotone poem, and will continue dancing.
And the music to repair, and the sequence to take back.
This sound and energy download, long, if it can, end by assuring and enhanced.
Like this is also the regularity of visual rhythm.
There are some beautiful flashs - the creation of images has always been a force in Chouinard - like those hairs that are ebourifered or these black tissue that reach the lines.
But the choregraphical approach lacks of composition.
It is the impression that the choregraph, instead of going to meet the Michaux's work, has been imposed with its tics.
The results: the body seems to be plate before the dessins.
Michaux' inch, like Gestalt's forms, open a larger and giboy picture than the dance.
Only the end, in negative, with its dances hamed by a stroboscopic light and white signs in a sudden black theatre, touched magie.
The public loved, the accommodation was warm.
The Gymnopedaes, after the contract, are more rich.
The scene is part of green, dancing and plane are covered with tissue, like miles in a long-term house.
On the plan, the dancers are relaxed to play the partys.
Their bad addresses in music, touching, give true fragility.
On scene, the couples adjust in two lovely, very sensitive, even erotics.
Group worker, small pasts only, joints that turn away, chers, the write is less binary.
Boffons also appear from Chouinard familyers, woodening the red nest, in very polarized paradises.
Love are carnassists, flowers or players.
The steel, the rivers and the small crises are beautifully translating the archaetic, the grace and the ridicule of coïte bodys, of creatures.
But the piece takes its real flood after salvation.
A clown returns to scene when the public goes away.
There, it is possible: the fourth wall falls, the universities studied overpose, executing dansers, descending down between the spectators, glonsen, flowing, short-certaining, playing furniture codes, the sauce in a savamly calculated disorder that remains sensual.
Rejoice and foolishness transplant, and it's Chouinard's art, there, to contaminate the public.
Google, Samsung and Huawei are subject to the prosecution of the Nortel patents
The group that has thousands of old patents of Nortel has entailed a prosecution of judicial prosecutors in the case of patents against portable telephone manufacturers, including Google, the company he cooked in the sake in the sales of patents who had occurred after the Nortel failty.
Rockstar, the consortium that has bought Nortel patents for $4,5,5,Md, made complaints against Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for a violation of patent against the United States Assisance Court in Texas.
Rockstar is together detained by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is accused to have violated seven patents.
The patents contain technologies that allow you to show publicity in relation to Internet search terms, have indicated the conclusions of the process, which is the Google's heart of mercy.
It was not possible to join the representatives of Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC manufacturing phones that operate under Google's Android operating system, which provides fertility competition to mobile Apple and Microsoft products.
In 2011, Google made an initial offer of $900 for Nortel Patents.
Google has increased its offer to several repairs, finally proposed $4,4,000.
After we lost Nortel patents face in Rockstar, Google has bought the following Motorola Mobility for a amount of $12.5.5, a part-based market on motorola patent library.
“Although it has failed to acquire patents because of the acquisitors, Google has forced and continued to overcome patents” reported the conclusions of the process.
Rockstar claims of damage and greater interests in Google, because he claims that Google's patent violation is obstinct, according to the flag.
Explosion of a house in Gesves: a defected water in the origin of the explosion
The grandma would have a cigarette during a gas escape.
The explosion of a habitation in Gesves, which made two serious wounds on Friday morning, a mother of 52 years and his little-five films, is under a gas flight from a defected water, showed the substitute of the King's Prosecutor.
The expert referred to in place by the park ensure that the origin of the explosion is purely accidental.
The grandma had a cigarette while there was a flight and an accumulation of gas.
The vital pronostic of both victims is always committed.
The grandma has been planned by the explosion and is greenly burned.
The little boy, who stayed at her grandfather and marriage, was at her sides and was lighterly burned.
"Two victims were intacted and longly conditioned on place before being brought to the Liège, she was in helicopter, in ambulance," explained the bossman José Paulet, down on the places.
Traumatised, the grand-pair was at the storm at the explosure.
Health and otherwise, he was able to join the square of the scatter left intact while the back wall of the house was completely destroyed.
The grandfather and the neighbourhood home, fragilyized by the explosure, was relocaled by the President of the CPAS.
The Pompiers of Andane and Namur and the Arches police are interventioned.
Cristina's civil protection has established the two buildings.
Egypt requests the first President freely elected to grant oath
Mohamed Morsi has granted the jury of investment, but it is little likely that his triomphe's day marks the end of political conflicts in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohamed Morsi promised the emergence of a “new Egypt” when he made the jury of Investment to the Presidency, and then became the first President freely elected and successful in Hosni Moubarak who was casted from the power 16 months later.

Considered as the "function road" little charismatic of the Muslim Frères, his personal prejudice was considerably strengthened since his victory and his talking on Friday during which he tried to present himself as the candidate not only of the Islamists but of all those who want to end the work undertaken during the upcoming of 2011 against the authorist President Moubarak.
"Egy is today a national, constitutional and modern civil State," said Mohamed Morsi, in a blue and red costume, addressing the judges present in the orange of bottles where he had granted jurisdiction.

Founded in 1908 and ancient Laych education, Caire University became a fifth of islamist students in the 1970s.
Mr. Morsi made a symbolic jury on the place of Tahrir, from where the summit which ended the authorized regime of Moubarak last year, and swore to recover the presidential powers of which the military Council, which replaced the former Presidency, put it on.
But by accepting officially to be granted before the Court, rather than before the parliament as it is in use, it turns down to the will of the Army by showing that the fight for power has not been completed.
Mr. Morsi's talks on the place Tahrir accompanied spectacular peoples.

The schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics, orthography and grammary
In the English literature courses, students will have to study at least a piece of Shakespeare, a Roman of the XIX century, a romantic poem and a contemporary British fiction from 1914 to our days.
The review will also provide new texts to encourage a more diversified reading.
A combination of literatures and English languages will be removed.
Since 2015, students will have to pass through an independent language GCSE and will be strongly encouraged to choose a separate in English literature qualification.
The Ministry of Education must be published tomorrow its new English and math programmes – the first materials to undertake a radic revision.
It will have changed in other basic materials in the next year.
Furthermore, Ofqual, the Review Regular Office will provide a renewment of the GCSE structure, with a new and less course notation system.
As expressed during the age of age, Michael Gove, Minister of Education, said that there was a " wide consensus on the need to reform our system of reviews to restore public confidence", insisting on the fact that the GCSE would be "ambient, more ambitious and more strict".
Studies show that English schools are less than time than Maths (116 hours per year, or 3 hours per week) than most of the other countries.
In comparison, Australian schools offer a average of 143 hours a year, and Singapore students are about 138 hours.
Although there is no formal obligation to devote more hours of the time employment for Maths, the coalition government's sources showed that the GCSE of extended materials – as well as the greater importance accorded to the materials in international classifications – would likely encourage schools to ensure more course hours.
The programme will further focus on the “the real world’s problems”, including financial mathematics.
This judge means that a law text adopted in July and that widely refers to the right to the abort will be able to enter into force.

It walks in the bus, the jungle and through rivers to provide free medical assistance
Dr. Georges Bwelle provides free health care in the Cameroon villages
Dr. Bwelle and his team are almost all their weekends to see hundreds of patients
There are no many doctors in the West African country, at least 1 for 50,000 inhabitants.
Enter here or via your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the 10 Hiros CNN in 2013.
You can vote for him, or one of the 10 other heroes, for the election "Heros CNN" of the year.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue its extraordinary work.
During 21 years, Georges Bwelle looked at his father who was sick to change the periods of conscience and unconsciousness and enter into hospitals that were not equipped to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was wounded in a car accident in 1981 near Yaoundé, the Cameroon capital.
At the beginning, he had only an infection, but he paid up to his brain, creating a hematom, with which he was going to carry the sequels that remained his life.
"There had no neurochirurgians in Cameroon," said Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought it to the foreign if we had enough money.
Instead of this, Dr. Bwelle had been able to join his father in healthy clinics and hospitals, so that he might receive any treatment he could benefit.
"It's not easy", added Mr. Bwelle.
You can leave the house at 5:00, go to the hospital to be the first, and you are not the first.
There are many patients.
People can die because they're waiting too long.
The situation has not much changed since the father's death in 2002.
In Cameroun, there are only 1 doctor for 50,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.
As a comparison, ratio in the United States is 1 doctor for 413 inhabitants.
And even if they could see a doctor, many Camerounais couldn't pay the consultation.
Two persons on five in the country living under the wealth of poverty, and almost three quarters of the country's health costs are carried out in the private sector.
"The only problem they have is poverty," explained Dr. Bwelle.
And because of poverty, they cannot benefit from life.
After seeing his father and many of his partners suffering, Dr. Bwelle was decided to try to change the course of things.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his well-being team worked freely over 700 chirurgic acts during the past year.
He has become a doctor himself, working as vascular chirurgia in Yaoundé Central hospital.
It has created a non-satisfactory humanitarian association, ASCOVIME, which has become in rural areas for weekends to provide free health care.
Since 2008, he and his group of benefits helped about 32,000 people.
Besides all vendrees, with thirty-seven people, they are in quargonettes after fixing medical material on the tooth and through hard fields to get into the villages that have the most need for help.
The chance doesn't always follow them.
They had to powse the vehicles to cross rivers or bottle tracks.
But when they come, they are received in heroes: the community organizes a feast, warm and dance and offers the best available accommodation.
In these villages, free health care is a good reason to make the feast, and Dr. Bwelle – with its great sorrow and debording energy – is more than happy to join festivities.
The team begins to receive hundreds of patients on the next morning.
“ We receive 500 persons at each visit", said Mr. Bwelle.
They sometimes live at 60 km from the village, and they come to foot.
In this stretching hospital, various health cares are produced.
Many people receive treatment against paludism, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmisible diseases.
Others can receive balls, a couple of collected lunch or a free birth certificate – a document required to go to school, but many poor families can not only be able to buy it.
On the evening, the practical team of simple chirurgic acts under local anesthesis.
Operations are generally operated in a school, master or house; after intervention, the patient rises and goes to the upper room to leave his place to the next person.
Thanks to the light of the electrogen group, the operation room and the fixation of the material, Dr. Bwelle and its benefits work until the first morning morning.
It's an enormous ritmo, but the musicians of the villages generally present the team to remain motivated.
“They break on thumbs the whole night to keep us earned so that we can continue to work", explained Mr. Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, fair but felt of the work she's done.
The group, composed of guaunais doctors and medical students, has done 700 chirurgic acts free during the past year, and he knows that their presence can make all the differences for those who are in help.
A man explained that the free operation that he had come up to swallow a heritage would allow him to work again.
“ This will change my future and my family, ” said the man.
In addition to live in this underlying hospital and working as a chirurgic in the hospital, Dr. Bwelle also works the night in private medical cabins around Yaounde.
This is the second job, explains, which finances 60% of its association; the remaining is covered by private donations.
"I don't know when he's there," said Katie O'Malley, a medical student in second year of Drexel University in Philadelphie and profitable within the Dr. Bwelle group.
It is still in the hospital or attempt to find money for its association to carry out these campaigns.
For medical students and sick students such as Katie O'Malley, who come from the United States and from Europe to join Mr. Bwelle in his missions, is an opportunity for learning on the field that they are not at home.
“We could participate in operations to help putting blood or through instruments to Dr Bwelle” explained Ms. O'Malley.
This is not something you have the opportunity to do in America when you are a doctor in second year.
Voluntary students generally feed their journey to Cameroun, and often come with collected medical material.
But once in Yaounde, their pension, transport and education are supported by Dr. Bwelle.
"It's a hero, there's no doubt," said Katie O'Malley.
He gives his life for this association, and his desire to help the guaunais people is not near to get out.
For Dr. Bwelle, the relatively constant work load is not a difficulty.
To assist others to live happy, taking the promise he made to his father is something that brings him a great joy.
“I am so happy when I do this work, ” added Mr. Bwelle.
And I think of my dad.
I hope he can see what I do.
It's why I can do that.

The two France of Peter Nora
Perplexs, universities have long to define and place Peter Nora.
Teacher in Amphitheaters and course rooms?
Unfortunately, but by emphasing its weakness for the ways of transition, Sciences-Poo, the High Éuds.
Gaston-Gallimard Street Working Arbitration?
In fact, but, unlikely, the hidden work and the subterraneous writing of the editor.
Heir of the debt as Fontenelle occupied at French Academy?
Of course, but, knowing that such a holy oil could not replace the true holy oil, the thèse of which it happened.
They acknowledged volunteers in him a great eyeholder, animator and federalist of their work, but noted that he was little excited to produce himself.
This image incertains the monument of the "Remember Lies", to which he added his name, also contributed.
The wicked languages could see a magic market at the pubes, presented by an intelligent comment, covered by a vif of eye touch and the eye eye-peaked, but unfortunately disappointed.
The two works which were published by Nora are soon two years have already established that the one who was past for no write had a lot and well written.
The book that here should make him finally justice.
However, once again, the attempt of blackness, intellectual vagabond, the jubilation laid down as to feet joints of one subject.
But we are soon understanding that the disagreed objects gathered in this book to whether the browser returns to a single and same passion: that to discover the constitutional nood of the French identity.
Why are these dramatic calls at the national unity?
Identity: It's a time concern.
There's a little, we were collectively agreed to define it.
But in the péremptive spirit of our leaders' leaders, the French identity was a timely essence.
It was only necessary to deploy accidents, and the case, obliged jacobinism, was confided to the prefects and subprefects, authorized interpretations.
That's what Peter Nora's all the other.
It is not in heritage of an eternal franchesis, it refuses to define the definition.
Analyst is concerned about a family extremity, he goes in a forest of symbols, arrested every step by an object of rebus, tourned by irritant questions.
So this, who is born from the company itself: Why, in a country as sustainable installed in its borders, if the former characteristic and solidly accompanied, are these dramatic calls to the unity?
They are so pressing, suggests Peter Nora, only to confront the trouble and not the discords of the French history.
Francs and Gaulois, Armagnacs and Bourguignons, Catholics and protestants: the division forces, here, are very old.
And most emblemmatics, obviously, is the one that operates in two of the national history.
Since the Revolution seminary, the French have two stories, and they have two nations, one monoarchic, the other revolutionary.
The second wanted the death of the first, but without reaching the snow; it was concerned in contrast to find the sacrary and even more appearing of unity and indivisibleness that she had shocked the head to him who was the manifest and powerful incarnation.
And, from there, a inherently binary nation, shared between the left and the right, layout and catholicism, worship and hate the revolution.
To feel this uniqueity of French identity, nothing is about the four steps outside the Hexagone, although the American capital of Peter Nora could be the heart of his book.
Since America and France have one, and the other makes a revolution, which has an explanation of rights, wanted to fund a new society.
But the American neighbour is better to emphasize what is right.
There, men who left their old Regime in England and had no more to worry about it.
Here, men accompanied by an old Indian Regime, and even more radical.
There is a consensual revolution when here she sowed the drame and confided it.
There are always founders, and here are the revolutionary ages that are difficult to do models, which are the remaining interactive.
There is a institutional condition, and here is a box of constitutions, as well as errors to ratify and try again.
France who is here, France who comes
But there was a time when the French believed that they could recover the decised rock of their story, and won the curse of the number two.
At this IIIth Republic, central and creative moment, Peter Nora showed many interests and even trends: welcome those who were then employed to repair the revolutionary fractures, teaching the students all that in the former France had dark prepared modern France and proposing a unified version of their history.
But this peaceful identity had only one time.
This is again in discussion, which has a new type of immigration, threatened by the currency of returning minorities, absorbed in the European space.
The book therefore offers the fascinating port of France, which is going and the circumspective appreciation of France.
With, first, the story would be brought, which should reserve some surprises.
There is revealed that the road was a household.
The man of the many curiosities turned, lightly obsessional, around the same idea.
The leather worker was in the centre of the centre.
And the one who had put on, here is more than a half-sept, a subject on the idea of the nation, but was undertaken to the initial year of the tèse, confidence to us, with grain salts, which he will end.
Certainly in a less raid, more expensed and more substyle.
But we don't be stumbled there, as well as binding.
Since the figure imposed of the university cursus, this thèse says the inner need of life.
An old host in Lebanon: "The return is enough complex to manage"
It was taken to Beyrouth on 8 March 1986 with three members of his "Antenne 2" team filmed a manifestation of Hezbollah, the journalist Jean-Louis Normandin was released about 21 months later on 27 November 1987.
From 2008, he participated in the establishment of the Defence Association of the World Days, which presumed for several years.
Its main goal is to get the opportunity for complaints and to bring their pregnants to the International Criminal Court.
During more than 1 000 days, the four homes of Aqmi (Al-Qaida in Islamic Maghreb) Daniel Larribe, Thierry Dol, Peter Legrad and Marc Féret were released on Friday.
After medical reviews at the military hospital of Val-de-Grâce after midnight, they were able to recover their families since,
And try, less little, to take the course of their life.
"The New Observator" asked Jean-Louis Normandin, 62 years old, an ex large reporter, represented since 2008, President of the Association "Worlds of the world".
From the evening of your release you were on the street of "Antenne 2".
What are your memories of your release today?
In particular, in Beyrouth.
When I was released, I found me in the car cover where I meet -- without seeing him because he does black - Roger Auque.
He said, "We're released," but I'm not sure, and I'm saying that we can still be killed.
We're very excited, but very hard too.
It's the war, and those who lead us are very thorough.
They put us on the boat of a trottoir.
There are Syrian militarys.
Then you come on the Summerland Hotel where the press is present.
France brings us to the Ambassade of France.
It's time of the first stairs to parents, family, friends, press...
I remember I took a bathroom for a hour.
And dinner in the friendship of France.
I also remember a short night to discuss with Roger and Marchiani.
The tension is still there because we have no way to evacuate us to Larnaca airport in Cyprus.
We're taking a private airport in France through Corfou and Solenzara, where Pasqua embarks.
How did your arrival on the French ground come?
We're going to Orly.
Chirac, Prime Minister, is there.
It's a little brutal.
There's an incredible busquet.
And many media.
When I went, there were three television lines.
I'm back and it's full.
The descent of the aircraft, finding them with my son and my parents, my friends, all this is extremely strong in emotion.
Among the airport and me, many motes follow our car that Roussin leads.
The motors throw the bunch to make photos and follow me home where I have to do the police to prevent some of them to go up.
Medical pressure is extreme.
It doesn't stop. We're well placed to know it.
But the status of emotion and fatigue is as difficult to see clearly.
We're going out of a boom and we're all right under the median fires.
It's a little complex, a little violent, quite complex to manage.
But we've done the hardest.
On the evening, I'm at 20:00, I'm also on the television.
Then start a kind of readaptation to life, very slow, for one or two months who are a little as vacation.
How have medical reviews and DGSE debrised?
I had the right to a first medical control in Corse.
The rest was made to the Val-de-Grâce the following days of my return: radios, reviews in all kinds and meetings with a psychiater.
It is not a meeting that makes it all, but we know that we can count on him, remember it so necessary, that we are not delivered to themselves.
It is part of the procedure.
I also met the education services.
They asked me questions about earlier pregnants.
It was logical.
That didn't hurt me.
How do you answer, today, at the release of the Niger's four oggs?
I'm listen to what you say.
The debate on the ratings, inter alia.
Some stuff me, less less.
I'm trying to do the part of the matters of my past as an housing and my case of President of the World Association, which allows me to put away, and it seems more interesting for me.
For example, I ask the definition of the resilience.
Surely, I fight with others for the recognition of the legal status of the otage.
I think there's a semantic problem.
It is necessary to qualify the adoption of "political homes" - which is the most of the time - and allows the obediences to have access to justice, to bring complaints and to bring their prejudices to the International Criminal Court.
Today, once again, everyone is in compassion, in emotion, and rejoices in the release of these disasters.
But who says that these disasters may also have access to justice?
A court in La Haye is for this.
Why wouldn't you look like the Otage Prenors "You have bound the war rules, such as those of all the Geneva Conventions, bear you into justice?"
This seems to me, however, founded, legitimate, wounded by a good sense.
This message has been heard, but I didn't listen, and it's choosing me.
It's my main fight.
Egyptian islamists in the street to refuse Morsi's process
The wrath is founded in the lines of the Egyptian islamists.
Two days before the process was opened by President Dechu Mohamed Morsi, they descended into the streets.
A mobilization throughout Egypt to call for the reconstruction of the first democraticly elected President.

The police has been using lacrymogen gas, 60 manifestists have been arrested.
Lundi, 20,000 police officers will be deployed before the Caire Police Academy, where Mohamed Morsi will be judged.
