It's too late for him.
It's too late for you.
It's true that I'm a strict teacher.
It's true that the earth is around.
It's very kind of you to show me the way.

It's a miracle!
It's a miracle that our house survived the earthquake.

It's gonna be difficult to do.
It's gonna be difficult to find someone to replace Tom.
It's gonna be easy to find someone to rent this house.
It's gonna be hard to do that now.
It's gonna be hard to find someone to replace Tom.
It's good Tom hasn't done that yet.
It's hard to believe that Tom is only thirty years old.

It's not worth mentioning.
It's not much worth.
It is not worth the efforts.
It's not wrong.
It's not you, it's me!
It's clear that Tom and Mary are waiting for someone.
It's obvious Tom can't do this without some help.

It's rumored that Tom and Mary have broken up.
It's surprise that you didn't hear anything from Tom.
It's surprised you didn't hear anything about what's going on.
That's the kind of thing Tom would do.
It's time to reflect your past.
It's time to fuck out of that fuck, Tom.
It's Tom Mary wants to see.
It's Tom Mary wants to talk to.
It's Tom's thirty birthday tomorrow.
It's too bad that you didn't take my advice.
It's totally dark outside.
That's unfortunately that happened.
It's unlikely Tom will do that.
It's unlikely Tom will do that.
It's unnecessary.
It's usually easy for Norwayians to get what Sweden are saying.
It's very wind, but it's not cold.
It's a way the time Tom promised he'd be here.
That's what Tom would want.
It's your fault I'm cripted.
It took more than I'm waiting.
I turned off my computer.
I turned the lights.
I turned the computer off.

It'll be a hot day.
It will become announcement soon or later.
It will be easier later.
It won't remain in that way.
It won't remain this way.
It will destroy us all.
It will hardly be any easier on the people if the cuddle with which they are beat is called the cudge of the people.
It'll take me 20 minutes to get the station by taxi.
It will not be hard for us to do this.

It would have been hard to do this.
It would be interesting to do that.
It would be romantic to do this.
It would have been forced to do that.

I've already said I'm gonna do that.
I already told Tom I don't want him to do that.
I've already told Tom I have to do that.
I already told Tom that I don't plan to do that.
I was going to Australia every summer since I was thirteen.

I was planning to do that for months.
I've been told you you're a very good carpenter.
I've been telling you're a very good French speaker.
I've been told you're looking for a babysitter.
I've been told you you're looking for a career.
