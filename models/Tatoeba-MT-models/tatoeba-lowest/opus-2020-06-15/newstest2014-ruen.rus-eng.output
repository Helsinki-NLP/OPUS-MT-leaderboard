In China and the region, two men have ended the life of self-assassination
One of the pregnancies has already tried to the society.
30 October, approximately 1-00, in the village of Luboa on his place of birth of 1947, the self-assassination of 1947.
It is clear that he had already been trying to sulcide.
What a man moved to such a step is unknown.
31 October, in 11-50, in the place of residence, an inhabitant of a 41-year-old man, who lived in China.
The names of forced death are not discovered, reporting the MWD Press Service of Kenish.
Did you have a black box in your car?
As long as the American projectors are trying to find money on the remonte of the shopping road system, many start to see the decisions in a small black box, which are appreciated on your car savings.
These devices covering each trainer and transferring the information to the readers are in the center of the sports attempts to modernize the former financial system of America's earliest engineering of planning and State.
Normally, the fair arden of the air planning planning has increased intensive debates and colonial aliens.
Liberians joined the environmental groups in the lobbying of the Government ' s right to use the smaller feeds to assess the number of your past miles and even where you go, and then use this information in the establishment of your accounts.
Following the chapter.
The American Union of Civil freedoms is also deeply concerned and addressed a number of questions relating to private life.
And although the congress can't be agreed, continued or no, several states are not waiting for.
They think how during the next decade you can go to the system where the drivers pay for each miles of ways they go.
All carriers have already tested these black boxes, part of which have the function of a soft relief.
It is really necessary for our country.
“ This is not the issue we can have the right of election”, said Hasson Iharat, the Executive Director of the Association of the South Californian Governments, which prepares plans for the beginning of the relief of the state of a mile passed by each Californian carist, 2025.
We're gonna be changed in how we pay these bottles.
Technology is already.
The need for this is to be aggravated by the absence of resources in the Government of the Road Building Fund financed by the costs paying for vehicles.
The Americans don't buy a lot of benzins as before.
Automobiles go over one hole.
The Federal Lounge itself, 18.4 cents for the golf, has not exceeded 20 years ago.
Politicians don't want to increase the wagon even at one cent, with high prices for benzin.
“ It's just impossible to save the benzin”, said Li Manney, an expert on transport policy at the University of Minnesots.
His state was recently set on the cars of 500 outstanding devices for the testing of the payment system.
“ This will be the best alternative in long term," he said.
It's called the loose payment of the user.
It is wonderful that this idea is engaged by urban lebers, as it is possible to change the character of travels to reduce the road and port gas emissions, for example.
Planning bodies in California are focused on this system in the development of strategies for the achievement of the objectives set by the ambitious laws of this State to combat global warming.
However, a member of the Palestine representatives of Bill Shuster (Republic, Pennsylvania), the Chairman of the Palestinian Committee, said that it also considers the system as a long-term alternative.
Free market commitments in the Reason Foundation also in terms of waterers to pay for each mille.
“ It's not just a throw that will go to the black dragon”, said Edrian Mur, Vice-President of Reason on political matters.
People pay directly for what they get.
This movement is also supported by two former United States Ministers of Transport, who called for the Congress to move in the direction of the cost payment.
The United States Senate has approved a lower project for $90 million in the past year, which would take part of approximately $10,000 cars.
However, the Palestinian officers rejected this proposal because of the threats of rural lawyers representing electors, which are often to go through a lot of thousands to work or to the city.
A number of states and cities, however, are self-related.
The largest enthusiasm is held in the State of Orion, where 5,000 aquators are involved in the largest experiment.
These drivers will soon pay the state for thousands of flights instead of the Benzin's nest.
The pizza project has already been completed in Nevada.
He was considered in New York.
Illinos will test it on a limited basis with the participation of vehicles.
And the Coalition I-95, which includes 17 Eastern Population Departements (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florid), is a study of how they can make it possible.
This concept did not have an overall recognition.
In Nevada, where approximately 50 voluntary cars were recently found by these devices, the drivers were concerned that the Government could see each step.
“According of the greatest brother and such things represents a great problem”, Alida Han said that the strategy and effective management of the Nevada Division department.
That was not what people wanted.
When the tests were completed, the United States Union office of Civil Freedom in the Nevada announced on its website: “There will not be difficult to transform these devices into a full detection.”
There is no need to create a huge, community-based technology infrastructure, which will be unremovable to maintain records on daily movement of individual citizens.
Nevada is one of the numbers of states where difficult searching for a disaster technology that would allow the powers of the State to take account of the cars, but without the location and time information.
If you can do this, Han said, the society will feel more calm.
The research of this technology has brought some State agencies to a small young company in California, named True Mileage.
This company has not been assisted in the collection of state taxes.
She tried to go to the developing market of the autostraction, with the drivers paying a flight.
But the devices that it tests are drawn by road projecters because they do not use the GPS and provide a limited number of information loaded by the model.
“ The people will be slighter to do this if you don’t take their speed and do not respect their location," said Ryan Morrisson, executive Director True Mileage.
There were a few major mistakes in some of these pill programmes of the State.
There's much less ways to do this.
In the Organization, projecters are experted with the delivery of different options.
They can select a device with or without GPS.
Or they can totally refuse from the device, decided to pay a fixed collection based on the average number of miles that are all inhabitants of the State.
In other places, it is hoped to sell the idea of a relaxed public, putting the device to do more than less.
In New York transport officers are trying to develop a provisioned device that will also take paid payment for parking accounts, to provide “pays as you travel” and to collect the speed on the real time of other carriers that could be used to avoid testing.
“Awtomys will be involved in the benefit they are proposed”, reported in the document of the building project.
Some carriers, however, are thinking whether there are not all talks on the poultry payment just a huge massive factor.
In the City Transport Commission on the Sale San Francisco, the Congress would be very simple to overcome the banking of the confidence fund of the Housing Road Building building, railways on Benzin.
Additional one-time or announcement could be taken from hybrid vehicles and other persons whose vehicles do not use much benzinn to pay their fair wages.
“It is no need for the radically chirurgic interaction when everything you need to do — it is to take the island," said Randy Rentschler, Director of the Committee on Legal and Public Relations.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of waterers will worry about their private life and many of other things.
The EU will prepare the support of Ukraine to the case of Russia's economic pressure
The European Union has a reservation plan for Ukraine and the achievement of an agreement with ICF on extreme credit if Russia takes any measures in response to the possible signing of the Association Agreement between the EU and Ukraine in the Vienna Summit.
The IWF was negotiated on stand-by credit, and the other EU officer who directly participated in negotiations added that their purposes were the conclusion of agreement in the next time.
In addition to the potential credit from the Ukrainian MIF, 610 million from Europe may be obtained.
The analytics imposed by Ritter are sure that Ukraine and ICF can overcome the previous difference on the terms of funding.
It is not believed in the possibility of reforms required for aid, and the International Recycling Agency S-P decreased at the Friday of Ukraine to one degree to the "B" of "B".
However, the representatives of the EU say that IFF can demonstrate deepness in the terms of credit, taking into account the circumstances of Ukraine.
In addition to the EU financial support plan, the EU has a reserved option to ensure Ukraine's extension of the delivery from Russia.
This may be a gas from the Green Fluss or a Slovak reversion.
The last, according to the officials, is the most possible and acceptable way in the case of Russia "developed" Ukrainian.
Analytics believe that such a reverse provision can be used only for several weeks, and it is likely to lead to the decrease of payments in other regions.
"Every EU and Ukraine countries are being negotiated on how to create welcome conditions so that Ukraine may import gas from other sources, not from Russia or from the same source, but on other trademarks," added Rether source.
Russia against the pollution of cities by cars
Attempts to solve the problems of large cities have been observed in most of the world megapoles starting from the second half of the XI century.
Usually, the terms of their reconstruction and extension of the magazine, or attempt to reduce the request for car travel, car number and time of use.
The example of Singapore, where the growth of private cars has been made hard, and the right of their adquisition is purchased in the audiences.
His price may be two-thirds exceed the price of the same car.
The European cities, including London, have been paid for entering in the city centre.
In Germany, for example, in Hamburg and Statgart, the green zones are introduced in which only cars are allowed to enter with a certain fuel class that also uses high quality (including biocar or electricity).
The Environment Agency, for example, has approved the "Fifth Year clean air plan" in 2012, approximately $250 billion ($40 billion).
As reported by the Guideline of the Guidelines Control Control of the Municipal Defence Office, the main aim of the 5-year-old air pollution office is the decrease of 20-35% to 2017, the growth of private cars not exceeding 6 million (he is 5,2 million), and increases more than 5 per cent of the fuel use at one vehicle.
According to the Agency, it is now 22.5 per cent of the total air pollution.
The main programmes are limited to the use of car transport as well as the introduction of additional carriers.
In addition, the city ' s " green fifth age" measures include a warmth comparison with the rest of the airports to the Eurostatards, the introduction of the local emerging and fuel system, the limits to entering cars into the central part of the city, prohibited the use of deployed vehicles (e.g. the establishment of the promoting financial programs for the replacement of old cars on hybrid or electricity), the development of electricity (including public and service), the development of public transport (including high-growth).
The number of car innovations also includes the prohibition of all private cars on movement within the fifth corner (all of the CNDs in the table) a week (compatible information contained in the vehicle number), and the removal of registrations for cars on the base of cars (e.g. in 2011, the first year of the car operation, the total number of private cars in Pikene was only of the third part of 2010).
According to the active environment programme 2012-2020, the number of cities with high and high pollution of air should be reduced to 128 (in 2012 138).
According to the Mine Nature, in 2011, 41 per cent of all pollution emissions in the atmosphere of the city.
In Moscow, for example, the emissions from cars are 10 times higher, and in San Peterburg are nine times.
The RF is only starting to consider the possibilities of limited vehicle regulation on the streets of towns.
The Director of the Institute of Transport Economy and Transport Policy WHE Michael Blinkins believes that administrative and physical measures aimed at the demand for car travels, the case is notified to be adopted only in the context of their full universality.
In the case of Moscow, a unique problem relating to the structure of its car, where two classs are weak to any repercussional effects - service and personal cars, as well as the "accéléred" cars of users that are not less than 200 tons (only 5 per cent of the total car park of Moscow).
During the days of Urbanians from the ECOM in Saint-Peterburgh, a study was prepared where the balance of the urban territories between housing, road coverage and the number of autoports is analysed.
The main findings of researchers: the city centre provides two times less needed ways, and most cars in the centre do not use cars every day by leave them on parks or just on the streets.
Consequently, it is proposed to build non-parks, but to expand the passenger, but to reduce the past part (to ensure that the roads become more friendly for passengers) and to limit the use and location of personal transport in the territory of the safe centre of the historical centre (the territory of approximately 3212 gay covered by a number of central areas of cities).
Straffs for non-Coordinated Trade in Wood will grow up times
In view of the urban authorities, the increase in the size of the ships helps to order in Waloda and release roads from steel pallets and balls.
The majority of selling traders do not pay, the product they realise is not often consistent with the sanitary control.
This means that the health of wine is under threat.
Thus, the lower limit for citizens for uncertained trade from November grows six times from 500 rubles to 3000 rubles, reports the president of the Administration of Woods.
Goldman Sachs announced risks for Russian economy
Goldman Sachs announced growing risks for the main economic growth driver in Russia - consumer.
This is mainly the feasibility of ungarned consumer credits and the mass reduction of employees.
Our main concern is not now that growth has been reduced, rather than that the structure of this growth.
At the last time, it is completely deployed by the consumption that almost does not disappear trafficking," said the main economy of Goldman Sachs on Russian Graph, representing the quarterly report on Russian economy.
Now the nominal rate growth in Russia is approximately 10 per cent.
In inflation of 6 per cent, it is able to ensure the future demand of consumer approximately at the current level, waiting for Goldman Sachs.
But the rewardivity of Russian firms is therefore, therefore, moreover, they will take the optimization of staff costs.
Today we see the significant growth of the payment in the PIB: if $10 per cent grows, GDP is only 2 per cent, it explained Mr. Graph.
The computers were decreased with the reduction of the remediality.
If it does not grow up, it may lead to unemployment and growth of unemployment.
The Russian Budget cannot pay, commenting the main economicist Barclays Capital on Russia and the GN Armyмир Pantwich.
Unemployment of historical minimums, high competition for workers.
In order to overcome staff from the side or hold up the current workers, payments should be made up.
The need for the Russia is to live and a very fast growth of the consumption.
Mr. Graph considers that, because of the extreme extent of the consumer ' s multiple effects on the economy of the country, this type of credit does not provide.
"Politics for the growth of consumption we haven't seen anything, money is not grown in the economy, but returned to the same banks as the percentage rate," said the economy.
But the problem in the other, Goldman Sachs is expected to grow up for unprofit credits.
They take mainly heavenly people to provide nothing to ensure.
Proceedings on such high.
As a result, they are not more often returning," said Mr. Graph.
The second threat of the growth of the economy in Russia is therefore the possibility of payment for ungarned credits.
The Director of the Bank Institute of the HUSE Sweet is now viewing the signs of the bank crisis.
Small credit organizations, without access to debt resources in hospitals, were forced to bring high population resources.
In response, guests went out to the tribe of war and continued to decrease credit rates, the economicist.
Small credit organizations cannot be paid under the same percentage, otherwise they will have a negative percentage.
If the guests are not disappeared from the depth, Russia will hurt the full bank crisis, it would have the Basil Sweet.
The release of a number of bank licences in the last week of the economicist is considered a predecessor of the massacre.
"The following situations are not carried out: the Institute's insurance system has not been marked significantly on the system crises," said.
However, the growth of the consumption will not be deemed to pay in the investment, because it has been rejected from the index of the payment of guests and military officers set out in the current budget version.
Frequently abuses of the requirement will be reduced by the damage of natural monopolies (and the consequence of inflation reduction).
But only partly, if investments are not grown (and a reference to it not until there is no - see aid), the consumption growth is still delayed in the Goldman Sachs.
The Pontian Army of Barclays Capital has not yet seen a proposal for the implementation of the psychistic scenarios.
"The main risk is still falling on the feet," he said.
In its assessment, the Russian economy will begin to be reduced by the costs of the net below $90/barr.
In Goldman Sachs also noted that the CBC was still able to reduce the percentage in the economy.
The paradoxal image is observed: the inflation has declined, and the banks have continued to raise the road.
This might mean that they have not believed the CBC, announced the transition to inflation tourising," said the Graph.
The percentage policy of the Centre on Market does not affect, but only affects inter-bann credit.
"The CB is the latter of all hopes," he assessed Clemence's graph.
Banks have been used not for the credit of the economy but for the management of their liquidity.
As a result of the decrease, the currency is immediately changed, that means that resources are trying to go to shopping against the ruble.
"Ranno or later CB will understand that this strategy does not work," said the graph and reminded that the State was planned by the end of 2015.
But it should be done before or higher the key CR (5.5 per cent), it is considered.
According to its assessment, the rubber currency has now increased by 10 per cent.
It's just one way to be weak, it makes the outcome of experts.
But if the CBC defers in the financialists some of the shadows that the elimination of the curriculum is not a part of the policy of rotation, it can break the rock much more stronger.
The 2th meeting of the South Ural was held in Chilebinsk.
The forum is prepared to the Day of Population, the 400-year restoration of the Russian State and the adoption of the Russian Constitution.
At the meeting, delegations participated in all cities and areas, representatives of national culture unions, religious consequences, legislative and executive authorities, generally approximately 350 persons.
Kurs forum is aimed at strengthening international agreement.
We can show an example not only to other regions, but also to other countries.
We have no differences and differences.
We live in full understanding," said Feofan, the mythropothet of Cheliban and the Maltous.
A number of issues were considered, including the ensuring of patriotismo, cultural cooperation.
At the end of the meeting, the resolution was adopted.
The informal part of the forum continued in the opera and ballet theatre.
This has opened the provision of national culture units of the Chilebin Area.
Snowden is ready to cooperate with Germany in the case of the United States education
Edward Snouden, the United States Research Developed, stated that he was ready to go to Berlin to show the German parliament if the United States Security Office and its Director Keith Alexander could not respond to its activities.
The German Deputy Hans-Cristinan Schreebel in Thursday met Mr. Snowden in Russia, where he was granted a refuge to discuss his daughter in Germany.
In letter from Mr. Snoudne, who submitted the Deputy to the SME in Berlin, said: “The result of my efforts was clearly positive, my Government continues to be a concept of change and seeks to criminalize political prosecutions without protection.”
Nevertheless, he speaks the truth — not a crime.
In letter, Mr. Snouden said that it believed that the support of the international community could convince the Government of the United States to refuse criminal accused against it.
The prosecutions provided by the United Nations Minister of Justice include the skills and the sponsor of the State property.
Hans Peter Fredrik, Minister of Internal Affairs of Germany, reported the Time online: “If Mr. Snowden is ready to speak with the German officials, we will find ways to make it possible.”
Relations between the United States and Germany have become close after the approval of the ANAB listened to the Concert of the angels of Merkeel.
Thomas Opperman, who calls for the parliamentary group who smoke the disadvantages, said that if there was an opportunity to listen to Mr. Snowden as a witness, “not under his danger and not fully disappeared relationship with the United States”, it should be used.
Mr. Schreebele, the Deputy of the Parliament of the Green Germany Party, published his photograph with Mr. Snowden in his Threeter.
During his visit to Russia, two German journalists were conducted.
Mr. Schreebele said that, according to the lawyer of the former contractor, Mr. Snouden couldn't return to Russia if he had gone.
If Mr. Snouden had shown in Germany, he would need guarantees that he would be “in safety”, the deputy said.
Mr. Snouden said in his letter that he was engaged with a “feder and permanent” campaign of persecution that tried him to leave his house.
However, he said that he was an ambitious world reaction on “the political interpretation”.
Guardians around the world and high-level officials, including in the United States, have made the development of an uncontroll system of a useful useful for society.
The letter contains a proposal to cooperate with German authorities: “When the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are decided.”
Frontier Airlines will take the pay for the handy place
Frontier Airlines planned to take the passagiers to $100 for they're taking hands on the boat of their car.
Frontier Airlines is planned to start paying $100 for hands and $2 for coffee or gas, although they had announced that passengers could leave the whole bank.
The new payment for the handy set is distributed on the sum in the upper samples, so the small amounts located under the seat will remain free.
Frontier said it's going to take $25 if the collection's payment more recently, and $100 if the travelers will pay, only when they're going to the train out.
Representative Frontier Kate O'Melly said that $100 should have the passagiers to take care of the latest payment.
“ We don’t want to take the pay for it," she said.
Aviation began to pay for the first and the second wages set in the garage, in 2008.
Passengers who try to avoid these collections are struggled as many as they could, in the handy place of the upper browsers, because often there is no place in these sites.
The passengers are one of the ways to put the passagiers to take less on boat.
O'Mille said that this new collection was really not for money.
It is that Frontier's loodest clients say that there is more difficult for the place in the top pools.
The passengers who buy bullets on the airport should not pay.
This means that one passover driver can get the opportunity to pay free, while the next passover can pay $100 for the same amount.
O'Mille said that the changes on the website and the Frontier registration are called to ensure that passengers will know about the collection before they go to the train.
The new Frontier cell will not start joining the age, although the date is not yet set.
Passengers are often lacking for the payment and other collections, but the airports are shot them.
They claim that the burden processing costs, and the passengers needed to pay for it.
Many in Wall Street believe that the addment of the poisony collections is aware that the aircraft takes enough money to cover aircraft costs after several years of loss.
Nevertheless, most of them had not regarded congregations for manual position.
The Spirit Airlines Inc. introduced the first collection for the handy place three years ago, and another disaster Allegiant Air later followed her example.
The only other aircraft with this collection is the Wizz Air, said a consultant on the Arabia of Jay Sorensen, who is attractively depending on additive collections.
According to its evaluation in the report of December 2011, the manual collection will provide $50 million per year.
Sorensen, the former Midwest Airlines, was recently flighted by the Spirit, and he was interested that he would find out a train when the passengers were engaged with the unnecessary collection of the Spirit for the hands.
“ The plant process was the worstest of what I saw for my carrier in the airports, ” he said.
I was waiting for seeing dogs and dragons from the aircraft.
He said, “And the plane went slowly.”
Frontier should also be paid for $2 for coffee, tea, gasing or sack.
Frontier stated that passengers who receive gas or tanks can leave themselves all the bank and that the coffee feed would be free.
It will still be free to spend water.
The U.S. Airways had a short time tried to pay for drinks in 2008, but he was denied from this after seven months after passengers began to laugh and no other large airport had followed her example.
The Frontier Entertainment for the manual place when passengers don't buy a bike directly in the airport is the last step to bring clients on their website.
Aviation pays for online producers, such as Orbitz, $10 to $25 for each payment.
This gave to all airports to encourage passengers to buy them directly, not to turn to tourist online agency.
However, Frontier went forward to all of them in this area.
In September, it began to give two times less damage miles of times a aircraft to clients who had blue through online tourist agencies.
In the middle, it cut the primary number of miles to 25 per cent of travel.
Thus, a train from Frontier in the online tourist Agency would allow 250 miles.
Furthermore, the passagiers can choose the place more recently, only if they buy the bullets directly on the Frontier site.
Frontier has a loil-client base in her family, Danvere, but her business is increased and gained.
The hands were reduced to 9 per cent, and the annual opportunities have reduced almost 13 per cent in the first quarter, according to the financial results issued by the parent company of the Republic of Airways Holdings Inc.
The Republic is trying to correct the financing of Frontier within the sale of airports.
AB will be guilty of the internal error, not hackers to stop the site's work
The National Security Agency stated that the ceiling of their work for a few hours of the secretary office had been made available, not the hackers as stated in the network.
“NSA.gov was not available for a few hours this evening because of an internal error occurred during planning update”, reported the e-mail office.
The problem will be resolved tonight.
The declaration that the oversight of the work was called for an aggregate type of “Attention in service” [DDoS] is invalid.
The server monitoring systems last night registered that the ANAB site did not work at least six hours, and the site still is not available for some users.
The previous representative of ABC reported ABC News that an internal secret network of the Agency was discovered.
No information available is in danger, the representative reported.
At least one online hacker-activist group stated that it was responsible for the introduction of the ANAB website with the DDoS site.
DDoS attacks are developed so that the trafic site is encountered as long as the servers are not loaded, and the site is not exited.
The tactics of hackers are relatively simple, and the attaques are not designed to predict the internal target system.
The previous supervisor AB, once received the Net of the Agency, was found in the last months in the public attention centre and the criticism after the discovery of its broad programs for the refugee and within the country, all this is the reaction to the secret files of the NAB, which were embedded from the Agency, and published by the former ANAB Edward Snowden.
The growing field around the agency was reported to the fact that the current incident was the result of the targeted hacker action.
Bombardier gain decrease from the fall of payment and the number of orders for aircraft
The Bombardier Corporation, Canada aircraft and train producer reported in Thursday that the reduction of clean gain was 15 per cent, with the impact of the reduced number of orders and airports in the third quarter and the problems with contracts in its ferry section.
The Bombardier company also published no information on its new CSeries aircraft and provided new information about whether the ambitious plans for airport into commercial exploitation would be implemented to the next September.
Following the first field of the aircraft's experience model, which was held about half a month ago, he flighted only three times, and asks whether the graphical test stage was.
The results have not been justified and have brought actions to be more than 8 per cent of the Toronto Foundation Bank.
Cameron Darksen, analytics of the National Financial Bank, reduced a Thursday its assessment from the " highest medium-term" to the "mediary" because of the conviction that the growth of actions was limited in nearer quarters or two.
“The decrease of the number of aircrafts was generally preded, we have deployed by the vehicle indicators, ” said Doerksen in the review of the Fundament Market.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries as continued by the annual testing programme.
However, if the next months are not announced on new orders, we believe that the market will be more concretely related to the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft family allows her to be placed at the lowest price of the market segment where Boeing and Airbus are now threatening.
The first experience of the aircraft was presented in March and the first time he performed the aircraft in September after a few months of delay.
However, CSeries’s strong mandates until not too much — 177, since the potential purchasers are expected to check the approval of the company on fuel effectiveness and the potential of the new layder economy.
There are now 403 orders and agreements with 15 clients and operators.
The Chief Executive Director Peter Boduan was sure that Bombardier would reach its purpose at 300 strong orders until the first aircraft was launched in commercial exploitation.
In Thursday, managers also granted analytics and IMEs that the programme is going forward.
“ The aircraft model was not far more than it was expected”, Boddan said during the phone conference, adding that the simple aircraft had been planned land tests and updated software.
All producers plan a different test.
We decided to take the first flight and stop the update, so we did.
This will happen during the whole annual test programme.
The second one of the five test scenes should make a flight next week and all the others will soon follow it as she reported.
However, the skeptic analytics refer to the statement that the first client could be able to operate CSeries aircraft within 12 months after its first field.
The Bombardier campaign stated that it assess the period of entry into operation and provide new information in the next few months.
“ This is a long time of birth testing - sometimes in the visibility, and it matches the internal graph of Bombardier - strengthens our point of view that the introduction will be transferred to the first quarter of 2015," said Dorksen.
In the third quarter, which ended 30 September, Bombardier was reduced to $147 million or 8 costs for asset, with $172 million or 9 costs for asset in the past year.
The accredited asset gain remained elderly — 9 cents.
The gross income was not significantly reduced from $4.2 to $4.1 billion.
The analysis was expected to acquire $10 prices and the cost of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The fourth world's largest air producer reported that he set 45 aircrafts for quarter, less than 57.
The total number of orders falled from 83 to 26 aircrafts.
The Aviecosmic Order was $32.9 billion to 30 September without change from 31 December.
“ In the aircosm area, the results agreed with our objectives, but a few number of market orders and general conditions have become unfair,” said Boddan.
The cost of the aircosmic income was 13 per cent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the largest travel producer in the world, reported that the value income in this sector was almost 11 per cent to $2.1 billion.
The carrier orders were $32.6 billion to 30 September, which was a little higher than 31 December.
At the income of the transport unit, several major contracts were negatively addressed.
The Guideline stated that in the fourth quarter a new development plan would be submitted.
Bombardier, who also announced that the Chief Financial Corporation Director of Google Patrick Pick will enter into the Directors Board of Directors, was 8.5 per cent to $4.83 at the middle of Thursday.
The Brazilian Embraer SA company, a third of the world on the largest commercial aircraft and nearer Bombardier, reported on the reduction of the square income of 10 per cent.
Sony calculates the lower annual gain
The Japanese electronic producer, the Sony Corporation, concluded the past quarter of 19.3 billion and $197 million, reduced the prognosis for the current financial year.
The Sony results of July to September 2013 have been more ambitious than expected to be related to television requests, videocams and personal computers of the Japanese corporation.
Sony's Television Business, in the II quarter of the first operational gain for three years, was 5,2 billion, and the reporting period has disappeared to 9,3 billion in the operational reimbursement.
The Japanese consumer electron market has overcome hard times, particularly because of the decrease of television demand.
And while competitors are trying to find out a complex situation, Sony continues to focus on the consumer seminar.
For example, one of the main partners of Sony, Panasonic corporation, recently lacks the accentuation of industrial collectors: the company's sales grows high rates, particularly by car systems and environmentally clean technologies.
By the end of the financial year, which ends in March 2014, Sony is estimated to obtain 179 billion of an operational arrival against the previous 230 billion.
According to the Thomson Reuters Agency, analytics believed that the indicator would be significantly above and that 221 billion of Ian.

Genchi has been the stimulator of the symptomic education
The scholars from the University of John Hopkins and the Medicine School of Maunnen Siny discovered a white, which Foxp2 is working on its function, stimulating the education of new links between Neurons.
Research is published in Science, and the magazine can shortly read its content.
Henry Foxp2 is the first known genm, which is directly linked to the matter.
Its role was made in 2001 because of the discovery of a number of persons who couldn't proclaim the words and sometimes did not understand each other.
Scientists found that the family members had violated the work of the geno Foxp2, but how he did it do its function, remained unrecognized.
In a new study, the bioology showed that at least part of its functions Foxp2 is implemented as a stimulator of new brain symptoms.
This is being implemented by the other Gene, SRPX2.
The last was discovered in the result of the search for factors that stimulate the education of symptoms.
SRPX2 has been found one of the 10 similar genes found by authors, so Foxp2 is only on its activeness.
The fact that SRPX2 actually affects the virtualization, scientists confirmed the Mouse Experience.
When the gena has been declined in artificially, they were less crying when the mother was divided.
If the geno ' s activity was restored, it has been retained and the frequency of the sounds reported.
The previous Mouse was also shown in connection with the Foxp2 self-virusalization.
The lives that have introduced a human geno copy were eating more active and lower often than ordinary mouses.
Today, however, scientists do not know whether Foxp2 work is linked and, accordingly, managed by SRPX2 with "mechanical" properties of sound education or more deep processes.
The jurisdiction of the cocaine dependence, which has advised the Head of Criminal Group on Police Research, arrested in prison
The 42-year-old Bashrat of the Child provided information to the Criminal Autority of Nila Scarboro
The advocate was afraid that his secret drug dependence would be discovered
Three years of prison prison by the Queen Court of Liverpool was condemned.
The privilege lawyer, who told the drug of the great police investigation, feared the development of its secret drug dependence, was arrested for three years in prison.
The 42-year-old Bashrat of the Child had transferred the criminal authority of Nila Scarbor a secret information on the investigation of its activities on illegal drug trafficking after threatening its cocain independence.
A subsequent lawyer, who was sent out by the Bash and was called among the offenders of the “related lawyer”, was arrested at home in 2011 after the police of the Scarboro, which he had previously represented in the court related to drugs.
The officers noted the 32-year-old Scarboro left three packages with cocaine to a lawyer in the city of Bluebern of Lankashire until he was at dinner of lawyers with colleagues.
Followed that the Child “regulally used” drugs of class A, after tests showed the follow-ups of cocaine in his hair, his card and credit cards.
During eight months from January to August 2011, he tried to get illegally information on the arrests of the Scarboro, as well as one of his communities.
The four suspects were present at this time under the supervision of the police in the main investigation of the Criminal Organization on the Governance and Cocain in Lankastria, Cambridge, Maryssaid, Berkшир and West York.
They and 32 persons later were arrested in prison after the police had earned in the series of heroin rivers and cocaine for $1.5 million and more than $2000,000.
A 42-year-old child delivered information to the offenders because of the fear that his cocaine dependence would be discovered.
Today, in the Leberpool Queens Court of Child, who worked in the legal company Forbes Solicitors, situated in Bluebern, was covered by the view of the recognition of his consequence in two cases of an intentional prevention of the implementation of justice for the three-week-week court in the Court of Liverpool.
He was recognized in the conservation of cocaine at one of the previous court meetings.
The legal development occurred after the police investigating Scarboro was found that he had regularly spoken with the Child on phone since February 2011.
Two detectives followed the suspected and discovered how he came to the Child in Bluebern and put drugs for 60 percent cleaning in the black primary for the golf under furniture lawyers.
Shortly after the transfer of Scarboro, he congratulated with the Child who was at the Football Station of Ivoire Park of the Bleebern Rovers Team.
The jurisdiction was returned home for drugs, and there were nine talks.
The court recognized that the Child had been regularly used to cocaine, since the tests discovered the drug follow-ups of class A in his hair, hair hair and credit cards.
The child later was arrested, but refused the use of the cocaine, said he talked to the suspected disaster because he was his client, and insisted that their communication was “avotic secret”.
During his detention, the child took his card and tried to put out a few credit cards, but all of them were confident, he also had a hair image.
He said to the police that he had a home office, and the clients came to him at the legal case.
However, the court was known that after important arrests, he called the larger parties of the illegal drug trafficking, which he had previously presented in the court to tell that the detectives were known.
In the accused words, Ann Wait said: “If anyone knows that it should not be violation of the law, it is a lawyer on criminal matters.”
Mr. Children is accused in the abuse of his statutory of the lawyer on criminal matters because he had entered too closely with certain customers.
The contact we are talking is not just a drug drugs, but a drug drugs to our own lawyer.
Some of his talks will certainly be fair because he was a lawyer.
However, this was significantly translated by the normal relations of the lawyer and client.
He prevented the police investigation as strong as possible to allow those persons to continue its criminal activities.
Mr. Chitt didn't read his profession, but swallowed her.
He was too close to certain clients, particularly Scarboro, and allowed him to convict its uninterest.
The child did not recognize the fault and said: “If I were an avocate whom I am not, and I would like to transmit the information to Mr. Scarboro, I would not wait for 15 hours, I would have done it immediately.”
But after the elderly officer Li Holsted from the police of Lankashire, he stated: “Mrs. Death became a lawyer for criminal cases as a criminal person just began to bring drugs to the representatives of the organized crime.”
His attitude to the cocaine had made it inadequately designed and vulnerable for the purposes of the main criminal groups who have commanded him to provide a precious information on the police investigations.
Responses should follow up higher standards of professional ethics and enhance the society of confidence and security.
Mr. Kind gave this confidence and tried to cover his professional.
The investigation of the case has been made by Mr. Children's unit of Lankastra on a particularly dangerous crime, which has already been condemned for it at three cases of cocaine retaining, and now still in preventing the implementation of justice, demonstrating our efforts to achieve a fair punishment for criminals.
The case will serve warning the offenders that no one is outside the reach of the law.
We will find you and bring you to the complaint.
Sam Scarboro was condemned by 14 years after the recognition of his fault in a debate with the aim of the heroin, the cocaine and the marijuana.

What will the TPU construction in Moscow
With each year, the capital authorities promise to develop more carrier and overseas (TPU).
Before 2020, 255 TPU is planned.
What is actually going on, our corrispondant was elected.
A couple of months ago, in the "Smonian" metroon" Arbatco-Save Line, a construction camp.
The signing stated that the trailing and trans-sized housing was conducted.
All this was very strange because there is no land transport that can't be stopped and then it can't be moved on.
In order to reach the nearest trolelybose ceiling on the sand, the order is 130 meters, including the land transfer through the Carmany movement.
Now it's almost completed in the Soviet.
The colorful lac, demonstrated the wall for the newspaper, and the asfalt has changed the brass.
Here's all the carrier.
Transporting guests would be plans and capitals, explain the capital service of the Transport Department.
Captain TVs haven't yet.
The planet provides the construction of parks, trade objects containing passenger movements, the creation of small architectural forms and welfare.
In fact, non-country ICTs are even undertaken by carriers, but professional suppliers from the Capital Responsement of the City of Moscow.
The transporting host is not a comprehensive construction – explains the Director of the Institute of Transport and Transport Policy of Michael Blinn.
Sometimes enough crystals on the head and tables of transport time.
So, for example, Isenov's Metro is recently opened a full-scale planet relocal guest.
Let's not beat, but with the closing parks and tables that show when the bus comes.
But the number of officers are recorded to the TPU any accident.
In 2011, Mari was planned to build all 151 guests, which were 59 with capital construction.
Now, in plans to 2020, up to 255 TPU.
Some of them have promised stealing in this year.
Although there is a TPD development program, no quality criteria are defined, he states Alexander Morosov, the Chairman of the Public Organization.
The number of objects are calculated, but the quality of transfers of each of them is often disappeared.
The criteria, in view of the expert, must be two: the first - reduction of the time of transfer, in the second - opportunity.
Before the opportunity to change the type of transport without rain.
In Moscow, when TPU furniture plants, it is directly designed.
A clear example of the UDDH.
Previously, the reward buses from the Yugoslav Schoss came to the main entrance of the ICB.
Now, their ceilings were transferred to the opposite side of Yugoslavia to the Cosmonautos Street.
More than a metro, significantly far from the monarch, nearer to a living house.
Through that the inhabitants didn't want the autocraft under the windows and were desired in all possible institutions.
With the capital TI in Moscow, it wasn't done any time.
The first ones began to build five years ago in the "Plane" metro.
The project was called to be former.
And it was really an example of how the overseas host granted to rescue investors is converted to a banking trade centre.
No, there's a princess for the bus, shot to go from the metro under the rain, and three stages of the car.
Actually, the Chemical Troilboses No.202 and No.203 did not have a principle.
They were disappeared from the metro.
There's more place under trade.
Only 32 store clothes, and it's almost all of the stores to the car.
Well, actually, one of the passengers will need to buy a new car in the way?
We have, when we build the capital TI, why somebody always gets a trade centre.
Recently, the situation has reached its logical completion when the part of the autostany decided to locate the market.
Now, at the third stage of the TPT, the Planner's among the park places is a battle trade.
Yours, specials, Chinese gens, the Nerose talks and protectors who are badly looking at our photo.
The oversearch host was finally turned into the baser.
It's that before the Planning Metro was a market, but it's taken.
And in the prefecture of traders, they were missed and disappeared to the overseased park.
However, because of high prices there is always empty.
It's the most ridiculous that the markets had been made to build it on his... a new TIP planet.
That's a year ago.
The Cauglian Metro is 50 meters from the driver of metro to the bus, and he says Alexander Morosv.
After the construction of a commercial centre, such as TPU, the distance has increased to 170 meters.
In order to sit in the bus, it is necessary to go through the whole trade centre.
After 22 hours when he is closed, it is going to share him under the open heavens.
Furthermore, the building on the "Planner" and "Calluge" will soon be shown with the colours.
In the middle September, the MARC was approved planning decisions for the first eight capital TPs.
Four of them will be 25-th, not considered two-third irons.
The main monster is growing in the metro of "Tucino", it's 418.7.000 km of the area.
Representatives of railway clothings for TPU building in metro have already been reported to the journalists: the future shops, guests and apartments are contained in the future.
In this way, the officers believe that multi-round parks take the moon from the third to the half of the area.
Let's take the example of the "natural" garages.
And I say, the galet is 258 cars that have recently been built on the International Street is 8015 kilometres.
So, for the parking by 2.6 thousand cars in the Piraterosco-Razumbie, we need an order for 80,000 quarters.
It's less than the third of the machine that's going to build there.
Let one two stages go to every bus's princes.
It remains at least 150 thousand kilometres of commercial non-mobileness.
And this is, at a minute, almost two GHM.
If the capital TPs in the stations and coals build iron furnitures, the rest of the metropolitics will be swallowed.
They also promised that there would be a lot of functional appointments, including guests, offices and even sports.
Nevertheless, the apartment of the City of Moscows has added journalists to draft draft decisions that investors could be able to participate directly to TPU officials.
Not any competitive.
Therefore, please that the town's transport issues are priority.
The ideal TI is, for example, the Harvard station in Boston or Southern in Toronto, sure Alexander Morosov.
There are the trolebus and trambuses from the land at the metro level and the distance of the approach from the wagon metro to the tram cell is 50 meters without going on the street.
There's no less trade.
But the Moscow leaders are thrown into extremity.
Or we're going to build nothing or we'll get 25 stages with offices and apartments.
The Eser proposes that the exизм of the abuses of patriotric feelings would be accepted
For the legislative protection of the patriotal feelings against the Russia's prostitution and the offences of the Russian Justice, it proposes that abuses of the patriotic feelings to extremist activities and to harm for five years of prison.
As reported by the Irish Journal, those amendments in the legislation prepared by the Opinion Committee on Energy of the Michaev Olet, are already designed to be arrested to the Supreme Court and the Government.
With the patriot feelings of the author, the author's amendment proposes to understand the emotional link with the country of which he is a citizen of love to this country, responsible for its court, respect for its history and culture.
As indicated by Michai, the law is authorised for the formal signs of the State ' s flago and herb.
The parliamentary considers that the protection of the Russians, whose feelings may be harmed and abused by public symbols, and other relevance to our country, is not sufficient in the Russian legislation.
As a example, it offers the divorced annually in the Cononym Day of the Defence Day when some medical persons are allowing themselves to doubt the heroic movement of the people of the CSR in combating the fascistics.
The Main Year - Yearday of Birth - 9 May - year - year - old - birthday was disappeared.
Attracting the astromy and the alternative view of the story, some publics are going to discuss that, unfortunately, the cultural Germans haven't missed the wild Council Union!
I'm reading this absolutely unnecessary in the country where the story fierce remains the main "good scene" of the nation, "Olé Michev's disappeared."
Furthermore, Michaeva said that the patriotically planted people in Russia is much more than religious, but the law shows the abusing of the feelings of believers and the abusing of patriotically feelings can be practically inadverted.
In view of the People ' s elector, patriotic feelings to extremist activities should be respected and in the 282th article of the Criminal Code to be punished.
The draft law provides a punishment of patriotic feelings: from the 100-year stage to the 5-year-old arrest.

The security concern in Mozambique is increased by the conflict of influenced people
Subsequently, the Statute of Samory Machela, President-Office of Mozambique, were gathered thousands of people in the Maputu centre to scann the world loans on one of the rare demonstrations here.
"We want to return peace; we want stability," said Vanessa de-Sussa, the executive Director of Investment.
In danger of the future of her country, she changed the business coast on the football that has improved the title "We need security" to the Portuguese, and joined a Thursday to the capital of the Independence Plan.
During two weeks, practical daily reports have been made between government troops and Renamo, one of the most cruel shits since the conversion of more than 20 years ago.
Renamo was once known by a permanent movement that was supported by the first time by the white authorities of Rodesia and then by the South African Epathey as a partnership in the context of the destabilization of the independent Government.
After the period 1992, it became an opposive party.
The analytics believe that the country is in the case of returning to the full conflict, however, recent events have recently forced to enhance for foreign investors and local residents.
High rates for fast growing economy, since the opening of huge gas stocks and coal stocks in the northern ocean can bring more than $50 billion as an investment in the next few years from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The direct party of Frelimo, leading political force since 1975, and the Renamo Party accused each other in the establishment of tension.
The Party Renamo claims that the Government has become a complaint of recent capitals, attacked its members in the province of Sophal, the traditional premium of Renamo, 17 October.
The attacks on the former positions were discovered when the Government forces attacked the basis of Renamo and tried to kill Aphonso Dholkaam, the leader of the group, reported the Financial Times Fernando Mazanga, representative of Renamo.
The Government accuses Renamo to initiate capitals by accusing the party to attack soldiers.
The President of Armando Gabuza had tried to make dangers on the incertainty.
Gabuza said AFP, the French Information Agency, in the middle of Mr. Dylakama felt that he was an unloved one wishing to use “all that remained from his force to try to demonstrate that he could touch the Government’s own decisions.”
Like Frelimo, Renamo, they want to avoid war.
However, dangers increased after the report that Mazanga had declared the refusal of Renamo from the Peaceful Agreement in 1992.
He reported the Financial Times that it was not respected by the Party Party's agreement.
“ Our goal is to return to negotiations, but with all the seriousness, ” said Manzanga.
The previous negotiations between parties had little been made to reduce the tension that has increased the series of concentrations in this year.
“ These are two affective persons (Geboza and Dhallakama), which were touched by the libs, ” said Joseph Hanlon, a doctor of the Open University and a Mozambique expert.
No one of them is a good negotiator and no one is ready to go to the necessary actions.
The Party Renamo, who is trying to reach election reforms, already stated that it would fight the municipal elections appointed at November.
The Chairperson and Parliament elections are planned for the next year.
Some commentaries interferred this pressure as an attempt to enhance the movement and financial burdens from the Government.
In 1992, the new Democratic Mozambique Democratic Movement (MDM), which is based on the former Renamo, is expected to improve its indicators in these elections.
Mr. Mazanga said that Mr. Gabuza, who should go from the stage in the next year when the second period is completed, wants to destroy democracy in the country.
“He doesn't want a multiparty democracy, but he doesn't want the transparent elections, but he does not want the peace because he would not leave the President," said Mazanga.
It is not clear how possible Renamo has, however, has already implemented destructive and struggling attacks on police parties and cars on the key car conducted from the north to the south.
Most of the sticks were in the province of Sophala, which is in several hundreds of kilometres northern from Maputu, but includes Beir, a port that is a garnished company, including Rio Tinto and Vale, uses for exporting angle.
In June Rio stopped the use of iron roadways approximately a week after Renama had affected the railway.
Mazanga was driving when he asked whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
The Party Renamo wished to “again the international community that the cases in Mozambique are not very good”, said Mazanga.
Insufficientness has increased the disability to the Government, and many people also worried about corruption, slow-level development and recently involved human damage, said Fernando Lima, head of independent mediacoops.
“Their people think that the responsibility of the future of the countries is to bear the Government and the President who should also find these problems”, he said.
Omar Sultuan, a demonstration party, said that people just want the stability.
“ No one worried about Renamo, nor Frily, they just want to renew the world, they want free access to the ways” he said.

Children must study myths and legends as a “modation of life”, says the author.
Thorree might show that the “group force can't overcome an expensive smoke” and the legends about King Arthur show how important it is to have dream.

Not to be simplified or bringing to a happy end, but to be born understanding of good and evil.
This should be sublimated; it was discovered by history, not clearly formulated.
An older principle: show, not telling.

In Siberia, it must not be a vegain: the temperature will not replace the spot
Why not the veterinary life in Siberia has explained the corporate of RIA News.
People who are fully rejected from animal origin must not live in Syria.
They don’t have a winter for health, and there are no temperatures that are not expensive, they consider the damage of the newsire diagnostics and doctors.
Drink Literal Oil
The smooth vegetarian is not only dismissed from meat and fish but also from milk, meat, eggs, a moderate way of life.
However, the doctors and diateologists are sure that in New Zealand and other Siberia's towns, such as food standards are not useful for health.
The full refusal of animal products is damaged.
In animal white contains unchanged immunics that are very difficult to compensate plants.
We need to be included in the rationality, even though the milk or the oxen," a certain diagnosis of Marina's diagnosis.
It provides an example of the fish containing a non-empty green oxide of Omega-3.
The richest oil for them is a lion.
"What's to need it in the numbers necessary for a man, you need to drink letters!" said the diathology.
The methods are sure that the people of Siberia need to give special attention to the ratio to winter.
This area of vegetarian is particularly concerned.
In our reality, high demands are made to eat.
You don't want to smoke, you need an increased collarity.
"If a person limits himself to animal products, so that this collorianity does not take it," says the specialist.
This agreed doctor-disectologic Olga Poevich.
She adds that bringing fruit and fruit is not out.
The man is better to ask the primary products produced in the area of residence or where he was born.
The Genetic Code is intended to improve the combustion and transformation of these products.
And the winter people wouldn't want to smile, but the bitter spot or something more later," she explains his position to the doctor.
Its words, from the fact that the winters can be useful of various misunderstandings, largers, dishes, local fruits, irons remaining in the winter.
But this is, uncertainly, not enough for full food.
According to the doctor of the Claudia Arifullian, a synthesis in the vitamins level is only sufficient from the middle of August and the mid- September.
The full vegetarian transition in our hard natural circumstances when temperature can change to 30 degrees and lies in my snow is unrealised.
The organism for life needs energy, and this is, mostly, the grass," is the medicine.
The teacher notes that heavyness is particularly harmful for children and female.
Children are growing, they need constructive material, including the aminotics.
And when we hold the vegetation, we give them not full.
The burdens are also needed in the main contents of white, vitamins and micro-related mixtures in the menu.
"The winds are uncomfortable," God's sure.
Ariphilian says that an adult person wants to choose all that he wants, "going in the games that he wants."
His body has already formed, skelet, bodies.
And the children have to take full question.
If parents leave him micro-related or immunistics, selecting him what he's going to eat, it's just a violation of the rights of the child.
"The lack of those or other substances for the development of the brain, look, you'll not retain the bones tomorrow," says she.
All medicine specialists are considered to be not high as growing winters in temperatures and fruits and fruits.
What we are bringing and produced in the temperatures is the lower number of microphones required to us than (excluded) in the open ground.
"The quality of the products isn't that," God says.
Ariphilian also notes that income and temperature fruits and fruits far from ideal standards.
The desire of producers to gather large burdens is damaged by quality.
"The bulls are not crowned in the circle, the raws are slightly wanting and smoothing, the immoral and unalerable drugs," adds medicines, adding that they are more likely to be drunk with a lower number of complaints.
And they become providers not vitamins, but cells.
This does not agree to the Siberian physics and technical institution of aggressive problems, the Agriculture Research Research.
It said that, in the right approach and in compliance with all standards and requirements in the temperature, the growth of full fruit could be made.
If you are attempting to extract the maximum of the square metre, it is, of course, to be faster and to overcome the growth of mineral approvals.
For example, when a lot of aggressive merchants are fast growing, they are large, but waterists and unfairly," she adds that quality is first depending on the producer.

The Court of Appeal stated that the court was required because it had violated the code of conduct of the United States and had not regarded the need to avoid the demonstration of prejudice, partly from the series of interviews in the ICS and of the official statements containing the public response to the court.
The court decided that the police officers had violated civil rights of tens of persons, not necessarily turning to black and Latin Americans on the 'Case-I-Search Programme'.
It was appointed an external monitoring control for the largest changes included policy reforms, education and monitoring, and decided to launch a platform on video camera testing in the police parts where most detainees happen.

The Parties ' s change in the Police Rehabilitation Programme in New York say that these changes will end unlimited practices, form a more reliable and effective police service and may understand how other police departments do this practice.
The opponents claim that changes are reduced by the police spirit, not by the crime, to the unnecessed money trams and do not address the more global problem of complex conditions to the police because of the reduction of officers for a few thousands in the last decade.
The court noted that it had not stopped the practice of resurrection and seeking, which corresponds to the Constitution, but changes the way the police of the New York Police would stop people.

The German SMEs say that BfV hoped to find antones of listening devices, and these actions took negotiations between the United States and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Berlin.
James Clopper, the United States National Research Director, reiterated in September that the United States did not use an external investigation “for the destruction of commercial secrets of foreign companies for the United States to improve their international competitiveness or to increase their gains”.
Since Edward Snouden, a contracting officer who becomes developer, began to publish its secret secrets of the United States, European Governments and company leaders, whether they can believe the Director in the word.

The German companies are convinced that the United States are now presenting almost the same risk as China, in the field of industrial skills and disappearance of data, according to the research published in July of the EY Consulting Agency.
However, in all documents discovered by Mr. Snowden, there was no evidence that the United States had transferred commercial secrets of foreign companies to their own companies.
Policy expressed concern that the EU was not aware of certain opportunities in the field of information and the Internet, and said that it should try to reduce its dependence from the United States.
The insulins are skeptically relating to this.
Someone in the German parliament says we should create a German Google.
I can just close the eyes and slowly open them again.
“It is no option”, says Gaso Plattner, President of the German programme provider for the SAP business.
If there is a need for the powerful European IT industry, it should not be allowed to die more than 20 years ago.
Everything is subsequent in Germany: from the air to cars and farmers.
Everything except IT industry.
Nevertheless, the coverage and technical development of the United States School agencies, which were known by the Snowden discovery, appeared a shot for some companys that had previously thought that the largest risk of the screens was China.
The larger movement of the local technologies, where the leaders of the European companies better understood that data in the United States are in the same jurisdiction and therefore potentially binding.
According to the research carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance Security Association, approximately 10 per cent of its non-American participants refused the plans to be used by a local driver following the development of the American data analysis.
Jim Sneeb, one of the executive directors of SAP, said: “We see the consumers are asking a new question that has not occurred a year ago, that is where my data are stored and if you can ensure that they will remain physically in this jurisdiction.”
Many German leaders claim that the latest communications are only acknowledged that they already knew: the powerful States want to reduce their most precious secrets, and therefore these data should be protected by any price.
What happens to the economic spyon is no wonderful.
He always had a place.
“ This was an item of discussion for many years and has not significantly changed in the current field, ” says Kurt Bock, the Chimical Managing Director.
The Americans are posting us at the commercial and industrial level, and we are also shopping them, because it is our national interests to protect our commercial enterprises.
Liders of corporations usually do not like to have the subjects of the responsive measures they have taken, as it can provide the privilege of the adversary.
In large enterprises, it was already a long time to think that to take a free flower on the exhibition or to leave a bottle without supervision in the oven number, at least noticed.
Ulrich Hakenberg, a member of the Board of the Audi Restructuring Corporation Board, said that it is a standard practice for many years to collect mobile phones before the government meetings so that they could not be used as listed devices.
The Federal Protection Service of the Constitution of Germany recommends that companies leaders consider the possibility of the use of simple mobile telephones during foreign travels because of the vulnerability of smartphones.
The previous mobile phones are elected later.
Nevertheless, there are dangers that small and average companies remain vulnerable for slaughters and screens.

The monitoring and prevention of diseases provided recommendations for children ' s schools
In the middle of the monitoring and prevention of diseases, a list of recommendations for food alergy for children in schools have been published.
This is the first list of such recommendations that the United States has issued, while the number of children of school age suffering from food alergy grows.
Now one of the 20 children in the United States has food alergy.
The monitoring and prevention of diseases found that the distribution of food alergy among children has increased to 18 per cent from 1997 to 2007.
The Guideline contains information on how to improve the awareness of teachers and staff of children ' s food alergy and how to assist for alcoholic reactions.
It also recommends for schools to keep discrealised stocks, mostly for injections, the EpiPen medical school is used to assist the potentially medicine Analysis.

Intersecundary children can choose “undetermined breast”
Germany became the first European country, which recognized the third sex of children born with neighbourhood bodies.
The newborns will not need to register the male or female sex.
The new law does not require parents to call some kinds of such children by allowing parents to draw a role as “undetermined” or “untained” in their birth witnesses.
The goal of the law was to disappear the pressure of parents who could take successful decisions on the presence of the sex and combat intersexual discrimination.
One intersexual man, according to BBC, said many years later: “I'm not a man nor a woman. ”
I'll stay created by doctors with blue and shoes.
For example, one of the two thousand children born annually is neither a boy nor a girl.
They have an intersexuality, one of about 60 pathological statuss that fall under the ‘ sexual development’ diagnosis — a collection of terms for people with therapy chromosms, guitars, or seeds, or inadequately developed sex bodies.
Wally Simpson might have been an intersexual.
Gender identification is not yet outstanding, but most experts in the United States say that, if the pillar cannot be determined, it is better to use all available information and to provide it rather than waiting and affecting the psychological and physical development of the child before the operations.
The New York psychiatric, Dr. Jack Dpreser, who specializes gender identification, said that the new German law was “a good idea”.
Intersexual children are creating an ethical diploma.
“ Some people have a huge life of violations that require operational interference, but there is no majority of their children” he said.
You can access the hole without operations and then see how to develop personality.
Scientists about how the child has a gender identity are not too accurate.
No one can answer why it happens.
It's a mystery of why people fight homosexual.
The report sent to the European Commission in 2011 describes intersexual people different from transsexual or transborder, as their status is not a gender, but a biological construction that does not be exclusively male, female, and typically for both ones, or at one time.
These characteristics may be held in second sex signs such as the museum mass, the distribution of hair cloth, the breast and the corporation; primary sex signs such as reproductive bodies and genealogy, or the structure of chromoso and harmones.
The report also provides a general presentation of discrimination with inter-sexual and transгенment persons in the area of employment, and the level of prejudices, cruelness and crimes of self-requests.
Gender disappearance is now a special camp.
Australia and Nepal have already allowed adults to put male, female or third volcanoes in their official documents.
In June 52, the inhabitant of Australian Norri May Wellby became the first one recognized “Boostless” in the world.
As reported by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the German passengers will be used in addition to M and F X, which is intersectional.
In neighbour France, gender issues are still contrary, in accordance with the new outcome to France 24.
In 2011, the decades of the lawyers in France, the clearly elected Catholic country, signed a peak on the exemption of a gender teory from school schools.
The American Catholic Web site also expressed non-compliance with the German law that “in situations where the world is in a new state where the pillar is an object of election, and sexual activity — no, we are turning up two tables of civilization.”
One mother of a new birth child from Maryland also reported the website of Baby Zone that she would prefer to establish a sex at birth.
“ To make a child pretty hard and without additional limits, especially if you don’t know the full of your child, ” she said to the parents.
Children need stability and confidence.
History children born with male and female organs called germaphrodiats, namely the beautiful Greek god, who had the signs of both sex.
And over ten years ago, the health community has taken a gender as a letter on which it can be moved, and then again resumed.
But now many are complicating ethnic reasons for the chirurgic operation, knowing that gender identity is complex, and sometimes the doctor does not know how the child will receive the dedicated ball when he grows.
“ In the middle of the 20th century, it was called 'unnecessary psychiatric cases',’ said Derek.
When they were born, you didn't call a psychiat, you called the chirurg.
The adminent theory on how to refer to children with the interim type was proposed by Dr. John Many from the University of Johns Hopkins, who believed that the general was easy to change.
He introduced the terms of gender identity and stated that environmental signals, including social — how parents grow in the child — involves Gender and Child Harmons, determined whether a man would be considered a man or a woman.
But in one case in 1966, known as “Junn/Juan”, his theories were questioned.
He attended the parents of the boy whose pensions were disastered during the unmarried circumcision, completely caught the child, also removed his eggs and grown as a girl.
“ Many presented cases as a successful example of transition, but it was not so, ” said Derek.
When a boy was about 15 years old, he became a boy and married a woman.
But in 38 years he had self - murder.
The Dreper said that some doctors are still “allowing this model. ”
But in the 1990s, with the arrival of the Internet, people who overlooked these sex operations said “related results”.
This was also the case of Jim Bruus, a 36-year-old writer of the Montana State, born with male chromosome XY but by intermediary type genetals.
The doctor could not be able to determine whether he had a large climate or small pension, and they were convinced that he could never live “pleasant life” of men.
So soon after his birth in 1976, the outside sexual body and the corners of Brisa were removed chirurgically and he became a girl.
He began to give women harmones 12 years old.
"I knew I'm not a girl," he told ABCNews.com.
I was unfortunate, but it was very hard to ask questions.
In 18 years, he was appointed a wagino payment.
But it is in depression and understanding that something is wrong, he needed medical documentation.
What he knew was terrible.
I was slaughtered at the birth, and nobody told me about this.
Brush was born from sexual development violation, which did not allow his body to produce sufficiently thesteron for normal development.
Knowing the truth, he became a man receiving the tester’s schools and removed his breast again.
Operations did it be hungry.
Today, he speaks to protect others in the organization named the project interface, seeking to bring people to intersexuality.
But Ann Temar-Methtis, Executive Director of the Californian Legal Association, Advocates for Reportd Choice, is concerned that the German law “provides energency and achieves.”
“ Many actives are concerned that the German law will encourage parents to take successful decision and to give the child “undetermined”," she said.
We're afraid he'll help interference.
We believe that it's better to assist a man or female sex and then wait.
But we have not yet seen how this law shows, so everything we can do is build proposals.
The Temmar-Mathis said that its organization supports the Australian law, since “they allows adults to choose for the third sex”.
“ Further people must have an opportunity to take their own decisions on formal sexual behaviour” she said.
The German law understood its dedication at birth.
This is the contradiction in which little children should not take place in this stage.
When they grow up, they can take decisions on their own body.
But Mr. Arlin Baratz, a mammologue of Pittsburg, who has a daughter with sexual development violation and helps hundreds of other people in the support group, said that the German law would support both parents and children.
The daughter of Barac, Katie, was born with the male chromosome, but she has a violation of sexual development named “unsearch of full disappearance to drugs. ”
Because her drug receptors are unjustly working, the female signs have been expanded in Cataly.
She's got an additive, but there's no mams and thumbs.
Now, in 29 years, Katty is married and has been a child psychiatric coordination at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although she is immortal, she hopes to be a parents through the establishment or a socially severe maternity.
“ It gives time to the parents to not take successful decisions, ” said Barac.
He gives them time to make some analysis and to split in the situation, as well as the interims of time before they are written a "Muman" or a female.
In this case, you are okay, grow up, love the child.
You have a wonderful child and you feel joyful.
We don't have to do soon on the operation that is uncomfortable.
“ This allows children to participate in the decision and make anxiety moved by parents because they don’t feel what they do right, ” she said.
At the end, the child decides with what room he or her is more comfortable, and it is wonderful.
This gives children the opportunity to decide in self-determination.
The Chicago teacher said that he's got to play better.
According to the 40-year-old Russian, he will continue to work carefully on the trinials.

Aniah’s grandfather, who lives in the village of Ivano of Peteric region for twenty years, became aware of how the neighbourhood sits, despite all the efforts of his inhabitants.
The pitchers put up the new vessels above, and the lower ball has already asked between the leads, it's going to be moved.
Of course, the family of asylums, which each year went into the submission, were deployed and disappeared for three-quarter feet years, but not wished to stay without light.
As the birds of the owners in the warmest part, the grandmother Ananias called to the King’s REA, which belongs to the opor.
And she didn't even wait that there was so fast.
When our specialists came to Ivan, they wondered that the neighbour is still holding -- said the DTK technical Director "Dnepropubliner" Sergey Beersov.

Before the end of the year, the same reconstruction is expected to be four narrows in the Power and the King of Defence.
Instead, until some save rare birds, others are slaughterly killed.
In the whole area, the news in the town of Weten-Camman of the Apostol Area, on the day of the opening of flowers, the marriagers for the dissemination have spread the levy family in the local area.
The lowly birds did not fear the people — the local inhabitants of their inhabitants were disappeared and not disappeared.
When the farmer heard the swords, they fled to the pool, four red leathers already lay on the water.
Now, the missional officers of the Apostle paradise explain who slaughtered the birds in the Red Book.

Message: Obama's pre-selected Chapter considered the exclusion of Baidan for Hillaria Klinton
The New York Times, close advisers of the President Barac Obamai in secret considered the possibility of replacement of the Vice-President Joo Bayden of the Hillaria Clinton candidate in the 2012 election list.
This opening is the most clear sense of all the expected book Mark Holperin and John Hayleman on campaign 2012: "The game has changed 2012."
The Times issue received an example prepared for the outcome of the book and reported on Thursday of the evening that the neighbours of the Chairman had conducted the “mobile research in the focus groups and public opinions at the end of 2011” to assess whether the exemption of the Baidan could help the overcome hopes of the rehabilitation of Obama.
As reported by the Political Deputy The Times Johnathan Martin, the book provides a detailed description of the attempts of the high-level chair officers and the White House, namely the former Chairman of the White House of Bill Daley, to assess the effect that the result is aimed at voted by the former Chairman of the Vice-President Client.
The possible replacement was a secret, firmly protected in the Chicago Pre-State and the Oval Office.
Only six closer advisers of the President — including David, the former head of the Pre-Section Chapter Obamas Messina, and the former senior advisers of the White House of David Axldrour and David Pulph, knew that the replacement was considered.
The book "Double Stories" claims that David was an initiative to replace Baidan, despite their “related personal relations”, but finally rejected the step when their data showed that the addment of Clientone in the election list would not “effectively improve the possibility of Obama.”
In his interview, Martin Daley confirmed that the Administration was actually considered the possibility of replacement of Baiden Clinton.
“ I was actively expressed for the consideration of the abundance of things, and it was one of them” said David.
You should remember that, at that moment, the President was a terrible form, so we thought, "O God, what do we do?"
While Daily arguing the research as an ‘request verification’, Martin told the representative of CNN Andersson Kuper that the pre-selection chapter was sufficiently involved in the study of whether this step would be taken to vote.
“Parliaments do not paid such money for investigation and focus groups if they are not considered anywhere”, said Martin in the AC 360 programme.
It is clear, however, whether Obama knew that his team had studied the possibility of replacement.
Martin told CNN that he asked whether Daley knew his last boat about the possible exchange.
Even though David and said he did not think that the President was on the course of a possible replacement that the former chapter of administration recognized that Obama had been possible.
Martyn added that "double stories" does not give a clear answer to the question whether the results of political management were made to the Obamas table.
Chuper asked Martin whether he seriously believed Obama did not know the possibility of excluding Baidan from the election list.
“ Maybe ” answered Martin.
Do you want the light in the dark of the swift?
The British enterprise has created the first light in the world with the use of the medicine.
Charlie Francis used flavouring properties of the sea animal to develop light food.
He came to this idea, reading a scientific article on mezles, and convinced the scientists in China chemically renewing a light white.
The moromen acts with the language of the eating it, highlighting the pH level of white and enlightening it.
Crisis says that since the smoke starts lighting when it reacts to the hot, it means that more you're lie, so it's clearly going to be.
Charlie, the principal of the marine production company, I'm drunk, says, “I'm incredible, but it's still in the first stage if you're talking about the production, so you'll get approximately 2 g of the substance.”
The white that we use in the marine is in response to your language with neutral pH.
So when your mouth gets a white, it will increase the pH level, and the marine starts lighting.
We tested him over the past few months, and it seemed to be perfectly presented to Hellouin because it creates such a beautiful light effect.
This may be the most sweet marriage of what I did because the medle-like leather was four times the gold royal.
So every ball's got me about 140.
It's pretty nice.
Experimental company, Charlie, located in Bristol, is a sign of its unnecessary infections, including dog, swimming, iron, and soft gold.
But his next creation should be more ambitious.
He said, "I want to develop an invisible season."

Hellouin 2013
When I was a little, Hellouin was shot.
We and the sister have allowed a coffee, not later to lie and get a mask for our area.
Now I'm just like a rock.
I haven't been calling for the last two years to spend a feast to my apartment and, rather, not to stand in this year.
However, the statistics shows that I am white waron with respect to Hellouine.
According to the National Trade Federation, the majority of the United States — 158 million — will celebrate Hellouin in this year and pay $6.9 billion to the cottons, coasts and deployments.
The only thing I'm waiting for every Hellouin is threescores.
The National Federation of Disearch Trade plans that the costs will be $1.2 billion from $6.9 billion.
In this year, sexually unemployed objects were paid.
Women have no need to be representatives of sexual professionals; they may also be sexual food, such as pizza, hamburgers or mariners.
As regards men, I think we'll see a lot of demons thanks to the Holy Deads, and I'm sure that the cosmounts in the Daft Punk Group will fall into our instagrams in this year.
According to Google, the cosmos that are looking most often, are the zombies, Bethman, the pirates and the irons.
Sorry, there is nothing wrong in traditional approach.
We had our dogs last year and we were not the only one.
Furthermore, in accordance with the National Trade Federation, the Americans will pay $330 million for home animals in this year.
That means a lot of funny dogs.
When the case comes to the conflict, we're not little.
The Americans will pay $1.9 billion in this year according to Nielsen company.
It's about 600 million degrees of Hershey's chocolate, the Milk Duds conflict, the Twizzlers and Clark Bar's battery.
According to the United States Trade Minister, this is a good news for 41 million needing children who have been prepared to accelerate our areas.
Furthermore, we buy and — we will not deceive — we eat 90 million percent of chocolate during Hellouine.
The only thing that we don't want to use is the coffee form of cucuz grains; yet, according to the National Condector Association, almost 35 million dollars are sold under Hellouin.
This is approximately 9 billion of individual cows.
It's a mystery that I've got to say.
Nothing does express the name of Hellouine as a house with preconsciousness.
They have a huge name, for example, “Wooods behind the walls” (the one, finally, is in the present prison), “Wooo and cry” and “The House of Hook”.
Moreover, in America Haunts society, there are 1200 officially recognized homes with prejudices generated by about 500 million income, as well as the huge photographs where you were almost described that your friend had set on Facebook, and then you can't take the guy who likes see this photograph and leaves the classic expression.
And in the conclusion we'll talk about the tickets.
Charlie Braun met us with the Great Ticky when we were kids, and the exhibition of Jake's lightning is like a disappearance of a birth leak, what we're doing with childhood.
With happiness for us, the like of a child was only started in the past year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up by cutting these tickets and not sitting in them.
According to the United States ' s recensement Office, the United States will cost about $106 million per tonnes in that year.
The Lighter of Jake, who was slowly dropped on your flower, probably came from the State of Illynes, who grew up in that year 542 million tonights.
If you want to make a more difficult job, visit Tim and Suezen Meteisdon in the city of Napa of California and try to cut some of their types of weight at 2032.

He came to a quick help -- it confirmed us the doctor of a quick.
And then he cut the two fellows and fled to the pool.
He fled from the U.S. and southern tribe to the Angle of East and North Tribunal.
He fled through all the fields.
This is response to the stories.
Before the entry into force of the dispute law, this area of the police can not be prohibited in what is on the field.

Robby Scott fled after the little DTP falls.
After three days of her inclined in the carrier, he noted a dog raising
The fires were thrown into the swimming powder to save the dog from the immune death
The rest was happy to be saved after the fire teams were designed to take it up and add it to a secure place, after he had sometimes stretched up to the height of 50 meters of the dangerous raw skin.

She didn't have a muscle during salvation, but she was perfectly shot.
But now she's okay.
And then she ate herd.
It was a very insolent call.
The fact that the dog has noted is unbelievable.

George Queevan: The break with Europe gives the statistics a selection
Another day, another strike of independence.
At this time, we warn that independent Scotland must be joined to the European Community free movement zone as a membership in the EU.
It is a fourth of the passenger controls in Berlin and the border with a collapsed swimming pool of Adriann square.
Actually, the Strathclyde newspaper indicated the possible economic benefits from more free movements to the rest of Europe, although it was not in headlines.
No one also pointed out that the EU Member States have long time to reduce their formal rules as well as they were satisfactory.
Since Scotland is not now entered into the Sweden Zone, the continuation of non-compliance will be a deependment for Brussels, replace what he actually wanted from the Advisers.
So it's not a pretty attention of the story.
And such an old that she turned into academic: first, I heard the “account” that “independence means passenger control” at least 40 years ago.
Yet, there is a interesting moment lost when the old story is described.
Why do the independent Scotland have to comply with Europe's orders?
Why can I change London's arm on the Brucelle's arm, especially now?
This is the actual European news: the great post-up plan to engage Europe finally has been closed.
The European project has been dead officially.
In all the European Union, the parties against the EU or the removal of the euro as a single wavelength will take the power.
Even in Germany, the Alternatics Party for Germany, based only in this year, appeared from a neighbourhood and received almost five million votes in the centuries of federal elections, so that it was the result of “Found Democrats” (such as our Library Democrates).
The internal opposition of the Federal Europe plan is always found.
Nevertheless, the current economic crisis has become a flood point.
The hard economies introduced by Berlin and the European Central Bank, and the boundaries set on national economies by preservation of a unique currency, have brought many people to think that the European project was too far.
The euro crisis was little linked to the national Governments in exchange deficits, which was only fair for Greece.
In fact, the growth has blocked its members in exchange rates for German exporters — that German policies and want to keep.
Without the possibilities of the southern Europe's national balance, it is inadequate conditions for production opportunities compared to Germany.
The only saved means to reduce payments and public costs that is actively supported by Berlin.
The current budget and estimates have a deeper problem of Europe's production capacity.
As a result of the integration of green energy measures implemented by Brussels, the energetic energetics defined in French and German energy companies by consumer, the European industry pays two times more for electricity and four times more than gas than in the United States.
It's more paralysing price conditions as we've already seen in Greenginmot.
There is no warning of the payment in the world that the decreased wine of the United States on the Nepthoic Industry of Europe will be stopped.
The result is the burden, especially in France, once the European Union's most nuclear side.
After the war, the French political elit considered the EU as a way to control Germany and put Paris on one level with Washington.
But Berlin is no longer needed to be in Paris as a means of receipt of political legitimacy, and has already bound its own European economic policy, left the destructed economy of France in a disaster.
The result is the right against the Union Party Marin Le Pen, the National Front, only that has gained the decision-making elections by leaving the legal socialist party to the third.
The Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the votes — the timely warning of the British Laborists that it is not possible to be found out of the proposal that the disaster is automatically used to use the left.
What does Le Pen do with his renewed popularity among the French white working class?
She wants to use the elections in the EU in the next year to create a block in the European Parliament against the EU and against a unique wallow.
If it is very likely to be the EU party's support for these elections, this block will first be able to adopt a home situation in the European Parliament.
This is my view: the growing narrows against the EU and against the unique wavelength in Europe are forced to destroy the euros.
The EU will not disappear, but it will be again like the European (Euros Trust Nationals) who liked the General de Goll.
Germany and several dependent economies from her may maintain euros, but France and southern Europe will restore their own wages.
I guess Britain is distained from this project by hope to come close to the United States.
However, the growing interest of Washington to the Pacific indicates that Britain will remain without attention in the cold of Atlantic.
What situation does it leave Scotland?
We can choose to become a region (actually) of the Male England.
Or we can protect our own economic interests, which means, not only to send Berlene and Brussels to the disasters.
I suspect that Scotland is able to overcome a more free European agreement, provided that we will keep our wage.
Cooperation with other Member States will be easier in the Non-Federal Europe.
In the other case, we need to consider the possibility of repeating the experience of Norway and the conservation of our economic independence.
The Government of the Scotland National Party in Scotland is, as a stranger, the most successful political movement in Europe, aimed at the hardest economy that has received the majority of votes in 2011 by reflecting the reduction of costs proposed (and realised) by the Laborist Concert of the Laboratory Capital Alister Darling and the later impact of the Turiian and Liberal Democrates.
Scotland would now vote for independence only in order to take steps to the hard economy engaged by Berlin and Brussels.
Earlier convergence: old form
African and Latin American girls, usually, reach sexually before their white screens, show research.
Physical changes do not mean that the convergence is close
There is no evidence that the proceedings of harmony or other chemicals
The experts believe that the coal epidemic may be one of the leading primary sex convergence mechanisms
The tendenciation to the early sex sense is not so expressed in the boys
The former Correspondent CNN Pete Ettery is a journalist that specializes child health and family issues.
Does the mother flow if her daughters start forming milk iron and growing hair in 7 or 8 years?
At the annual conference of the American Pediatric Academy at the week in Holland, the Floride State, the Child Endocrinolog Dr. Paul Capluitz explained that these early physical changes were fully distributed among American girls and represented a new standard.
“ I take a long time for parents — it usually does not mean the rapid attack of the full sex, ” said the Capacity.
Evidence of development, such as growing breasts, lobby and sustainable hairs and body skins, appear before girls.
However, there was only a small change in the age of Menaryh (the first messaging) for the last four decades.
The average age in the United States is 12,5 years old and reduced compared to 12.75 in 1970.
“ Once the herd starts to develop, it is at least two to three years to the winter, ” said the Capital, who was also the author of the book “Standards of a convergence in girls: how to get to this disseminent problem.”
The time is the most accurate checking of how management will be progressed.
There is a debate on the fact that it is a fair attack of sexual disaster, but it is considered to be “properly” when the breast grows to 8 years.
In most cases the process is delayed or stopped, it is that the pediat can take carefully.
More rapid progress can serve as a basis for analysis in endocrinogo to exclude serious problems such as the deterioration or the oxygen.
There are procedures to maintain early messaging and to prevent another consequence: the previous old cows that can finally lead to growth and low growth in age.
Recommendations on medical or hormonal therapy are based on child age, development, growth rates and emotional heavyness.
The psychosocial aspects are also important.
The Capital is concerned with medicines, but it recognizes that “the education of sexual convergence can avoid the caused problems and feelings of girls that they are different from the breast.”
Another great problem is understood: the parents are just not wanting to have very young daughters.
“ They are worried about the risk of pregnancy or even how they are going to do about the hygiene issues, ” said the Capital.
“ It was a shock, ” remembers one woman who had the daughter of mestructuring started in 10 years.
Although we were signs and we talked about messaging, she was not emotionally ready.
She came home from the school of a ridiculous and degraded because she was the first among her friends.
There are many explained theories about the reasons of the early sex convergence.
Nevertheless, there is no follow-up evidence that harmony are produced in milk or other food products, chemicals in the environment or sexual references to the media.
Gentlemen — Like girls — a predominant confusion.
The Capital claims that the transmission that has the greatest weight is the epidemic of food.
In 2001, he helped the study of girls from 6 to 9 years, linking the number of lives in organism with sex-country periods.
Other data reaffirm this conclusion, but there are many other factors.
In this country, African and Latin American girls are usually reaching sex ages before their white springs.
There are different clarifications.
In the world, the former convergence, in all apparently, affects all: from economic conditions and climate to geno.
Another mystery: Although boys have hairs on face and skins are appeared in younger age, trends are not so expressed as girls.
Other doctors participating in the AAP Conference reaffirmed the complexity of this subject.
The appearance of rare hairs and lobbys is even met by children and children of forest age.
“ We must be careful about how we define the true attack of sexual abuse” said Mr. Laurence Silverman, a child endocrinolog in the child hospital of Horib in Morriston, New Jersey.
Parents should not be able to get some indication from the pediatre of how they talk to their child.
“ This may mean the early one expected to speak, ” explained the Capelot.
If you keep peace, your child is usually reacting well.
The girls who rise early need to reaffirm that even when it happens in the previous place, this process is a normal part of life.
The United States Boeing is prepared for the flight in Chite
The open-term observer of the Russian territory and the aircraft in Chite in Friday, 1 November, at 8:30 by the Mosque time, will leave the aircraft of the city.

Reactive aircraft producers affect the width of the sediment when large orders at the horse
The leading aircraft producers have extended the expensive dispute on the width of the tourist class on further journeys, giving a tonnage for the pollution of Dubai aircraft in this month.
It is turned around the width of the seats provided on the long-mostrical passengers, whose interests are not always in the centre of attention of the airports, since the amount of the space chosen for them plays a key role in the approval of recent airlines proposed by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
The Airbus in this week called for an increased standard, which would provide the width of at least 18 digits (46 cm) in the eco-class salons, but its major American competition Boeing said that it should be decided.
The same time, when aircraft producers are produced in the sales of their two-modern tank aircrafts, and the 17-21 November expected adjudications.
In particular, if there are 9 or 10 persons in a series, it takes a central place in the statements on the economic effectiveness of new projects of the ministry.
Boeing claims that its updated 777X will contain 406 persons from the economic class of more than 17 inches in width, situated by 10 in each row.
Airbus said that the A350 Concurrent version of its A350 will be transferred to the EC class 350 persons to the width of 18 inches sets at 9.
The self-elective gugants are often exchanged by technical attacks through professional press advertisement.
Now Airbus is directly referring to the public in Dubour, where 777X is expected to be a leader with more than 100 orders.
She recently demonstrated what might be the beginning of a new advertising war shown to the financingists that reflected three persons in the restaurant, who had been entitled "You would agree to this?"
“Boeing offers other master fields in the seats more high than in regional tour aircraft” said the leader of Airbus John Lihia.
People's ratios are changed, but aircraft seats have not changed.
In the middle of the 1970s, when a widely feeding Boeing 747 had made the standards of modern travel, and the percentage of average American men from 40 to 49 years has increased to 10 per cent, according to the United States Health Department.
The cost of the median American men of the 21th century is 39.7 degrees, under the statistics of the United States Health Service.
Airbus claims that its competitor was holding the concepts of the 1950s when the average covered the statistics of those who recently called “reactive publication” was already.
Airbus said that the research shows that the additional inch in the width of the seat improves the quality of the sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing is divided by the Airbus figures on the size of the seats and said that the producers should not be interfered in the decision how the airports are balance between tariffs and opportunities.
The research shows that the benefit of the salon is not only on the width of the seat.
“All are actually involved for the election election and the opportunity to do what they consider to achieve,” said the Boeing specialist, on the room of Ken Creper.
They don't want us to decide for them that will bring them a profit.
They know their business better than anyone else.
For passengers, the question is increased by space by sides, but the suppliers are more frequently a factor that can affect the profit.
This controversia is the race of the aeroplanes evaluated at least $700 billion per catholic prices in the next decade, sufficiently to change the comparison of the US and European export.
As the first reported in July of the Retter Agency, the place of seats is that it is that the co-operation of the fight between new reactive aircrafts.
As Airbus, Boeing and 20% increases in winning at one place in their last two-monstery models compared to the market leader in this seminar, 365-month Boeing 777-300ER.
The identified Boeing characteristics are partly based on the comparison of 10-month lines 777X with the original 9-third company of the constructive decision 777.
The experience in self-sensitivity is decreased in comparison with the 10-th company currently used.
“The pricing that Boeing does it is to touch more places and to make its aircraft more competitive in comparison with our developments,” said Kevin Kenstine, head of the Air Force Commissioner in Europe.
On the other hand, the analytics say that the sals with 10-month lines for the 777s show that many passengers prefer the meat plant that can go through the hand of the lower tariffs.
“The Side of the wide eighten inches would be ideal for the passengers, but the reality is that from the commercial view of the Airbus proposal is threatened by the 777 model," said the specialist on the Internet of the Mary Kirby Salon, the principal and manager of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing don't provide creatures but offer suppliers' directorys from which airports can choose.
Peace volcanoes have even settled aircrafts to check competitive plannings.
In the disappearing competitive, all manufacturers also offer aircrafts with a very milk company of the airports and regional vehicles.
Airbus offers A350 and 10-month lines, but says she didn't yet sold it.
Until recently, Airbus emphasized the need for additional salon modalization, proposing a broader place at some of its aircraft.
Without support to the only one producer of large modern aircrafts, as the experts said, its call to the new growing standard, whether it is, but may take attention from the danger of the sale of models 777X.
New anti-ocinic vaccine may avoid the fuming process
Scientists have developed an anti-costic vaccine that could avoid fuming processing sygaritation.
One of the vaccines has been able to protect the mouse from the Nitoin independence to the whole life.
Further tests were needed before the start of testing on people, but Professor Ronald Cristal from the health college of Wail Cornell in New York stated that the first results were discovered.
“We are very hoped that such vaccine-use strategy can finally help millions of fuels who tried to move, testing all the methods available today, but found that their nitrogen dependence is sufficiently strong to overcome it through these modern means”, said Professor Cornell.
The new vaccine contains an immediate virus that was developed to bring genetic information to the production of anti-nicotine anti-anthroughts.
The virus is electrically informing the cells of printing and then starting to produce a stabil anti-intelle stream.
Andetala is exhibiting any molecule into blood, neutralizing them before they reach the brain preventing the rice of the nitronian fuels.
In the tests of vaccined mouses, which later provided nitoins, continued their normal activities.
And the mouse that did not give the vaccine, “spanded”, and this is the sign that Nikotina has reached their brain, they say the researchers.
These experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine magazine.
The previous tactic vaccines suffered unfortunately because they contained antibodies.
In order to maintain the high level of anti-personal, schools had to be done so often that they were in ways and unfair.
But the value of the new vaccine is likely to be much below because it's converted the cell cells into the anti-personnel factory.
Professor Cristal said that if the future human vaccine was fully safe, it would be able to give children before they wish to try hygarette preventing nikotic dependence.
But more likely she'll be used by fuels to leave smoke.
“They will know that if they are starting smoking again, they will not receive pleasure from the nitin vaccine, and it can help them escape from this behaviour," said he.
British scientists said that the results were interested, but predicted that additional research needed.
Oliver: Third Land Sub-Agency sites completely advertised
The Vice-Gubernator of the Jurioy Oleans stated that almost three rural visits of the Moscow Area were completely advertised.
The total budget of the region receives 187 visits from 288.
In 2013, 187 visits from 288 are received from the area budget.
The estimate of 122 agricultural visits is exceeding 50 per cent and 83 percent of the rate.
The budget of the area budget is sent by 25 billion roads order," said the Olympics.
Also, the high-gouverneur noted that only in three cities, Musish, One and Poshino budget revenues are more than 1 billion of roads for 2013.
The income of rural visits in many areas is less than 3 million roads, "which doesn't have."
The Assistant Administrative Expenditure costs in 88 visits are above 70 per cent, "The decrease of quality of services has been reduced," Oleans noted.
He previously assigned the heads of the Municipal Sub-Parts to the end of November to consider what visits are needed to be organized, joined in the urban districts or changes of the administrative management system.
These proposals will be addressed to the end of January.
Furthermore, the Governor of the Moscow Area stated that the Administrative Reform in the Sub-Agency was planned to reduce the number of ad hoc rural visits.
In Mohai, Caribbean, Slovakia, Colombian regions, the Mohai and the Colombiques are also requested to incorporate municipalities.
The discussion of this issue in cities and areas of the region will begin in November.
The Chairman of the Brinzole also stated that there were approximately 30 rural visits in 12 areas of the Sub-Administration.
This is related to the fact that from 178 agricultural visits in the Sub-Parts at least the third of the 'admissible' financial basis and 100 data.
Diana Arbin reproached Hellouin with his children
Diana Arbin has not covered what great pleasure it has received from the education of his children.
Despite what is now, Arbin is particularly providing time for creature and public activities, it is still a opportunity to reach Marto and Artemis, because it is not only thorough time to their education but also to disappear as possible.
In the last week, Diana was two - time ready to his worshippers about his pedagogic talents.
First, she put the photograph to the Facebook, and she showed how she teached the children to read.
And yesterday, the plants showed how Artem and Mart had been made on Hellouin.
Our first halloween is ready to be called Diana's photo of his children in the festival coasts.
What is not wise, because they, as no other Russian little girls and girls, have a relationship with this feast because they were born in America.
Germany first enters "undetermined pillar" at the registration of children
Germany will be the first country in Europe, where it will be allowed in registration of children born germphrodiats, instead of a male or female, to indicate “undefined”.
The parents of the child will have the right to leave the "Popp" in a witness of the birth of an incomplete birth.
Instead of "F" or "M" parents may write "C" (undefined).
This decision is aimed at not to undertake parents from the "accession" of the sex operation.
According to statistics, one of the two thousand newborns in the world is born a germaphrodiat.
Three refused that Obede's influence
The former Minister of New South Wales, Joe Tripee, will be an investigation of the anti-corruptional supervision body of the State.
The former Minister of the New South Wales Joe Tripea has announced the changes in order to the apartment of the primary objects requested by the Political Team Eddie Obed, which is secretly possessed by the triples of non-mobility in the State.
The Independent Commission against Corruption (ICC) has extended its investigation in the Friday if Mr. Obed has been conducted in several ministers of the provision of the apartment contracts at Serchollar Ky, where the Obedes family belongs to two restaurants and coffee, without the end of the trend after the period of their action in August 2005.
It is now investigating the advice that Mr. Tripido knew the secret participation of Mr. Obededa in objects of non-mobileness, after demonstration by the former Vice-President of the Administration Chapter of Mr. Triopedia Line Esspoul in Thursday.
During several years of discussion launched in 2005, the Government was planned to make the apartment open competitive.
Awarders were against this and wanted more long time.
In 2009, there were $2,5 million for the vacation contracts to Serchoular Ki, which had provided the Obedes family for the year.
Mr. Tripido, who was Minister of Infrastructure and Transport from February 2006 to November 2009, initially spoke for open competitions.
But he refused that changes were made on the request of Mr. Abeded, who, as recognized Mr. Tripido, urged the Government's policy to change.
The ICAC reported telephony discussions were held in August and September 2007 between Mr. Obeded, Mr. Tripea and Steve Dan, the elderly officer who came to the Ministry of Ports after the management of Mr. Obeded in the Fisheries Division.
“Is there a question discussed during these telephone discussions about the development of the commercial apartment policy?” asked Mr. Antony Wille.
“No, ” answered Mr. Tripee. ”
I can't remember what was discussed, but it wasn't exactly the same.
Not to be between me and Mr. Abed.
According to a high official, Israeli military lawyers attack the targets within Syria
The high official of the Administration Interview Fox News confirmed that Israeli military lawyers had attacked the targets in the Syrian Port of Latvia on Thursday.
The Chief did not explain that it was for the purpose, but he said that at least one.
The Asocied Presse indicates that the purposes of the Russian production of SA-125.
At least two times previously in this year, Israel renewed aviation aircraft with railways within Syria.
Independent workers in the subcategory 457 may be tested on “compliance”
The test for foreign workers under class 457 is on the Government's consideration because it has an increase in representative measures.
This test will be applied on criteria aimed at preventing use by class 457 to complement unlimited posts or as a lake to move family and friends to Australia.
The document submitted by the Government to the discussion was issued today, while the former Laborist Deputy Maxine McCook described the Government's reorition on foreign workers, it said that it could be aggravated by the neighbouring of Australia.
“The Great Declarations of the type of an emergency — at the end of the season” and “the first work of Australians” represent a very unfortunate ratio for times when the prosecutors requested the defended labour market”, she said the Institute of Australia’s India today.
This was historically meaning that the white work had to be protected, and if some in the region saw the explanation of this historic artefact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The document presented to the discussion is issued 12 measures that have been considered by the former Minister of Immigration by Crisus Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Konnor, who was yesterday in Sheri-Lanka, where he met officials on people ' s conflict, has already made five of the recommended changes and the remaining are in the review period.
If the criteria “compatibility” are adopted, the applicant may be investigated on the subject of whether the candidate is a parent or nearly known owner or person with relations with the financing of the company.”
Companies may also need to be lowered by owners from subsection 457, as the previous enterprises would like to fund a small number of employees and then took hundreds to work.
However, a 35-year-old planker who seeks a survivor died preferably from the information after arrival to the boat with refugees to the Nation Island at this week.
The murdered son of the nine years of this man has led him to the journey to Australia, and from the death of his father in the middle of his own supports the two-year brother who was also on the boat of the ship.
Australian authorities sent a man to the Nazi island hospital where he died.
The friend of Sammy Warlam said that the chocs suffered alcoholism
The friend of the Cookist Seman Warlammic Earlyk said that the Russian News Service had suffered alcoholism, transmitted the Russian Service.
"He has no presentation on how to stop drink," said, in particular, a woman.
Remember that Wourinq had led to the court for murdering on the bloke of the collection Russians Senam Warlamba, a member of the Colordo club.
According to her, the chokeist thrust her out of the hair, and smote it after the attack, the hands, the herds, and the beasts.
Barlamous himself had come to the Denover police and had been recognized to the slaughter, detailedly described the event.
He was arrested, but then leaving in $5,000.
The Court was not limited to sports in the country movements but had forbidden to be closed to Warrionk.
He will also cause the prison decreased for six years of violence.
The Government of Britain announced the research aimed at enhance the economic effect for Scotland from the HS2 railway magazine project.
The HS2 project provides the opening of high-country communication with Scotland and the North England, with the beginning of the First TAP in 2026
The Minister of Transport of Barrowness Cramer noted that the project would join Britain.
The Minister of Transport of Scotland, Kit Briony, said that he was in terms of the perspectives of work on plan with the Government of Britain.
The first phase will be to build a new high-country rail line between London and West-Midlands.
When the Second Stap ends, lines will be made in Manchester and Lids.
In June, the Government has revised the estimated value of the construction of high-country line between London and the north of England from $32.7 to $42.6 billion.
The Government of Britain, which conducts negotiations with the Scotland Transport, commanded HS2 Ltd to consider further improvement of iron-related ways and reduction of travel for North England and Scotland.
This should include the opportunity to overcome from Glasgo and Edinburgh for three hours or less.
Barrossa Cramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is to create a national network that will make Britain and its city closer to each other.”
We develop HS2 because the benefits that it offers are great.
Without him, we are deployed in our iron network.
However, it is also related to the transport of cities with each other; 18 cities in the United Kingdom, including Glasgo and Edinburgh, will receive a better message through HS2.
The Scotland Chairman, Alister Carmaica, added: “The last announcement is a good news for Scotland. ”
On behalf of the statistical Government, Kit Braun called Mr. Carmaycla “unnecessary” to support the HS2 inclusion of the HS2 network.
Mr. Brown said: “The high-country railway has all chances of bringing huge economic benefits in Scotland, but also adds the economic afternoon of Scotland to a general argument for high-grown railway way throughout the United Kingdom.”
We are therefore glad to work in partnership with the Government of Britain to consider the options of the construction of high-country railway in Scotland, the establishment of benefits for all and the continuation of the railway line of Glasgo, Edinburg, which has already planned the statistical Government.
I am urged to consider the results of research with the British Ministers in the next year and the joint decision on the next steps.
Toria is a new hope of nuclear energy?
Governments in the world continue to think about how to ensure energy needs.
The fuel of carbons (the name where they are) is negatively affecting climate.
Renewed energy sources require large areas for generation.
The atomic energy is without otherwise, but leaves the mass of ways to eliminate waste.
Recently, scientists focused on the tracks, another radioactive element of the Metallev system.
He meets worldwide, and, as the specialists claim, his disappearance does not leave escapes that should be kept forever.
Electronic devices for aircraft in Australia until they remain in force
Australian aircraft passagiers will also be needed to exclude their plans and smartphones during the airport and the airport, despite the measures to reduce the data regulations.
The Federal Aviation Management of the United States allowed the American transporters to change their procedures so that the passagiers could read e-mail books, view videos or play on their devices during the airport and the condition that they will be left in the "Arm" field.
The passengers can already do this during the main part of the field, but many are angering that they do not have access to their electronic books during the airport and the train.
Australian transporters consider the decision required by the American airports to make a huge amount of work to compliance with new requirements, but indicated that they were not planned to change their procedures nearly.
In the Office of Civil Aviation Safety, they also noted that they were considered the statement, but noted that the restrictions to the use of electronic devices in the critical factors of the field still operated in Australia.
“The security of civil aircraft is currently not contained in special rules regulating the use of electronic devices in the aircraft”, said it.
This issue is regulated by the rules required by aircraft to ensure security at any time and the passengers to comply with the safety rules of which the equipatic members are reported.
Virgin campaign, which had already discussed the Office of Civil Aviation Safety Aviation, had not been contrary to changes but said that it would follow the indicators of the regulator.
“We would welcome the review of the Office of Civil Aviation Safety Auditors the issue to allow electronic devices, because we really believe that it will improve the quality of customer services now when it (unproliferated non-proliferation system) is on our aircraft," said the President.
Qantas stated that the current rules would be retained.
“ Our current policy is that electrical devices can't be used during volcanic and plants, and we are not planned to change it” she said.
The FAO position is distributed to American airports.
However, we are always interested in regulatory changes that could benefit to the passagiers, and we will, of course, study the FAU decision and the reasons that call him.
The impact of the decision of the United States will be deprived from the airport to the airport and will depend on the age of their airport.
Carriers should demonstrate that their aircrafts have sustainability to radio records from mobile devices as well as to review delivery, training materials, manual transport standards and passenger instructions.
“ Although the aircraft is checked and confirmed by its flight, it may allow the passport to be used by portal, light electronic devices such as planets, electronic books and smartphones at any height”, said FAA.
In some cases, bad equipad will give passors to exclude their devices during the plant.
Furthermore, in accordance with the recommendations of the group, the harder devices should be placed under seats or in upgrading seats during the airport and the airport.
Ladies of Dagetan will be heard in the genius of Cuban notes of extremism
The Futbole Match between the Angie and Camboya came into political collection between the authorities of Crossadow and Dagetan after the Dagetan Flagge was burned, and Mr. Kubani named it.
Chapter Dagetan Ramán Abdulatipp in Thursday invited the Republical Parliament to return to the court because the genius Crossodar border gave appeals to an international disaster, particularly calling for the war with "Basurmans".
Take Mr. Cravenard's border, this was adopted in 1995.
It's the same vision, and nobody's doing this.
"O you here, as an enemy, we're going to death battle, for this words to write in the genin, to generate some believers on others," said a solidarity with the Abdulat Chairman of the Hizri Shisaids Chair.
The Pentiny has been innocent for his friend Asad
Now, the news from the ocean, that is, from Syria, where, as we knew today, Israel has pushed the ruling of Russian production, which, according to the communications, were called "Hezbol."
Syria has now made an important condition to destroy its chemical weapons by 1 November.
This was made in the framework of the agreement achieved by Russia and the US has not held military operations to which they were paid by the year.
More detailed about weapons and what it means for the Syrian President, he will tell our main international court Richard Angel.
Washington stated that the Asad regime would be punished for it.
More than 1400 inhabitants, including hundreds of children, died in August from ratio gas.

He's not a leather, and he's gotta go away.
But Alaska remains.
And it feels more sure.
His troops still use the artillery, railways and pumps.
His enemies are designed and bad armed.
His people have to leave their houses, many hungry.
Some have to be paid with lipples and kitchens.
Many believe that Bashar Alas has fled from punishment for a massacre murder.
The Chemical Arms Agreement calls for the success of diplomatics, the inspectors have endorsed the Nobel World Prime, and Alaska himself has made an impression of a person prepared for cooperation.
Today, in Washington, the United States Ambassador in Syria had to respond to unfair questions.
When a child dies from hunger, his mother is worse than that he was not killed by chemical weapons.
Alaska's still holding.
And it changes the weapons to power.

Mr. Wilki said today that $325 million are not decided, “see they would not follow a clear reform that will set up the health system on Tasmany on a more sustainable basis.”
Nevertheless, he commend the Government for his response to the request of urgent assistance with which he first turned to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May.

“The crisis we are here is that the Laborist Government of the State has disappeared $430 million from the health system”, said the ABC TV telephone.
When the Government is rejected almost a million dollars, and the Commonwealth is 300 million, it is not possible to become a good news.

He said the reason of the extinction is not known.
Certainly because of a condemnation to the terrorist organisators in Balli
The remaining 202 died in the result of the exhibition of bombs in Balli in 2002 was angerously reacted to the condemnation issued by the last of the complaints presented before the court and stated that Walmer Patterk should be a dispute.
Packet who had been pregnantly 10 years in flight, as one of the most explosed people in South-East Asia, was condemned to 20 years of release of liberty for his role in the establishment of explosive devices used during the Terakta.
It may be released for 15 years if it will receive a comprehensive freement.
The 45-year-old submitting was recognized by the murder of mass murderers because of attacks on two night clubs in the Turkish region of Kut, in which 202 people died, including 88 Australians, and more ten were killed.
It was also recognized by a number of other complaints related to terrorism, including the threats of the church over the whole Indonesian Congo of Birth in 2000.
Prosecutors needed a harvest period, although they could argue that a person called “interruptor” for their republication of explosive devices should be condemned to death penalty.
This decision has disappeared the ill memories of the mother of Perth Joun Cortin, which lost his 39-year-old Jane and Jenni's nearly 10 years ago.
And the two of the laughing, she said that the Patty should be condemned to death penalty.
“ I really think he must follow other guys.
He must be present before the discrepanciation team," said Mrs. Cortin AAP.
“ I must live every day, knowing that I will have no neighbors, and I will not see my daughters.”
The Sarah Cluster was destroyed when a massive explosive device was carried out in the spring of the spot, immediately after the evening of 11 October 2002.
Peter Huz was in the “Peddy” bar, where a terrorist killer had sheltered a roughzak, which was the start of explosive, over 20 seconds previously.
After this, he fell into a month in which and as murdered three times associated with life - security systems.
Mr. Huz said that Packet had to participate in three other members of the Terrorist La Jamaa Islamia, responsible for blood battle, Amrosi, Muslas and Imma Savic, who had been punished four years ago.
Actually, this guy has the death penalty more than all.
Save him life, well, there is no reason to keep him life.
Get 20 years after killing 202 people and killing hundreds, it's not so much.
Pact is the last of the parties of the Terak in Bally present before the court.
He was covered for almost ten years, but at the end of January 2011 he was detained in the Palestinian city of Abbattabd, where the United States killed the former Al-Qaida Chairman, Usaam Ben Laden, less than four months later.

The patch may still appeal his sentence.
FAO: “Awl passports can now use guagets on airlines (or not calling from the mobile phone)”
The aircraft will be able to use their electronic devices throughout the field to read, work, play, play, watch movies and listen to music, but not speak on mobile phones, according to the long-gouverning guidelines issued in fourth of the Federal Aviation Management.
But passengers should not expect that change will happen immediately.
As soon as this change will be implemented, it will be deemed dependent on the airport," the Administrator of the FAU Michael Urt at the press conference.
Airports should show how their aircraft responds to new guidelines and that they are updated their educational assistance for the ageing equipatics and instrument rules to comply with new guidelines.
FAO stated that it had already received plans from some aircraft to expand the use of portfolios in aircraft.
Delta and JetBlue were among aircrafts that already presented plans.
“Independent of the state of the plan, we would be able to approve the extension of electronic devices very quickly” said FAU.
The passengers are currently obligation to disable their smartphones, planets and other devices when the airport is closed.
They should not restart them until the airport is reached 10,000 feet, and the capital will not give "good".
The passengers must disable their devices again when the aircraft is low to the plant, and not to include them until the aircraft comes on the ground.
In accordance with the new guidelines, the aircraft whose aircrafts are appropriately protected from electronic pools may allow the passport to use these devices during the airport, the aircraft and the road.
The majority of new aircraft and other aircraft that is modified so that passengers could use Wi-Fi at large high levels as it is expected is responding to these criteria.
Laura Gladeng, President of the Association of Professional Boat Training, welcomed these changes.
“ Although the new policy will be well implemented (and we're going to work closely with the carrier to achieve this), it will be an unprogressed option," said Glaydeng.
We revealed clearly to feel “school divorcies” when the matter comes to this issue.
However, the Internet connection, the exchange of electronic letters, text messages or downloads will be prohibited at least 10,000 feet, reported the Agency.
The passagiers will be proposed to overlook their smartphones, planets and other aircraft devices.
So there was no “Slips with friends” — an intellectual Internet player, in which the Actor Alek Bollduin played in 2011 when our case occurred: the actor was removed from the American Airline Airlines aircraft for refusal to exclude the device when the airport was in the airport.
And the harder devices such as the novels, it's still needed to be placed in the garage office, as they can grass someone if they're fly over the whole salon.
The calls of the mobile phone will also be prohibited.
The regulatory powers on calls are of the Federal Commission on Relations, not of the FAU.
FAU can delay some electronic devices during the airport and the airport
Last month, Mark Ronker from the National Transport Security Council, the National CBS Safety Expert, said that the CBS News Telephones continued to be considered a risk.
“The phones are really a problem, not only because they can create a poison for navigation devices, but we know thanks to the CFS that they can create the places for the higher band when the air is in the air”, said Ronker.
The Advisory Committee established by the FAU to study the issue was recommended in the past month to allow the Government to broader use of electronic personnel.
In the past few years, the pressure of the AFU was increased in order to reduce restrictions for their use.
Critics, such as the Senator Democrat from the State of Mrs. Claire McCakskill, claim that there is no valid reason for security.
The compliance of restrictions is also easier to ensure, since the use of the device has become a comprehensive.
Some research shows that until the third passagiers are lost or ignored to exclude their devices.
The FAAO began to limit the use of electronic devices in 1966, in response to the media for navigation and communication, when the passengers began to carry with the FM radio-employers, high-technology gauges at the time.
New aircraft are much more dependent on electric systems than the previous aircraft, but they are also developed and claimed to be established as sustainable to electric furnitures.
Aviation offers a Wi-Fi use password for several years.
Solitaires modified for Wi-Fi system are also more sustainable for pooks.
The most of the lanceers are designed for the broader use of electronic devices in accordance with new guidelines, Urt said.
The electrical devices usually select radio-based bands much more low than the previous generations of the device.
Electronic book read devices, for example, select minimum signals when translating pages.
But signals become stronger when the device load or send data.
The Amazon.com company was among those who sought to decrease restrictions for use of electronic devices.
In 2011, the company's representatives loaded a total aircraft to read the childrenle ' s electronic books and flighted it to check the problems available, but did not find them.
Members of the Advisory Committee of the FAAO expressed abusive feeling of whether the device represents any risk.
The Duck Kid of the National Aviation Association stated that it was considered to be a real device, even if the minimum risk was.
Other members of the Committee said that there were only individual platform messages that confirm that devices can create boards for aircraft systems, and most of these messages are very old.
However, the Committee recommended that FAU would allow passports to request passengers to disable the device during the disposal of devices in limited visibility.
The group of representatives of the tourist industry welcomed these changes by calling them by the healthy step to meet passengers that are now using many technical devices.
“We are glad that FAU recognizes that the passagiers' compound is not incompatible with security and protection”, said Roger Dou, Director-General of the United Nations Turkish Association.
Automatics will be able to carry out exchanges for the receipt of the rights of the Provider
Exchanges for supplier rights will be able to accept private companies possessing their own computer automobiles.
On this, the "Commant" refers to the draft Government decision "O permit to manage vehicles".
According to the newspaper, it is now about 30 aircrafts in Russia.
It is proposed that the students of such "proliferated" cars will be estimated by the results of internal testing.
The Hosauto Inspection of each half of the year will monitor the exchange exchange.
If more than 30 per cent of the theory exchanges and more than 20 per cent of the students are not allowed from the first time, such school will be charged by half-year privileges.
The technical requirements for autodrome contained in the draft decision of the Government shall enter into force since 5 November 2014.
The project also contains the requirements for a double-coal technician technicians.
Since 1 January 2015, the owners of motorcycles to obtain the rights of the category A should be exchanged in the terms of the city movement.
Furthermore, since 5 May 2014, the company will not take for foreign foreign leaders with foreign rights.
Such workers should receive Russian rights after exchange.
The flood moved on the air to a secure place from the smoke plant in the North Sea was back to the wild nature
The fiber moved on the ground after it was found in a steady state on the north Sea’s flood was returned to the wild nature.
This water passenger was placed in a ventile sent to Albert, last month, and then went out the Statistical Office for the Prevention of cruel treatment with animals (SPCA) to the rescue centre in Alloa.
The central manager of Colen Siddon said: “It’s a water passenger, more all, is a wind migrant from Northern Europe, which falls into a powerful wind area over the North Sea. ”
It seems that the bird has been shot and could find a survival on the flower.
He added: “He was not able to fly again, so they returned to us for help.”
The Water Passenger was healthy and a good condition until it was released.
Is Europe ready to take business with England?
The Business for Britain campaign was launched in April with the obligation to assemble business representatives and to determine what changes of the creation of well-beings and workers would like to see in EU relations.
To this end, we have commanded the largest and most full investigation of British leaders, asking them to discuss our thoughts about Britain, business and EU.
YouGov company requested more than 1000 business leaders who represent broad business in Britain, sectors and regions.
The findings of the survey will be unexpected for many.
We have explained that the growing majority of enterprises currently seeks exports from Europe, giving particular attention to countries that are engaged and grow, while the EU countries are in the eastern state.
They want the Government to give priority to new trade links with countries such as China, India and Brazil, and not to take time for long-term and difficult process to reform the EU's imposed institutions.
When they were questioned about their specific political issues, the anti-numerical regulation to the production laws, most of the leaders believed that the control of those key power fields should be returned to the Westminster.
There was an unity of single market, while business representatives stated that the costs of regulation from Brussels are now translated to the benefits of trade in Europe, even 40 per cent of the major enterprises, traditionally the traditional Europeans of all undertakings.
The latest and most indicative, our survey of business leaders found that the most clearly wanted Britain to take place on the change of the treaty and the relationship with the EU based on trade, not on policy.
The result that was observed among the undertakings of all sizes and the larger business groups shows that business is a “signable change” that will return the powers to Britain.
High rates are to achieve changes in the treaty and more profitable conditions for Britain would provide a 16-procent move in vote for remaining in the EU.
The Prime Minister must have no doubt: this investigation shows that the British business supports its plan of revision of the conditions of the Britain membership in the EU.
He also shows that the business is expected to review a significant movement in the current balance forces back to the Britain side.
The best conditions for the British business are possible and are still more necessary as Eurorion is a way of closer economic and financial union.
The priority should be given to the workplaces and economic growth in Britain, and, as our survey shows, this means strengthening attention to trade and fundamental changes in the standard activities of Brussels.

Although businessmen are significantly estimated for growth.
Over the year, they are unfortunately: sales have falled on 7 per cent.
All this was the head of one of the largest pioneer companies of the country, the President of the Council of the Russian Beveragers of Isak Shap at the IIIth annual conference of the Adam Smith Institute on Russia's daily question, which was only completed in Moscow.
The public market regulation had discussed it.
From 2008 to 2012, the Russian drink market has already been reduced to 18 per cent, since in the past years, significant improvement of the hydrocarbon regulation in the production and drinking of drinking, has reported Shep to the hearers.
None of the world is such a severe restriction of the drink market that does not preved any new and new non-logic prohibitions that are based on war against the abuse of alcohol.
He visited that many legislative prohibitions invited to reduce alcohol abuse have no particular impact, however, all new initiatives are constantly made.
More than all the producers of drunks have struck the debt to sell a oxygen in this year.
"We've lost 35,000 consumers right now," said Isaac Sheps.
For the future year, two prognoses were made in the drugs.
The optimistic is the one of Sheps: the sales of drinks are stored at the previous level.
Pesistics - 2 to 3 per cent will fall.
In order to preserve their arrivals, businessers are deprived to go from the carriers calculated on the mass consumer class "premium": the drink will be less, but it will be a road.
Nevertheless, the radic repercussions from the fall of sales with a small number of carriers are not yet shown.
"In my observation, the level of alcoholism remains at the same level - reported the doctor-Narchologist Alex S.C.
True, it has increased the rate of patients using strong drinking sugars, and those who have "slated" on the refrigerating toxic drinks like "Juara", while it was ten years ago the "sweet" alcoolism.
In September, 600 persons were embedded from the Ford ' s car charge in the Supreme Patchesk.
As they say in the Professionals, all allowed have been compensated.
However, there is more difficulties than workers to reduce reproduction in the region.
The Deputy of the Budget Zaks Alexe Etmanov at the meeting stated that the Ford company in the United States had reduced 600 people.
In his words, it was still in September: then, on the voluntary release programme, which was developed together with the organization's proceedings, about 600 persons were dismissed.
The workers who decided to improve their own will have been proposed "country requests" as a number of reports.
Because of this, most of them left workplaces on their own will.
However, according to Etmanva, the number of people is a whole night change.
I think this will not be limited.
However, the authorities in the nearby two years do not plan to take any sector support programmes," he explained that the Government was not taking into account the stage of production in the region and a great decrease of workplaces.
In the Forde, this information does not be certified and not reaffirmed.
We're waiting for the response from the company, and when it appears we need to publish it.
Discussions on the reduction of workers at the Fourd of the United States are long ago.
Thus, for example, the company's plans to deliver 600 people was known in September.
Earlier, he stated the stop of the car production.
As a reason for the deployment, the demand for the Ford car in Russia was called.
According to Peterostatus, at the end of the nine months 2013 industrial production in Lenoblatt was declined by 5,4 per cent.
The production of vehicles and equipment has reduced 11.5 per cent.
In the United States, you can use mobiles during the airport and aircraft
The new regulations for the security of mobile devices during the aircraft and aircraft are approved in the United States, reporting the BBC corporation.
It is expected that the American airport allows passengers to use the smartphones and plannings for the whole journey, the new rules will begin to operate until the end of 2013.
However, the link to the Internet for receipt and shipment of e-mail will be prohibited during the fields at the height below 3 kilometers.
Because of the danger of the railways of aircraft, the half vote link will continue to be prohibited.
Thus, the aircraft allows to read electronic books, play on planets and other garages and view videos during internal and international flights.

The Russian Mafia in the United States finally strengthened the new name - the British round.
This week, the black list of the Russian Mafia in America was filled with new names and four companies.
The United States Financial Minister entered into the Brazilian round of three representatives of Russia, two Usbekistan and Israeli.
One of the Russians was a known cancer of Grigory Leps, which understood in the transport of money for group members.
Nevertheless, in the black list, 22 people participating in the Brazilian round, and six posted organizations.
Nevertheless, many experts express the fact that such organization is real.
The Bretain Trade Declaration is more trying to join different criminal groups, previously stated a expert on organized crime and professor of the University of New York, Mark Galati.
In his view, the Brazilian round reflects the popular mark of the Russian Mafia.
"I have not met any of the Russian law enforcement bodies or any other person who would confirm the existence of such a criminal organization," cited Mr. Galati, the American Centre for Corruption Research and Crime.
Mr. Galeta agreed with the University of George Mason Liz Schellley.
"If they are also operating the community, it is more like a criminal network, but not an organization," it makes it the words of the Centre for Corruption Research and Organized Crime.
In the middle of the past year, Mark Galeotti suggested that the Brazilian round is mostly engaged by Russian Waisen law as well as Dad Hason.
The Criminal Autority was killed in January of that year.
Thus, the activities of Lashi Shushil and Zacharia Kafarov, which were completed in 2012, were closely linked to Dad Hasson, and another list party, the Temuri Mirzo, had come to Dad Hason the tribes.
However, Mr. Galati notes that some persons and have no relationship with Osonia.
It was considered that all of them were more common financial and criminal interests, such as drug trafficking from Afghan.
Nevertheless, there was a scanned round to include the Bretain Circle, Greek Leps, the beloved cancer of the President of Russia, who took attention to Crèle.
In fact, we appreciate that we will receive more detailed information from our American partners, as it was decided to why his list was introduced in such lists, said the Chairman of the State Dmitri Pisk.
In any case, he (Lip) is a civil RF.
Like the interests of all RF citizens, his interests will be protected.

Two YMCA staff are accused in sexual crimes before accused against Johnatán Lord, as known by the King Commission
Two MICA NNW staff were accused in sexual crimes against children in 2011 against the worker for children in Caringbach Johnathan Lourd, reported the Kingdom Commission on sexual violence against children.
However, the Commission had said that it had “no cases with cases of sexual violence against children within its organization.”
The Chief Executive Director of Philip Haira asked on the one case when the worker of YMCA was accused in the crimes related to the child pornography and on the other case when the teacher was sentenced to YMCA Caringbah Hall for sexual crimes against children in 1991.
Mr. Hair said Gail Fernes, a lawyer who helped the Commission that he knew about the first case but didn't know the second.
He recognized that YMCA in the entry into the Commission was also allowed uncertainty, claiming that “the external verification of the YMCA which recognized that YMCA is in the first lines of safety of children”.
The testing commissions said that YMCA was notified that it had received the second of the end of four possible evaluations on the results of quality audit carried out by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Mr. Hair, who entered the YMCA when he was 21, recognized that he had provided the substantive promotions by Lored and could not be able to ensure clear understanding of the staff of his commitments relating to violations of the security policy of children.
Previously, Lord was condemned for sexual crimes against 12 boys during its two years of work in MICA.
He was arrested in prison as a minimum of six years.
However, Mr. Hair rejected the proposal that the corporative ethic YMCA had allowed staff to report about the violations of Lored in the area of safety of children.
The officers showed that they had observed violations, including the fact that Lord had been alone with the children, personally listed to them, and he denied them on their tribes, said he loved one of them and allowed them to play their mobile phone.
Daniel Okwell, who was under the leadership of Lored and asked her to learn her child protection, because she was concerned of his behaviour, revealed that he found Jakey Bartt, the Master of YMCA's children in Caringbaha, who was the manager of Lorod, “a gentle and often difficulty.”
The Executive Director said he did not explain staff that they had been unfortunately informed about the situation of his above managers.
Nevertheless, their friend and Lodr was able to put them out of the thoughts of the need to report him.
Mr. Hair said that he had submitted the MICA Council of New South Wales that the lessons for the “Proceedings of John Loddge” were not “related to provide information” by the staff and that the Council agreed with it.
Mr. Hair stated that the decision to appoint staff to sign the confidential agreement shortly after the accused was adopted by the MICA General on Children of Liam Whitley.
He said that it was called to prevent proof, but in that case, “agained” and that was badly realised.
MICA of the New South Wals has not been safe for children of organization during her work, Johnathan Lord during 2009-2011, reported the Commission of Expert on the Enlargement of Child Professional Steve Smolbon from the University of Griffith.
He said that there were serious problems in the collection, selection, instruction, staff learning and monitoring.
The hearings are addressed until 20 December.

Tony Blair said that he was a chance to return as the Minister of Britain, but recognized that the return was little reliable.
On the evening of the 5th anniversary, 59-year-year-old politics had viewed the various aspects of internal policy.
Since the departure in June 2007, after ten years at the post of the leader, Blair has fled significantly the discussion of the British policy, restricting the majority of its commentaries to foreign affairs and its role sent into four neighbouring peacemakers.
Answering to the question, would he return to the Prime Minister, Blair, as reported by the London Evening Standard, said, "Yes, of course, but it will happen, so..."

Look at Kima, who held a high-level meeting.
The experts of the contribution activities reached to Cardiff to fight for the “Best Year” were known that the competition would be very high.
But no one was ready to show the three-year Fantón Kirkland.
Even not a schooler, just for a few months before that, the younger with his Sweetlandian Madam Tuffy Riffy, was swiming through three turtles, to make a massive mass, left 30 adult fellows away from behind.
This unlike couple — the only growth — received high assessments for the outdoor, conduct and style of the annual competition, which is conducted by the center of Sanibink Conduct in the city of Rary, far away from Cardiff.
Except to a globally disappeared background of men and women in an eye-cottle chapter, he drew his chapter on the ground and grew up the two-year tour of Toffy.
The judges glorify Fentone for his totally unnecessed ability to be treated with horses over the years.
And Tophie received higher assessment for the external and character.
Penton gave Toffi on his third birthday in March last year, and he took every day with the Sweetland Pounds.
His 30-year-old mother Donna said, “Fontone and Toffy are a great dumb.”
They had a lot of fellows, but these two went with gold cups and rocks.
It was just his second statement with Tophy, and we were all in the street when he won.
It was completely acknowledged by strange people on the arden that they wanted to be photographed with him.
This boy out of the Nantilla village, which is far from Abb-Veil in South Wals, goes through his tickets of Sharon Hawls, which makes horses for more than 10 years.
Mrs. Hulls said: “All the public was wounded, and all were crying with appreciated votes and boys.”
He fled over the skin throughout the long arden, and even though he looked like that little, he did his business beautifully.
He loves horses, tractors and farmers, and he has two cigarettes that he cares.
Once he began, he'll already take part in the Lashy year, and I'm sure he's going to be well.
The representative of this annual horse exhibition said: “Fontone only three years, but he knows how to turn to his mannie.”
But they're a great team.
The judges noted Phenton and Toffi for their external appearance and how they represented the show.
They appreciate the feeding of the pony and lacking statements — Fentone and Toffi were the best in roing.
I'm sure Fonton helped his attractive consent, and he was really well looking at his role.
The public call for the Chinese journal "Reorganization"
The Chinese journal, published at the first place, should be reorganized, reported the press regulator.
The new Expresss journal issued in Guanço made an unexpected public statement with a request for release of the journalist Yunço.
But afterward, Mr. Cheen recognized the television that he took accounts for the writing of false articles on the company with the State ownership.
Now, the New Express should go through the “Processing of full correction of errors” as reported by the regulator.
The provision of the error management has been made from the Guyana management in the field of press and publications, radio, film and television.
A preliminary investigation showed that the Yangcheng Evening News Group of New Express issued a number of false reports on the ground of the Zoomlion company during the period from September 2012 to August 2013.
The “New Expression editing” was degraded,” said the regulator's statement.
He reported that the decision “against administrative investigation on Gene Yuncheo as an appeal of his reporting license”.
He also called the Yangcheng company to make the full correction of errors in the New Express and recommended that it should investigate the situation of responsible persons of the journal and immediately amend the Guideline of New Expression.
Mr. Cheen wrote a few articles for the New Express, in which he declared financial violations in the construction equipment under the Zoomlion.
After his detention, his newspaper had published two appeals to his release, stated that it supports its journalist activities.
But Mr. Chenn then appeared on the public television with a recognition that he published false articles for money.
“ In this case, I have damaged the zoomlion company, as well as all the new medicine and its ability to provide public confidence," said he to the public announced CCTV.
I did this mainly because I wanted money and glory.
I knew my fault.
Following the recognized Mr. Chenya, the New Express issued appeal at the first stage, he stated that the journal did not have to check its reporters so much.
Recently, a number of highly suspected convicted have been recognized on television.
The experts say that the practice of assassination of recognition in China remains generally distributed, despite the recent amendments to laws prohibiting powers to harm any one to himself.
United States tunnel - Mexico for drugs switched by iron-related
One of the most complex tunnels for drug control between the United States and Mexico, established by their own lighting, ventilation and electricity systems.
The United States authorities described the broadness of four to three feet as one of the most complex secret courses, ever discovered.
The tunnel, which is nearly six philosoly pools, links the components across the city of Titihuana (Mexica) and San Dygo (USA).
This area is filled with unacceptable components that facilitate drug loading.
The tunnel was closed before it had been immediately transferred any drugs, as said the authorities.
According to the judicial documents, the defenders had confiscated eight and a half of the tunnels and 327 per cent of cocaine in the discovery of tunnel.
Three men who, according to the lawyers, have been assigned to the prosecutors in retaining martyrs and cocaine for dissemination.
In the case of the conviction, they will have the time of prison from 10 years to the expensive release of freedom.
In the city of Nogasles, the Arzison State, the counterbars use the widely local channels.
The tunnel is the eighth transition found in San Diego since 2006.
The number of larger tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after the collection of martyrs in October, which has set a complex task for the rapid delivery of their products to consumers.
In 2010, the authorities found a long passage of about 700 wheels, covered by the river paths that walked from the kitchen of one of the houses in Tijuana to the two parts of San Diego.

The ship for foreign owners will bring the London Lopnet Laptop
The allocation has completed a preliminary assessment of capital growth, but is expected to the final decision from Mr. Osborn in 2012, which in the 2012 budgeted the public expenditure of 7 per cent for the homes of more than 2 million euros and an annual procurement payment for buyers decided to be owned by households, not as physical persons.
At this time, the hospital has already exceeded the total amount of Northern Ireland, Wells, Scotland, North-Oceland, North-Oceland, North-Ocean, Yugoslav and Hamberu.
Mr. Kuk said: “In addition to the increased hospitals in the precious house and institute a related legislation against worship, it is very difficult to claim that the cost-effectiveness of the defendance is defended independently from the influence of the old municipality system”.
“But this step may lead to the fact that some foreign investors will not be able to buy an immovability to London or its owners will not want to sell it” he added.

The scientists spread the light on how the dog’s dog moves with its setting.
More early studies showed that additive dogs smoke in the right side (on the dogs) while dogs smoothed shocks prematurely on the left side.
But now scientists say that other persons of the pseudo-familie can consider these deep differences in the rash and react to them.
The professor Georgeio Valortigara, a Neoproology of the Trentan University, said: “He is well known that people have the left and the right side of the brain are involved in the creation of buildings that cause positive or negative emotions.”
Here we've tried to see that in other species.
He added that, as well as man, the right dog controls the left side of the body and attractions, and two of them play different roles in emotions.
In order to learn more about how the dogs respond to different dogs of different dogs, researchers watched the animals when they looked at other dogs films.
They measured the frequency of the hearts of animals and analyzed their behaviour.
It's probably, we'll soon understand why their tastes are sometimes going to the one side, and sometimes, in the other.
Professor Valortigara said: “We showed the dogs videos with dogs, or natural versions, or the power to escape from any other search factors, and we could manage the movement of the shock, and send more to the right or right.”
When the animals saw that nothing the other dog had moved on the right hand (in the view of the dog’s dogs), they remained perfectly disappeared.
But when they remarked that the shoe was on the left (on the point of view of the dog's skin), their hearts were conceived, and they looked like to be satisfied.
Professor Valortigara said he was not thinking that the dogs were intended to communicate with each other with these movements.
In fact, he believes that the dogs have learned from their experiences which they should be concerned, and what no.
He notes: “If a few meetings with other dogs and often raising their hair in one side relates to the more friendly behaviour, and the right of the party gives less friendly behaviour, the dog reacts on the basis of this experience.”
Researchers say that these results can give owners, winters and drivers a more deep understanding of the emotions of their animals.
The expert on the conduct of the dog John Bradshaw, invited a scientist at the Witness School of the British University, said that this was not the first research to verify whether dogs were important to the left and right of the side.
In the past year, the group of scientists from the University of Lincoln discovered that dogs turn the heads on the left, if they look at aggressive dog, and on the right, if they look for a dog.
And in another scientific work of the University of Victoria in Canada, he reported: “The Swaps often came to the dog work when the removal of the rock was led to the right, and not to the right, instead of being achieved, the opposite behaviour of the Italian research.”
He said that differences could be because dogs in different studies did not fully accept animals in films or dog workers as dogs.
It could be useful to study how dogs react on the present dogs, he explained.
“ While there are sufficient evidence for the different kidneys that two cells are used for different purposes, many details still need to end, and the dogs are not excluded” he said.
However, considering the easy to be registered by their behaviour, we probably already soon understand why their hairs are sometimes cast into one side, and sometimes are in the other.

Pope Francis on the first cordials in February
The Pope France will visit new Catholic Church for the time of its ministry on 22 February, as she declared in Tuesday.
The Cardinals are the highest spirituality in the Catholic Church after the Pope, and they are elected by the Pope, so France will appoint their first group of people who will finally participate in the selection of his predecessor.
There is now 201 cardinal.
However, after the 80-year-old of the cardinal, he cannot take part in the papa elections, it is a prejudice of the 120 “cardinal electoral” group.
Announced this news, the President of the Vatican Chairman, the Lambardi father, said that before the ceremonial report in the sane, the collection of all the current cardinals would be held, known as a continent.
“Papa France decided to notify its decision to call a consolidation in February to facilitate the planning of other meetings with the cardinal participation of different angles of the world”, said Lombardy.
Jack Valléro, from the Catholic vote organization, said that to February the number of cardinale electorists, probably declined.
He said that the Pope usually calls the cardinales as much as needed to renew the number of cardinales to 120, as well as so many cardinales over the age of 80 years.
The context of the next year will be a great importance because it will be the first since the election of France in March of this year, according to Valéro.
At this time there is a prejudice for Europe and especially for Italy.
“ It would be interested to see whether the new cardinal Pope is designed from other world regions to restore the balance” he noted.
In South America, 40 per cent of Catholics live, but they have a lower number of cardinals.
These will also be the first elected cordials from the forming of the French Cordial Council - groups of eight cordials from the world that are responsible for seeking ways of reforming the church.
In the past, the Pope decided to be self - solved.
“ Now, France elected eight cordians to help him, ” said Balo.

Critique for the election of Obama
I voted for President Obama twice, divided hope to the possibility of change.
He said that Obama has allowed the obstructionism of the Republics to make no privilege of efforts.
Structuralism cannot be justified by the reformed Web site of the Obama Health System, unpaid attacks
Obama’s campaign 2008 is a huge reminder of the possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second currency of the Harvard University Faculty Faculty Student.
I'm reading a terrible busy book in these days.
I thought that this book would encourage me at the second course of medical factory and make a sense of hope in me.
It is called "Gerance for Vienna", and this is the memorian of the President of the Barac Obama campaign 2008.
When I end to write reports on my patients and lie to my bed, this book returns me when the policy encouraging millions of people, and the statements could be hidden by the spirit.
The victory of elections had been indirect, and the leading new programs had been pausus to consider that historical point.
My fellow classes wept for joy, and my parents shot all the news they could only find.
The White House should have come to a young strategy team, and the people were ready to change.
In 2008, Obama was 82 per cent during the introduction of Obama.
Then I'll open the book.
The return is now a huge proven as a dream of dreams.
It is hard to remember those days of optimism — they are talking to a long reminder, a huge memory of the lacked opportunities.
Over the years since I left my first election bulletin, changes have really happened.
It was that I couldn't even imagine myself.
I will give Obama for his great and different achievements, from the adoption of the law on access medical assistance to the conclusion of our military people from Iraq, the cancellation of the Regulation “No question, not to say”, the murder of the Omega Ben Laden.
Moreover, I believe that the Participation has blocked too many attempts to move our country forward: immigration reform, opportunity to select public health and close the bases of Guantánamo among the others.
But after an unnumerable number of times when I went on the side of Obama's Administration, protecting her from colleagues and congress, I have completed the explaining that I can provide.
I have reached political disappearance.
The obstructionism of the Republics cannot explain the permission to listen to foreign leaders or attacks on innocent children in other countries.
He cannot explain the collection of data on the private life of the United States of the National Security Agency or the persecution of developers who have discovered non-governmental actions.
He cannot explain the murder of the American citizen of Andorra Al-Asians without the court and the consequences or the non-compliance of public financing and expenditure during the presidency campaigns.
He cannot justify the findings of the report that the white home is mentioned in order to enhance the SMEs are “sound aggressive... since Nixon’s administration”.
And at the last time, he cannot justify that it is not able to develop a simple website for more than three years after the signing of accessible medical assistance law.
I don't know if it was supposed to be waiting for me.
Did I have been a 18-year-old understand that the manager can oppose the political campaigns before him?
It is clear that the work of the election post is not a planned programme of action, since our public dialogue will be formed as an opposive political party and like accidental events such as the challenge in Newton.
Nevertheless, all the examples listed above indicated that they were significantly own choices of the Administration.
And that's what's worried about me mostly.
I voted again for Obama in 2012, but not because I was a half of his candidate.
The Ombudsman was an unrealised and rare alternative. It seemed that he was not able to decide on their own policy or views.
I said that my second time of Obama, free from the pressure of future elections, justifying the hopes we heard for such a long time.
However, when Obama’s revision was lower than 45 per cent in this week, it was more difficult in 2008 through this book.
This allows me to touch many promises that have been led.
On this week, I read the part of the book that was described by Clynton, which had made Obama a delight to the primary elections in Pennsylvania.
For an analysis of the reasons of dismission, he told his staff that they should return to the normal movement and remain faithful to his purpose.
“ I want us to return our attractiveness, ” he said.
We must remember who we are.
Five years ago, Mr. President, and I am fully agreed with you.
The comments expressed in this comment are exclusively Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Paulmer claims that the deputy of Tony Abbot is a conflict of interest in the child ' s leave.
The Deputy-Miliar Clive Paulmer said that the Prime Minister, Tony Abbot, has a conflict of interests in the child ' s leave, because his daughters could protect and get out of this benefit.
This magazine of the huge sector, which had an unregulated payment dispute for the emissions of carbon in the amount of $6 million, made this statement when he tried to address whether it was a conflict.
The Joint Palmer Party may control four votes in the senate, which can be a vital importance in the decisions of the abolition of oxygen emissions and harmony activities.
But Mr. Paulmer said that the conflict of interest could only be the ministers and said that the daughters of Mr. Abbot would personally play from political measures.
“There is a great conflict of interest when it is talking about the payment of the child's leave, because if any of these daughters is defended, it will be directly interested to receive leave or not”, said Mr. Palmer.
After two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially announced Mr. Palmer winner in combating the location of Sanhain-Kost of the Electoral Survey of Ferfax with the transfer to 53 votes after the review of votes.
Mr. Palmer called for a review of the vote accounting procedure to the elections to accelerate the process.
The daughter of Tony Abboth Francis and Bridhith.
Should these elections be decided within two months after we have voted?
“ We need to have a more perfect system, ” he said.
Why should we not have such a system to come, enter your data into the computer immediately vow and get the result at 18:30 at the same evening?
Mr. Paulmer also under the criticism of the use of the cards for bulletins.
That's because they can react the result if he doesn't like someone?
Use the cards at our time seems strange.
The Electionary Commission is studying the possibility of electronic vote and recently published the joint discussion document with New Zealand.
Mr. Palmer said that his programme includes an international airport for Sanchaine-Cost and would be very seriously related to its new work.
The State office provides the service of the society.
“ We don’t enjoy any benefit, except the story, because we can serve this area at the critical moment” he said.
RBS distracts two valued triggers
The Kingdom Bank of Scotland has temporarily disappeared from the work of two triggers in its monetary operations, according to the information of two persons known by this situation, which is another reaffirming that the global verification of the regulators of the proposed monition on the currency market is sought by traffic.
Some of the largest world banks, including UBS, Barclays, German Bank and RBS, reaffirmed that they cooperate with regulators in investigations related to the largest financial market, the daily settlement of $5.3 per day.
These two triggers will be the first RBS officers who are dismissed during the deployed investigation that is referred to a scandle related to inter-bann position LIBOR.
In response to comments, the bank confirmed that in the month he received requests for information from the regulatory bodies.
“Our current investigation is continued, and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and our other regulators” reported the bank two weeks ago.
Last month, notified persons said that RBS had transmitted the e-mail and immediate messages that had received and sent his former trainer to the Britain Authority, the Office of Finance Control (FCA).
The trainer, Richard Asher, left from RBS in 2010 and, as well as known, was led to his current officer's leader of European Scan trade in JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandni, the leader of the European Space Trade to Citi, went to release this week, while Matt Hardiner, the former currency trainer in Barclays and UBS, was departed from the standard Chartered bank for this week.
No of these triggers was accused in any violations.
Mr. Ashira had a group of contacts with Mr. Achera, in accordance with the words of acknowledged person.
The UBS Bank reported that he had taken measures against some of his staff after the Swiss regulator Finma said he would investigate the proposed manipulations on the currency market in several Swiss banks.
At least six regulatory bodies in the world — the European Commission, Finma, the Anti-National organ of the Weko Switzerland, FCA, the United Justice Minister and the Hungary Governance — consider the approval of the bankers in the discussion for the impact of the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Switzerland also started internal verifications or received requests for information from the regulatory bodies.
The banks are deployed by instant messages and e-mails for several years in searching for offences.
The testing news have included triggers in the field of activities that have been one of the largest sources of trade units of investment banks, which, however, had been difficult in view of the low power to the surrenders.
Some bankers tried to reduce the gravity of the situation, saying that the widely and high-level market is almost impossible to minimize, but the elderly triggers say that it is not always true.
Despite the large number of daily trades on the currency market, the elimination of liquidity between different trade platforms and the larger use of their internal platforms means that “You can start affecting the market at the very small price”.
The news came the same day when the Credit Switzerland announced that he released one of his funding trade offices at this week after the result of the losses of almost $6 million at the end of the past year.
The Bank has immediately notified the relevant bodies and cooperated with its regulators.
“ We're sure that the trigger worked alone and that this issue has been able to localize, ” reported Credit Switzerland.

In Egypt, the first sentence of the elected Chairman is accepted
Muhammed Murs's jury, but the day of his burden will be awarded to the end of political fight in Egypt.
ISSLAMIST Muhammed Mursy promised “new Egypt, ” when he made an jury, it became the first free of the elected President of the country, changed Hosney Mubarak, which was released 16 months ago.
At its initialisation before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Mursy was also the first elected islamismist President of the Arab Peace and the fifth Head of the State in Egypt after the monarchy was declined approximately 60 years ago.
He took a jury before 18 judges in black mantles to the building of the court on the river of the Nile, built in the style of the former Egyptian temple.
“ We seek the best future, the new Egypt and the second Republic, ” said Mursy during the tragic ceremonies shown in direct ephrase to the public television.
“ Today, the Egyptian people set the foundation of a new life — an absolute freedom, democracy and stability,” said Mursy, a 60-year engineer with the American education of the Bretain-Musulman, the fundamentalist group, which was most of the 84 years of its existence, has been prohibited by an organization which served by the mixture of actions changed by other Governments.
The building was protected by hundreds of soldiers and police when Mursy arrived with a small shorting after 11:00 to the local time.
Only a few hundred parties were gathered to the court building to welcome the new President, and, depending on the presidential scope of the Mobaraca time, the movement was stopped only for a short time to spend the autocoloon on the usual road associated with the city center with the southward rewards.
Although Murs was deployed as an incarcerated “related County”, his personal prejudice grew up since his winning and the fifth statement he tried to impose himself as a candidate not only the islamists, but also all who wanted to bring up the case to the end of 2011 against the author of Mubara.
“ Today Egypt is a civil, national, constitutional and modern state,” said Murcy, clothed in a blue business coast with a red green, judges in the middle of the village hall where he accepted the jury.
Afterwards, Mursy was sent to the University of Cairo, where he had to speak an event.
He was appointed a formal acceptance with a military orthodox who performed a public gymnas during which he standed as a “grate” stand.
He presented the military deputy Feldmarshall Husine Tantavi.
His arrival was met by the “Armia and the people one hand ” who scanned hundreds of them gathered in the main vocational hall.
In 1908, the Cairo University of the Caribbean in the 1970st century was a deployment of the Islamismist Student Groups.
Mursy took a symbolic jurisdiction on Turchir area where the resurrection ended by the authorized government of Mubaraca in the past year, and promised to return the power of the President whose office was released by the military Board to take cases from the released leader.
But when it agrees to take official jurisdiction before the court, not before the parliament, he does the will of the military, and it is a sign that the fight for authority will continue.

It is planned to produce 50,000 tonnes per year, which represents approximately 10 per cent of its consumption in the Tumen area.
Despite the transition of other activities, the number of business officers has not reduced - it is now 157, and in new equipment plans is an increase in more than 50 employees.
The company is recruitment of staff and the necessary specialists are gathered out of the already available.
The future year is planned to introduce a new food aggression to five millimeters, which will reduce the self-satisfactory and another state, with the speed of the trumpet to 47 meters at a minute.
By the end of 2014, there are a line of trumpets that are used in the housing-communities.
The management of the enterprises is the task to close up to 70 per cent of the Tumen area in this product.
The Deputy Director of the Department of Investment Policy Leonid Ostroums, focusing on production leaders, encouraged the strengthening of the modernization of car-building companies.
In this regard, the forms and forms of public industrial support, which include the reimbursement of credit rates for the purchase of new equipment and the costs for it.
In the present year, 150 million rubbers are already lost, two thirds of this amount have been selected.
The last Commission, which will consider subsection treaties, takes documents from undertakings until 15 November.
Furthermore, the budget is reduced to the participation of local producers in international barriers.
In the future year, 150 million rubbers are provided for compensation of allocation payments and credits for acquiring new equipment.
5 million will be participating in bars, 3 million to energy saving programmes.
Declined to 72 million rubbers for the reimbursement of a defended and paid equipment that is produced in the south of the Tumen area for the Neptegostic Complex.
According to Leonard Ostromuv, the form of support was stopped, as it was the reason for the compensation of the wages for useful incopiece that had been paid into the area budget.
They do not presently and subsidies are directly expenditure obligations of the region.
In view of this, the Government is considering the immediate support of industrial enterprises, not the financing of the net sector through them.
Budget assistance will be linked to investment projects that will be implemented for production.
Many undertaking leaders expressed concern about the situation that was composed of the patents.
The contract on the purchased equipment is a competitive benefit of the South Tomen ' s industry, and it will be difficult to recover the price of the Russian middle, where the work force is more deep.
Furthermore, there is a question of the privilege of the new TNC-UР owner, the Rosnephet company which has not yet set his orders on the civil business.

The President of the Ukrainian Nigeria, Azar, is convinced that prices in the country are significantly reduced since the country has signed the Association Agreement with the European Union.
He stated that during the communication with the readers of his page on the Fisboek.
I can certainly say that the prices are defined by the large number of factors, including the customs payments.
Thus, after the signing of the agreement and entry into force of the free trade zone, the level of customs leaves to the import of goods from the EU will be significantly reduced.
And this will mean the prices must be declined.
"This is about goods from the EU countries," wrote Azar.
With regard to the other goods, the impact of the price agreement will not be direct, it will be designed.
But, however, there should not be an increase in prices.
So the reports of the biobords, which have been a lot recently occurred in our country that the EU Association is a growth of prices, not exactly or if it's exactly not that," replyed Azar.
Followers verify information on the hard treatment of the child in Biish
On 29 October, the media had published the report that an adulter of one of the children ' s gardens of the Biskha's city for educational purposes of the child in a dome.

Following the fault of the U.S.
The Vasilva Educe, which is almost announced by a year, has not yet commented numerous publications in the press, as well as the disappearances in Minnboron, as well as its personal relations with the Ex-ministrator of Defence by Athalus, its poesia and the valuable things.
However, on 1 November, the Hobornserbis case violated the silence.
In the Life News of Vasilva, he stated: "Of course, the task was exactly one: to provide any negative information about the former Minister of Defence."
It was a shooter to make me show, otherwise I'm in prison.
These threats have been stopped today.
We're going to the court, and we'll prove our innocentity.
We're sure about 100 per cent.
In this case, we can find that, unfortunately, most of all of Vasilva said that it was not important to be a doubt.
The official representative of the RF RF Rumyr Markin was likely to say that the picture collected by the Obornonserbis case was discovered.
In the middle of the arrested property, there are several pictures that the household was sure in his deep knowledge of arts, acquired as a world life recorder.
However, the artificial expertise, appointed by followers after arresting these pictures, set out that they have no artistic value and, just saying, are the declines," said Markin at the beginning of October.
Some pictures in the Ministry of Defence...
Then all recognized that they weren't mixed from Minborton, so they said I'm wrong with a dumb.
Who has the right to discuss my taste, to discuss some personal moments?
I mean, it's just unprecedented," says Vasilva.
In this regard, whether she recognizes her fault in one of its 12-mentioned crime episodes, Vasilva said: "Of course, no.
Not to know anything.
Moreover, there is no damage of the Russian Federation about the matter.
They're just putting people into deceit, here's all.
Furthermore, in response to the present declaration of the CSRR that Basileva was dismissed from the study of criminal materials, the Perugant lawyer stated that he and his customer "requests not to know cases".
What has been the reason for revealing the household of Vasilhea, not yet talking to the press?
Maybe how could a woman not answer the accused in a bad injury?
Or are the rights of the journalist of the Commonwealth, which said a couple of days ago that she had "hasted into a greater cross under home arrest" by announcement of the reconciliation of Athalia Sardinia with his wife and his return to his family?
The recognised military survey "CP" Victor Brank in its article "Serucks returned to the wife?" wrote, "Therrs are not excluding that after such anxiety it may be more talking to questions."
Before Basilva, some accused in the illicit sale of the non-modern property of Minnboron took on themselves.
The preconscious guys.

The school courses of the English literature will require the students to study at least one pipe of Shexpira, the Roman of the XIX century, the Roman poesia and the modern British artistic literature from 1914.
The replacement will also be submitted to the 'integrate programme text' to encourage more reading.
The United English and language course will be rejected.
Since 2015, the students will be required to make a individual switch in the language, with sustainable recommendations for the election of the English literature as a separate exchange.
The Department of Education should tomorrow run new English and mathematic training programmes — the first items under radiovision.
It will change other basic items in the next year.
The regulatory body will present the revised structure of the average school evaluations, with a new system of assessment and the smaller rates of jobs.
In the past of the year, the Minister of Education Michael Hoov said that it was “a wide consensus that we should reform our system of exchanges to restore public confidence”, arguing that school exchanges would be “the more complex, more ambitious and more stretch”.
Research shows that English schools have less time of mathematics (116 hours per year, or three hours per week) than in most countries.
For comparison, Australian schools give about 143 hours a year, and the disciples in Singapore take about 138 hours.
Although the formal requirement for more time in the mathematic record would not be, the sources in the coalition said that maximum school exchange exchanges in compliance with the increased efficiency in the calculations table, more likely to provide additional schools on this subject.
The education plan will be higher attention to the 'owners from real life', including financial mathematics.

It is now very important that Russian firms have received normal cost credits, which is the first thing that should be done needed," said the Government head.

Travel on Green, Rivers and Gentles to provide free medical assistance
Dr. George Bwell provides free medical assistance in the agriculture place in Cameroon
Bwell and his team are carried out nearly every exit, taking hundreds of patients
In this western African country, medicines are not so much — just one by 5,000
Announce here or through your mobile device
Dr. George Boughle is one of the 10 main heroes of CNN 2013.
You can vote for him or for any of other 10 major heroes to become CNN Year.
This person will receive $250,000 to continue its removal work.
Over 21, George Bowell saw how his father returned to life and again fell into an unrecognised state, throwing in hospitals that were not necessary to help him.
Jamph Bwellle received herd in the carcast, in 1981, far away from Yanund, the capital of Camerún.
At the beginning, he was only slapped, but the infection was spread on the brain and released the gematic that remembered herself until the end of life.
“ In Cameroon there was no neurohirurgs, ” said George Bought.
If we had money, we'd get him out of Cameroon.
Instead of this Browle, his father had collected in overwhelmed clinics and hospitals, receiving any treatment they could receive.
“ It's not easy, ” said Bought.
- You can go home at 5:00, invite the hospital to be first, but you're not the first.
It's a lot of patients.
Some can die because they've got to wait.
The situation has not been very changed since the father of Balle ended in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, only one doctor for 50,000 in Cameroon.
For comparison, comparison in the United States is one doctor for 413 persons.
And even if the cameras were able to turn to the doctor, many of them wouldn't be a carman.
Two of the five persons in this country live for poverty and almost three four health costs are private.
“ Their only problem is poverty, ” said Bought.
And because of poverty, they can't enjoy their lives."
In view of the suffering of his father and many of his compounds, Boughle made a decision to do this.
During the past year, Dr. George Bwell and his volunteers had conducted 700 free operations.
He became a doctor and worked as a sovereign chirurgic in the Central hospital of Yugoslavia.
He also founded the ASCOVIME ASCOVIME non-Competitive organization, which organizes travels in the field of outcome to provide free medical assistance.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group had been assisted by almost 32,000 people.
Since every Friday, he and even until 30 people are killed in the firgons, are bound to healthy belonging to the roofs of the village to visit those needed.
They don't always make luck.
They've never had to steal cars through the river and the darks.
But when they come, they meet as the present heroes: this is the feast with songs and dances and the best rooms that can only provide local inhabitants.
The payment of health services in these villages is really a party, and Bought with its widely laugh and unlimited energy is more happy to join the joyfulness.
The next morning, the briefing starts to take hundreds of patients.
“ We take 500 people in every travel, ” said Barak.
They're coming from all the coasts in the radius of 60 kilometers from the village, and they're going to pizza.
Each of these outcoming clients provides various medical services.
Many people receive treatment from Malaria, Tuberkusal, Defect, Diabet, Parasits and diseases transmitted by sex.
Others can get bushes offered by eye or free witnesses of birth — documents required for schools that many poor families can simply not allow themselves.
At the evening of the brigade, a simple operation is under the local agency.
Operations are generally carried out into school, municipality or house house; after patients are deprived and go into postoperatory area to release the place for the next person.
Used by the generator for the light of operational and sanitary equipment, Bwell and its volunteers work until early summer.
It's an unfortunate temperature, but brigads usually help to support forest musicians.
“ They are fought all nights in the boat that we should fight and continue to work, ” said Bought.
In the Sunday, the brigade members are returned to the city of standing, but the fiery of their work.
This group of camera medicines and foreign students had conducted 700 free operations for the past year and they know that their assistance could be greatly important for those who help.
One person explained that the free operation of the grind's treatment allowed him to work again.
“ This will change the future for me and my family, ” said the man.
In addition to these clinical adventions in the outcome and work in the chirurgium Bwellle hospital, he also works nights in private health clinics around Yanward.
This second work, according to its words, provides 60 per cent of the financing of its non-Competitive organization; other resources are covered by private gifts.
“ I don’t even know when he sleeps, ” said Kate O'Mille, the second student of the Drugs University in Philadelphia, who is in the Bwell Group.
He's always in the hospital or he's trying to pay money for the organization to be able to continue these campaigns.
For future doctors and doctors, such as O'Melly, who are coming from the United States and Europe to join Boughle to its tasks, this is the possibility of practice they would never receive home.
“ We got an opportunity to assist operations where we helped to remove the five blood or keep instruments for Dr. Bwellle” said O'Mille.
As a student, you'd never get such a opportunity in America.
Stangers usually pay their travel to Cameroon, often acquiring medicines offered.
But as they arrive in Janov, their food, transport and training pay Boughle.
'He's a hero, no doubt,' said O'Melly.
He gives his lives of this organization, and his wish to help the people of Camerún without end.
For Bwell, almost permanent loading of work is not a hard test.
To help live with a happy life of others, to fulfil the promise given to his father is what makes him great joy.
“ I am so happy when I do this work, ” said Browl.
- And I think of my dad.
I hope he's seeing what I'm doing.
I'm doing this to make people laugh to reduce their pain.
Visit ASCOVIME and see what you can help.

Obama is rejected from his words on health
In the middle of the critics, President Obama's last night went to be drunk about its frequently repeated, a unique promise that “see you like your health insurance plan, you can keep it.”
Since hundreds of thousands of people have received notification of the cessation of services from their leaders, the republics over the last few days have discovered the President because it would introduce the American society into the defence.
Obama had several reported its definitive public promise tonight.
“ The humbleness of people who have a medical insurance that works can keep it” he said in his statement in Boston.
In view of the fact he called “payment in news” for the ceasing of services, Obama called the notifications of the Americans to seek other market options.
Most people will have the opportunity to get the best comprehensive medical insurance plans at the same price or even decline than it has been pronounced.
“ You will receive more profitable conditions, ” said he.
The Administration stated that no one should be surprised that 5 per cent of those who buy a self-employment could be deemed to change plans because their covering does not match the new standards required in accordance with the law on accessible medical assistance.
“Let me tell these Americans, you're doing the best,” said Sibelius in a statement before the Energy and Trade of Palestinians in Washington.

The Rosbalt Agency has lost the status of the SMEs for non-integration brain
On 31 October Mosgowd decided to recognize the unactive license on the registration of the Rosbalt Agency.
In the absence of the MSI status, the Ross Oversight for systematic and fraud violations of the MSI law.
During the process, a miscellant president was created: the court was ready to close the SMEs, actually refused the publication in the right to the contracts.
What's "Rosbalt"?
The Rosbalt Information Agency was established in Saint Peterburg in 2000.
In the next years, the Agency has opened the second main office in Moscow and a number of regional units.
Also, the Agency works in the former CCP countries.
Since 2001, Rosbalt was developed and operated as Federal Information-Analytic Agency.
In the mid-2000, the Agency entered into the list of the most private Internet Internet in Russia.
The Rosbalt has always been a quite specific low: the explosional publications of the Agency were (and are now) notes with a reference to the source of law enforcement bodies.
Discussions on the neighbouring of the publication to the forced structures continued on all the extension of the Agency.
Although the Rosbalt had a wide base of sources in different states, it was spoken for such proposals and that the project head of the Chaffin wife of Victor Quarquesov was standing in the project.
It is not clear to the role of the Chapelin in the Rosbalt Guideline: more of all it is called the "Project Treasury".
The Director-General of the Agency is Laris Aphonen, the Chief Editor of Nicola Walyan.
The Rosbalt has not been published in the Federal AIDS Reviews, nor in civilization, nor in audience.
In October, the Agency took the 25th place in the visit of the Russian Internet websites on the LiveInternet version.
According to LiveInternet, the middle of robalt.ru website is about 150 thousand unique visitors (and 500,000 reviews), a monthly about three million visitors.
Including the most popular material in the last five months - notes of the disappearance of Kril in respect of Ukrainian, death of the Soviet Solitaire Group "Corol and Shot" in the capital of Brazil.
The Rosbalta conflict began in July 2013 when amended the MSI law prohibited journalists of non-integration boats have entered into force.
It was found an prohibited medicine in two videos on the website of the Videos Agency and the Poussy Riot polluted the highs.
The further parts are described differently.
On the basis of the discovered video materials, the Rosbalt has accused in a huge and systematic violation of the MSI law and has been sent to the court for a prosecution to the License Agency.
In Rosbot, the claims of the unfair states said: first, the roles were not edited, secondly, motherwriting words were deleted, and thirdly after the warning of the role were deleted from the site.
Representatives of the Agency were endorsed by the claim of the Russian Surveillance in the world court and when Mosborсуд adopted the Russian Surveillance in 22 October 2013, the examination of these complaints was still considered.
However, the number of 25 world courts had decided not to use the Rosbalt: the main editor of Nigeria Walon had recognized the offence in the violation of the administrative criminal offences and had over 20,000 rubbers to 10,000 per one of the roles.
It appears that and allowed the result of hearing in Moscow, if it was rejected from the thought that the origin could be allowed before.
The Court decided to recognize the inactive evidence of the Registration of Rosbalta, in fact, the MSI status agent.
You can't say that "Rosbalt" during this opposition remained alone.
The Agency supported the Hosdam Deputy (on behalf of the Royal Overseas Chapter of Alekhorus, 10 October, signed 26 deputates; the document was provided under the initiative of the CDPF).
With regard to the wrongfulness of the publication, he stated a head of the Union of the Russian Journalists, the President of the Moscow Journalists of Paul Gusov and the Chairman of the Human Rights Council for Michail Feedoth.
Furthermore, in the words of Goddino, the Royal Overseas gave him some guarantee that the licensy would not reach.
The Court of Rosbalt showed that there was a great issue in Russia to be a jurisdiction under which the jurisdiction had been available.
Syria has destroyed equipment for chemicals
Syria has destroyed all denunciated powers for the production of chemical weapons, recognized the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.
This first stage of disarmament of Damascus has completed the day before the timetable.
By 1 November, Syria had to be destroyed producer and other support objects designed to prepare warfare substances for use, BB-IS transmitted.
The destruction of the most comparative substances or their chemical components must be completed by mid- 2014.
According to the representative of the OECD, comparative substances are currently in disappeared conservations.
International Inspectors went to Syria after the damascus on 21 August, the chemical attack was lost, according to the United States, more than 1400 people.
The main task of the inspectors was not to lose time to allow Syrian authorities to make more chemicals and to destroy the infrastructure to smoke chemicals and ware.
These productive powers will now be attentive to let them not be done.
The next age, in mid-November, should agree to the detailed plan of destruction of existing stocks.
Many questions are here.
Where will they be destroyed?
Who will provide for this equipment?
All Syrian statements will be closely checked by Western Distributions.
They will be ready to inform the inspectors of new objects to check if they are found to suspect that Damascus has not been discovered until the end.
The United States believe that this flag was conducted by regular troops.
Syria and Russia argue that this is the case of the Syrian Arms.
The world community requested the Syrian Guideline, in accordance with the agreement reached by Russia, to destroy or bring all powers to produce railways, gas and heats and to fill them.
Now, when this stage was passed, the next step should become the destruction of the Syrian Army already being destroyed.
It is suggested that this arsenal may be more than 1000 tonnes of nervous-political substances, each orange gas and other pollutioned chemicals in several decades.
It is necessary for the destruction of the OHO and Syrian authorities to agree to the start of the graph of action, which is two weeks.
The Manager of the Field Operations of the OSHO Jerry Smit stated that his inspectors had "literally observed the destruction of equipment."
"They have now no opportunity to lead further production or smoke chemical weapons," said he.
The WHO statements that the inspectors visited 21 of 23 objects in Syria and were convinced that the production of ovens and comparative substances were destroyed or disappeared.
The remaining two objects are too dangerous to carry there in the document, but the equipment has been transferred and verified by the OAS specialists.
According to the SME, the process of destruction of chemicals infrastructure was " particularly unfortunate," as it was in the contexts of the continued conflict.
At the beginning of October, the Noble Peace Premium received, but, according to the Smith, time to reveal it in the inspectors until they were found, they were too occupied.
John Kerry said in his unprecedented recognition that the United States School was “awaying far”
John Kerry demonstrated the decrease of the decrease of the United States disappearance programs and made an unprecedented recognization that in some cases the scholarship was “acknowledged.”
The Chairman also recognized that there was a fault in the case of Barak Obama, that it was an “autopiate” during the presentation of the sound development of Edward Snown on the ABS.
The flights of the information made the United States Government in the center of diplomatic scene with their partners.
The report on video connections to the open Government conference in London said: “It is no doubt that the President and I, and other Government members actually accepted some outcoming things on the car, because such opportunity already existed — and during the Second World War, and in very difficult years of cold war, and of course, 11 September”.
Then he became a member of the United States Government, recognizing that the United States School was too far, but emphasized that the rights were not violated.
He said: “In some cases, this has been more far than it.
And the Chairman has decided to make a light on this matter and to explain the persons, and now he has a pretty analysis to make no one feelings of malnutrition.
I believe you, the iniquity of the innocent people is not in this process."
Mr. Kerry argued, however, that the ANAB had done well-beings and that his healing operations had been saved many lives.
He added: “We work in a new world where people are ready to break up.
In the world there are a radic extremism, uncertainty and full determination to kill people, strike people and attack Governments.
And if you were able to hide this, stop it before it happens?
We actually prevented the violation of aircraft, the explosives of buildings and the murder of people because we could learn about these plans.”
Nevertheless, the American lawyers are sent to Europe to help solve issues related to the United States for the Foreign and to convince Europeans in need to continue joint anti-terrorism activities with the United States, the Sub-Chairperson of the Sub-Committee on European Affairs in Thursday.
The Senator of the State of Connect Crist Merphy said that he had spoken with members of the European Parliament and other persons at this week and concerned their threats to stop participation in anti-terrorist organizations because of disappearance with the national security Agency.

— And I go to Europe to give them understanding that we must continue to cooperate in the area of combating terrorism, despite their wrath towards these NAB programmes.”
The news that ANAB had gathered millions of telephone talks in Europe, have disappeared the relationship with some United States Unions, although the head of the Agency stated that they were unnecessary and reflected the disappointment of the methods that had collected NAT and which they shared with the United States.
Other developments have been renovated by the Snounden documents that show that the ANAB had monitored the mobile phone cancer of Germany, as well as 34 other world leaders.
The National Investigation Director James Clopper has protected the Schengen ' s activities in respect of alliances as necessary and said that it was a normal case with both parties.

ONG - Public structures monitoring the conditions of delaying freedom.
The work of Sergey Magnite and Leonadi Divorceva, the concerns in the copying column, namely by the NGO, have been declared by the majority of resonance results in the decisions.
The control of the NGO is the fight between human rights defenders and the force lobbyists.
At the meeting of the ONG Working Group, I proposed to make the criteria for the selection of human rights experience.
"They did not take and form the lists without criteria," says Varry Borschov.
The current Chairman of the Moscow Monitoring Commission and the Association of Independent Observers - the universality structure of prisoners.

The ONG Council should vote for the composition of the NGOs in 43 regions.
At 1800 vacant places, less than thousands of wishes, and in Ingustia and Kabordinov Bakaria, the competence could not be organized because of the absence of candidates.
The OP promises to organize donor in vacant places.
WHO Moscow is one of the few commissions with a competition, although the new composition will be 40 participants instead of the 20.
According to the Borschav, the current capital commission of 11 human rights defenders and 9 forces, and the option that is to vote in the OPC is changed by 17 to 23.
So, in the capital Commission, 30 human rights defenders wished.
The new composition may again enter the representative of the God 's Brothership' of Vachwal Calinin.

Bosnia believes that the forces, appointed by the President of the ONG, will be able to make the work of unfair defenders, so the rights defenders do not exclude collective exit from the Commission.
According to them, the movement of forces coordinates a member of the NGO Anton Colorks, entitled the Russian Officers, the organization with the interests of the force.
"I'm not eating the young ones on the stage," said RBC daily Anton Colors.
He refused the movement of any lists and said that the rights defenders would not be able to visit arrested oppositioners.
He was not even interested in what list of votes are now in the OP.
The renovation of the Bosnover information is considered to be the form of pressure.
The possible success of the human rights defenders is planning change of the Guideline of the Chilebian ONG.
The former managers are disappeared because of the last years of copys.
The Common Chamber concluded that the management of the local commission was ignored the problems of prisoners.
And here's the ONG Rostova-en-Dann can go from the defenders to the forces.
From the new "propay" lists of the Defence Chairman of the Local Commission, one of his officials was found, although the Federal Chairman has excluded it in May 2013 for an inevitable behaviour.
The lists of the Moscow and Enlarged Commission of Burschov considers the "copesh moving".
The Democracy of the Toloconians did not impose the UNCTAD as a " violence ": only one human rights defence and have not even accepted a compcuse document.

He sent other members to the Council.
His colleague on the POP Paul says that he voted, as he likes the proposed mobile list.
It has coordinated the preparation of the lists of the NGO Vice-Secretary of the ONG Rule GRIB, which was also a staff of the National Research Institute of the FIAN.

If the proposed list is rejected today, the next days of vote will be changed.
Australian Women offers appeal against prison period in Thailand
The 21-year woman of Sidon, condemned by 15 prisons on the island of Phocket, for a false acknowledgement that she had been attacked a taxist, made a complaint on punishment and was released under the board.
Steve Roschil Bamford was initially recognized by the Phucket Province Court in a false search following the reports of the police of Thailand that the local taxist had made an attack at night on Sunday 10 of June, while two other men had held it.
However, in records of the video monitoring camera, it was later found that she was well returned to her hotel after the disappearance of its Australian Battery.
The Phocket police requested Bamford for two days before she recognized that she had storyed this story.
It was in local police rooms before the court.
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-year prison period in the centre of the holding of the general regime in the Phocketa area, not in the female prison for adults.
It is a daughter of the former player of the Australian League, Peter Tanks, who was attended to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberre for assistance to her daughter.
Tanx said to Senennium Sunday Telegraph that the whole family was “related” by the benefit of her daughter and was waiting for her return to Australia.
“ Apparently, it was a huge time, but we hope that she would be welcomed to return home as soon as possible, ” said Tanx.
Bamford made an appeal to his sentence and was released at 50,000 baths.
According to the reports in Australia, it is currently conducting its release into the Smoking Zone in South Thailand.
The legal sources in Thailand reported that Bamford currently presented a local lawyer at Phuquet, but warned that the appeal could lead to the court to increase its condemnation for two years and put it into prison for adults.
However, after the recent murder of the Australian turgen of Michel Smith in Phuquete Thailand, he could also seek to restore its decorated Turkish myga, which leads to the condemnation of a fair sentence.
Roman Senach is now present in Paris to the presentation of his Roman "Electives", translated to French.
Remember, this was the finalist of four princes: "Ish campaign," "Ross Buker", "National Installer" and "Best Book".
In the past year, the writer for this book was satisfied by the premium of the Government of the Russian Federation.
Roman Senach is an uncertain leader in the generation of the present thirty-year-old and forty-year-old prosecutors.
Each publication of its hardly built in the modern life material of narratives and orders makes a huge dispute between the criticians of the most different directions.
It could be stated that the military articles on the prosecution and publication of Senecia, recession on his books and magazine publications create a civil and unexpected Russian Literature from the end of the 1990s until the beginning of 2010.
In discussions on the “one of the modern writers”, the critics of Sergei Choperinian, most of its participants are understanding under the word “literature” which the current and future are not only our word, but also life.
Unfortunately, the number of books did not allow the majority of articles and reviews from regional SMEs and blogs to be included in it.
The analysis and review articles are generally given in reducing the 'Ambzack' sections.
