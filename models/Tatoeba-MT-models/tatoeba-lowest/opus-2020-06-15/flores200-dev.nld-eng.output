This will turn the screen away. If the shapes on the right side, the shadow moves on the right hand, and when it is on the left side, the shadow moves on to the left.
They need to get the additional energy from the light to return to the previous energy level.
They're doing this by throwing out a small light piece, called a "foton".
Scientists call this process a "stimulated emission of straling" because the shining light stimules the atoms, which causes the output of a light photos, and light is a sort of radiation.
The next photos are to see atoms that photos send. Actually, photos are of course a bit smaller than on the photo.
Photos are even smaller than the parts whose atoms have been made!
