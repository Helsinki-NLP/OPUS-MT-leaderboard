Scientists found a way to discover parent stars
Astrophics from the University of Californian in Santa Cross have learned the concern and its impact on the chemical unity in star copys.
It is expected that the opening of specialists will be able to search among parent stars, that is one class.
The results of their authors were published in the Nature magazine, and soon they can be informed on the website of the University.
The cause of the unique chemical composition of nearest stars is the pre-extension of the light of the gas.
Even if the star is born then left a star class, it is possible to determine the place of its birth and the star education region.
Earlier scientists doubts that the evolution of stars outer class could lead to the differences in its chemical content from such a parent in the classer.
The results of the modelling of astrofics show that such differences should not appear.
In their research, the specialists with the super-computer have shared two flows of inter-land gas, which together formed clouds.
This object for several million years is transformed to a class that begins to be educated.
Scientists added rock-metics to initial gas streams and set out that, through the fast careful reduction in the cloud, the high stage of chemical unity was reached.
As astrofics believe, their research shows that stars can be searched for chemical composition as well as to determine possible regions of education of such objects.

It was very American idea that work rights were human rights.
The Congressmans, Kit Ellison and John Luis, proposed a draft law which protected the prosecutors as a civil law.
"Where is the work of the middle class", said Ellieson, a democracy of Minnesotes, who is Co-Chairman of the Congress of the Progress Federation.
That's why I am fiercely presenting the Act on enlargement of the rights of workers together with a symbol of movement for civil rights by John Luis.
This newsletter legislation will provide the same legal opportunities with the discrimination of the prosecutors, which also with other forms of discrimination by ceasing the forces of opposite prosecutors
Change the Labour Regular Act so as to allow employees to participate in the prosecution organization, seek justice in civil courts and compensate damage and payment is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is unfortunately not the radio initiative, at least under American standards.
In fact, the best way to be discovered in the proposed by Elison, Luis, and the lawyers, to remember the very American thought.
Despite the attacks undertaken by prosecutions in the past years, in Visconne, Michigan and other states throughout the country, Americans once supported the country of the world to enlarge, enlarge and respect for labour rights.
It was time that millions of Americans still remember when this country had defended the democracy, the freedom of word, the freedom of printing and the right to organization.
When the United States occupied Japan after the Second World War, Dung McArtur General and its assistants helped the country to adopt the Constitution established so to ensure that the military automation of the Hydec Towso was replaced by democracy.
As acknowledged that workers and their professionals play a role in forming a New Japan, they included the text directly recognized that "right workers to organization and negotiations and collective actions are guaranteed."
When the United States were occupied by Germany after the Second World War, Dweitt, and his assistants helped the Germans to write a constitution which guaranteed that the Fashism Adolph Hitler was replaced by a strong democracy.
As acknowledged that workers should be organized and listed in a new State, Germans included an open article: " The right to educate associations in order to protect and improve the working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to each person and every professional or area.
Agreements which restrict or attempt to enhance this right will not be legal; measures aimed at these objectives will be recognized against law.
When the former Chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which was formed by the World Declaration on Human Rights in 1948, adopted by the Organization of the Joint Nations as a universal agreement, Roosevelt and the Composers included the guarantee that " any person has the right to organize and enter into the prosecution for their interests."
The generations of the Americans have been based on the human rights of workers.
When the country has consulted other countries about how to create civil and democratic societys, the Americans explained that the right to the prosecution and that it should be protected as an equal partner in collective negotiations with corporations and government institutions.
Now, when these rights are attacked in America, wisely, to return to the American idea that people working should have the right to organization and that their votes should be heard in free and open society.
As the favorite Martin Luther King said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Everyone now knows that the proselytical movement has not been driving the power of the nations but has increased them.
The highest degree of millions, the prosecutors wonderfully created markets for industry and highlighted the nationality at an unrealised production level.
Those who attack prophesy forget these simple truths, but the story will remember them.
History will remember how to do.
Official recognition of workers as human rights and enhance civil rights to prevent discrimination against the organization of prosecutors has been long ago.
Kit Ellison and John Luis renew the ideas that historically expanded America and promised democracy to the reality.
The court is timely locking the law that could close all craft clips in Louisian
In the United States, the Federal Court of Justice had temporarily blocked the introduction of the law of Louise, which his parties said that he would rather close all five arbitral clinics in the state.
According to this way, which was signed to the execution of the Governor Louisisan Bobbie Janedle in June and should have entered into force on 1 September, the doctors who do abortion were obligation to have the full acceptance of patients in the hospital in a radio of 30 miles from their practices.
Nevertheless, the decision of the judge means that the doctors can continue to do legal acts, continually looking for such powers.
"The persons will be allowed to work legally, continuing the ability of enforcement," wrote the judge John de Greewalz in his decision.
The hearing will be appointed for a month in which the judge shall decide more constantly in accordance with this law.
The right to an attorney with glad pleasure met this decision, the latest decision against similar measures, saying that it will give the doctors more time to obtain hospital powers.
"The present decision ensures that women of Louise will be protected from a criminal law that seeks to leave their health and rights," said Nancy Nortap, President and manager of the Reproductive Rights Center, which had the ground of the ceiling of the law from three of the five clients of the State.
It was not immediately clear if the decision was to be taken to doctors from two clinics that did not speak in this case and also made a comprehensive acceptance statement.
Louisa entered into the 11 states who have adopted such laws and the courts recently recognized such non-constitutional measures in Alabama and the Mission.
The key parts of the Taimark Act, which would close most of the remaining clinics in this state, were blocked federal judges in Friday.
The barriers for the right to anatr together with the American acquirers college and Genokolavs and the American Medical Association said that the laws on acceptance laws are imposed to doctors unnecessary in terms of medicine.
The lawyers expressed that such measures are aimed at the protection of women ' s health, although some also noted their positive effect in the clitorial closure.
Only one doctor who makes anarts in Louisian has a complainant in the hospital, reported the Reproductive Rights Centre.
If all the remaining doctors in the state are forced to stop implementing the procedure, the doctor, fearing its security, would stop implementing this procedure, reported the group.
Critically, the officers of the Louisians said that they would not punish the doctors who do abortion until their complaints were expected to decide.
What is the introduction of cotton to domestic products
Nevertheless, half of the products in the field of trade networks should be Russian production, the Deputy of the Hospital Russian Franzement of Oleg Nilo.
The parliamenter has prepared a draft legislation aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers.
The document will still be detailed to avoid the possible disclosure for buyers.
This is about products that are not produced in Russia. "...> For the rest of the product groups produced in Russia, the Ritter must provide at least the half of its positions to the own producers," reported Nilele.
However, amended in Article 10 per cent of the implementation of products made in Russia is the draft law, which amended the National Code of NGOs by 10 per cent.
The idea of putting 50 per cent of trade networks into the package of promoting measures for Russian producers.
There are several times more personal products.
However, the initiative may have a positive and negative effect, the experts say.
According to the lawyer of the Logician company, a member of the independent expert centre of Lithuania ' s Opinion' Sergey, for Russian economy, as well as for the natural agricultural and food sector, will be a positive nature and will lead to growth.
The farmers, farmers, small stores are in the area.
They can sell more, and that means the winner grows.
Furthermore, they will have the right to deal with the ritleer’s conditions and prices, as they will have to buy their goods.
Russian producers will increase their activities and sales, which will lead to higher wages than before.
This will increase budget income, establishing new workplaces, which are starting to increase, which is faster, will be increased to growth in HIV.
The independence of Russia from foreign food is declined in a few times, indeed, not immediately," notes the expert.
Earlier Russian enterprises could not frequently be tried to shelter local stores because of high competition from foreign analogs.
Now, after the imbargo introduction, the poor has been free and can be easy.
But it should not be forgotten that after all necessary agreements and sanitary checks on the Russian market, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia have been made.
In other words, now it was the "moment of sweet," when the old players have gone, and the news haven't come.
The first Vice-President of the General Public Organization of the Russian Finance Club of Directors said that it was almost a month after that, as well as the growth of the prices for the preparation of the production, it has been said to AF.ru.
Indeed, the idea of selling in each category as at least 50 per cent of the Russian food products will be able to strengthen the sector for local producers.
In that case, they will comply with each other, not with goods that are subject to the other State.
In other words, the purchasing fight is divided between the companys working under the single laws of the sale.
On the other hand, Caciano notes that Russian producers are able to meet 50 per cent of the internal needs of consumers far from all articles.
And in this situation, trade networks will take place from the share of Russian goods to half assets.
In this regard, the risks are increased that the borrows have been made.
It may be added to an expert under the form of Russia's foreign products with overwhelmed ethics.
The negative effect of the introduction of cows feel large trade networks, especially those that are intended to cooperate with importers.
Loyally that foreign providers are adjacent to this allocation, since the demand for their production is declined.
Lithuania does not exclude that the law on cowboats on primary goods may also be reflected on consumers.
The fact is that some Russian production products can arise on the quality of import similars, while stores can increase prices to the second, such as deficits.
On the forgotten ideas of the importing of economics in the beginning of the year, reiterated in February of that year because of the pollution of rock was not stopped.
At the background of the Western ' s shorter relations is now more active.
The law is invited to binding rituals in the form of orders to provide providers to be considered with certain producers.
Then we'll go through the way to import, and the production planning system will be created in a shorter time," says the Deputy Oleg Nilo.
In particular, the cohesion mechanism will be for agricultural sectors, where the capacity is particularly high, for example, in the molecule where 25 per cent of import is imported.
Our farmers are really capable of covering Russian shops.
Furthermore, the powerful impuls can obtain local production.
As known, the maximum amount of imports remains from 30 per cent to 35 per cent.
It is about 65-70 per cent to Russian production."
The experts are viewed that the invoice of cotton for domestic products is able to facilitate the import and can accelerate the process.
However, this initiative will not bring its own initiative, since it is necessary to comply with measures, Lithuania.
In any case, 50 per cent of the products sold in accordance with this initiative may be brought from the border, and it means that the full import will not happen, but significant steps in this direction will be made.
In addition, the cows should still be configured in the country of production of domestic products to implement these cows.
The data of the cows as a time such guarantees and are provided by the experts.

NEBOUR ISSLIEDORATION: New medicines can decrease the cancer of light and nuclear cancers
Researchers followed the medical way of women for seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of women at the time of the diagnosis decision, the cancer cancer of nuclears, the present diseases and social status also affected the probability of survival.
Women's older age and those in the later stage at the time of the diagnosis decision had the lowest survival rate.
For those who lived in regions or distant places, the probability of die during research was 20 per cent above than those living in urban areas.
Although research was not designed to determine why women living outside the towns, more likely to die from the nuclear cancer cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that the timely set diagnosis and the absence of access to optimistic treatment were possible factors.
"The disease is better to be treated by chirurgics specialised on hynological ecological cycology, and they are mainly in large cities," she said.
In spite of improvement of the quality of the steredic services to reduce the incidence of distance, it suggested that increased number of travel services that allows specialists to treat women close to home, and the support programmes of people who govern from their home could help.
Dr. Jordan said that, independently from geographical provision, the research found that a long-term life expectancy between women with nuclear road was rare, underlined the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.

The inflation went out of the release.
Whether Russian growth of prices feels
As a result of the override sanctions of RF and Western inflation in Russia, it will be accelerated and not included in the prognosis of the authorities convinced by the BTB Capital Analysis.
According to the view of experts, the effects of anticipation will lead to the inflation shoe in the first quarter of 2015, RBC Daily.
According to the past planning of the Mine-Economic Development, the inflation in 2014 was 6.5-7.5 per cent, in the next year and less than 6.5 per cent.
However, according to the newspaper "Commмерant!" this week, the smaller but principles should be adjusted to macroeconomic progress until 2017.
According to the publication, the state may reduce inflation assessment for 2015, which allows to eliminate the expected population growth income.
It was expected that the food sanctions of the FF worked a year until August 2015.
How could such a high inflation be made?
The current situation provides a small shock, but the decrease of inflation will not be changed," said the source of the newspaper in Minnesone.
The ITB Capital economy does not share the financial and economic expectations of Government ' s inflation and forbidden the growth of prices in 2014 at 8 per cent.
The main effect of product prohibitions will be together with the possible introduction in the RF regions of sales (NSP) in 2015.
Inflation pipes of 9 per cent will be at February, and then price growth rates will be inherent, experts will be paid.
But last week, Rossst gave the first inflation events after the RF had introduced "aquarium sanctions".
AF.ru requested experts and explained their inflation expectations.
Artem Dev, Chief of the Analytic Department of FC AForex:
The growth of the price is already observed by the main segments of goods.
Furthermore, when social significant products have been affected, the Government was forced to start the system monitoring of price stability to prevent the risks of unnecessed price increase in short terms.
Prosecutors and rituals are already marked daily before regulatory bodies so that the authorities may know exactly who, if and for what reason it initiates increased prices.
The key factors of growth of consumer prices have continued to remain in the position of the capital refinancement of the bank sector, from the Russian Megargular, from the internal conversion on the cause of the population in the foreign currency, as well as the embarg for the transport of food products from countries related to sanctions against Russia.
If the inflation pressure remains under control, the value of the minimum product set would not be 12 per cent to one quarter.
The import of food products has facilitated the shock of proposals on the internal market and has made a logical increase in the cost.
Since the current stage we are not fully launching import mechanisms, as well as enhance the sustainability of the Russian market through internal production, the sanctions continue to have the risk of growth of the inflation combined.
If there are still physical reasons that have been added to the absence of confidence to the national currency, as well as degraded economic growth, the inflation is fully exceeding 8 per cent of this year.
Alexander Scientist, Director of Alpery's Analytic Department
In the 1990s, inflation has sometimes reached 20-30 per cent in the month, and in the past it was also above the current level, the other case, which then has increased fast economic growth.
I think that inflation is 8,8,5 per cent during the year.
Platon Maguta, UNHCR 'Fond Maguta'
The external factor related to sanctions against Russia until it is successful, but if the pressure is further improved, first of all, in the financial sector may lead to certain difficulties and increase in inflation expectations that usually have been traditionally produced in the buying of a single ball to enhance their conservation.
It may be suggested that the Government, the CFC and the Financial Ministry are trying to reduce the flavouring of rocks, as well as market methods and public regulation.
But the growth of the price is traditionally starting after the age of decrease, and it may be more sensitive.
The aim level of consumer inflation in Russia was 7.5 per cent, more than in all, as RF provides further financial coverages.
The centres are decreased by the decrease of the households
Thus, a result of the exclusive reduction of the number of households at least 35 years, may lead to the fact that the garden centres start to lose tens of millions per year when the current youth consumers have reached the "based age of garden" in accordance with HTA investigation reported by financial Times.
According to this report, the persons who disbursed the housing are deemed to the average of 55 per cent of the amount that owners of their own homes are paid to the garden.
It is mentioned that an increase in the number of people living in high-urbanized areas, the popularity of the palaces in front of the house for parks and the reduction of the garden size as other factors that have damage to grow, the annual sales amount of which, accordingly, is £5 billion.
In Great London, where the number of households fell from 61 per cent to 43 per cent in the age, the lowerest rate of trace for gardens for households.
HTA and the Kingdom Guarantee Society reported that the apartment of housing and absence of space for garden was not meaning that people could not grow up.
Gay Barter, the Main Guarantee Council at RHS, said: "The growth in containers, for example, in particular popularly to farmers who can transport growth with themselves when they move."
The HTA report has defined the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "soft autum" trade of goods for the garden resulting in increased numbers of households and economic prosperity from the end of 1980 to the middle of 1990.
It also suggests that markets will improve in this year by a better metal after unrepensed conditions in March and April of the past year.

According to Dun T, which is called a new company, Wanda could increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from current 40 million to 100 million to the next year.
The new area should be the greatest online-to-offline platform in the world.
The online-to-offline site (O2O) is to introduce purchasers to the Internet so that they come to normal flags or buy other traditional services.
The classic example of O2O is the seller of groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O - the greatest "pair" in the online-communication," said the leader Wanda Van Sünger (Bloomberg quota).
"The current O2O area is not in China, and in this situation all is approximately equal."

The state of Jack Ma appreciation is $21.8 billion, of which 11 billion are at Aliba.
Leader Baidu Robin Li now takes the third place among the richest people of China, while Van Consumer from Wanda, the fourth part of the reit.
" For this battle, it is very interesting to observe: three rich men are the most efforts to make calls more rich," said Bloomberg, the Chino Director for E-Communities Research in Hanço Cáo Lay.
But he believes that a new company is in fact able to compete with Alibaba immediately after the creation: "They can't build one day."
On the fact that Alibaba is not just to confront new companies, but also the paid leaders of the world-wide market, it has been published a report of the financial indicators of Alibaba on the last quarter.
Alibaba often describes the average thing between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June, the Chinese company has gained more than its two American competitions together.

Nevertheless, half of food products in trade networks should be Russian production, the Hosдум Deputys consider.
They have developed a draft legislation on this topic.
It is to bring changes to page 8 of the CF on the basis of public trade regulation in RF and the National Code.
The objective of the document is to introduce protection measures against the Russian food producers.
It is important to clarify, in accordance with the law, at least 50 per cent of savings in store products must be according to the goods.
However, the document will be understood that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, for example, fruits and fruits of winter, so it will be made to avoid the possible discussion for buyers.
On the same time, the draft law includes changes and the National Code of the FF, establishing the decrease of NGOs in 10 per cent in the implementation of all food products, which are Russian, reports the newspaper "Ivoire".
On 27 August, the parliament's lower Chamber was deepened by a draft law on changes in the FSO, which proposed the renewing of agricultural markets in Russia, which small producers could be able to implement their production.

The first day of the wedding is marked by mocket and wind conditions on the airport of Adelida
The EU has prepared a cold sorcery in southern Australia, bringing flood rain and strong winds that flew on the fields of the Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain came into the city to the evening 9, after 6.6 mm that came out in the evening night.
The last rain had previously been a couple of short olive oils with a patent wind, including a rain that started up to 8 evening and grew approximately 4 mm in 10 minutes.
Following the early wedding in the past week, the temperature fell again to the maximum of 15.8C in the city.
The skills, as expected, have served one of the reasons for the delay of the Virgin Airlines airlines from Melbourne in Adaid.
The aircraft should be landed after 7:30 a.m., but the wind movement is a immediate change of speed or air direction to a short distance, and has been denied to take height.
The wind breasts reached 50 km/h to the airport of Adaid at this time.
The fields showed that the aircraft had to bear the height during the second landing, and the aircraft ended at about 8:40 evening.
The delay of the airport was granted by the following delay of several other vehicles, including Emirates from Duboa and Qantas from Sidon.
Maximum 16C is pronounced in Adaid on Tuesday with the probability of one or two olive oil.
Evaluation of building objects in RF will happen in the new
The prices, the building regulation, and the challenges of linking the Federal Anti-Mobile Service are particularly monitored.
The FASS has established an expert Council for the development of the competition in a constructive area.
At its meeting, the Chapter of Control of WCH, construction and natural resources, FAS Woodwim, said that "the annual calculation of the estimates of construction objects is absolutely unrealised."
The standard base makes the price of non-transparent and may lead to an unnecessed construction price in the AFC.
It proposes the cost of construction of hospitality objects at the projecting stage to define on the basis of the market prices of constructive decisions instead of the estimated standards and the same assessments for Technology Operations.
These proposals are included in the "Hot Card" and are now in the ministry.
"The replacement of traditional documentation in the construction of constructive elements should lead to less corruption in the field, explaining the "RGB" of the Watch Town.
It is now that each ball and haeck is calculated, and it is not always likely to be checked, so the time to document the unemployed construction companies can copy the "pleasant traders".
In a ministry, the FAS agrees.
"Increased transition costs for constructive elements are already developed: price calculation methods for constructive decisions, targets for these indicators - said the "RGB" head of the Department of Gross and Architecture of Elena Jueco.
As a pile chosen area of road construction.
However, experts believe that the problem is more serious.
As the "RGB" chapter of the construction company "Profession" Anatolai Demaniaco said, the sharp standards have been recently stopped, but another business mechanism has not yet been proposed.
"What is about the proposed building element calculations, it is difficult to realize, since in the building of the building, different technologies are usually used," he believes.
It is not a secret that the carrier is developed in a lot thanks to the guest.
According to the President of the NGO Governance of the Experience Community of Professional Professional Trainings, Ecatherine of Lezyan today is the State the most expert prosecutor.
The Ingeniement Director of the Rosatam Armymond Malahov Capital Building Centre noted that the markets today were divided on a company which had access to the contract port, and the company owned by monopolies and unlimited competences on this field.
He believes that the establishment of a transparent market may only be provided in the condition that access to contracts will be limited to any administrative impact.
The expert Board was proposed to establish the system of the guest so that the same executor was not right to receive more than 1 billion EUR or more contracts for more than 1 billion.
The ministry believes that this approach should be assessed with the impact of business and the effective management of construction.
As Elena Juck explained, it would be necessary to fill the complaint by the General Representative functions, which would lead to increase the number of chargers and budgetary expenditures on its content.
As a result, the prosecutors should have knowledge that allows to assess the quality of implemented undertakings, as well as their security.
In the case of such disasters, it will be necessary to determine who will respond to the security of the object in general.
Furthermore, this approach may cause high-qualified guest parties to the uninterest in the receipt of a State order for unpleasant work and small contract amounts.
The complaint of the Institute of Alexand Evashesks' advised that the Hospital Procedure has now been converted in a business game for the holder's career.
And he brought this example: "Party at the completion of the claim must indicate "concert indicators" without the word: "or equivalent," "because," "because", "more"," "anolog", "and" or "the same type", "not below," "not below," "level", "power", "before," "before be," "here", "n't above", "not upward", "not allowed" and etc.
Thus, the prosecutors often abuse their right to impose the requirements of the application provided by subordinate organizations.
Another problem of the 44-FS was considered by the European opinion that it was necessary to assess further at the stage of the claim for quality of work through the proposal of the party.
In explanation of the application of the Party, the applicant can only assess the qualification of the applicant but not the quality of the work to which it has not yet come, it is the expert.
The quality of work can only be evaluated when they accept.
The expert Council was also proposed to transfer the marginal income from the top to the lower ecleon to disappear interim perpetrators.
The Chairman of the Expert Council, Articles Secretariat, the Defender of the United Nations, believes that it is not important to do so, since the complaint of the mandate should be granted by the Chief.
Anyway, the known representation of Ryan "Atel" is: "What's the powders of the claim?"
Israeli children return to school after war in the Gaza Sector
Every Israeli children in the territory, near the Gaza Sector, went again to school on Monday after the season in the bombs, when rail and mines had falled on their visits during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while the Gaza Sector school was closed while the territory was restored after wars.
The beginning of school employment has been a feeling of gladness and concerns of those suffering from the railways of South Israel, but the follow-up of wars remained sweet.
In the south city Ashdod, the child garden ' s officers of Pashsh, in which rocked the railway, took the follow-ups from the wall and the children’s guests before the coming of the students.
"We're a little afraid, but with glad viewing the future," said Ronnit Bart, the inhabitant of Kiboc Saad and the teacher of English in his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to the greatest life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shenny Bart, said that once again to go to school, "a little strange."
"It was a difficult time, and we didn't totally go out of our houses," she said.
The President Reuven Rivlin visited the kiburs which was located away from Gaza to express its support.
Before the fire ceasing agreement had stopped the war last week, thousands of border settlements such as Sad did not go out on the street or left their homes, have gone away more secure areas from the Gaza sector to save rail and minimised fire.
Many of the inhabitants of Nahall Oz, away from Gaza, where the Palestinian mine was killed four-year-old, are sure they should return.
The Ministry of Education reported that approximately 1nd families have not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at this time.
Prime Minister Benyamin Nathanyahu visited the school in Sderot, a city of the border of Gaza, which was strongly disappeared from the Palestinian fire.
He encouraged the children to learn hardly and said: "We will do everything that is possible to give you knowledge and to secure your security."
Israel and Hamas agreed to be irremised in the past Sunday.
The fire ceasing agreement immediately put an end to battle, however, the unlimited issues remained key, for example, the Hamas ' s demand for the abolition of the Egyptian and Israeli block of Gaza and the opening of airports and marine ports in the Gaza sector.
Israel wants to make Hamas arms to return the body of two Israeli soldiers died in war.
It is expected that the new stage of non-direct negotiations will begin later in Egypt in this month.
In war, more than 2100 Palestinians died, between three four were peaceful citizens and at least 494 children, according to the evaluation of the Palestinian and the United Nations.
Israel summarises these figures and states that at least the half of the slaughter were slaughters, but he did not provide significant evidence that it was approved.
For Israel, 66 soldiers and six peacekeeping people died, including one secret worker.
During the war of Hammas and other Gaza fighters, 4591 electricity and mines on Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
Israel’s army, at the time, conducted more than 50,000 aircrafts and other assets.
As a result, the Israeli attacks were detruyed and destroyed thousands of houses in the Gaza sector, and 250,000 were found a survival at more than 100 schools that were transformed in vacants.
Since the tens of thousands have still been in hospitals and fears continued, officials who have responded to education have retained the beginning of a year of education.
"I hope that school is soon opened that we can complete our education as children of the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammed Amara, a 13-year boy who lives in one of the Gazi school.
According to the popular criteria, prices for non-mobility have shown the maximum winter growth for seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Housing index for the housing price in Australian table increased by 1,1 per cent in August, reported the RP data on the afternoon.
The growth of June, July and August has resulted in 4.2 per cent, the largest increase in winter from 2007.
Annual growth was 10.9 per cent, more than two months higher than 12 months to August 2013, but an increase was not equally distributed in the country.
The Research Director of RP Data Tim Loules reported that Sidney and Melbourne were conducting two-quarter markets.
The RP Data figures show that the living prices in Sindi have increased 16.1 per cent in the past year, while 11.7 per cent in Melbourne.
The following markets were Adelida, Britain and Darwin, where the prices in average increased from five to six per cent.
On the other end of the scope, Canberra had resulted in the Government ' s reduction costs, where prices were increased by 1,4 per cent per year.
Mr. Lowleis said that now when the spring started, an increase in the number of non-mobility designed for the sale will be observed during the following months that will be "suased test" for the market.
"Assuring the current high level of airline speed, the overall high speed of sales and the current conditions of low percentage, probably the value of living is still increased in the following three months," he said.
How people live in the old house of Uphs
In the former Gold Industrial House of Edokim and his son Iwan Damide on the street of the Watch Tower Revolution 57/1 (leaving the Great Cazayan) 18 apartments.
The XVIII - century house has not been changed if it does not consider gladness.
Related people are here as an excursion, and people are more happy than their privileges are the right to live in an old infimic house, whose walls are remembered by the captain of Alexander Suvorve.
The dates of the household’s construction are indirectly shown on two dates 1730 and 1737.
But in any case, the building is received without a little 300 years.
An old court, always opened the door, crying the boat.
The doors in the apartment are close to each other, the walls were shot, and the roads are seen in the light of the road.
It seems that it's all right to say.
And the inhabitants believe, "You don't think it is."
Living in the 16th century’s 16th - says Tatjan Lukavan, inhabitant of the apartment No. 3.
The object is on the hospital, but the money for its content is not decaded for ten years, and we feel museum exempts of which authorities have just forgotten.
The last revolution was 40 years ago.
The stars are still bad, but the foundation has all been prevailed.
Many inhabitants are still in the street, and praying at a week in the public bathroom.
How can you be free in such conditions?
The road walks directly under the windows, not even a peak zone.
The mother moves the news.
Now it appears that it was just heard: under the windows there is a flow of cars.
See, the scene is constantly drunk, the windows can't open, and the noise is high.
But a man belongs to all things, to good and evil.
Our apartment is still educated, thanks to the husband, his hands are golden.
Furthermore, we're two rooms, we live with a son.
In other families, a lot of worse, at the second stage, there are less than half meters of higher.
The Territorian Contract proposes to go to the neighbourhood of the apartment No. 6 Humans of the Old.
A pleasant hospital woman from the time proposes a coffee cup and tells:
We have a unique apartment, 14.5 m2 for four persons, so we live with a husband and a daughter with a kid.
I've never been here since the birthday, the other housing was never, the man's eyes of the room: the antitreols, two wonderful letters of "g"; one of them was contained with a bottle.
It's very close and little different from the usual parent interface: only slides of beautiful, "historic".
But with the plot, the water supply system is not needed anywhere.
Humans are talking about his apartment at home and wonderfully on the same time as the Italian house where the Roman roads stand.
So it is a very old and recent, daily and legend:
Produced approximately 40 years ago during the last revolution.
Then they made us a small kitchen in a cocket and a tunnel from the former Cholana.
We live in the second stage where Damide was home with the family, in the second stage of the servants.
Our apartment hasn't been arrested, right?
The Office of Inmobilities said that the Privacy has no value.
We can't accept only one-called apartment, but we can't make any more.
Four months ago, they promised to distribute us, but the promise has not gone.
I wasn't obliged to smile and I'm not.
In this apartment, my grandmother and my dad and my dad, my dad and my dad and my husband and my daughter.
Everything was for that time.
For example, healthy crises flew into the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the film, they're a meter thickness!
They're saying that the structure has been detained in the eggs, so it's keeping so long.
The house is basically designed, thanks to Damide!
It is likely that only so until no one had killed those who had slaughtered the pit or their own.
Only the building is slowly died in our eyes: the teeth and the liver house hurts, the balls are unremovable, we've had the cement, but it's not useful, but it's not useful for us to go into the land as the cold.
They say, there's under our hidden lace and move to the River White, which has done specially some time here old to be hidden from the danger, in any case.
They have been persecuted.
The old man tells how a story came to him and asked him to let him start in the apartment of the discovery.
And then I urged to give them a job to exchange herself at October.
History said:
Where are we in one Thursday?
And here there's some crazy hope that will give a living more space.
We agree to exchange, we wouldn't have gained anymore.
Nevertheless, the family of the Olds did not win.
The greatest dream of man's dreams to be distributed, and the daughter of the 16-year-old girl gave a single room.
Thus, there are two families who have a two-commerce apartment instead of the greatest roads in which two generations are now living.
The symbolic, miniaturar girl Oleis Carsak of the apartment No. 11 and 12 shows the second stage of the house.
There are two close rooms of the general area of 23 m2, named apartments.
We have seven people, two kids.
You see what circumstances.
The steel is disappeared by tails like windows, walls on kitchen and rooms.
The water in the last round year is only cold.
Following the ancient home of Ufa, it is possible to make sure that most lucked to Laurentiv's marriage from the apartment No. 4.
They take the first stage space rooms.
You're right, a lot of place!
The location in 75 square square, written three people.
We live in the rooms where Suvors remained during their stay at Ufe, says the Head of Alexander Dmitrivich Lavern's family.
The pools are high, slow.
One bad -- all around the shoes, disappeared, breaking down.
Sossedi must have already been told!
Most hurts we have with half: the trees shocked, the land was literally gone out of the feet.
I put a shot, a climb in the room, and in the other room, we walk like we're looking at the kitchens, so much of the stuff.
On the house of Edokim Damidus Alexander Dmitrivich, it is better for any excursion.
The golden industrialist relates to a family, speaking of him with exquisition.
In fact, personality was indeed unrealised: the Kagin and Usians had built a house, disappeared the roads and collars, holded the Urial guards.
The heirs of the shopping non-modality are angry, but they don't want to live under one crowd with a story.
I've been here a kid, in the 40th century, says Alexander Dmitrivich.
Then there were wooden buildings for cards, horses and card buildings, afterwards made.
In 1968, we wanted to take our house, but something was missed.
History was repeated in 2014: a new resident was again launched.
We, as a team, gathered all documents, gained the needed institutions and immediately found that the transfer to the apartment was transferred to 2015 or 2016.
Something don't believe in all this...
Two years ago, Laurenians went to the Ministry of Cultural Republic of Bascorton to learn about the courts of home.
The chiefs were not taken.
We sent from one table to another, and then, as in the laugh, they put a bottle without signing and printing: "The Master of Cultural is not oppressed against the disappearance of the inhabitants."
I even got this feeling that our house had no longer been in the city plan, since first he was under 57, and then it became 57 A, and now 57/1.
Like it was already in the 70s.
The Russian Planet turned to the informed information-analytic management sector for the land resources of the Uph of Virmira Barbara.
The Occ.b. Revolution 57/1 was included in the Full Wood Division Programme.
I can't respond to the workers of the 70-year-old, I know only that there was a plan to compare all old homes, despite historical value.
Happy pleasure this was not, and the decision of the modern authorities is to resume all the old houses on the Occident Revolution, representing the architectural value, successfully implemented.
Inhabitants are soon planned to be divided in new apartments.
According to Barbarash, the house of Demidi will be Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
It is now in Italy a architectural binary, and the "Star Uf" project presents there, including others.
I hope that all the old Caza Street will be arrested by 2016, says the leader.
The house will be accepted by the one that was before three centurys ago.
Damiday's house will be a museum open to all those who want.
Furthermore, the Government has decided to make a road during the outcoming days of peak.
Unfortunately, there will be too large loading in the town.
In 2015, it promised to be disposed of the future museum of the Armymond of Arabia.
Nevertheless, they will remain free: their new apartments will be the same area as the present.
Only the other episode.
A forest fire started in the Empire because of the cruelness of the forest.
The smoke became the cause of the forest railing in the territory of the Holocaust Forest Zone of the Primor Area.
The group of forces and resources is enhanced.
According to the KHSBU 'S Premor Aviabaza' guide, the air forces created on the place of the rail conditions require the accession of air forces.
Vivilius Mediterraneus, Vice-President of Aviabazi:
A fire in a difficult place was discovered by a busy aircraft in the 3-ector area of a triumph aircraft.
The rest of the tree on the old garden.
The powerful disappearance of the territory and the smoke of more than 45 degrees, the absence of an opportunity to diamonds of fire-flowing areas create significant complexities in the tunnel.
We need analyze Mi-8.
The allocation of the powers of the aircraft by Mi-2 aircraft and the An-2 aircraft is very weak.
Four flowers were operationally suspended after discovery wounds.
The main task of specialists is the detection of warmth and the preparation of the area to provide additional forces and resources of warming.
In the area of dinners, the Ohotokia heat was additionally added to 3 decades of fire.
Only if the aircraft plant is prepared, the specialists will be moved to the spot place, it will be reported on the Prior Bank's website.
My dad never understood me.
I never said, "I love you"
Henry was one of the seventh children born in the family of immigrants from Jamaica in Dadley in Middens in 1958.
His father died when Henry was 19, worked on the factory, and their relations were limited.
Henry repairs the "Radi's Radial Platin" which is partly based on the imaged discussions with his father and grew up from the series of transmissions to the radio 4.
Sundtruk is a rigs and a ripa, and the melods are lives.
However, Henry had to take some difficult memories of childhood.
After his mother's death, he was a new treatment, but Henry is often talking about relations with his father.
He was very unable.
You never saw him face, you just heard his voice, "Stop up.
Get away from the sister.
Let's go!
I want to look out crying.
My older brothers, Simor and Gilton, who were adult when I was a child, went to the pop and talked about such things as the form of a drinking stack, the beauty of the crystal.
I never talked to him so.
He was such an unlawful guy in an angle who readed a large part of my life.
Hey, recently, opened a Literature Master in Dadley, and although the conditions became better than in the days of his father, he was able to look at what should be his life.
Now there's a little bit better, but they're dark, smoke, deep labirin's labirin's layer's layer's preponders with the fire and the damage and the kitchen of the sand.
My father fell in the bathroom and just laughed there, and you heard how he slowly began to laugh about yourself because he wanted to get away from the lithic master.
When I came there, I understood what he did these years and years to work for us for an investigation, and I began to appreciate him more.
However, Henry went out of the child of the nursed parents' love.
My dad never understood, never said, "I love you."
Only when Mom became bad at the end of her life, we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Frank, allowed him to share the love that he had not lacked in childhood.
Can you stop it "I love you?"
Just stop climbing me!
Dad, I'm 22!
Don Frank.
Why don't I get to marry her?
She's a great mother.
They're still good friends with Frank who was married for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why don't I get a wife with Don?
She's a great mother.
Henry's mother had a demon.
He was one of the ones he killed her.
So, when I'm very, I've been very correct and I've got the symptoms of the diabetes, my doctor said, "You have to take radical measures.
Then I started a serious occupation of Physis, and I also had to sit on a hard child to escape the symptoms.
It's very hard.
And it's funny.
Nobody eats marty.
The change of the core tractor of Henry may be reflected in his well - well-being smooth.

This work is different from networks and comitals that have been an incompatible attribute of his dedicated professional life.
He started the carrier when he was 16 and worked on the factory.
Diджy noticed how he was born on the scene and wrote about him to "News faces."
His television carrier started in the middle of seventy: "I was the only black/comic of television."
He learned the work.
I was not only going to grow up in the public, but I had to learn to be an effective shopping car between 1975 and 1985, being a star, television work, and it was very hard.
Lennie in New Persons in 1975
Since his manager had the right to the "Bright and white show of mines," a easy deployment program in which people "which their face," Henry found that it operates for five years.
My family did not like it.
I mean, I wouldn't want that to never be with me, but I'm not sorry I'm doing it.
Although it was a strange, worthy of a conviction, I worked in the large areas and learned to work with a throat.
But what was the "learn reward of a easy deployment class for the British Television year and year" was and the "grote paddy to black people."
As a result of the culture of black coasts in the United Kingdom, Henry worked in an alternative project in the eighteenth.
The first scene of Shaw Lenny Henry was translated in 1984, and in the ninth year he was known, among the others, he was head of the Great Blok of the Commised Chaff.
Related roles, documentary films, televisions and roles in the movie took the next ten years of his life, but after his series of BBC in 2008 "LennyHenry.tv", he said, "What are you going to do further, Len, because it seems a lot that you're going to take time or to hurt the side."
There was a series of documentary transfers to Radio 4, named "What's good to...?"
The first was Shakespeare.
I had a real alergy to Shexpira.
You can't tell me that at school, and I thought it was, in many cases, prevailing white people from the middle class with colleagues and captain down.
So I was very afraid of him.
All of whom we took an interview for transfers, Peter Hall, Trevor Nan, Adrian Lester, Judy Dench, said, "You must try.
Don't hurt it until you don't know what you're talking about.
Listen to some of these words, and you know why we're all like Shakespeare.
Henry's 20 rows from the last monology of Welllo for the documentary transfer, and it was shot.
I felt a feeling that I can.
Whatever I've been going to do is my head.
"What this is, this is a serious case, in turn to this serious, endeavouring its text, a small study.
So, the repair process was hard, and I read this pizza months and months before we set it.
And she had success.
It seemed that they were waiting for catastrophes, and she didn't happen.
Soon we started "The Communication of Errors."
Soon I was in the National Theater, and I just couldn't believe it until the end.
It was one moment I thought, "Oh, you've changed."
The technical disappearance occurred, and Henry institutly felt that his case was to get public.
"The voice inside me said, "You'll have to work 10 minutes until they're making a computer."
Instead of this, the Assistant of the Register announced that the presentation would be renewed when the problem would be resolved.
I went away from the wall and said, "Oh, glory of God."
It's not my responsibility.
I can allow someone else to disappear.
"You're playing a pizza, stay in the role."
Henri's in the "Back" theatre of Daces
Teaching the text for the 'Backet' was difficult.
The patient's quite useful, it strengthens the muscle.
She also took a good thing, so it was a sign higher, saying, "Whatever you have to do?"
He says this, of course, by the vote.
So I'll keep it.
I really love this.
I like to be in the repair hall.
However, Henry's still thinking of the comic is the whole way of our conversation overlooking his humor when he starts, then it's finished to be born.
I just decided not to work in the walldape, because this thing with the get of an immediate reward from the full room of the strangers, I think it's quite dangerous.
If you're trying to do that all the time, it can bring it to a bitch.
I'm sometimes working in the "Apol" Emirate" when I want, but, mostly, I don't get such pleasure as before.
I'm asking if he's gonna give a tour again.
It's glad to sit in a location with a reciproc who helps to bring the form of the start, the middle and the end of the way, I don't think I't want to never to disappear.
So this is his new power?
I think so.
I like to be a acteur.
It's a nice murder.
You're always telling a story and here a great place for this.
I love history.
People love history.
Katie registers public officials to identify "invisible workers"
Katie started the biometric registration of all public officials attempt to remove "invisible workers" from the payment of the Government.
In the Government declaration, the employers who are not registered during the next two weeks will not be paid.
The Government is understood that thousands of people continue to receive payment after they have left the public service.
The President of Uuru Kenyata promised to reduce the corruption in public structures since it came to the authorities in 2013.
The audio audit has discovered at least $1 million ($700000) in the month by payment of " unvided workers" and other financial violations.
The Government understood that the payment continued to be paid on bank accounts, even after a person dies or leaves public service, reports the BBC reporter of the Quebusiari table, Nairobi.
All public officers should appear during the next two weeks in the identification centres to ensure that their data will be collected through the biometric registration procedure, the Government declaration is reported.
Any who doesn't do this without a respecting reason will be removed from the payment state will be reported.
"The procedure has significantly facilitated the rationalization of the public service, defining the actual multitude of public officials, and will also be used to facilitate the payment status at both levels of Government -- so it will put the end of the problem of "insecurity workers", said Ann Viguur, the Secretary of the Minister of Planning and Structuration.
Decade of Turkish police arrests against the Government
A total of 33 police officers were detained in Turkey for suspicion in the " Government Trade" reported local information agencies.
The representatives of the police had not immediately commented this information.
Among the detainees were 14 high officials reported by Hurriet Daley Newz.
Some of them, last December, participated in corruption identifying activities aimed at verifying Government officials, including four Government Ministers.
In July, a number of Turkish police were arrested under suspecting the establishment of a organized criminal group and the hearing of the phone.
The Turkish President Regipe Taip Erdogan (which was the Prime Minister) has defined their action as part of the measures taken against him and others that were undertaken by the Islamic Clinic Fithullah Hulen.
Not all the children returned to Ukrainian school
The schools in most of Ukrainian opened their doors on Sunday (1 September) after birth Canniul.
This day, traditionally, is a great event for families, and, as thousands of other Ukrainian parents, the Prime Minister of Arsjech gave her daughter to school.
There he said to the journalists that not all schools were opened again, but that he would make everything possible to protect the country for future generations:
In the first September, the ceremonium was not going to every school.
There is no peaceful heaven over every part of Ukraine.
We have to fight for the peaceful heaven.
The whole Ukraine, the huge Ukrainian nation front, must fight for the peaceful heaven.
Alex Pastuch, the school director in Slovakia, who went to the daughter of Jazekia, spoke to Russian.
We hope that the world will finally be established here and that children will receive knowledge that will be useful in their lives.
The first day of training notes traditionally that children hope high-level roads, holding the air balls and give the colours to their teachers.
In the face of Ronne Firhed BBC, it may have found such an impressive manager that she needs.
It follows the loyalty of the bank business, the SME and the internal tours of the Tori party.
In fact, it has a own experience of work in the guidelines.
Its carrier started in a concerting company on the Bain and Co, and continued in Morgan Stanley, Bombadler, ICI and Pearsons worldwide.
She was the Chief Finance Times for seven years and went to the rescue when the high post in the Pearson's main company took a swimming colleague.
They say her job is approximately $1 million.
Its political audit is also gone.
She recommended that David Cameron Lord Braun, the former head of BP, when he tried to bring specialists from the private sector to Whithold: she became a Minister Officer.
She's his husband, the former Consequent Tori.
Previously, I called the Chairman of a compared cup in May.
BBC is not only a large and complex organization in public life, but there is an internal paradox.
The Council has two directions: inside as the highest level of management of the BBC-Arachum, but I am run as a voice of public concern and concern when something does not.
This is almost an insufficient dupole, which requires full radial reform.
However, what new Chairman will be risking to come, detected and destroyed Institute is so complex as the Chinese dinosacy if he remains working in this process.
It's a difficult solution.
It would be not so difficult, many will be glad to see how BBC will reduce, after reviewing its power, financial and status.
As competitors run around and new technologies are throwing out awareness of old assets, the unemployed license value negotiations represent special danger for BBC.
For the humidity of $145.50 in the year, the Britains are defined by the greatest medical business in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it states that its work was covered by 96 per cent of households and each of them every 40p per day.
Furthermore, obviously, Beeb grows: 53 per cent supports it today against 31 per cent of 10 years ago.
BBC's view and use models have changed. Now I'm getting new tracks on the mobile phone and I'm looking for iPlayer's programs.
But it remains a very popular and comprehensive institution.
He needs a speaker -- I hope it found him.
The Perry from Texas says that the decrease tea was written to somebody's pilot.
Trait from the confirmed actor of the Republic of Rica Perry, the Democratic Prosecutor of the Democrates, which is in the centre of criminal prosecution for the abuse of power.
The train was later removed, and he followed another of the Perry acquired that record was described.
It's just that from my achat's been published a ticket that was written by somebody on a bilateral.
"I don't appreciate this cart, and I took it," she reports later.
Perry assistants did not immediately respond to the communications requested to discuss.
Although the records were loaded from the confirmed actor of Perry, it was not clear who actually performed publication in this area.
Further early, Trevis Lemberg had contained a carrier for the surrounding prosecutor of Travis Lemberg, who had recognized the fault in April 2013.
Perri made an prohibition for the financing of its state when she refused to go to the delay, which brought the great jurisdiction to Ostian in this month against Perry, which was a potential candidate to the President at the election of 2016.
"I don't always smoke the car in the air condition, three times higher the valid alcool level, but when I do it, I'm going to be accused by the Governor Perry because he's telling me about this."
I'm the biggest democracy in Texas.
The Lamberg Division did not investigate a major jury against Perry.
They were engaged by Michael McKruam, a special prosecutor of San Antonio, who was appointed a Representative Judge.
Perry had not recognized himself abused and called the accused of political complaints.
His powerful legal team requested a judge who was conducting this case to reject the accused act, acknowledged that the law that is used to pursue the Governor who fulfils his responsibilities more than all the history of Texas, is contrary to the Constitution.
Perry stopped funding for $7.5 million from the State State Control Division, based on Travis, and was pursuant to corruption in the Texas public sector, when Lemberg was refused to depart from the rescue.
The total complaint was issued by the public supervision team.
The lens of the confirmed actor of Perry is often updated, and sometimes it is a sign.
In 2012, when the Fifth Party was a party to Aiya during his President campaign, Perry answered that he could go out of the game and published a twice with a photo that runs close to the ocean, and saying, "We, the South Carton!"
Berkeley reports that the market of non-mobility has returned to the "Normal status"
One of the most known furnitures of London predicted that the markets of inmutability in South-East England " returned" to the normal level of activity.
The house in the table was an issue of a survivor and slightly growing prices, and it was widely dangerous that the credit procurement undertake the Bank of England to establish limites to the imposable wages in June.
Tony Pidley, the Chief and President of the Berkeley Building Company, said on Monday: "On the beginning of the current financial year, he returned to the normal level of transition from the 2013," added that it had been "the private environment".
The London Inmobility Market was overcome during heritage, as foreign buyers went to the table.

The average market prices for private, accessible and study schemes of Berkeley have increased approximately one fifth in the past year, reached $423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the bulletin in the last months has been less accessible to foreign buyers, some of which also stopped introducing new in-mobilities and political rictory around the potential "favoral" in front of all elections in the next May.
The London Foxtons Inmobility Agency has warned that the reform of the Iopathic Market, which had been more harder than business delivery, also reduced market growth as a market seller of non-mobile sales and prices in the second half of the year.
The feed data from the Bank of England showed the fall of the appreciated immunities in June, provided for further housing market.
Hamptons International, another non-mobility agencies, reduced the progress of the growth of the london non-mobility rate for 2015 to 3 per cent, based on the fact that the prices of non-mobility had already been reduced.
The tranctions were in time at the fourth comparison with the previous year in the most ways of London, such as Chalis, Maferre and Kennsington, under the WA Ellis Agency.
Nevertheless, the request for the house at the table was very useful for Berkeley, highlighting the wages of sales at the sum of $2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidley added: "The demand for goods with a good design and the best location remained old and, reflecting this, the sales for the time were stored."
In June, the company reported that 3742 new homes were sold in this year until the end of April, nearly a third of more than the perceived pix in 2007.

Berkeley's value was at $23.96 in the second half day in London board.
Photographs of the discovered Jennifer Lourence are published in the Internet by Hacker
Jennifer Lournes has reached the 85th heading of the annual premium of the American chinoacademy.

Exclusive breakfast from the new Roan Howard Jakebson on love and the J letter which calls for the crystals
They're growing, better to say so, they gradually disappeared as a card that left under the rain.
The woman sometimes told him that he was too serious, hard in the society, closed, and may be a little anger.
And then she had his hand with her.
He saw anger in himself.
He was a curious, like the egg, yeah.
The last victim of this curiosity was a small roman, of which he was waiting for more than usually, exemption from a single and miserable life and may even be satisfied.
Elenan Solomonz was a triple of beauty rocked hairs and a dry heart from the northern island village, more deprived and severely than Port Roybe.
She came to the south with an elderly one himself, which Keirr considered her tea, and then the last received heritage in a series, but like a paradise in a valley called the Riya Valley.
Nobody lived in the house a few years.
The thumbs, in the baths, were sitting the powders, left their waves on all windows that are sure that the house belongs to them; the garden is crowned with the skins like the hyganic cows.
It was like a kitchen of a child book, a smooth and shot, with a full secret garden.
Consideration of the author: Howard Jakebson, whose Roman "J" was included in the Book Prize in 2014.
The Chamber will be announced next week
Keirn and Elena sat in hands, in the slopes of the high grass, with an unexpectedly hot wedding day; they both dissounded with the deep console that bowed the country of the immoral music and encouraging news when he looked at her created corn feet, he remembered the old song of the young one who loved his father to listen to the house.
You've got too big feet.
According to the aggression of them, the songs of such a console have no longer been played.
They were not prohibited -- nothing own was prohibited -- they just didn't go over.
They helped them to become Archive as the word "Arachy".
The general stuff did what would never be able to achieve orders and prescriptions, and as among the books, they chose a memours of disasters who were grown in poverty, culinary books and love roses, from all the music they chose a balance.
At the end of the day, Keirn was played at the imaginated forepin and a huge comic voice to make the feet of Elenena.
Ellen didn't understand.
"It was a popular song of a peanist, whose name was Fates Waller," he said to her, he was a car kicked to his two fingers.
So he always did his father to stop the "J" letter before she was going out of his mouth.
It started from the game they played when he was a little.
His father played her with his father as he told him.
Start the word with "J", forget to put two fingers to the rock, and it's going to get you a penny.
It wasn't a very fun game then, and it wasn't very fun now.
He knew that he's waiting for it, here's all.
He was supposed to explain what it was.
Ellen never heard him.
Jaz was not played, although he was not openly prohibited.
Immigration came out of the mode.
In life, there was only one self-shake.
When the melody started, people wanted to know exactly where it ends.
The same thing, with the smoothness.
His unprecedented acts on nervous.
And the race was an exhibition by the music.
Although he had reached 10 years old, he had never heard about Sammy Davis Malch, Kever knew about the drag of the father's sanitary compact collection.
But even though he didn't have to tell Ailene that Fates Waller was black.
When her age was aged, she remembered the time when the popular brain was not black.
Otherwise, no law or pressure.
The community was listened, and this means that each seminar agreed with thanksgiving those who had made a judge, with the principle of a group proposal.
People of African Caribbean origin on the temperature and physical characteristics were well done to the area of disappearance and sports, and they pitched and fled.
The outcome from Indonistan, as if a talent in all the electricity concerned, was taken that no family remains without an electronic phone.
What remained from the Polyn Diaster was seen technical work; what remained from the Greek, the turtleks.
The outcome from the Persian forest and Levita, whose children have not been sought to leave the country, when TU, CHOR, PRONOWHER, the EU PROROBLE ROBLES have occurred, in fear that they were accused of flowing, in fear, to say that the flow would be the following, retained with the labs and the Chalians, and were not exposed and pushed from the unfair.
Everybody can.
Since she had heard only balloons, Elien had been difficult to understand how abusive words she had just missed Kevern could have been put on music.
Music is the expression of love.
"They are really not anxious," said Kever.
Maybe it's for people who have great feet.
My father never hurt anybody, but he missed this song.
He said too much, but the launched garden gave him a security illusion.
No word could result from the sound of hyganic lines like capsules.
Ellen didn't understand anyway.
How could your father love such?
He wanted to say that it's a shock, but he didn't want to add her to two fingers again.
She's already thinking that she was strange.
"He seemed to be a fool," he said instead of it.
She had shown her head unbelievablely, closed Quever's review.
In the whole world there was nothing but the cops of her blue hair.
Nothing what he wanted to look at.
"Well, if you're saying that," she said, staying at her view.
But it doesn't even explain why you're going to me.
It seemed that she was really disappeared.
Have I got too big feet?
He looked at them again.
You can't say no.
Lodge, maybe, a little bit...
And you're saying you're hating me because my tastes are too sweet?
I hate you?
Of course, I don't hate you.
It's just that stupid song.
He could say, "I love you," but it was too early.
"You like that because you've got a taste of tastes," he tried to say it instead of it.
I have such a disaster.
That was wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts often have brought it in a smooth situation, because, as his father, he was not aware of the encouraging disappointment that could smell the cruelness that could be swallowed into the shocks.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he wanted Keirn.
Despite good eyes.
Elenan Solomon's wine was drunk and lifted up from the chain, shot the console and drunk the wine that they drunk.
The wine from the business could not be justified.
In her concern, she seemed to be dragged as the palm letters in the Urugan.
"And you like that because you're crazy head," she said...
Although you don't like it.
He was sorry to her and because of the worst hurt of his words, and because of the fear that she had appeared in her view when she had given it.
Did she think he was gonna hit her?
She didn't talk to him about life in the northern cold archipelago where she was grown, but he didn't doubt that she was similar to the primary.
The same widespread glacial ocean has disappeared on them both.
The same fighting men, even more sensitive and cataprised after the OTHO, the PROGRAMME, the ERRABLE OF THE PROCESS, than their prejudices, counterbars and disasters, shot in the potter's furniture that were ready to put the hand on any woman to give them or to doubt them.
A crazy head?
They would have shown her a fucking kick, if she wasn't careful!
At the beginning, it was the most ordinary expression of an erotic anger between men and women; the opposite against the pretty balances that removed the console, starting to curse it, and then to be wounded.
The latter explication, according to Kevern, because you were angry for yourself was already angry.
Elenan Solomon's corps showed him to leave.
He went up from the scene as an old man.
She felt a painful hardness, but the weight of his womb was surprised.
It was not the end of the light.
They couldn't know each other.
She looked as he went, and from the top window she looked out as he was going, her wife--- the man who had seen the gun on herself.
Adam, who left the garden, thought she.
She felt a school of compassion to him and men, some of them lifted up her hand.
The man who turned away from her, with a congressed back, warmed, all the ability to fight him left him -- why she seemed that she knew that it was so good if she could not remember any event until the day she had seen this?
One Elena Solomon looked at his feet again.
Over twenty years prior to the above events or nearly Esma Nosbaum, a comprehensive and powerful 32-year-old researcher who worked in Ophnau, the informal control service for the Common System, prepared a small report on the conservation of a low and medium-sized violence in the most parts of the country where it was expected to reduce, if it was not completely stopped, taking into account the resources and forces that were made on his elimination.
"Much was done, and many things were done," she wrote, "to smile the damage of aggression of people who were wars in thousands of wars and won most of them, particularly among these patent flowers and slaughters of the place, where, despite those of the benefits of the church, the disappointment of human well-beings was strictly felt over the whole history.
However, some qualitys are not eliminated.
It would seem to be lower the loss that he's lower.
The seat has smelled over sensitive balances, the story of the overwhelming challenges and declares its dust of faith in the well-being of marriage and family life, but not only an elderly wounds its strong lack in rural communities and in urban locations, but also have data of the fact that new and bad disappearance in houses, workplaces, on roads and even on games.
"You have a valuable way to write too much," said her scientist manager, reading a report by all.
I think you have to read less romans.
Esma Nosbaum left her head.
I should also ask you, you're ateist?
"I think I don't have to answer," answered Esma Nosbaum.
You're a bossy?
Esther reiterated his right to private life and silence.
Phyminist?
Rear silence.
"I ask", said Luther Rabinski, "not because I'm against the atheism, forestity or physicians.
We don't have any warnings here.
We are the servants of society without warning.
But some kinds of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and praise themselves, sometimes can find results, for example, what you have shown to me.
It appears that you're warned against the church, and that you're calling "sack" and "blood," others would interpret as an expression of natural life and energy.
Continue to need on the TOM, THE PROPOSITION, ECONAL OF THE PROGRAMME, as if it happened, yesterday, means to leave the country of its vital force necessary.
Esma Nosbaum looked at the sides before Rabinins were talking.
After his heads, like flamingo, the light-dyod letters repeated the advice that Ophnau gave the country to the last fourth or more.
Love your neighbour, take the price of your neighbour, listen to the balloons, go to the music, talk to the phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, excuse.
The talk is better to silence, the word is better than the word written, but nothing is better for love.
"I'm fully understanding what you're going to say," said Esma Nosbaum quietly, when he trusted that her scientist manager ended to say, "and I don't want to say anything, except that we haven't betrayed as effective as we believe.
I was concerned that if we are not ready, we will find that we will reiterate the mistakes that have resulted significantly to the TOM, the PROGRAMME, the EU FOR PROGRAMME.
Only this time we cast out our wrath and unbelieving on others.
Further Rabinez connected the fingers of the fingers in the peak.
This hardness should be meaning an endless patience.
"You're going too far," he said, "whiching the "sounds" actions that did or didn't do our children.
You're going too far, and when you're talking about they've thrown out their "never" and "incredible" on the others.
In your place, a person should not need to remember that, understanding the past, there's a real protector, we're not talking about 'Nos' and 'thes'.
There was no "sa", and there was no others.
It's been the time of unordinate, that's all we know.
"What, if being honest with himself, has waved to put Esma, no part of the society can be fairly justified.
I don't accuse anybody.
Whether it was bad or good - what's done, it's been done.
Then it was.
Nothing needs to say that we're agreed here.
And as we don't have to accuse anybody, don't have to justify if it was reasonable or if something could be corrected.
But why's the past if not to learn --
The past exists to forget him.
If I can add one word to this --
The Premide Luther Rabinit disappeared.
"I'll consider your report," said he, leaveing her.
On the next day, on the way to work, it shot the motorcycle that went out to the trotuary, as described the rain, "in an evil wrath."
Consents are connected.

Production in Europe at the lower rate of 13 months
The growth of the production in Europe was decreased to the lower indicator in August 13 months.
The latest importance of the European Euro-Euro-Economic sector in March 50.7 in August left from 51.8 in July.
The value above 50 shows the growth.
New orders have been detained and the enterprises have suffered from a growing tension between the EU and Russia in connection with Ukraine.
The values were made before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting in Thursday.
I will wait from the bank of a clear plan for the rest of the European restoration and the threat of deflation at the inflation that is totally 0.3 per cent.
There is a proposal that the manager of the ECB Mary Drag later to this week may give additional signals that it considers the quantity measurement scheme for euros, similar to which Britain and the United States have been used during the financial crisis.
"When a growth is better than any growth, the tourism effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty to producers," said Rot Dobson, the elderly economy Markit.
The Germany ' s production sector, the largest trade partner of Russia in the EU, was lower than 11 months in note 51.4.
However, in the second scope of the block economy, France has falled to 46.9.
France continues to call on the present concern as well as the decrease of Italy from the stability to the stability.
In view of the fact that the impools of growth is in the main industrial engineer, Germany and Spain and the Netherlands, it does not add security," said Mr. Dobson.
The reduction of the industry, most likely, is still infringing oil to an analytics expected to introduce an additional monetary or budgetary stimulation.
An positive news was from Ireland, where PMI increased to 57.3, its highest level from the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, the main economy of IHS Global Insight, said: "The best that you can say about the August research index of the productive sector of Europe's business activity, is that it shows that the sector is still growing."
He added: "The European producers obviously have a very difficult life at this time, since the current green geopolitic tension - especially related to Russia/Ukrainian - adds uncertainty to still comprehensive circumstances in many countries.
This increased tension apparently affected business and particularly on the confidence of the consumers, and probably indicates that some orders are detained or even rejected, particularly important orders.
He said, "All more like it," that the ECB, of course, must be conducted a variety of quantity merits, "when we know it's gonna be limited."
The inhabitants of Maryopol make a living street against the volcanoes
In Maryopol, before the past week, there was no one wanted to organize the Population Republic of Mary, a city on the Asian Sea, to work.
Now the inhabitants with fear wait for the arrival of the "Folls".
According to the version of the politics, the seminars move to Mariupol to go to the Asian Sea, recently took the city of Newweazowk, which was not even in the composition of self-prolifered republics.
The Russians decided that the Ukraine Army would be protected, but it had little forces against the great armed representatives of DNA-LND, and were assembled to help military.
They're making oaks, build blocks and strengthening.
On the evening of the Sabbath, some thousands of people came to the eastern border of the city, and there were placed in a living street distributed by Ukrainian.
They're going to do the same in the case of the offence.
Foreigners are gathering and resuming drunk and products, collecting medicines, reporting the newspaper.
The city is gradually closed, ceasing banks and banks.
10 years of water for the Beslan: ten years from a lodged school as children who have been found in it have been suffered.
10 years ago, there were more than a thousand people in Czech batteries in the school in Besselan, South Russia
More than 330 people who were more than half of whom children were killed during this three-day trial.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who deceived death during the animal at school
It was about ten years after the terrible disappearance of the Unit, 334 people died, including 186 children, who were heroicly overlooked have warned the evening of a new atmosphere in Ukraine.
When terrorists, the Islamic phenicians, were stolen and killed children and parents on 1 September 2004, at the beginning of the new fourth, it seemed to be the least possible worst.
The tragedy joined the east and the west in a distortion, which then arose in action and hope for the future in the pretty heavy circumstances.
10 years later, we returned to Beslan to South Russia to find some of the victims who deceived death in the school.
We found a wonderful young people who opposed evil, although the memories of terrorism will live with them forever.
They're the greatest hope?
What war that now suffers from Ukraine, in which the same children are as they die, will now be stopped.
The girl who is trying to take back in a relaxed sports hall
It was stored at the scene of the known Russian photograph of Dmitria Beauty when in one cup he tried to take back into a smooth sporting hall after the extinction of mines.
In the distress of Aida, she had sought for her mother, Laris, which now has been 40.
There were dangers that they both died, but they actually survive.
"The woman said to escape from all the forces, but I couldn't," she said then.
My feet were covered with blood.
I got up and came back inside to find my mom.
The soldier welcomed her and led to a secure place.
After the operations, she thought it was completely rescued, but yesterday she said, "Tree months ago, pain was back.
I'm afraid I can need more operations.
A few stars remained in my tribe.
Its goal is to become a dancer, help people as well as they helped the doctors.
"The tragedy changed my life, but she, of course, didn't shot her," she said with a call.
"It has happened to me, and it cannot be changed.
One time a year I'm always going to this sports hall to remember all those who stay there.
My friends and I are trying to not talk about this in other days.
It's too strong.
My best friend who had to be my sister, Derra Hapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were little and we dreamed to go to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I can't end the training and start working.
I'm thinking about the family later.
She says she's still hiding her, although the memories are a little thorough every year.
I'm glad that many people in the world are still remembering our disasters, and we are so thanks for the assistance we received from Britain and from everywhere.
When I see a photo where I'm leaving in school window, I think many people will see it first, know about our tragedy and make it so that there's no longer happening.
The young man who fled through the grass pool, thinking his mother's dead
It was his first day in school ( Russians starting schools in 7 years) and survive three days of disappearance with his mother Tamar.
Then he was seven, and he said, "Mam said to me to lie, if it be explosed, and to keep her on the hand."
After one of the explosives, he thought she died.
She said to him, "Beautiful."
Besides that she was dead, he fled and saw a little laughing, took the child on his hand and fled through the green pool.
His father, the Herody, who took the son of her neighbor, said, "Dordy told me that his mother died.
He said, "I couldn't save it."
In fact, Tamara was elected to liberty and was in hospital with wounds on feet, thinking her son was dead.
After their assemblement, she said, "I'm weeping for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He fled and took me.
Afterwards, Damira was brought to London (not a disagreement newspaper of the World), where it was rewarded as a Child Defender from the Barnardo's Primeer Tony Blair and his wife Sheri.
"It's a terrible thing returns to you every day, but I'd like to stop remembering him," he said yesterday.
I can say that I have a memory, he's nerved.
I remember how soon I throwed out all my played weapons.
But now I can play the computer games with the shield, and it's not a problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to return to that sports hall, but I don't think about myself.
I remember the children with whom I played in the palace that did not be eligible.
We're never saying they're killed or dead.
We're saying they're still in the sports hall.
I remember my trip to London so good, especially a playing store, where I'm allowed to choose everything I want, and a car with an open top.
But now he fears such a place as Ukrainian, where wars bring to such an affliction that he and his friends survive.
This earthquake comes back to you every day, but I would like that I can stop remembering him.
"I'm so sorry to all those who suffer from these horrors," said David who had been working for a voluntary work in the female monaster last week.
I want to help.
I want to serve the police once and I hope that I'll be numbered in a training academy next year.
His mother Tamara, 48 years old, said, "37 kids were killed in our quarter, can you imagine yourself?
I remember the waiting stilling right after the disappearing, there were only children that would cry and run around, and this silence continued a lot of months.
She'll just remember her trip with Damory to London.
People in London wept when I told our story.
I understood how people at the other end of the earth can understand our feelings, can help.
She was thanked to Sherry Blair and her fund for the benefit and the opportunity to go to London in August 2004.
I'd like to call Sheri and just tell her that 10 years ago, but I'm still remembering her and her husband in London and how they helped Damira and me.
I remember when David wanted to eat a boat, they called all the Russian local restaurants.
I remember he played with the officers in the restaurant, Daward shot them out of his water pill, and they fled and played with him.
And the whole month he went after our kitchen then.
I was surprised that Britishs were so ready to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I all think that this world hasn't been better than these 10 years.
Now in Ukraine, people die daily, and I think many children were killed and will be killed.
It's just like our kids.
I think for many people of war is a new report that they hear when they're sad or when they're busy anything else.
I just know that these people feel, terriblely.
And I can't stop feeling him.
Nothing changed, people still want to kill each other, and that's so painful.
Damide grew up and became a very slow and quiet boy, he is not aggressive and not bad.
He is not looking for a place, for example, he is not involved in this past cake.
I know he doesn't like to remember him, but they're very close to six fellows, and they're going to a sports hall from time, and they're wearing the cows there.
When he was younger, he suffered from this -- I remember he was lying on a spectacle, turning away from us at times.
No sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he threw all his arms and other military games now 17, he's over me, a sympatic, smart and healthy.
I'm hard to believe that a few hours I was so sure he was dead and I never see him any more.
When I was able to turn away from the pit and rose up to the feet, I looked, and I saw me around when parts of the body were laid around.
I was absolutely sure it was impossible that my little boy could live in this.
"I remember that I cried to him, 'Dammir, flee,' but again I was so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard and fled.
That's the life for us, otherwise than the others.
Georgie Ilin, 17 Years
A child whose shopping photo after the disappearance was defined for the tragedy in Belarus
Spacio: Beslan Georgy Ilin and his mother Fiamma after the decade in 2004 and the matter of Georgie today
On his discovered face, there was a speech of fear when he was saved from death when the Czech terrorists spread his uncles.
His photography was one of the most shocking symbols of rebelliness in Besselan.
His mother Fitima, 54 years old, led him to school at the first day of school before taking the old son of Virmira to university.
"I left two minutes before the terrorists fled to the house, so my little boy stayed alone for three days of cosmetary," she remembered.
Not only one, there were our family of our parents, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgie was able to survive.
How close to this date, it's more difficult to think and talk about it.
No one day when we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been long, I think it happened yesterday, some walls of those days have all the time before me.
Nobody will ever forget, I promise you.
The photo of Georgia (left) was one of the most shots of attacks and was enveloped in sculture (to right)
I remember Georgy wanted to go to school on the day that he said he wanted to talk about the teacher.
I just knew he was alive when I saw him on the television.
And now there's also a culture of a weeping Georgy in San Marino.
Georgy doesn't like to look at this photo, and she's hidden in a book box in our house.
I understand, but I also think that through this photograph people from the world feel our pain.
Georgie now says, "It's supposed to never happen anymore.
"I'm sure we'll ever know the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedy and never know the truth.
Now they'll investigate that Boing's crime in Ukraine.
Do we ever know what she was called?
This world goes to something very bad.
"I can't understand how it happens, because if I ask people, no one wants war, so what's going on?
10 years are nothing for such a pain.
We need to last ten years to forget her.
She has affected my health, and I still feel her.
It's just three or four years old that I've shot my kiss because of the shoes, but now it's better.
I returned to school later in 2004, I was very afraid every day.
I thought about my friends and fellows who were killed.
That's why I continue to go to this sports hall before each September.
I want to give my memory to my old boyfriends.
I'm hard to go into the sports hall, but I have to do this.
I don't feel a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I won't forget about it, but I'm not trying to misfortunate myself.
My life continues.
I have completed school this year and made medical university at Worcia.
I'm going to learn to become the cardiacrog.
My first choice was to go to the army.
I wanted to be a military, but I didn't let me.
I wanted to fight for my country, but it won't happen.
Georgie Fernive, 20 Years
A little who survive, although it was found at the stage of terrorist murderer
Incredible: Georgy Farniv was at the feet of terrorism during the slaughter, but he was able to survive.
During the disappearance, he was photographed in a sporting hall sitting close to the bomb at the foot of the terrorist killer.
Actually, it's a wonder that he wasn't killed.
"We think it was even yesterday," said Georgy, who wanted to learn at the FBI's investigation office, but couldn't be harmed because of the damage that was caused by health during the detention.
That's still with me, it's not something I left behind.
I'm the elder now, and they say that the children are easy to work with bad events, I have to say that it's wrong.
"I worked with psychology in 2006, and I felt a little bit better after that, but I can't forget it.
I'd like to forget.
In 2005, the next year was the first and the last time I entered into this sports hall again.
I lost awareness.
I'd never go back there and, please, don't ask me to show me where I sat on this known photo.
Heaven: Georgy Forniv today, with open photographs on the notes of the photographer, in the hospital after the extinction
My pain is hurt, and I'm leaving her with me every day.
My friends know that I don't like to think about it or to discuss it, and they never asked me about school.
With regard to physical status, I'm healthy.
I have to be careful with the tribe that was override, but now I'm gonna go fine.
But yet health hasn't allowed me to go to the FBI academy in San Peterburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical arrests, and they answered that it was impossible.
My second impression was animals, so I went to a veterinary institution.
I learned there two years.
He learns to treat all the animals from the kitchen to the crowns.
He said, "I know that I will never tell my children about my experience.
That's not what the children should know, and of course not that they should survive.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, "These pain never leaves me.
She's in my soul worse when the birth is close.
I'm going and I'll attend the ceremonies that will be conducted to note it.
I know Georgie's not going.
She should be stronger for him because he was there, and I don't.
I was waiting for him at home, and I couldn't help.
I'm so thankful to God that he's back to me.
He's staying with us.
Georgy is now growing, but this bus is still with him.
It's hard to take when something is so terriblely wrong, it's happening to you.
He's a boy, he loves sport, but he can't take them out of the tribe.
He had a few operations, he could go, but he can't be a sport.
I'd say he's 50% overwhelmed this box, but it's impossible to overcome and forget it.
This hard experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the shot, and it only makes my sickness.
I lost a lot of people I knew good, and that was my ways.
My son with me, and it's the best gift that God could make me, but my heart is painful for those who were killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know and widows that have never been married anymore.
I've been going to accept that life continues, even if you don't want.
I'll never forget how the heart tried out of my breast at the moment I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what happens in the world, wars in different regions.
Why are these people fighting?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I'm working on it.
We were a friendly country in the past, how did we get to fight now?
People and children suffer, I'm sure many children have been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If you could've been able to take all the stations and get out-- so far as possible.
Alan Cchaewa, 10 years
The young man who triggeredly brought into a secure place of the speciality
Successful: Allen Ccaewa takes a secure place of the Russian side special (left).
She is now 10 (to right) and she will not fully remember the wonderful crime
Peace was stopped in 2004 when the small Alan had led to the Russian Police in Belarus.
Terrorists left her, but hardly left her mother 30-year-old, Christian sister and Mahara's brother in the sporting school.
The Mahar, who was then three years old, was saved, but Alanians' mother and sisters died in a dead battle.
Her father Rwanda had been married again, and his new wife and a small daughter he called the Christian memory of the daughter he lost.
Alan, whose ten, now, will not remember anything of the breath and divorced in an intelligent and vital girl, speak to the neighbourhood.
"They are a great happy family now, and Allena and Mahar are both beautiful children," said the close friend.
Rosland is a great father and wants to keep them away from all recalls when the tenth anniversary is noted.
You can understand why.
The Sindsy Cagava, who returned from the Manchester Yenedid, noted that he was noted with urgency when he was able to go back to the field in the German club.
In his words, this transfer is a joyful event in the carrier.
Of course, I'm very glad that I'm going to play the Burussia's picture of the word of Cagava.
I feel very good.
The pillar of positive emotions and the urgent expectation when I can go back into the Bourusia form.
Recommended that Kagava was passed to "MU" from Burussia in 2012 to 16 million euros.
However, he was not able to strengthen the English club, conducting a two-session of 38 mothers in the kitchen of England, killed six small and gave 8 resulting transfers.
Women is accused to a girl in the Pelican movement of Faipha
A 78-year-old man will be sent to the court for a trip to a three-year-old road movement to Fife.
Hardon Stuart made a girl to Pittentin's transition to Istan New York.
The prosecutors stated that Mr. Stuart had put the Audi Q3 without an appropriate attention and attention to the girl, as a result of heritage.
Stuart, 78 years old, from the Advocate, rejected his fault in the Trial Court of Donada.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the Queen lawyer, appointed the date of the court in January.
Obama, Merkel and Olland will not return to the East
The Duty Free Aviation Airport has made a table prohibiting buy in this shop a number of world political leaders.
Don't disappear them with spirits, waters, and horses.
The administration of the shop decided that the President of the United States, Baker of Bukha Obama, an angel of Merkeel, the President of France Olland, Vital Clickko, Julia Timochenco, the Prime Minister of Japan and a few other known fellowships will not be able to disappear water, horses and spirits in their store.
And she broke up to the door of the table.
Earlier Obama received a denial in the other types of detention service for the Dictionary Task Force, which reported the website of the survey.
If the American dream President had ever been asked in the diagnostic table in Russia, it is not known, but the prohibition authors are obviously astonished.
Is there a corner after the Embargo: Mediterraneus gave the advice to aggression?
The President, the Russian Minister, Dmitriy Mededves, considers that in the terms of the Russian Agricultures, new technologies should be made to set up the emissions of shopping carriers.
The Council was attended during the visits of the Upptyprom company "Agromplex".
The Chapter of the Government also granted the advice to recent to the Russian meat, whose quality is at the post-level level.
An annual embargo for food import was entered in Russia since 7 August.
The chief manager of the Russian Society of Valentin Massacks is of the results of the tourist DecaNation.
According to the specialist, the third place is a good result, taking into account the lack of targeted training to orders.
Our sports have made up at its level, and it's the Massive.
Third place is the confirmation of our high team level.
It is pleasing that the privilege of French and even Americans over us is minimum.
We must notice that we haven't been prepared for these warnings.
The season ended, and we were not engaged in our leaders to participate in the mother DecaNation.
In the past few years, we became a second tour, but in this season we have updated the congregation.
France, at the same time, made a batteries team included 13 kippens of Europe.
They didn't hide their intention to overcome this year of which they were publicly announced.
But even such a compound of warrants could not resist Americans.
I therefore believe that the Russians have acted at such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some kinds were at the below order than the Brilliant Line.
The session is complete.
In fact, the sporters are not so important, but more in orders of the command level.
The main place was here.
As a result, it was agreed, when 1500 m men were so tactical kitchens, which showed the result below the middle level of female refugees.
4 Shows how to make better quality of sub-country photos and videos
If you want to photo or remove videos under the water, you will have a whole number of applet options before you.
The lowest option is the "sweet" water, for example, Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an exchanger, for example, Gopro Hero3+ Silver Edition, which are sold by approximately $300.
I've made these pictures at the family feast with a number of photographs, all about $350.
Depending on what equipment you use, several rules should be observed to achieve the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you've got water-protected camera, you're sure that the camera and other offices are closed.
Furthermore, configure your camera for that type of photo or video that you'll take away.
Some photos and videocams have grounds or object types that optimize the exhibition for an exposed condition.
And before you come into the water, get out how deep your apartment can leave.
Some cameras are calculated at 5 feet, other 50 or 60 feet.
See our guide of buyer and digital cameras as well as the traditional and water models.
Take a few staffs, because many of them willn't get.
There's a kid's JCD that help you to put your skills, while they're not usually in the exchan-camer.
Even if you have JCD, it'll be difficult to look under water, and the staff company will be an accidental process.
So do a few staffs.
Also, if your camera has a series screen mode that makes a number of staffs with a few different exposition installations, use them.
Stay on the surface.
The number of lights are significantly declined as soon as you can black under the water.
If you can stay at the surface when you get a baceine, a river or the ocean.
This also allows you to translate more colours on the photos, and more deeply you will go, less you can see.
Increase the smoke objects.
This is a great council for smoke, but it is still more important in water because of the deep light conditions.
Particularly important, if you get the exchange camera: this apartment is often established with a fixed, wide line, which means that you'll be close to the sample objects if you want to fill the frame.
The 2012 Olympic Spieler of 2012 on the free fight of Bill Mahaw can go to Greek-Rimic fight.
This reported the chief manager of the Dagetan congregation for the free fight of Sajid Sajid.
The Specialist did not exclude the participation of the sports to the peacekeeping kitchen in September 2014.
Now Bill Mahaw is on the collection of the "classs" team "R-Sport" of Sajida Sajida.
In fact, on the adolescents, Bill spoke both in both styles.
At the first part of the world, 2005, he became a slaughter of liberal and third prisoner in Greek Armies and decided to concentrate on free fight.
It's been a long timely talk that the new stage of his carrier will be in Greek-Remic fight.
I'll say more, Mahaw can go on a peacekeeping kitchen in Tachkent -- if it wins a kitchen.
But it's always a decision for a trigger chapter in the head of Gog Couhashwili.
Andrew Lowson was such a person whose personality might be able to enhance all around, even in a hygiganic organization such as the National Health Service.
Ascertain Agencyology, he sanctified his carrier to deliver patients from suffering disease and treatment.
Among those who referred to him, remembered his wife, was a officer of MIV-6 who had to live with destructive consequences of torture.
Lowson understood that, until the doctor had been involved by diagnosms and diseases, those who had a treatment, mostly worried about something else.
One time in 2007, however, he was found to suffering.
"I didn't feel as usually," he wrote in my past year.
I was hard to find strength in myself.
He discovered that he's angerously preventing his wife, Julieet.
"I want to happen faster than later," he said.
When Juliet went for week, Lowson discovered that he was inadequate and unwise why he was disappeared.
Something was wrong.
He asked the colleague to make a retention of a kitchen cell.
It was two weeks ago he caught on the lakes in the French Alpaha.
The results of the retention came.
It was a mezotom, unlike cancer that affects the pillar, or a blue clothes.
For most cancers it is easy to explain the accurate reason.
Although some smoke smokers suffer light cancers, for example, not all the sick cancers of light smoke.
But with a metolic otherwise.
In all cases, it is a contact with the staff, a localist material that has ever been called "under," but that, as it is now known, had been deadly stopped.
For most of us, the disease that you can not take attention is the most of us.
The office is finally the material from the past.
The most dangerous type of staff is not used in Britain from the 1960s when the recommended industrial debt has entered into force.
Even when it was used, only individuals of specific sectors worked closely with him: tubers, builders, carriers and dog workers, for example.
The industrial toxine of the other episode, if it's a little reason for concern today.
But it's wrong.
Great Britain is present today on the pocket of the myolic epidemic.
This is more than any other country on the planet.
In an annual mortality, about 2500 people died more than two times more than this disease than the result of car abuse.
Annual death of metolics from 1980 and an advanced number of deaths in the future in Britain
The cause for which we feel dead consequences now is that, although the use of the staff has been lawfully used for many years (all the types of staff were finally prohibited by the Act in 1999), to the development of the mezoons are usually decades.
It is not limited to winners of industrial construction specialities.
The office was, and in many cases, it's still staying home where we live, offices where we're working, school where we learn, and stores where we're going to buy.
As a result, the Mezotom does not take attention to the class, additive, professional or age.
The Baseon elections, from modern London universities to private schools, have not been saved.
The building of the parliament has been lower.
Even hospitals designed to treat us have been found by the reservoirs of this mortal concert.
Andrew Lowson was not old.
He wasn't a trumpeter.
In fact, he had to think where he could contact the officer.
Then he made it.
"It seems to be a lot of persons in the Gaya hospital, where I've been six years on the stage," he wrote.
All students, sisters, doctors and carriers were used to use these tunnels.
I'm interesting how many of my stores are weak the same sick?
It was a question to which he was unfortunately able to give part of the answer.
"Our four doctors who were in the hospital of Gaa, and after the last five years, he noted in a letter in 2010, "I stayed alive."
How many of us hurt this disease?
Andrew Lowson was put to the diagnosis of the "socium" when he was 48 years old.
When he died, 17 February, he was 55.
Living so long is inadequate.
Fifty per cent of patients are dead after eight months after the diagnosis sentence.
She's always dead.
So now we can just repeat the question of Lowson: "How many of us suffer the same disease?"
According to the leading expert in the United Kingdom, professor Julian Pito, the most likely suggested that between 1970 and 2050, when an epidemic in Britain must live, about 90,000 persons would die.
Most of them are not present that they would die in this way.

The short review of reports from the court court, where the suffering persons are often compensated, shows how far the mixture has been extended.
In this July, for example, Marks & Spencer recognized that, in the absence, James Elena had been contacted with a person.
She worked in the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, with the manager of clothing offices on two objects, one of which was the main store at Oxford Street.
Ms. Elena was 18 years old when she began to work in M/S.
Now she's two kids older than 20 years.
"Before it happened," she said, "I never heard about the muscle, I had a little knowledge of the person.
I couldn't come in my head, and I couldn't do it.
Many people really know about personality.
In fact, the office is not one substance, but a group of six miners.
They received their name from the word "sabisisform", which means the bulletinist structure that tells them the pureness and density.
Of these six, three often used in construction.
Christian, widely known as a white officer, is most often more of others in buildings today.
It was used in bloody balls, pillars, the terrorising of the trumpets, wheats, even in the car shoes.
It is less dead than other forms of person, but yet recognized the European Union and the World Health Organization, “the serious health damage to death” which can lead to death.
But more dangerous are the core axis (amosit) and the blue asbesto (Crociduat).
Britain was ever the largest importer of the coreist officer in the world, and experts consider that there are some vessels, although they are cooling reasons to believe that this is the fundamental reason for a high number of patients with a mezclame [Brittany].

Justy Elena may not have thought of himself as a typical victim of myocratics, but the work of Julian Pito allows it to imagine that her story is not inadequate.
He studied the hospitals that suggested that "the percentage of the inhabitants, when there was no known effect on work or home, have been more likely affected by the environmental staff."
The majority of this impact, he said, is "properly used and the effect of the Wedding" on our buildings.
Nobody seems to be sure he is in safety.
The report of Goddard Consulting, which was considered by the Wester Duke, shows that people, even in the government centre, could have been unrecognized.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the technical shocks and tube for the location of parliamentary committees were strucked by the murder cellars that could be moved as unnecessary as the " forced air streams".
Members of the parliament often accused that they are pursuant to their own interests, but in this case it seems to be right back.
Although the Parliament ' s Technical Service Division had received a " clean sanitary witness", she now recognized that work was needed at 1 billion of the reconstruction of the parliament, improved the electricity and removed the persons and that after the general elections of 2015, members of the parliament could be attended in the QE2 Conference, not in the green places of the Westminister.
The report Goddard noted that “the situation with the office has not been managed in accordance with the various rules”.
Unable to know whether this management error will be living.
All you can do now is waiting for.
One of those who couldn't find their contact with a person is Mrs. Abbott, a common doctor.
Like Andrew Lowson, Abbott, 50 years old, he suspects that he was affected by a person when he worked in hospitals.
"I worked in the hospital who had successfully been advised by the person," he said, "but I can't prove it in my case.
So hard to remember all the places where he worked and dates.
What he would remember clearly, this day at the beginning of December 2009, when he was expressed something like a ball.
He was 45, and he was on the middle of the afternoon.
Soon, I've got to hurt.
That started very fast.
I felt scary.
I thought I couldn't go through the way home.
As a doctor, Abbot knew that he was sick from the pillars, the neighbors around light.
However, as Janis Elena, he was not just a reason to suspicion with the melody.
Finally, he couldn't work a month.
Independent doctors made the retinencing cells and made pillar catalogues to produce easy and send it to an analysis.
Yet, his state remained without diagnosis.
Immediately his health status has improved and returned to work.
But from time to time the same symptoms returned, often after the sports and hardly dreamed.
In 2011, one of the patients of Abbott came to him in receipt with similar symptoms, and he was later put in the "Mozome diagnosis".
However, even then Abbot did not link it to his own case.
Finally, his patient was over ten years old and worked directly with the office.
The link was clear in this case.
In September 2011, the status of Abboth was disappeared again, and his doctor had shown his results of the CT and the reentess group of specialists.
In December 2011, just two years after Abbot began to feel bad, a damager who was equipped with the camera was put into the pool between the kitchen of his cell's cell's cell and his easy clothes.
I'm an optimist.
I'm usually going forward," he said.
I wasn't too survive about it, honestly to say.
But Rachel, my wife, survive.
The result of Biopsy was a week between Birth and New Year: "I have said that it is myolics."
Mr. Abbott: Dignity Mezotom
Soon Abbot met in meeting the sisters of Macmillan, one of which suggested him to connect to the turist.
In the same time he recognized the scale of epidemic.
"The office has been used widely, especially in large public buildings, where it was quite frequently the tube terroristization," he said.
People who have affected individuals in these buildings are now affected by this disease.
Thus, the mezotom now affects younger people with non-Picical Professions.
The most dangerous hazardous tube were in hospitals, so it is little likely to lose patients.
But many persons who were walking on pearls to fall from one building in the other (as Andrew Lowson) or eat in double tables (such as Gram Abbott did) are almost really affected to the toxic substances.
During a few decades after war, hospitals were placed where patients had saved lives, but the places that were threatened to the doctors who treated them.
He's still removed today.
The schoolmen set their Bunzen's hotels on the personal position.
And they're not just hospitals.
The office was often used in offices, stores, libraries and marines because of their surprised isolation and fire characteristics.
The schools too.
In fact, many more than first have been affected by individuals in the class.
In the whole country, the chimical schools set up their bunzen's guests on personal training.
Web sites focused on personal problems in schools.
At the same time, in our homes, such as the filament or the crowds of the sahares were usually contained.
"It's an industrial weapon set in a large number of our buildings," said Andrew Morgan, a turist who represented Andrew Lowson in the case of the Gaya hospital.
In one case, the only contact that was able to remember a sick woman was a garden of the 1970s.
So be careful, dreams of the garden.
The effect of diagnosis when you know that illness is inevitable, drugs.
"On to know that, it goes quite a lot of time," said Mrs. Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to continue, but I know I couldn't focus on what I do.
I've been in the chirurgic two weeks.
Then I understood that I'd have to go and get disappearing with me.
Well, I won't meet Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was transferred from the doctor to the situation of the patient.
As a comprehensive number of patients to him, he remembers how the amount of information was to be lowered.
"It was easy to understand everything," he said.
"I asked my doctor, "What time have I?"
They gave me approximately 12 months.
I remember how I thought, "What, I'm not going to meet Christmas.
Here's all."
The mezoline is particularly dangerous, as the mechanical is how we support life - the act of disappointment -- calls the cancer that kills.
Most of the cases are contacted by the person.
The office consists of the brackets.
When the office is disappeared and the clothed, they can steal into the bottle, the light bulbs.
The bulldoers are angering the pillar and can cause cell bombings.
"The Worker's inspiration of ill-lawsletters" professor Tom Trageer, Cardiotoric chirurg who came to the Gaya hospital in 2001.
The same person and the hospital, where he understood Andrew Lowson, has been affected by the staff, now, on the irony of the judge who leads the center on the mezotom treatment.
Trager knew Lowson and treated some others who probably have been affected in the hospital.
When the axes fall into the ticket of lights, Trageer said, "They are driving them on the pearl where the thumb is.
This is actually an invasitive process from the beginning.
The usual options of the treatment of other forms of cancer are far less effective in the mixture.
The effectiveness of the chirurgic interaction, for example, causes bitter disputes.
Some think it's supposed to try.
The driver is not agreed.
"It can't cut the pillar," he said.
It can't be around with a foot.
Nevertheless, this cancer is "n't very well subtracting chemotherapie," which is "activing", but does not affect it.
"That's from time to time the sick who lives for a long time," said Tregger.
But finally, they're all dead.
Successfully, some patients live a lot longer than waiting.
Stephen J. Gould died after 20 years after the diagnosis was set.
Two after the diagnosis sentence, Mrs. Abbot continues to fight.
After he suffered the melodical, Abbott met Andrew Lowson, who, four years after the decision of diagnosis, was uniquely converted to the Office of support and consultations for the same sick people.
"Allo, Central Raccount," he said vitally when they called.
"He was very positive," said Abbott.
He made a diagnosis four years ago, and he's still energetic.
At the beginning, Abbott proposed six chemical cycles that would take four months and extend life every month.
"I've been in desperation," he said.
I wanted to go.
But Lowson, however, "I've been angry to bring some more positive area."
In meeting with several specialists, Abbot decided to continue treatment with professor Loic Lanj-Lauzunski, professor of Toraque chirurgia in the Gaya hospital.
"We had the privilege that I didn't need a direction, I just called them, and they took me," recognized Gram.
The Mediterranean patient would have to get the direction and approval for funding.
Days play a decisive role for patients with metotom to get the best of the available types of treatment.
However, when such treatment is finally ineffective, many diseases are still affected by one financial aspect of concern about the future of their families.
And then they go to the court for compensation.
Andrew Lowson joined Andrew Morgan from Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It was aware that the applicant is due to health since 1898," says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it happened that even very small numbers could cause health risks.
It was then discussed about the dismissibility of the company.
Andrew Lowson and the hospital Gaya finally regulated the case, but it was not a "pleasant value" according to Morgan, as Lowson could not only prove that his logism was the result of contact with the person in the Gaya hospital.
After the investigation of his death, the representative of the Gaya hospital confirmed, however, that "a dual locations on which it was spoken was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lowson.
How to Delete Applet
In fact, to connect a common contact to a company or place of work, usually over ten years after that, there was a great problem for patients with a mechanism requiring compensation.
Many of their former workers changed or closed.
The fearful archives could be lost.
And those who are protected from the steel know that there's no time at their side.
In response that year, there were serious new legislative acts that facilitate the hospitals with the mixed compensation process, even if their former employees could not be followed.
In accordance with this law, a 350 million funding fund funded by the insurance industry was established for those who had been set a diagnosis after July 2012 and who could provide contact, but no one to be judged.
In such cases, diseases will receive 80 per cent of the amount that the court would normally condemn the compensation case of approximately 120000.
Over 300 successful figures on this scheme are expected every year.
Andrew Morgan, as many who work with the sick with the melotics, believes that $350 million represents a "related job" for the insurance industry.
"It's a deal written by the insurance carriers," said he, notably, that the amount is four of the fact that the insuranceers should be paid, if it had not been imposed by the timely rental and sickness with the containers would be able to pursue the company and to make a common way.
Even Michael Penning, previous minister of work and pension, recognized that the law was " perfect".
But Penning and Morgan recognize that, when seven persons die every day, rapid action was necessary.
"The people are so strong, and they need help today," said Penning during the second reading of Bill on the merchant in December last year.
At that time, Mr. Abbott was in the hand of professor Luke Lanj-Lawski 19 months.
After the initial consultations of Lanj-Lassounk, he recommended a chirurgic interaction which, otherwise, besides Tom Trager, is an effective view.
Thirdly, the radiotherapie and the chemistry followed, where Lange-Lauzunk may be covered by 40 per cent of patients over five years.
Abbot felt a lot of forces.
"It's, of course, one of the most important things," says Abbot.
You see this in patients all the time.
There is some strength that supports you.
When you're going, the state can be very fast.
Mrs. Abbott reads on the operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he ended the last six cycles of chemicals.
The following scannings did not show and follow diseases.
Then they made me scanning in March [2014].
There's been a few fifth [which] in my cell's cell.
I've got to get 50 times.
It's not a threat of life.
It's the end of life.
And again Abbot went through six chemical cycles.
Now not the follow-up.
However, this process is physical and emotionally difficult.
You can think of practical things, when I die, for example, or what a woman needs to show how a turtle works for battery.
When you get bad news, you're gonna be unforgiving.
I need to look forward.
Like Ellie's father, 16 years old, and Temzin, 14 years old, it's not always easy.
"It's difficult for the parents," he said.
It was a lot to understand what to say.
When the first time I made a diagnosis, I told girls I've got a disease, which means I'm not going to live up to the old.
They reacted very differently.
Theme is very common and energy.
She told all our friends, and we were very fast calling many.
Ellie was more closer.
She didn't say a lot.
Those conversations are something that should be touched by all the diseased cancer.
But such discussions with the metody are not enlarged, even in the trial possibility of surviving.
This sickness has been defined (although, finally, for Steven J. Golld) is a drug definition.
As said Andrew Morgan, "The Empire is not a threat to life.
The body of Pharaoh's embarrassed persons are in particular tissue.
The cuts are used to strengthen the castrel and improve warmness.

China refused to give Hong Kong the right to choose managers; Protestants swear to notice
The Chairman of China decided on Sunday to allow the electoral of Hong Kong to move candidates to the election of 2017, despite the increased requirements of democratic reform.
This movement will, rather than in all, be used to initiate the promised protests in the Hong Kong Business quarter, as the activeists started planning and mobilization at the time after that statement.
The decision of the United Kingdom of Popular Representatives, as a matter, allows the Communist leaders to select all candidates that are not low to Beijin.
"It's not deceived our expectations, but it's still anger," said Emily Law, President of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Pickin promised.
They deceived Hong Kong people.
And clearly we have a case with the authorised mode.
The pursuant decision of China, Li Fay, Vice-Secretary-General of the Permanent Committee of the United Nations Meeting, said that it would allow the natural movement to the election of the leader of Hong Kong to be too chaotic.
Since 1997, when Great Britain had transmitted a review on Hong Kong to China, Peking promised that the people of the region should choose by vote by the head of the Government from 2017.
The Chinese leaders have presented the decision as a democracy step forward, as it gives the prosecutors the right to the right to vote, but also makes it clear that the Chinese leaders continue to hold strongly the process in their hands with the assistance of the candidates' commission to move.
And, according to the new article, only candidates that "love the country and love Hong Kong" will be delivered.
The decision was taken after a year when one of the largest and largest protests had been made in Hong Kong for many years.
For the major part of the democratic campaign in Hong Kong, the Occupy Central With Love and Peace, organisms who have threatened to oversee the financial area of Hong Kong, if Peking does not guarantee the present general electoral rights.
On Tuesday evening, a few hours after the statement, hundreds of the Occupy Central Party were gathered to rain before the Headquarter of the Government of Hong Kong.
The organizations stated that their movement was moved to the new stage of civil innocentity and that they would arise on protests in the next weeks.
Nevertheless, they did not report details, obviously, attempt to avoid issues with public bodies.
In online-declaration, the organizations reported that the movement had been " thinked that the centre area was only as an exclusive measure, which can only be taken if all the possibilities of the dialogue were exposed and no other choice.
We have greatly regretted that all the possibilities of dialogue has been disappeared and covered by the central area will be unfortunately.
The State bodies in Hong Kong were prepared for a few days and the Sunday of the Government's Chamber were strengthened security measures with the adoption of police and barriqued.
In the context of unordinates, many in Hong Kong feel that they have slowly lost control on their own town.
The ingredients of the material are strengthening the competition in goods and services.
The fear is also enhanced that the values of Hong Kong, such as democracy and the freedom of words, starts to be debounded with a growing pressure from Peking.
Some criticize the Occupy Central movement, saying that his demonstrations have been risked by the business source of a living force of Hong Kong.
"The proof of which they say may lead to a large economic damage depending on how long the person will be involved and how long," said the Regimentary Ip, which criticizes the movement for a long time.
We don't want to make concern that Hong Kong is under control.
This is a presentation that is contrary to investments.
The Chinese State MEs also provided reports in the last days in which the Guarantee Assetists of Democratic Movement had been shown by differentiants sent by Western Powers.
In those years, the activeists organized the informal referendum on the electoral law, which brought 780,000 participants to more than one five of the Hong Kong electoral.
And in July, thousands were decade to one of the largest promocratic demonstrations in the history of the region.
The United States Cultural Cultural Life has reached university: the Prime Carriers proposed to reach personal aircraft
We are pleased to respond to this question, led the first trip service in Britain, for the current students.
To leave a clear impression from arrival to university, the company also proposes transport options such as personal aircraft, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stuart also stated that the Servis had thought of security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to take its things through all the country in dangerous cars.
In comparison with our new options for the VIF, we are waiting for how to help students this year to reach the university with the minimum efforts and the maximum rossum.
The representative of the company reported that, as the service was only launched, the orders did not yet, but added that "studors start to pay the service in the next few weeks."
The company also stated that although students needed to pay for the education of £9000 per year, it was hoped to find a market for this service.
The current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectation and hope: more important than ever, to make great first impression, and VIF is what it needs.
Nevertheless, the National Student Union declared this service as a result of reality.
Megan Dann, the Vice-President of the NSS at the higher education, said: " This project is incrediblely affected by most students.
Many students who start university education in this month have focused on the crises of the cost of life when available financial support in the form of credit and grants does not ensure the slight growth costs of basic needs, until they can at all begin to think about the expenditure of thousands of funds for a simple arrival in the community.
Faminists address the question of racial behaviour and police behaviour after Ferguson
Unarmed adolescent was killed by the police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, previously in this month.
Those who are coming lifted up their hands, and they say, "Stand up, don't shoot!" until they look before the tombs.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri related to the murder of the unarmed adolescent Michael Braun, the Blogger Miriam Zola Priss noted the internet conversation between white feminists.
At its experience, the white pheminists left commented have become a gender above racial belonging, when it was undertaken to promoting reproductive rights and non-equality of income.
However, as a role of tension in the Middle East and a national attention had been given, the responses of white women focused on racial belonging to 100 per cent.
As compared to the reaction of black women, shortly after the murder of 9 August, personal communities with such titles, such as Ferguson's thoughts of the face of the white woman, and the Phyminismo is not only about the damage of women.
But for Transs, they demonstrated an important move.
"I don't think there are many people who speak about white hair and privileges at this high level," she said.
People felt a need to say something about what happened.
It's very symbolically for the crisis we met, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so linked to racial behaviour, they felt that it should be indicated.
For the English professor at the University of Ogayo Core Mitchel Ferguson, he discovered the problems of the black Americans every day, but that were not being women ' s cultural problems.
"I can write something funny in Facebook about what's happening with me and my partner, and I'll take 150 lobbys everywhere," says Michelle.
When I write something about how the colors are attacked in their own country, the silence deceives.
"Why are women quite publicly talking about relations, but not about public security?" she asked.
For black women, such as Mitchell, who have studied race, gener and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no diotomy between racial belonging and gener.
From its view, the black women are in the position to clearly divide these problems; they are complicated with a complex reality every day.
While white women are now involved in racial behaviour and gener in the Physician manager, Engeilla Hattery, professor of Women and Gender Research at the University of George Mayson, said that their pre-deployment did.
"In 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men, and the basis of this is almost always the violence of white woman," said Kathry.
She needed a white woman who confirmed the terms to clarify the license.
At the point of view, the break between the white and black women occurred when white sulphurists, for example, Susan B. Ettony studied the situation at the end of the 1800s and saw that the fight for the electoral right would be effective only for one of the groups: women or black.
"They have decided to put all an oxen into the thumb of the voice for women, and the right of the voice for the blacks had to appear later," said the Ettery.
Considering such things, we are clearly presenting why color - women do not trust white women.
We didn't do anything good.
We never helped the black women to protect their husbands and children.
Even after the right of vote in 1920, the white women had been joined to the Association of Southern Women for preventing licensed.
This group occurred almost 40 years after the black women first asked for help, said Michelle.
With the view of Mitchell, the reactions of white pheminists on the problems raised in Ferguson - the act of the police, racial discrimination - reflects the time when the white feminists had been " exploring the problems with which the nipples were conducted in several generations.
"Is it would be great if the assets with [traditional] ideals would be seriously affected to the right to educate the child, how are they regarding the right to contract?", asked Michelle.
The second troubles that Carriere have committed against reproductive rights and access to contracts are now understood what it means.
The well-known white activist of the Gloria Stayne, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brauna, was used to Faisbun and published a clear article of the Guardian Rebekki Carrol Columbia, which needed the white Americans to take more participation in racism issues.
"I hope that women with a second, but likely to understand the danger of the body, and the racial problems that are significantly different in public issues, will be in the head of change," wrote Stan.
Although Stane is handed by a more overwhelming pheminisme, which includes the problems of race belonging to himself, and the gener, its comment on race in America, is still surprised by some.
She said that young men in the United States, particularly the colorful young people, who are more vulnerable than their sisters, said, "Who has hit the feminisme?", she said, "The people that youth men in the United States, especially color-in-law young people, "weak more vulnerable than their sisters," but the remarks of the State on Ferguson are contrary to the criteria that she had previously expressed.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently initiated a small program, my brother, to help the vulnerable black and spanish young people, then the anger of many feminists, including Gloria Stayne.
The police relations with the black community is not the only problem that moves the traditional femminist.
Since the United States border service arrested approximately 63,000 children without coherence to the south-west border in that year, the immigration reform was again on the surface of women at this time.
Andrew Merkado, Vice-Chairman We Belong Together, who mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that it was only to share the history of immigration women.
"They speak themselves for themselves," said Mary.
When the majority of the workers [immigrants] are deleted, women who arrive with them are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"There's history's answer to female organizations," she said.
The Ipsy's sweet house is sold
The photography of the house for sales in Saphtholke was removed by non-mobility agents when there was a large wine reflected in the guest.
The sale of $120000, individual house with one room is on the private road to Ipsych.
The detailed description was a photograph of the guests of the household, which was reflected from the head, stolen in the garden.
Connell's Inmobility Office reported that the dogs on the photo is a homemare of the owner of the household.
"Otherwise, the photograph was placed by error and already removed," reported the representative of the company.
In detailed description of the house, Connells described the former house of meetings as "one individual house with one room."
Although the Agency has removed the photograph from its website, it is still stored in an advertising material.
The sale of the house has been interested in social networks where some asked whether oil was sold together with the house.
The Russian Tennisist, Mary Sharappa, in the fourth round of the US Open Circle, believes that she does not have stability.
According to the sports, she wished to complete the year worthy and to try to go to a new level, transmitted from New York of the OISP.
How do you totally assess your results on the Great School's tourists this year?
Of course, I'm glad I could win for Rolan Harros.
With regard to the three other tours, I had no stability, especially in the end of some mothers.
Now, of course, I'm disappeared.
I couldn't even come to the fourth.
What tasks do you have to do before the end of the season?
Following both of the plague, I have a huge motivation to go to the new level.
I have to work, and I'm gonna do all the possible to end the year.

Playing from Harvey in this month.
A new million southwester from Perth, where a happy one takes the home at almost $1.1 million from the winter playing on the sud-west of the evening.
The Gazette oxyk in Harvie offers gold for the second time in the past five years of the past game $1 million in November 2009.
However, a pleasant gain must still be declared.
The Lavka owner, Steve Forward, said that the player led the aviation in a small city to the southwest of Pert.
The whole city speaks about this, and it's very excited.
We thought that such a game could be secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia have disappeared the primary gap in the past month, noting the completion of several weeks of the State player.

Mine-Competition wants to accelerate the growth of the electricity market
At this week, the Mine-Economic Development will introduce a comprehensive environmental clean transport plan to the Government in Russia, reporting the Director of the Department of Auditors on the round table, which had held "Woodness" in Moscow-Osloon 2014.
The plan is established by the Government, one of the main objectives of the reduction of port gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted at the end of September to begin October, said the suppliers, proposed electrical and hybrids, which are already present in Russia.
The plan (copy is in the Budgets) calculated for 2014-2017 gg.
The criteria for electric and hybrid transport should be developed and decided to stimulate the use and production of environmental clean vehicles.
The report to the Government in which the logic and customary support measures will be described to December 2014; the plan of the low-country and milk liquidation scheme will appear until April 2015; and the proposals for the reduction of the vehicles, the stimulation of the localization and the creation of a self-infrastructuur will be developed until October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it should be changed in regulatory and legal acts to facilitate the conditions for construction of furniture infrastructure (in parks, auto-related stations and others).
Furthermore, federal officers intend to formulate for regional authorities to stimulate the use of environmental clean transport, in the form of delivery of benefits in movement and park; for example, February 2016, and proposals for enhancing the hosts of such transport.
Finally, the Mine-Economic Development has already been reported to October 2014 into a list of indicators of evaluation of the regional bodies of criteria that reflect the effective support of the production of clean transport, the development of the burden infrastructure.
The electricity rate in Russia has only been formed - in 2013, selling some 100 electro-obligators in the country.
At the beginning of 2014, the import journey was made to the electrical, therefore sellings were about 500 points, the principal executive director of Mitsubishi Motors in Russia of Aar Panks.
However, the five-year growth does not make e-mails a few notices: in Russia, according to the Association of Europe's business, sold 2.78 million easy and easy commercial cars.
Only Mitsubishi Motors are imported until Russia.
The first time Renault is prepared to begin corporate clients, says the Strategic Planning and Renault Partnership in Russia of Nicola Remiz.

Nobody said that mydy would be better, I didn't promise you, it's a new Palm browser.
It is formal to recognize that it is true, but the mind and the desire remains unprecedented.
We're talking to Belargie, we're talking about the moments, we're talking about "Midies" - we understand "Belgia".
Repositors are deeply delighting that the success of the job depends on three factors: this is the location, location and again the location.
There's such places that are not good, even fine, but something unfortunate.
King, standing on the Palm table, I remembered that there was somebody coffee here (in honor of the same television), then Odess-mama, and still the restaurant "Godle" and the drinking "Drobb".
Now, it's again drunk, but no-so-subsis, but the Belgian.
Over the earth, only the top of the isberg: a bar stage and a pair of columns, the rest of the space was even disappeared in the sun.
It's glad here, like in the child room: red, white and green walls, different slides, instead of the window of televisions where girls flood.
Belarus charges in Peterburg haven't been in a newspaper, so it's a comparison.
Here are eight species of different drink (260-300 rubbers for 0.5 l) and the innumerable multiplicity of the bulletin (170-1550 rubles).
The Communist-Positional Officer has a pleasure presentation of the menu, reporting that the "midys - the grand families" and should be noted: the Servis, despite the individual disasters, is the most positive side of Palm.
We are waiting for the containing, but it is very unexpected.
For example, those who have been advised, for example, have been advised that the local rock with the Vallonic black (280 rubles) is actually carpacked to the same deep, that the primary paper in comparison with the mother is incredible.
I feel like some stuff it can be just if you're smoothing together.
The case with the Sales is worse.
The classic league (260) would be recognized by the crime against the Belgian people: a huge isberg which has ever been disappeared by a long card that has spread the Kynaval Fasul, unrealised chips from the beach, more than a season gun.
You don't want to meet anybody with such a leather's saal!
The establishment of the belgian salt was partly another, but the impression was not also different.
If in the unsearching quarters of locks or smoking smokes could still be closed, why the mydy look like as if their life had a few times been smoking and disappearing!
I know, there's all the normal white-modes here!
They're drawn up in the "subs to your selection" (490-560 rubbers for 0.5 km).
Alongside the south, the one who was white wine, farmer and marriage has not been discovered.
It's eating, and the aeromatics haven't been, if there was wine, so there was a secret.
The good ones of the Frist and the Major Majors are at home.
It's a cushion beverage here, not the shock, and it's so much that you can decide, the first or the second scene before you, just a pretty nice spot.
It was stated that the kitchen of the local pump was prepared in a drunken sugar, and nothing was spoken of the dismant.
The situation was diametricly opposed to the situation: the diameter has deployed everything.
The impression was that the film in life had been cut off exclusively dismanted, because the meat had a so-called aircraft.
But at that time, the bucket was added a wonderful -- no, just a negative gun in the crochet corner.
Baths in Palm are proposed not only sweet, but also seeds with hover, smoke or bicony and symbour (220-280).
The Clin Suss has been outer waterists, and the waffles were hidden.
But the manager was very informally interested by daily impressions.
So we need to come again.
The euros of the USM has risen up above 37 rubbers for new sanctions prepared for Russia.
It's a new historical record.
"Tomorrow" to 10:29 mk rose at 26.9 copies and was 37.02 rubber, euro currency was up to 30 copies - to 48.73 rubbers, show data of the Moscow cell.
The bivalet core rose at 28 copies to the level of the previous closure and was 42.28 rubbers.

At the night, on August 29, the White House reported that the President of the United States Bakak Obama and the Concerter of Germany had discussed the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.
The road elimination is long-term, and in the couple of euros, and in the pair with the dollar.
The long-term prognosis presented this note, says the elderly Alpery's Anna Bodrova.
What is related to Ukraine or otherwise will be reflected in courses.
As long as it continues, the investors will react.
Today, the hearings of the military investigation have not been confirmed by any side, but the market was very emotional.
All conversations of the fact that he was sustainable to such news were disrupted yesterday.
The week, on the provision of the specialist, is closed at $36.90 and 37.05.
The overall period ended, the prices of weaknesses, policies, sanctions, the problem of the gas through the Ukraine, all of these are on one street.
The inflation spread is also pronounced: the current prices per cent are increased from 5 to 10 per cent.
Soon, the seasonal fruits and fruits are completed, and there is no wakuum until the network is transferred to other providers.
"Dallar came to the note in 37 rubbers, passed back and returned back, no powerful isterics, - comments the Chief of the Market Analysis Open Broker's Constantine Bushov.
They will still look at whether the promised sanctions will be entered on the Sabbath, as NATO will be settled.
Robbl, in his words, was a smoke after the end of the logic season, then the news to Ukraine, and the CBB for the past week stated that to the end of the year it was completely moved to the flooding course and rejected from any valued interviews.
If you look at a daily collection, it was nothing different from the previous month, all feared 37 rubbers, continued analytics.
Yeah, there was nothing to be done in the plan of defence.
The worse time for the currency was recalled when the overall demand was noted at the end of January, and the third March when the CBC was recurred.
In the UFS IC, it is a positive part of the rock relaxation.
First of all, it is a growth of the revenue budget from export operations and an increase in competitive competitiveness of domestic producers through import heating, says the main analysis of UFS IC Alex Koslov.
The travel of import goods and services may be reduced at a negative moment.
The Russian collections have significantly reduced investment in the Russian economy, increased inflation pressure and, as a result, causes the health of money decrease, which, in its terms, affects the growth of the country's economy.
If it speaks of the market of actions, the road deterioration of a few roads declines the decline of the prices to the action expressed in the rocks.
For example, the MMB index has declined to 1.67 per cent, and the RTS index lost 3,27 per cent.
The significant difference in relative density of the index is explained by the decrease of rubber during the day more than 1.5 per cent.
The elimination of the wheel is emotional and is explained by the massive intention of buy the bullet.
The practice shows that the gradually emotions are not, and the cotture of the rubber partly or fully restore lost positions.
"We believe we can soon see the comparison of $36, 36 rubbers for $" - notes Alex Koslov.
Genetic violation is often wrong dignity

Rogers said that when she was 13 after a few operations to release the hail and leaving the pockets, she looked at the medical card when her doctor went out of the room, and there was written that she had AF.
"I felt guilty because it was a nest where it should not be, and so I didn't tell no one, but I came home, I found information about this state in the library and wrote to the AF Association," she said.
When I received information in response, I was troubled and tried to the worst pair that could only be able.
I thought I was going to be in the 18-year-old clothes and I'll die before I'm gonna be 25, and I'm gradually losing all my ability in this area.
I went through this one, and I planned my own bulls.
She said that until 17 she had been completed, she understood that her ability to walk wasn't hurt as much as she thought, and she asked her doctor about it.
He just rose up, took me up and said, "My dear, I don't think you have this sickness, because you would have already been in a disabilities."
I think you have something that represents a very little threat to life.
After several genetic surveys, the SMT was found.
"When he explained what's the SMT, I thought it had been a happy ticket," she said.
The welcome SMET organisation announced a month of information on SME to try to take attention to that disease.
The logic burden of the Washington Zone has grown as recovery of the economy
The restored economy means more clients, more sales and new workplaces.
This also means higher burdens.
The cost of the State and local campaigns for companies throughout the country has been deadly increased in the past year when the recovery of the economy has been accelerated according to the new research issued last week, and the company in Washington Zone was not excluded.
The communications in the area, Maryland and Virginia have been paid to $27,6 billion in the terms and at the local financial level in 2013, 3,8 per cent of more than $26.6 billion in 2012.
In the past year, the cost of State and local business has increased by 4,3 per cent, to $671 billion, compared to $3.9 per cent, and the third underlying year after each other, in 2009 and 2010.
The insufficient state was increased faster, 4.3 per cent than local loans, 3.9 per cent, according to the research of a professional services, Ernst & Young and the State Delivery Centre, the Local Policy Group.
More than half of the income in the environment, the 56 per cent of the enterprises are lower, while the 36 per cent of the income of Maryland is in firms.
Furniture, with 28 per cent, provides at least the lowest income, proportionally, from undertakings.
In addition to three years, the cost of the company's incertainability has continued to rise, researchers said that incertainability has increased 3,7 per cent in this year after growth was less than 1 per cent.
While the larger share of these income is in greater states, such as California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same is happening in Washington Zone.
The communications in the area, Maryland and Virginia have increased $10 billion for non-mobility in the past year, at $9.6 million more than in 2012, with 4,2 per cent compared to the previous year.
However, the recurrence of non-mobility value has no similar effect on the growth of the state and at the local level in Mauritius, where non-mobility boundaries exceed one of the fifth payment accounts.
Virginia and Colombia have paid approximately half of the State and locally in the form of non-mobility benchmarks.
"What happens in Maryland is that the greater part of their non-mobility, particularly the base around the Occurg Columbia, belongs to a Government or a non-Competitive organization that don't pay unmount taxes," said Dull Lindholm, executive Director of the State Defence Centre.
So, Maryland is much more needed, for example, to pay the same service in other states.
The recent growth of the income from undertakings cannot be completely explained to the recovery of the market of non-mobileness.
The enterprises also appear to be amended according to this.
The computers in the region declared a corporative undertaking level of $2.3 billion, at $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland has collected $1 billion corporative benefits in the underlying neighbourhood, mostly in the region.
Although trends are directed in one direction, the local enterprises' burden has not increased with the same speed in all three places.
The growth level in Ocrugua Colombia was at the same level that the average country was 4,3 per cent, while the growth in Mauritania was significantly fast, 4,9 per cent.
Only, Virginia had observed the allocation of loans below the average, 4.1 per cent.
In Virginia, the lower corporate soil of three jurisdictions (in each of which the single corporate allocation) was 6 per cent.
In Mauritius, the corporative allocation is 8.25 per cent, while in the area it is relative to 9.975 per cent.
The research of the United States Palestinians previously showed that Virginia's underlyings for undertakings under the State and local level and, in general, a pleasant climate in respect of the taxes for enterprises than in Maryland.
The environment has not been evaluated in this study.
Despite its privileges, Virginia tested the competitive pressure from its neighbour from south.
The North Korean has recently signed a legislative act that reduces corporative rates from 6.9 per cent to 6 per cent, as well as in Virginia, and the allocation was 5 per cent in the next year.
If the State continues to achieve logging objectives in the next year, this law could provide the cost of the tax for businessers even to 3 per cent of 2017.
At the same time, a small business in Washington zone is likely to feel better and therefore pay more income at the State and local level, according to recent research.
A transitional structure in which the majority of small firms in Columbia, Mauritide and Virginia have increased 20 per cent in the past year to $2.4 billion, with a greater growth speed than the portals in general.
Researchers said that the trends and increased wages for business over the whole country are more than in that year, in the steadfast of trafficking in state and local levels of 6.2 per cent of the first three quarters in 2014 compared to the same period of the past year.
However, the Washington Zone may remain, since the decrease of federal expenditure is on the market of work in the region.
Russian Deputy - Eighth
The home of the world pursuant to the dreams of Russia offered two silver and seven brown rewards.
As a result, Russians were only the main factory of the Japan collection.
Turkey in Chelibinsk began on Sunday, and the first day the Russian team brought a silver meal.
Its owner became Beslan Mudron, who was in Category to 60 kg.
In the same end of combating the Boldbatar Ghanbatat from Mongolia, the rest of a comment received by the Russian.
And this is the second day the tour became the most successful for the Russian collection -- that three medles were now revealed.
In managing categories to 66 kilometres of silver, Michael Pulaev and Bronza Camula Han-Magamadiu.
In the final pound of the Russians, the Chypreon of the world 2011 and 2013, the Japon of Massy Ebinam.
Han-Magomedi, at the fourth stage of a player who had lost the co-sponsor, gained a comfortable tour and became a bourgeois owner.
In the Category to 52 kilometres even to the third stage of the Pédetal poster, Natal Kuzazin.
In the popyle, she had lost the active cheps of the world, Michael Kelmandy from Kosovo, who had been speaking under the flago of the International Federation of Dzdo and had successfully protected the title.
In the controversy of the Kuzabenin's breasts, Ma Ann from China, but after the end of the tour, he recognized that the third place was not exactly what she had calculated.
And again the privilege of the Russian road to the gold became Kelmendy, the earlier Cuban's kipinel of Europe.
On the third day, the tour in Chelibink Burnsk in the collection copy of Russia placed Mus Mouscheks in the category to 73 kilometres.
In its fourth part, he became the former representative of Moldova Victor Scorns who now speaks for the OA Team.
However, the russian gained two complaints and became the owner of the reward.
The moods were speaking at the home cheps of the colony, which he planned to take on the nearest time, so he would take the pouze in the smoke.
With regard to the ex-Muldannian Swords, he and the Turkey arrived in the brown meal.
It is interested that the other composer who took the OAE sport nationality, Ivan Remansco with a browser has completed the statement to the category to 100 kg.
On the fourth day, the Russians also offered a brown to 81 kilometres in the category.
In the hard fight of a small female, he settled French Alana Shimitt.
In Friday, three skills were thrown up, but Russians have limited one browser to a man’s tournament to 90 kg.
Her owner, Kiril, was questioned, while the collection of Russia was guaranteed: his comfortable partner was a composer of Kiril Denis.
However, it was not the most appeal: The questionnaire couldn't come to the damage from the grain.
The male bulb was renewed by the hosts and on the sixth day of the sponsorship - she was in the collection copy of Renath Said, which argued over 100 kilometres.
In the comfortable football, he had a pure gain on the Brazilian David Moor.
This has been the individual part of the world's primacy.
The last day of the tour in Chalibinsk, on Sunday, was designed by the calls of the world in commands of warnings.
Both Russian collections and male women were one of the main claims for the benefit, but, as in individual provisions, the representatives of the gentle sex did not succeed to the medal.
And this is the Russian Dussodoists got a command money.
In the decision-making state, they have joined the main features of the Japan ' s team.
At that time, the Russian collection was 2-0 after the clean winner of Han-Magomedova and Law Daniels Yarzeva (to 73 kg).
However, in harder pregnancy categories with their Japanese fellows were not able to conduct Murat Haviiyers (81), Magomed Magomed (90) and Aslan Kambie (100).
The scenario has also developed a bunch of female tower, where the Russian collection, conducting 2-0, took place to Japan 2-3.
In the commands of Chelibinsk, President of Russia Armymond Puntin, who welcomed the male collection with a silver after the end of the tour.
"The second place is very clear, but I mean it was shown that you could be a kitchen," said Puntin, the word which brings the RIA "News".
Play the Japanese, the grandfather of the drove is nothing here.
But I'm sure you can have them and play them.
The collection of Russia on the home of the world has made a lot better than a year ago at such a level passed by Rio de Janeiro.
Then the Russian team was only three meals, one silver and two bulbs.
The current tours have been lost the olympic Chepens of Arsen Galstian and Mansur Isab.
We're all, of course, great maximums.
Yeah, you want gold meals.
But let's remember that if a person in the olympic cycle is eight-way stronger, it's the potential Olympiade winner.
More in the form of sports than the duke, the tourist RF Vitaly Mutco, made the word the Press Service of Chepenion.
The collection of Japan was expected to become better in Chelibinsk, which was 11 meal of different dignity, five of which were made gold.
The next peak of the world will take place in the future year in Astán.
To meet other materials, news and statistics on the page of a age of sports.
Joan Riverz family hopes the best
Joan Riverz is without aware of the arrival to the hospital in New York three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-year-old stakeholder has been disappeared from sickness.
"Thank you for your permanent love and support," said Meliss Riverz in a statement today.
We hope the best.
Her mother came to the Maunt Sinay hospital in Thursday after the extinct call that her heart stopped at the top City, Yorkville Endoscope, reporting sources.
The teachers are intended to hold it under drugs and under close monitoring until they are not satisfied with the state that remains "fair."
The answer was wide, including numerous web support from such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Kings will be able.
In the sale of a delicate album group of Royal Blood, the new hope of the British Royal Year, which has brought out of the clubs directly on the stadium.
Royal Blood's duty all year at the scene, but it already has an active nomination to the BBC musical premium, a disagreement tour to Arctic Monkeys and will visit the New York Concert from the Jim Peege.
Their delicate album has received 100 tickets before the religion, and the contract on its exit is located in the portfolio of the Major-Label Warner Music.
In view of the current weeping situation on the musical market, the situation from a number of outcoming outside is not a new Lane Del Rey or a regular vote, the new R'nB, and the drugs of the Britain playing the highest level and intensity that was the last time in the mode of a couple of ten years ago.
In general, the trading to the first album in connection with all the above-mentioned circumstances was particularly high and have been completely justified.
The duke did not have a bad name on which it was possible to swear that the entirely disappeared hair metallics, and the blood of the kings, as they seem to have in their homes, is also understood.
This is, of course, mostly about the heroes of the past level Led Zeppellin: as the great quarter, Royal Blood is about to strive the standing blood of the British Royal and bring it to a new height.
Provision is about the success of this business, unfortunately, but something to say it is possible.
The thirty-seven thresholds of little minutes are not so much the demonstration of the phonomic gift of the composer, how much the confidence and powerful declaration of the intentions.
Some dignities of individual numbers are understood, not able to refuse: we say, the pill synthetic "Out Of The Black" is characterised by the memory of non-millar line, but by the batterian party.
The musicians say that this song is really easier to hurt than drink.
The "Little Monster" might also be able to select the powerful "Little Monster" and the closure of the "Better Strangers" composition from the sexy quota in the board.
However, it is true that each song of these songs will be a good sound at the festival of the lovers of a hard year, but when they are playing, they will fall into more or less one-year-old tax.
And this isn't really bad, even shot.
The Royal Blood is that they don't claim new Lanon and McKartni's labs, but have brought many rocks out of the hotel Indian clothes.
Their music, despite some diversity, was created for stadions, in a location calculated less than a couple of thousands of people, is clearly close.
The White Stripes is part of the chief use of the bath, replaced by the hydrauter in the usual format, which is in the start of the Negative The White Stripes.
Nevertheless, the case is not only in tools but also in the same approach to the concealing of the song.
The heroes were elected by the postmodernist paradigma, with a huge disappearance course to recognize themselves not just epigones but self - creative unions.
The Royal Blod is now sounding so strong and that this attitude is successfully druging some secondary and solidity of music material.
Well, at the end, who said that the rock should be wise?
Amazon buys Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed that he reported information on Tuesday: Online-Partz and Video Producers, and another hundreds of other materials bought the Twitch video performance service for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
This news was surprised not because nobody waited for Twitch will be sold but because many expected to be a buyer of YouTube.
Three months ago, the Twitch Videoserver of Google for a good billion looked fully ready, and such a comparison seemed natural.
Twitch, based on a whole three years ago as Justin.tv, has made the aim to be a flood of the general character -- the YouTube version in real time.
Instead, he quickly turned a platform, where the genmers had transferred their inside play moments; "You to play in real time," according to Business Insider.
Twitch interface.
And the "let's play", the genre of videos, which are totally famous (in general, old) of processing graphics, such as the National Theater, are already popular at YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when the Twitch described, so the news that Youtube has received Twitch was met without special interest, the classic example of the technological company that is equipped with a potential competition.
This is a secret why the discussion with Youtube was overcome, taking into account that, according to the information, he was ready to pay less than Amazon.
All that we have at this moment is a statement from the executive Director of Twitch Emma Shira: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they divide our values and long-term objectives, and they want to help us to reach them faster."
Another secret, honestly, is an unbelievable success of Twitch.
It's so much that I'm telling that it's better to do a sport than to look at it, it's hard to understand the attractiveness to look at the game instead of taking myself into the joist hands.
One thing is to look through a plot of a friend at 3:00 when she's prolonged through the Resident Evil, and it's the other -- see how some legal person gets 20 flags in the head of Call of Duty.
All the games you could look right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular plays today are calculated for one person, so looking on their ground, without supervising the self-control, may be the receipt of the main pain that is worth Do It right.
I agree that the rapid births in which Rogery Bansters of our electronic world are completed all games in recurrent times.
But if it's not about the virtuous game or the humor, it's little sure his Twitch channel will be interesting.
But what do the sceptes know like me?
Twitch has 55 million visitors per month, and this is the fourth source of the physical internet trafic.
How do Amazon do it do?
It's hard to imagine that Twitch's turning to Amazon Instant Video as you can just kick the Twitch.
However, Twitch would enjoy any company: young men who dreamed advertisers.
As said Chapter Twitch Sheir, Amazon and Twitch, "There believe in the future game," and this canal does not give signs for advertising, even e - as a huge kind of sport.
Consequently, more than 330 people died in 2004, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were killed.
We've been in Bessana for a few days.
We have talked to the survivors -- almost all students, with the dead parents, with the angels City - Ramon Caspoulat, head of the "Mathie Bessana" of the Susan Duke, who took part in the MSP office, tells the Corporate of the Employment Division Elizabeth Antono, who worked on the project.
As they returned to Moscow, they met Elasabik Alachán, who had been adviser for the President of the North Caucast and negotiated the terrorists as well as the Officer of the FBF of Russia by Viehlord.
That's what I've been particularly surprised for this topic's work is that in Beslan as if there were no decades.
This theme is extremely sick for all who have any relationship with her, people with difficulty agree to talk about what happened.
Return impressions are very hard.
But we can't forget Beslan, and I hope we've done with our tasks," said Antona.
The project is prepared by the Challenge Rambler & Co, which is working in the company since the spring of this year.
The previous projects were dedicated to the First World War and the 15-year residence of the Army Putin authority.
The CNUDD has implemented the launch of a small railway
The North Korean launched a small railway in the Japon Sea acquator, reporting "Renhap".
It was launched approximately 10:30 a.m. from the province of Chagando situated on the border of North Korea and China.
The Ratio fell in the Japanese Sea, a 220 km flood, made a statement to the Joint Committee of Heads of South Korea.
Deputys proposed to accelerate the entry into force of the Personal Data Law
In the event of successful initiative, the data of the Russians will not be stored on servers from 1 January 2015
In Hosдум, the draft law, which provides the transmission of the date of entry into force of the law on the personal data of Russia from 1 September 2016 to 1 January 2015.
The initiative is placed in the basis of the legislation of the Palestine below.
Its authors were deputates by the Hospital Dayin, Iroewal Niols (LDD), the Federal Evasions ("One Russia"), the Army of Parhain, and Alexander Juezko (CDP).
Such change, on view of initiative authors, will contribute to more operational and effective rights of citizens of RF to maintain personal data and to keep the secret list of information and communication networks.
The law, entering into force by the parliamentary, is obligated to keep the personal data of the Russians processed through the Internet.
It also makes obligatory accounts, systemization, stocking, stocking, clearing and expansion of the personal data of RF citizens in the Russian territory, as well as information on the location of such databases.
Furthermore, the law hopes that the Russian Surveillance is the right based on the decision of the Court to limit access to information processed by violation of the RF personal data legislation.
The law also proposes the creation of such "which lists" sites, a automaticly automatised information system of the Office of Personal Data Rights.
The law was adopted by the Hospital Year.
The draft law authors were submitted by the authors of the Legislative of Lugo and Wodam Day of LDD and Alexander Juezk from the CRF.
The Day and Yugoslavia are also one of the authors of the current draft law on the transfer of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
The data of the FF data should be paid for the apartment.
The commentary made today in the Hosдум's first draft law for the Opinion Committee on Information Policy, Leonyd Levin stated that he had not seen the problems to move the date into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
According to his words, the company that will not have their own personal data in the RF territory will be able to restore them, for example, "in "Rustleco", which was unrepaidly said that they were ready to provide their servers to the apartment and already provide their servers at Mail Group, in Western companies that are now provided to their servers."
"Therefore there are a few independent data centres prepared to cooperate in this area," he added.
"If the company has decided to do the law and continue to work on the RF territory, I don't see the problems -- they will receive technical opportunities for location," said Levin.
Consumer legislation
At the same time after the publication of the draft law of the Russian electronic communications, the Russian Association was concerned that, in the case of the adoption of the legislation, the Russians would not be able to benefit from many global servers.
In particular, it is about aircraft and aircraft services.
As a view of the Association, “the draft law leaves personal data actors - the citizens of the Russian Federation's right to be distributed by their own in operational data that their accounts, systemization and etc should be provided only in the databases set out in the Russian Federation”.
The GREC statement stressed that more effective measures would be to create a user information mechanism where the record is carried out, to systematize its personal data.
In that case, you can choose what territory the actions will be made.
In addition, the adoption of such projects on "lockization" personal data in other countries has resulted in the income of global services and significant economic losses.
The part of the testing road of the iron water exposed hotness
Isabel Roberts from Britain cried so when she had thrown a milk water on her head, which had disappeared the coat structure of the person.
This test of the iron water hasn't come to pain.
Women was hospitalized after she cried so in the testing of the milk water that drew the honor.
Isabel Roberts cried so ridiculous when she had thrown out a milk water that had disastered the structure of the face.
"It was so cold that I cried, but when I did it, my honor was starting to swear," she said The Mirror.
The water is 20-year-old.
Isabel Roberts for seconds before the unfortunate connection
I tried to close the mouth, but he didn't close, he was stolen, and then I got understanding that something is wrong.
Then my mother and sister had the same understanding and they were starting to desire, but I had to take urgently to the office of an urgent assistance.

The soldiers delivered the Ukrainian military over 400 captive
In the New Stress Army, the Ukrainian Soviet 27 claims that the oppressor had violated the agreement of the cease of fire
The volcanoes at 10:00. 1 September were transferred to the Ukrainian side 402 prisoners, 72 of which were wounded and 35 soldiers died.
This reported the Interfax Representative of the Premier Office of New York.
He added the fact that "at the UNHCR forces in the Mitchy population area, the Su-27 aircraft which violated the cease cease agreement."
According to the contact of the Agency, the Ukrainian stakeholder of the Law Airport adopted by the prohibited international cosmetic batteries Conventions.
The representative of the pre-service noted that the complaints in the night could affect two U.S. paids on one of the field airports and destroy two browserports and two composed of ware.
" The loss in the living force of the adversary - to a hundred people killed and wounded 13 persons were in captivity," said the representative.
The Interfax does not have the confirmation of this information from the Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed “National Republics” of Donbass claimed the transfer of the Ukraine party to comply with the ceasure regime of 223 prisoners and soldiers of the Ukrainian National Guardia.
At the same time, the DNA Army stated in the Newrossian Army, “the attempt of the Nazidians to violate the previously achieved agreements to bring a hard technology out of the environment.”
Then the volcanoes reported the destruction of two tanks and two ICPs, cut six tanks and 198 military disarmament.
According to this chapter, the general loss of the adversary on all directions (Dann, Lugan, Maripool) made five tanks, eight-browned cars, more than 120 people killed and killed.
At the end of the past week, the large group of the Ukrainen military military was in the area of the Ilovakia area.
The President of Russia Armymond Putin requested the manager of the "National Republics" to extract Ukrainen military officers from the environment.
The DNA agreed to take it in terms of ensuring weapons and armed wars.
The first tens of military officials began to leave the environments on the Sabbath on the morning.
According to the Commander of the Ukrainian territorial defence of Dunbos, Senam Seminchenco, on summer 14 people came out from the "Cat" night.
In his Federation, Seminchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounds are "in full of 137 p.m. 32 RF and 9 tanks of RF" where they are well addressed.
Inter alia, IID and the Russians announced the reports of the Ukrainen military and NATO on the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
IAD RF: Russia will take response measures in the case of introducing new sanctions of the EU
Russia has the right to take response measures aimed at protecting their legal interests in the introduction of new anti-ross sanctions, reported IRF.
The report of the Russian external diplomatic state state said that the European Council of 30 August demonstrated the inability of Member States of the EU to continue the integration of the integrated support of the Kypro authorities.
Brussels continued to stress that Russia is part of the situation in the East of Ukraine, with the " absolutely unprofitable approval of the presence of Russian armed forces in the territory of this country," says the state.
IAD RF regrets that Europe, in contrast to the interests of their Member States, is affected by countries concerned in enhance the conflict with Russia.
Members of Europe should call for a peaceful settlement of conflict at the East of Ukraine, as well as to ensure the full "display between opposite parties", the state.
It also notes that there is no objective humanitarian assessment of the situation in Donbass, where the full humanitarian catastrophe has been disrupted, as well as the number of victims in peace.
Remember that the next seventh anniversaries in the European Union is planned to develop specific proposals on sanctions against RF.
The EU representatives are closely cooperating with American officials.
It is proposed that they will correct intravenant measures for the period of action and mode of cruelness.
The new sanctions of Europe may affect energy and financial sectors.
The Australian Government also announced enlargement of sanctions on Russian ' s defence, financial and non-Fetate industry.
Heavy ways for university training
The cost of university students for many students exceed $1,000 per year, Matt Sherider, who will soon overcome the second course, has made achieving way to reduce expenditure.
He developed a system of how to take a book of projects in the senior officers, proposing a nominal compensation for them to reimburse their sales.
"My Mathematic Analysis, which usually costs $180, I got a seminar for $10 and the "Chick-fil-A", says Sherider, 19-year-old in Georgia.
The needed literature for the past seminar would cost $430, he says.
He's lost $120.
According to the Council of the colleagues, the average student will pay more than $1200 per year for training and training, but students have a number of options for reducing these costs.
The students are often electing the Internet Training and creative ideas such as Sherider systems.
The books are still more popular, allowing students to use books during the seminar, and often are significantly decade than their buyer.
The Nebo Incorporyid company, which belongs to more than 250 university books, reports that the percate books increased two times since 2011.
Research shows that approximately four books in university books during the past marriage seminar have been brought a procucutor, see the Nibo President, Trevor Mayer.
More than half of all books are acquired in university books, according to the "National Association of University stores".
This is the introduction course in the best ways to make an advantageful debate.
Account in Internet Training
Sometimes, if you go to the Internet, the price of the new book may put one third from what you see in a university book store.
The nine exhibition of the Mathematical Analysis of Ron Larson, Brisa Edwards and Robert Hostketler is $290, but a new exhibition can be acquired for $239,99,99 on the Chegg.com website, which is specialised at the sale of books.
Building of the detention
If you're not against foreign notes or disasters, the manuscriptors are a good option.
"Mathematic analysis" is sold for $93.49 in the maintenance of Chegg.com.
Matt Caseda, 25 years old student from Brigame Yang University, says that he paid for Amazon.com 42 cost for the manual booking Experience "Strategic decisions in the Medium: understanding the business of the advertising business."
The book was sold for $48 new.
The students, for example, Ingryd Brisey, director "Claud without wall" at the University of Massachusets in Hamherst, proposed students to abstain their professors, whether it is not possible to use previous publications.
Sometimes updates are insufficient for employment.
In such cases, old publications are often found for the very small value of the last publication.
Besides Chegg and Amazon sites, Half.com, who belongs to "eBay Inc"., is a popular alternative for buying books.
Protocol
You should think if you're gonna be good with them, don't forget back and don't want to leave them after the course is complete.
You can connect more than 80% of the value of the new book.
For example, one student could take the Mathematical Analysis project for $20.
Find the rules of the store where you take books, including any steps that can write to you in the notes, emphasis and disappearance.
If you take a book on a prototype, remember that if you don't return the book, triffs may even exceed the value of the new example.
Electronic Books
Electronic books instead of traditional books are another option.
Sometimes such own books are collected by e-mail license for a certain period in the distributors, for example, Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The Mathematical Analysis Protocol on the Chegg.com website for six months is about $61.
Bricy says that students who study literature often can find the most benefits, since many classic statements can now be free, while literature on natural and engineering sciences may be very dear.
Despite nothing, look at it.
Jo Golt, 29 years old, which is going to start school in the Legal School of Pepperdin, recommends to be used by the ISBN number to explain prices on the book, as it ensures that you are looking for the exactly necessary text.
Before doing orders in the Internet, he says, you need to check whether the book is actually on the composition.
It was not easy to give him this lection.
The addendum of the book that he obtained was lodged for four weeks and finally paid the full price in the University Book store.
The Pentiny declared the full inefficiency of the Developing East fund
The Chairman of Russia, Virgin Puntin, held a meeting on the country ' s priorities of investment projects and territories in the eastern East, reported that the Developing Investment Industry created two years ago, Neeffectiven, Interfax.
"15 billion rocks so and remained lay on depositories," said the President.
During the meeting of the Chapter of the State, he urged the approval of the list of the territory of divorced development in Darm East.
He recalled that the draft law required to establish the TRs should be exacerbated to the Hospital of the August.
The Federal Meeting noted the Chairman, until 1 July, and did not approve the list of the territory of divorced development in Darm East, and their criteria.
The Potterin Army also has established the main tasks for the development of the Developing East.
In the middle of them, enhance the availability of the region, removal of infrastructure restrictions, both on the internal market and for export development.
Nevertheless, there is a need to create references to accession to the region of additional investments, as well as to establish a territory of disappearing development that should be competitive with regard to key business centres, the President emphasized.
Remember, previously, it was reported that the territory of disastered development could replace OEC.
Why "Galactics Delivery" couldn't save cass collections.
Sylvester Stalone returned less than $30 million from its $90 million in the United States, while "The Lord of sins: the woman for whom it is to be killed" returned only $12 million from its $70 million.
"Home video" from Cameron Diaz was only $14.6 million in the first outcome, while children's films, such as "Come make Dragon 2" are also deployed.
The article on the Telegraphy Robby Collin shows that when child films are talking about, the case may be bad as the same films.
Collin called the "style" year 2014 in the entire history of the child films, and called "Come to lead Dragon 2" to the "functional" duration of the finance.
However, when the films governed to hearing a few more older age, it seems that the problem does not need to be the same films.
In July Entertainment Weekly compared the average series of CineaScore and Metacritic of each film above the year, at least 2000 copies between the Memory Day in May and 20 July 2013 and this year.
The results that take into account the views of the film and the film crystals are allowed to imagine that the films of this year are similar to the calibration with past-year-old heats.
Some commentaries consider that the case may be changed in the changed greenhouse aspects and increased popularity of flood Internet servers, such as Netflix.
Register John Fawro, who now works on the prototype of the disputy film, said the website of Hollywood Reporter, "I think time is changed."
We should recognize it and not try to worry about what was before.
The netflix income from the flood reproduction service has reached $1.2 billion, almost twice exceeded the past number of $837 million.
The past year, the Register Steven Spieberg explained the studies that they're too trusted on the Comics Francis, and proposed the "Free" Hollywood.

The "Ladies H" Symon Kinberg recently called the fall of the Cass collections just "ciclinic," Hollywood Reporter said: "The winter will be the most cassive year in history, and no one will survive it."

And generally, it is preferable to allow for prohibited imports from Russia, as well as from Latin America, Israel and China.
"The best is a littleer than a bad Mossel," a shot of the Italian restaurant Barlotti Marianano Valleyo's quality of the shirts, which offers providers to replace Italians.

For a couple of months, a parish must have been missing.
What are you doing?
Go to Russian?
In 2005, I was on the Peamond Market.
Mariana Valério does the eyes that it is clear: the sweet memories will not leave him until now.
The mood was on the roads of all over 30 centimeters from the pool!
There's a kitchen!
Crisis!
Then I said we're never gonna buy anything for the Russian markets.
I don't know, maybe there's all changed.
But for the days, I was brought to the fish of the Dalland East.
That's what she was funny!
I said I don't even want to talk to the man who brought it to us.
Balerio is surprised that many standards of Italy for the Russian producer in the wildvine.

Shef-Pour restaurant "Brasserie Most" and Bara "Streel" Regisses Trighel is not so psychistic as Wallero: France's troops have already replaced congress from Tunisia, and instead of French restaurants will buy Swiss.
Nevertheless, Reyes becomes more emotional when it speaks of Russian providers: "Wright Captain 200 rubles!
I'm asking, "Why's the reason that it's so worth?"
I'm saying, "Well, we need to work."
But this captain must not stand about 80 rubles!
We're buying a weight, but they're alive 15-20 years, imagining how much is their master?
It's worth that it's supervisory.
It seems that Russian providers are one of the main sources of foreign prostitutes.
The standard story: "The last three months all was good, then the quality has falled down."
Main claims: Russian providers cannot extract statistical calibrates and quality.
Many restaurants of the European cuisine do not know that it will be with them when the stock is finished

Now and so unlikely to take the prices, says Rack.
As statistics, the growth of the general currency for the second quarter of 2014 is 1.8 per cent.
It's the smallest indicator after 2010.
The different prices will be grown and further, it recognizes, but unlikely how fast: As long as most restaurants have been reserved products in the nearest two months in hope to overcome the excursions of cowboy prices.

We've got a ring, a kete, a kitchen, a hot, a bottle, a cheese, a crowd forest.
Yes, they're not so green as the Norvegian forest, because it's a wild fish.

In the spring of his tent, the Magadan's pocket, the trick, the muscle, the musxon, the mercy with Crime, the Greeks from the Dutch East.
Galkin is sure for a long time to go to fish from the Dutch East.
As a statistics, fish outcome to Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tonnes, a significant part of fish is going to Japan, Korea and even in the United States.
Fish imports in 2013, about 800 tonnes.
His people worked since 2012, sold fish through Internet-garsin, until the sanctions have served another half of the restaurants, such as the simple things.
There are still 15 restaurants to Galikan.
The same soft can be done out of our fish, he's warming.
We've tried, we've tried different recipes.
Now we're selling through the Internet wallet for millions of rocks a month.
Our fish is a couple of times, and the addment is a maximum of 15 kilometres in the kilogram.

"The Russian fish providers have not yet proposed us," he explains the owner of Killfish Bar Dmitri Eve.
The same situation and other products: Russian producers could take the low, but it does not happen.
According to the Foundation Lavka Lavka's draft Lavka Boris Akimav, you can now speak about the location of imports from Europe and America by China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations where the powerful logistics and larger amounts are.
They are able to put an prohibited import in the different way of our farmers.
So it's an prohibition that the large producers of other countries are first played," says Akiam.
However, in the last month, the retained race has received and more worse signals than product sanctions.
The outcome of the Massive Inspective Testing of Rossus Weather was temporarily suspended by the three businesses of McDonalds in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Steelropol and Ecatherinburg.
"We are studying the proposed claims to define the actions necessary for the rapid opening of reservations for visitors," said the "Damm" at the McDonald Press office.
Actually, nobody knows what will be going on.
If all are limited by product sanctions, it is one option that can be overcome, it is said in the conditions of an anonymity of the company engaged in a reservated consolidation.
But if you start closeing McDonalds throughout the country, the scenario will be very different.
Europrotocol instead of HIVD
Coco's payment can be received without HIVD, so the CBC intends to stimulate the integration in Russia 'Europrotokola'.
The Russian Bank has developed a project of indications, which from 1 September of the year to receive a coco-smoking carrier could be provided without HIVD assisting.
It is true that only about cases when the aircraft was formed by the European Protocol without the participation of a road police.
Thus, if only two cars were involved, there is no physically affected persons that do not exceed the fixed limite, and both drivers have reached a consent in the question of the offender.
From 2 August the payment of the Europrotocol is 50, EUR, and from 1 October in Moscow, San Peterburg, as well as in Moscow and Lenngrad Area, it will be higher to 400 rubbers.
It is that, even in the unbelievable damages, in the situation where the TCP can be formed by the European Protocol, the drivers who have falled in the airport are calling to DP.
It was impossible when the coco police had been available without HIVD assisting.
Options written in the project of indication as time and time it is called to enhance it on the way of the “European Protocol” in Russia.
According to them, the maximum expenditure for coco on the DTP, formed without HIV staff, should not be lower than the Europrotocol.
However, it cannot be above the limite set out in the Coco insurance treaty.
The idea is, of course, useful and theory to develop both DPC staff and roads.
But most likely, it's not going to be in the neighborhood nor carriers.
The latter now speaks of the serious threat of the growth of minorities to which new provisions may be introduced by the coco's payment.
As regards waterers, it is difficult to imagine what work the need to be done to overcome the imperial Russian conservation.
In most cases, the investor will be at times waiting for a small abortion, because it is the hope.
And yet not known that it will be easier to win the mechanics or to convince the watermen in the hope of the Europrotocol.
The conservation certificate will be made namely and unrepaid
The minor wants to impose subregional certificates to the predecessor and will allow banks to make them similarly.
It will prepare a draft law, which will prohibite pollution certificates to the predecessor.
Lastly, this tool is capable of popularity, as it has been led here above than bank contributions.
The fact that the prevention certificates of the claimant do not fall into the assurance system, and the bank is deeply concerned because they do not need to be assigned to the Fund of the Contribution Service (ASA).
The risk of the situation is that the step is planned to take from small and medium-sized banks distributing such certificates, and the SBBBK and the Moscow Bank, which control 98 per cent of the profile market.
The Bank of Moscow, according to the Agency, is approximately 3,5 per cent.
The problem is explaining in the ACS that the small bank clients buying such a certificate are attempt to obtain money to the ASB.
Some containers who have no sufficient financial software and the purchase of pollution certificates to the predecessor may suggest that their attachment is stored.
The absence of insurance payment for these certificates in the case of the license to the bank may lead to disappointment and social tension.
In practice, the agency was cased when the predecessors had tried to seek an insurance reimbursement through the court," said the ASB.
There's a problem, of course.
No one will pay the purchasers of certificates, since they have no right to reimbursement from the State.
If it was that the instrument was not enriched in the ASV, it would also be prohibited with the metal accounts that were used for citizens in one of the four metals of gold, silver, plates and petrols.
These accounts are not also in the assurance of the contributions, but there are no one before it is tried.
It is, above all, that the certificates of the predecessor are a very valuable bummon that can actually speak in the quaxidenge role.
In this case, their movement is practically uncontrolled: any bank client can buy a certificate, transfer to any citizen, and before the recovery of such certificate can change the multitude of the households.
Unlikely, the draft law is prescribed that the conservation certificate must be an accurately precious bummy that should be kept in the depository.
In order to submit the pile to banks, such certificates are allowed to be released without the right of an emergency.
This is the analogy of an impressive contribution that the bankers dreamed for many years.
NATTO Summit: First Protestants in Newport and Cardiff

The soldiers shot the Ukrainian patrulled coat in the Asian Sea

Two Unions met
The above-level negotiations in Misk did not decide the problems for which were known, but have made a new format: the first persons of the European Union met the first persons of the future of the European Union
Let the EU leaders and the Foreign Union have first discussed a number of “related problems” in the context of the Ukrainian situation.
This structure is special to work effectively without understanding, but it is clear that he has taken the flows from this self-employment.
Questions have been issued on the evening on 26 August when the Belaruss followed them and the other Europeans have seen in the televisions of the new President Lukasco.
The Belarus leader showed an example of a deterioration of a man's behaviour, which only had a jek-pot-protect and planned a dignity of oldness in the highest society.
Like Midan Lukachenko helped
To arrive to Minsk immediately from three major European Commissioners (EU ministry) who met Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing of their name, not just a legitimation of the President of the 20-year-old.
This is a complaint to the Minsk plenary Agency of the European Policy and the main Mediterranean crisis.
The older analysis of the Belarus Strategic Research Institute, Daniel Malians, is sure that Brussels can no longer speak to the Mine's same tonne as before.
"What Catherine Evan met the Tet-a-et with Lucakezco, it gives the reason to believe that the relationship with the EU will be deployed further," he said, "Hoola."
This is a hidden part: the preparation for the breaking of the Belarus authorities started a long time before the Norbour Midian in Kyove in 2013.
"When results were achieved and with the EU, these are successful negotiations on the improvement of visa and rehabilitation, the modernization dialogues, and the burning partner, and the United States have been conducted on international security negotiations.
The States have even disappeared some sanctions.
With regard to Ukrainian events, they had only understood the process.
On the one hand, it was possible to keep relationship with Ukraine enough warm so that it could not be lost in mutual trade, and the President of Pousso could come to Belize to negotiations.
The other Belarus leader, who had not recognized Crime to Russia and urged to punish the prostitute prisoners in Donbuss, with all courageousness, to Moscow.
The Minsk did not come from the Foreign Union, nor from the ODC, but the Russian Arabia was placed in the Russian Arabia.
Brissel and Washington noted the balanced position of Minsk on Ukraine and assessed it, certain Belgium experts.
As a result of successful movement of Lucasco to political diversification, it will be seen as often in the nearest time of Minsk to take meetings in the EU+TS format.
The High Representative of the EU on External Policy and Diplomament of Catherine Ethen could not operationally respond to questions of which Brussels is expected from relations in a new format.
The Chairman of Evan Maya Costanchi said only " Honigk" that, on the basis of the solutions of war and peace, this topic is not a priority.
It was so reported that the next meeting of the Ukrainian matter with the participation of the first persons in the new format may become also Kazakhstan.
It was a statement by President Norsultan Nazarbaeva, who recognized that it was personally requested by representatives of Europe.
Nevertheless, at the final briefing of Alexander Lucakzco, he understood that all sides are not contrary to that Minsk remains a central area for meetings as well as in Russia-OBSE-Ukrain, as well as at the level of heads of States and high representatives of Europe.
This means that the last Detective of Europe is the status of a full manager of the European leader who helps solving a global problem.
The best friend of the European farmer
The same composition of the EU delegation, including the European Trade and Energy Exploitant, underlined the conclusion: the main summit is not the tragic situation in Donans, but the economy.
Actually, the recording of future gas supply negotiations and the extension of the dangers of the CT countries on the Ukrainian Association would be more larger than peaceful declarations without specific dates and numbers.
The Commissioner for Trade Carl De Huht, however, said: "The representatives of the EU have come to Minnsk to find a decision of the political crisis, which has economic consequences, not opposite."
It seems, however, that in the Ukrainian economy, it is "working" in Belarus.
His consequences, and firstly mutual sanctions of Western and Russia, are given to Minsk, which has been the subject of sanctions, long-term ground for manaver.
According to the Leader of the Science-Student Centre of Mizas, the former candidate in the Chairman of Belarussy Romanchek, the European Investigators are actively interested in the possibilities of Belure for Agricultural Production in Crimination.
This is the result of the schemes for which Army Pentin's semage of Minks.
"Initiatives of these schemes," said Romanchek "Hoognak" - are not the Belarus Business, but Russian companies.
They have been working long, including Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these models were destroyed.
The Russian business is needed to restore them, even through the middle of the Belarus structures.
Second, it continues to continue experts, it is that many Ukraine companies are not able to configure production from the Ukrainian ships as well as the Russian market orientation.
In the Ukrainian producers, $4 billion exports to Russia, and the Belarus production schemes can now be extremely encountered."
Romanchek considers that the role of the area for EU negotiations and the Ideal CT for Lukashenko and the development of economic relations with Europe.
He recalled that the loss of the EU sector from the Moscow sanctions are estimated at $5 to 10 billion, and Euro-Commission has currently proposed only EUR 125 million.
The Belarus Chairman may propose that Brussels work together to minimize the impacts for European farmers.
This may raise the authority of Lukashenco into the EU to a unfavourable height.
Hospital without initiative
Catherine Evan thanked the Belarus authorities for the Summit initiative.
But Paradox is that the official Minks from its active role in the birth format of TS+EC is strengthened, and the Belarus leader to meet the Ukraine colleague stressed that the new format was initiated and that it became the Kyv.
"It was your proposal to assemble, without any order to discuss, not with bars to decide, after signing the Agreement on the Association with the EU, to disclose in the situation that was present in Ukraine at that time," he turned before the cameras to the Peacec.
Nevertheless, observers set it as an attempt to relax Moscow, it was significantly contrary to the mixture of Minsk, which highly increased its political weight.
In the Belarus Diplomatic state, Belarusia highly emphasized that, in the organization of EU and TST, there is no useful objectives, but the final goal of this format is to create in the future of a unique economic space from Lisbon to the East.
"It is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts which are in other areas, in particular in the area of security, moves and moves the management of our strategic Communities of the Russian Federation," said the Ognek in the IAD Belarussian, the state where the last time they take words to be correct.
Moscow zones may appear with paying entrance
The Government of Moscow considers the option of introducing a paying entry as a method of combating the central routes on analogic trail with other large cities of the world, with M24.ru's link to the Moscow Transport Forum.
One of the options that successfully recommended is the payment of the entrance.
It's an expert opinion, we need to learn it, see all mines and pigs.
To say that the decision has been taken on this matter until early," he said.
The master emphasized that the capital of the capital was very important for Asian cities that appeared on the structure and loading of Moscow.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is already implemented by a central color card, added Nicodhuts.
Recently started the Central Color Car building is a certain example of the fact that the whole traffick is not to pass through Moscow.
If there were sufficient infrastructure for travel, it should not have had been a transcript in Moscow," he noted the waver.
Max Lyxuth also stated that the introduction of pay parks had significantly developed the capital roads.
And, in his words, the capital authorities are not planned to stay on the achieved.
Remember that the 26 August, the Russian capital Sergey Society started in the ceremony of the building bookmark of the first start-up of the Moscow Road Road Road (CCRD).
Smoke Profant
Philm Frank Miller and Robert Rodriges "The Lord of sins-2: Women for whom you have to kill" did not the revolution that it could have been expected.
The first "God of sins" (2005), covered by minimum but symbolic, participation of Quentin Tarantin, made a revolution in relations between the film, the comics and the literature nar.
Sikвел also in its own revolution: it detruises the foundation for the modern thought of the "tesis anti-sys" chapter (if it understands under the theis of the global nar, and the anti-communications cosmos.)
From now on, it should be read, "Thess is anti-hoos."
"The world of sins-2" is haotic and the dramatic, and at the philosophic level: both of them, he's in the stupid meaning of the word.
Yes, some of the heroes known by the first "The God", though, it's called Marv (Mickey Ruk), who has ended the life on the electric style, and there's nothing, only, but it's surrounding -- in the role of this people's woman, from the air of the pit and the other pumps with the students.
But the elders are literally distributed by newspapers, like throwing into the city from any other film, about the meaning and the mind of which the storms are asking not to worry.
Yes, his story, unfortunately dismissed by authors in the very interested place at Johnny superfluous player.
He's in the encouragement-frigidial Eva Green and something to her Dueta (Jussh Brolin).
But this journey, in which Duitt, wouldn't differ from Johnny, is more than the persons like the other parts of the body, the persons are involved with an inhuman regularity, not a pain and not even a disappearance.
It's not the people, we understand that it's the architectury of nar. The rocket that's too sure of the player who's pleasing in the "sess of the detective" sex corrupted by the sensors.
Well, and when the architep runs with the architectur and the architecturm, it's not a film, and you know, an abstractive life.
And to give an abstract life writing questions about the logic of this slaughter is just funny.
Furthermore, even in this crazy world there is something constant.
Boods from the first God's "God" continue to hold around the defence from the defendant of their family cards of darkness.
Yes, the detective of Hartigan's no-net, and he's looking at the bunker, and Bris Wilis is always nice to see.
The main problem of the Lord of sins is another.
Frank Miller was a good way that the artist had a talentally connected comics and nar, and as a recorder renewed the presentation of how to move the comics to the screen.
The Commission and the Nar are two aggressively contrary to "reality."
The phenomenon of comics was born at the end of the 1920s, then when the Malawi Society Square (1929), the Malta Summit (1930) and the "State Key" (1931) created a canon nara named by hard-boiled school.
Well, or pulp fiction.
The Communications gave a number of ten heroes from the Pope's season, which gives him rich power, Superman, Bathmen, and the saddle of Dick Trays to Chalka, Tora, Man Pawk and the other "Mans".
But in any film on the motive of the comics, there was something damaged: the qualified personals were constantly desired to grow a screen flesh, remained by creatures in the middle of their real world.
Otherwise, they were left "Existence".
On the contrary, Noar is the most extremist genre of the world literature.
Following world wars, the traditional roman - with supervivies, characters, family scandles and historical background, has lost any conviction.

Geneva has been the most universal and functional emotion of humans
The heart of the expression of persons is the biological universal for humanity, and each participating in its establishment of a body and a group of mouse is not an additional means of expression and threat, the scientists of Australia and the United States have explained.
On their openings, they were reported in the Evolution and Human Behavior magazine, and the Californian University of Santa Barbar can shortly be read.
The expression of the persons are shocked and left down the browns in the dark lips of the narrows in all cultures, and they do it even blind from the birth of the children never seen, notes Aaron Sell's research author.
In the framework of a large research project related to the nature of an anger, scientists found that this emotion had resulted in effective disputes during the conflict.
The more physical damage of one person can make another, so it is more opportunity to protect his conditions and he brings it to a contact with anger.
Researchers found the confirmation and other hypothetics: physically strong people are more bitter and moved to the manual, believes that they have the right to bind other inadequate conditions for them, as well as to prevent the powerful methods of peaceful decisions.
As a result of the fact that the wrath was first the " trade emotion", scientists decided that the movement of each of the seven museum groups that create a cordial expression of persons should represent the worse indigenous more powerful and dangerous persons in the eyes of the contact, as well as the way as possible to agree with the conditions of conflict in avoiding conflict.
In order to verify this hypothesis, researchers were sent to the computer where the person was disabled or absence of each of the seven elements of an irad person and showed their information.
Although the leaved bulbs or outlined in front of the individualship did not make bad persons, those humans were more strongly recognized.
The anger of man, as well as animals, expresses threat: the extensive demonstration of his own force to be agreed and sustained.
A man sharps the narrows and smells his mouth with the same purpose that the avenger who is moving or the grandbour who demonstrates his princes.
The 'never' is allowed by the advocacy of the contact to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form that is most effectively demonstrating the contractual side of the impact of this refusal.
But the most vulnerable - that no one of the anger's components is arbitrary, they all express the same thing," said John Tubby anthropologus.
