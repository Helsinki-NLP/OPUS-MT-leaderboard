Parliament has not supported a amendment to release Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian Parliament has rejected the proposal to decline the amendment of the Criminal Code in which the leader of the opposition of Yulia Tymoshenko is condemned.
The amendment would open the doors to the exchange of the service expression, but Parliamentaries refused the proposal to reduce economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years of prison by the presupple signing of an agreement with Russian disvantaged for Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The sentence is not yet close, the Court of Appeal has the obligation to revise it in December.
Tymoshenko was convicted that it was a political winning of the regime, and even in Western they have been doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to be repealed in paragraph 365 of the Penal Code with which the former service was condemned was supported by 147 deputy members in the vote.
For its adoption, 226 votes would be requested.
Libya's victory
The history of the Libya Liberation, or of the Libya rebellion, has already his losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the wilderness and without him there is no war.
Stay to define who the winner is
As it is already cooking in the region, the islamists gained elections, but now it is to diluciate whether they are moderate or radiate.
The National Transition Council has entered into force the traditional law, the sharian, which we already know certainly.
Libya will become a country without offence, because the throats will cut their hand.
Women can already go forget to emancipation and apogs, waiting for their implementation and thus.
Instead of the person of the deputy, the society, composed of three warriors, will be joined by the Coran.
In Libya, there will be a order that we can't imagine or imagine and that we can't certainly do.
However, our form of life is neither the only or objectively the best and, probably, would not agree to them, at any time, to the already mentioned libraries.
True, it is that you don’t let sure that Islamic fighters accept thankfully the help of the infidel dogs.
The only justification was that, since its view, the attacks of the OTAN would not design them a United States general, but the greatest Allah, whose greatness were held after each of the outcoming interventions.
When they are looking for winners in Libya, West is not among them.
We are attracted in a tirote of the islamists and our politicals to disappear from a reporter in the person of a political friend without having guarantees of benefit.
After the recent bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not take military care of Libia.
In this case, the locals do not propose a problem to expuls the "closed"
But without occupation will the oils continue to be made with black black gold only with good words?
It is quite likely to be no, but it may eventually be westernly able to prevent human rights to protect.
Always the followers of the sharp do not crush us.
Starting a new was of the crisis
France and the rest of Europe go to the lack of the investors' searcher
A statistical torch has been extended by Europe

The Checo team, together with a good dose of lucky in the second time, was an fantasticly defended of the attacks of the local team, so it will not be lacking the citation of the European campeon.
IHNED.cz continued detailed development of the party in a minor report.
There was almost emotion in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Checo team, thanks to the removal of the local team towards the end, and also to the excellent game of ◆ech and Jiráček, came from 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrated its step to the Campsonato of Europe.
Because of the chess defense correction, the mountains did not prejudice to the second half.
The two prejudices of the game were Damjanovič and Vučinič, which left two large times.
Furthermore, thanks to the genius Petr ≤ech, the one Checo will not lack the quote of the Copa of Europe, so the arcades of the national fotbol will bring you an approximate thanks to about 200 million crowns.
Since the first minutes, a good offensive game was given.
Both teams began soon to keep lines and play nothing more back to the field center.
There was no pressure of local players in the first half, patents on the other field in defence, just what the checa defense could avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die by the nuclear programme of their country.
They formed a human guard.
A number of hundreds of university students formed human schools around nuclear installations in Iran.
With their manager, they wish to express their support to the nuclear programme before a possible attack of Israel.
Students were led to pray the middle of the installations and then corrobored death slaughters to the U.S. and Israel.

Diary menu of an obedious child: you don't disappear and breakfast
More than one third of children with ages under the age of 9 to 13 have oversight problems, where oversight affects 9 per cent of school population and obesity to 5 per cent.
The obedious children are in their majority of families with a lifestyle that is not healthy, according to current investigations.
It turns to demonstration what is the importance of the environment in which a healthy development of the person is grown, as well as the reference models.
At the table, obsesised children are eating at least with two of the frequencies that children of families with normal weight.
To dinner, more than 19% of the obesis had eating fresh patatas the day before the analysis, which is linked to the Prevention Programme "The obesity is not an casuality".
In children's surprised families there is no cost of practicing sports, which is applicable to most of the current families, where only 15 per cent of the children responded that their parents at least one time per week found time for physical execution.
Research of 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of the past school year and participated in the same nearly 900 children in Basic Education of all Chequia.
It was already the second edition of the programme of "The obesity of it is not an casuality", which supports the General Health Safety and the Uniferi company.
To now, more than 12,000 children have participated in the project from four to the eighth.
A suitable and quite family exercise is certain factors, which have notably reduced the number of children with superpes and even obesity.
"Other than half of the children investigated have responded that they have five daily foods according to the regime: disappearance, dinner, food, middle and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy day," gathers one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast but with embuted for dinner
The experts advise that, in healthy development, they are important, in addition, the details, which also take account, for example, to have a fixed time for family disappearance.
In Chequia, however, only 23 per cent of school families are dismissed at the same time.
In most families, each disaster alone.
But the worse was discover that 10% of the households weren't disappeared.
However, the disappearance is the basis of a correct daily daily.
The study shows that obedious children’s families are more often consumed with fresh patata humans.
All cases - independently of weight - drink to daily sweet refress (70%).
Generally, more than 40 per cent of the children in question, however, among their parents, this result is reduced at least half, only 15 per cent.
Fabricing your diet
The next phase of the study allowed the elected chavals (204 Children and 172 girls of 13 collegios) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their guests and opinions.
"The food preferences of cheque children in ages included between 12 and 15 years, from the point of healthy food, are very far from the ideal."
Among their favourite foods are found the past, the flesh and the sweet
"It is above all alarming the popularity of sweet refress," reported in the final report of the study.
As the main food takes the palm of the skin and remains near the oven meat.
Practicely, children always reject less and sweet for fishing and green is very low.
Realable accommodation
At the same time, the study shows that children are intended to change their food homes if they receive correct information.
"In the control group of participants in the study, who filled the questionnaire after the end of the Prevention Programme "The obesity is not an casuality", in many cases a change was made in favour of the principles of healthy food, as well as the results of the study.
He calls attention, for example, on the sweet refress, where many children would begin to prefer the normal and corriger water.
Children would also be elected more often in the questionary meat and fishing for main food and restrict the consumption of sweet food and harina.
The artist must also be a good psychologist, support professionals
In the introductory article, how to learn the styleists, I was desired that the initial lessons were quite loaded.
I didn't have any idea how to go that.
Conferences of three professionals of the ramo, how to clothe problems and also a seminar on how it works in the spectacle world.
And it'll be worse.
How closer are the final reviews, more information and practical tasks are doing us
And even though the course is developed every sabbath and Sunday, he doesn't have any alfiler.
We are once studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how to cover the woman who has no perfect symmetry.
And so is most.
Someone is cut, someone has a skilled figure without the appropriate curves and somebody suffers over.
The list has to know how to swim optically a few wide hairs, spread a kit or receiving the necessary curves
We have given us some stuff about how to stress the body of women of Jennifer López, huge skins and cadders but stretched and at the same time you don't clothe it in a too much disappointing way
If, for example, the difference between the census and the cattle is so much as the fall or the pantalons do not be adjusted, it is the penalty to be made at least a throat of a throat extra measured.
Unfortunately, they will not repent, because the clothe that sees perfectly is imagable.
With a measuring fall, it will feel much better than with one who doesn't move, stand up, bail in the census, etc.
The stabled body can be allowed to clothe clothes with pearls, beams, barriers or drapees.
There are certainly many types of different information and body information, so I'm content that I have every week to order all this information on my head.
And even so, I'm afraid that with the targeted task, I have more than dream.
Any participant in the course has been granted two famous ones, which must be designed two vessels: one for the day and one for the night.
The current aspect must be taken into account the style of mod which is attached to the person concerned.
He touched me "vesting" to Miranda Kerr, perhaps you know the Victoria's Secret campaign.
Great inside, for me is much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christianna Aguilera, which will recently be paid a few hundred kilometres (for example, take into account the exageration), or the young Selena Gómez.
The clothes need to cover them from the pages or search them on the Internet and print them, to then develop them graphically.
The moodboard, which is called to the complete result, also expresss our personal style and our relationship with the graphic design.
It is important also to think about the graphical part of the styleism.
This is why you have not only seen physically, but also, for example, of the products pages in the revised pages (the specific subjects such as trends, bottles, cracks, etc.).
Of all this, the artist and designer Mario Kameník spoke to us.
But all this remains for Sunday.
The artist must have a global vision.
The three specialists encouraged the sabbath conference with information on all kinds of body.
Honza Pokorný, the Jakub Polanka model designer and the Ben Renč photographer.
Jakub remembered us that the mode is an illusion and the artist should know you to get out of this.
And a good artist knows working with the same capture of clothing different forms.
Variability is in this case essential.
So, such gardarine (or speaking in English, trench-coat) can be clothes with vacuum and camise, but also served to clothe the black body with taiwan sacks and photograph it as if it was actually a clothing.
Or just calm it and go up the kit to get a completely different image.
"Just with it," he insisted to us.
The more value is the following advice: "To start working, you need to first know all the rules."
"Lugo you can break it," said Jakub.
I am therefore clear why we remember all these forms, which is combined with why, if then, in the revisions of mode, we found different results.
That's not talking about the defiles.
Thanks to Ben photograph, I know that a artist has to have more types of clothes in the booking of which you're trying to photography.
So, for a mode story that has ten pages (for example, ten outfits), you must have ready, lists to use, at least 15.
And as the pictures of the clothes works in combination with other tomats, all of them different to which are used in the reality.
All this must be taken into account at the time of designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that the image and style they are only offered, in many cases, half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, that is not exactly an extraordinary song, but the image and the margin have made a global star of it.
In Chequia, at the moment, there is still no clear trend to use the skist services.
Even the famous persons also find it unutil (I am enough of my skills, my physical aspect does not have so much importance).
And when someone asks us our services, you must take into account that it is very likely that they show us a very different mole in its real (minor).
Then it remains just goggy and telling whether the heart revises have already written on the subject, whether a certain celebration has been encountered/deleased, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario stressed us that the artist is not enough to focus on the mode but need to understand outfit.
During their work, mostly, you should communicate with people you have seen, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He knows to appreciate people, not at least, defends their opinions.
"When a director is contrary to you that you classify the vessel and fill it with goods, you can't catch and cast all that he had and say, "It's what horror".
"Find at least one couple of things you can put and recommend that someone may be put to it," said Mario.
He also showed us that everything must fall in the "placovka" call, i.e. the work bottle.
This is set around the census and there are all the necessary tools.
It's objects like tires, such as tickets, captapelus, or imperdiable. There's also a nut hair (which serves the list during the workshop of products such as tass or horrors), special kitchen pizzas for front, if this was greater (alfiles and other type of ingredients are not allowed, because they could damage the teasio), or a costing game.
To not stay in passive audience and put something into practice, we learned to restore the soil of the safftes.
Even during the study photos meetings, on a plane area, the floor could be damaged and much more on the outside.
And we did no more than restore and restore.
We couldn't touch the shots with the tickets so we couldn't harm them for accident.
So I had to be very sweet.
Mario gave me a joy to elegge my work without reservations.
The truth is that I don't have such ability to do so much.
This is only a small part of all we heard during the whole week end, in the second part of the course.
I already realized that I was dedicated to the professional skills is not a rock way, but gives me exactly what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run is completed throughout America.
Research
A journey, firstly disappointed, is complicated because of a series of improving disappearances of a rutinary journey during the morning.
In some measure, it was possible to cover the expectations, but it would not serve anything, if, in fact, it was not intended to do anything extraordinary.
The new delivery, to which the title added The Run, discovered large expectations before his street.
I promised to give new airs to the old Need for Speed and, on the basis of it shown, it appears as a game that should not end again to be a gender of action again without any more.
We also feel wonderful about how to stay the insulined scenes, where the main person goes out of the car and falls on their own feet.
As it seems to happen in the NFS series, the results did not vary much about what we hoped.
There are roads that can be given for acceptable, but in the total compound points are paid because of absurd faults that are already appearing in the series for years ago.
In fact, there are no errors or errors, but it is more incomprehensible disappearance of the programers.
The adventure begins very well.
It is introduced into a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has some personal problems; to solve them, it is offered to participate in an illegal cart for all America.
You sit on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is reaching the first ones to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The road is divided in ten stages and then, over 50 cars.
This means that each road has place on a different road and steps are placed in different environments, which are quite different and interesting.
So one does not have or remotely feeling that the game always offers the same.
Some of the entities are also pleasing in view, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to the previous delivery of the series.
So it's nothing of the other world.
But the past through the wilderness, the otoñal landscape or the high covered snow mountains produce a very nice effect.
Furthermore, the roads are differentiated when a attitude.
So, for example, in the desert you will find a swimming pool that reduces visibility.
Instead, in the mountains, you must have carefully so that you don't bury a wave.
According to this, each of the cars is very well developed.
There's just a couple of models, but it's enough.
During a moment, you're trying to add to a quantity of required rivals (usually in a classic road), then you'll stop winning time (class Cronometrate) and then wait a dual against one adversary.
In the middle of all this, the police is sometimes, which does not, but to difficult more things.
The news are the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, most of the cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help it, always clicking the right button at the right moment.
Nothing complex.
However, it is surprised that there are little less landscapes in the game that could be waiting for (in particular there are only three).
But the final result is positive, because this element does not be painted and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The conduct model continues the wings of the previous episodes.
This means that today's day there is no great thing, but you can't say that it's bad.
If you are looking for realistic simulation, you can already search on another side.
But at a road conceived with quite action you have enough of this behaviour style, although we can find something better between the competitive games.
It's all right here.
But problems happen after some time.
On the difference of the correct behaviour models, it's no longer the same thing with the collections.
From games of this type you can't expect to receiving complicated deformations and collections, but in fact before a fight against any object, you can't predece how your car will react, with which not all is in order.
It is typical that, by making a very customized adaptation or circulating car with a normal traffic, there are only light red, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends to make worses.
Or even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the rescue system, there are no big problems, but you can put you to hurt.
The resets are programed in such a way that, when you suffer a accident or get out of the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point.
However, in each road there are only five reservations available.
If you're all consumed, you'll have to restart the rock from the beginning.
So it's not only a help in the case that something is not okay, but it's not very much to fix.
Sometimes, neither the reset, only helps to learn the memory stage.
A huge wedding of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, there must be a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Another time you will find on some site "civiles" cars always with the same configuration, although you are the first, five or five minutes before or later.
This makes a relaxing mainly in situations, when you see that two cars going to meet in opposite addresses, your constraint adds without problems, but when you're coming, you'll need to run or break.
It's equal when you're coming, because it's programming that the "sourprise" will always happen before your natives.
The adversaries also have more advantage.
During the whole game you will get to sites where, without taking into account the moment, you will always add the same adversary on the same site.
Furthermore, this happens at the end of the game, in a long punch, which is still more shocking.
Your opponent must come before you, the price that is.
When it goes before you, make you difficult the vision of the cars coming in front, so at first you can make the car to pop.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with a maximum dose of suspension and adrenalina, but the execution is so apparent that you are surely detectioned later.
And it's a pen, because although the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and with action, so it is often not possible to follow the detail what happens or where.
And truly gives the same, if the merit is taking the idea with 50 exclusive pysts or classification on the road so that you don't leave burning, or any other thing.
An inhabitant idea is the change of cars during the cars.
You have to be attentive to the gasoline survivors on the side of the road, because you just have to change from the car, even though in most cases you'll have enough of what you have.
The cars are divided in three categories.
Deportations are appropriate for urban areas, strong American cars for right autops and superdeportal exotics for technical conduct, for example, by mountain road routes.
Furthermore, the most important narrative goal is also appearing a hair of paralel challenges, i.e., there's shorts in concrete places that you'll know by the stories.
Here you will receive not only medles, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both for challenges and accounts.
In reaching the highest level, the conductor is opened with several possibilities, starting through the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, there is a online autolog function that compares your results with other players and available other Community functions.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last chariot is done in the history.
With the car you reach to the metro tunnel (passa), where you can move to dark through the roads (passe).
The speedmeter marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, sudden, afterwards, the metre's convoy and takes you without any further.
In the redaction we will certainly have a discussion on this for a few days, on whether during the programing of the game no one thought even a little or if the truly authors take us on a bottle pand.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the general visual effects result in most of the pleasing cases, sometimes to survery.
For what does it think that, in the moments the highest tens, the quality of the image is reduced and, in cases, in a serious manner.
This affects particularly the accidents where many participants are involved, when the continuing image quality is not already valid.
The audio is good, and the sound band is a question of gusts.
In order to enjoy the majority of the youth group, the sound band belongs to the category "at one of his father and mother," but it may be suggested that no one would buy the game only for his music.
The final sensation of Need for Speed: The Run is quite confused.
If the game is absolutely missing errors, we would have to say that The Run is the best NFS game in the last years.
The feeling that the game is not finished.
The diversity is secured, but ready for the mistakes will touch you with the power of some aircraft reflectors.

The emblemate before the EU, Vicenová:
Chess have a reputation of negativists and euroscéptics.
"Lesboa treaty has significantly affected the balance between individual institutions"
"I didn't wait for a war set up without a quarter."
"There will be five, six years before the situation is established a little, calm and the new players are attained to their new papers," so he convicted its conference in the Czech Ambassador to the EU, Millennia Vicenová.
How not to be taken seriously, "clature and openly on Europe", which has already said in the first part of its conference, when it has agreed to describe every EU organ and its relations with this precise and clarity, because it would be the desire of many conferences of the United Nations law Faculty.
Vicenová also added the work of the new Permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first are the criticians, that if it is insulin, a Greek official, able to assume any role, but I say he left all uncertained, because he's taking their roles to perfection."
"He is a man who knows to listen to the twentieth state members, communicate with them and has a clear view from where the EU must go."
The new representative of external and security policy explains from the question: "Who is this EU? What number can I call it?". It is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of the political union such as China or India.
No one wants to prohibite the Olomouk's Chess
Awaits the next agenda is also concerned, continued and will continue the European Council in the next future.
Two years ago, the Czech Presidency was successful.
Chess took care of the emergency economic crisis, solved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the East Association.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected Chequia.
The Czech representation in the EU has at present many commitments.
In words of the embarrassing: "A good alboroto," not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is now being treated.
On the other hand, the budget for seven years of the EU must be adopted, caused by the current economic situation, much more complex.
If the budget is easier and effective, what sectors will be priorities, what countries will receive more support and what less?
The embryod also remembered its main legs, with which he came to Europe: "Early about Europe."
"The truth is that I don't like fair refreshments, foreigners or jerges that people don't understand."
"How can a citizen understand that in Brussels do not actually find the skins the curve or rewarded pipes, platanes of different sizes or that nobody will prohibite us from Olomouk?".
It also seeks to make more progress from the EU environment and to draw closer to more Czech citizens to the European institutions.
We hope the Europe of speeds
According to the embarrassing, the chicks have a name of eurosceptics, and people are more aware of negative aspects than positives.
He also regretted the low participation of cheques in the European institutions.
The fault is a lot of factors, such as the modest of our candidates, their inability to write motive messages, but also the little support of the cheques.
Besides the success of the Czech Presidency, he enhanced the force and cooperation of the Vicegrad Group.
"Create me that when you come to me a polaco and a hungry and it's about me about a slave, a French tells me by my side, "What, you have already left, the Visegrad Group?", and it is seen that he doesn't do any thanks."
In the future, in accordance with Vice-Vice-Office, new duty regulations for the budgetary policy are provided for Member States.
It is a very real thing of the concept of the two speeds, if no longer, in Europe, more than the new of the European Federation.
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone."
"We have the Schengen Space and we also have the strengthened cooperation procedure."
"The first time they said that they only want to cooperate the countries they want and not, they are left out."
"These procedures will be always more and strengthening Europe of the two speeds" is hoped in Vienna.
In this regard, he also stressed the role of Chequia and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all the issues affecting the entire EU should be discussed between Member States, not only among members of the Eurozone.
Border history:
The IBM innovative starts its second century of existence
If someone was looking for a term that was very precisely defined by the IBM strategy, the most closest would be "grown time".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is considered as current and, however, has already been over hundred years since its foundation.
The basis of this long placest character laid the first head of the signature, Thomas J. Watson visionary.
He already appreciated that many problems in the world have solutions if people are ready to think.
His leg "Think!" was converted in his scene, to which it will go to build the life of the gigante future (the title of an internal magazine IBM began to publish in 1935).
Watson was also the basis of an carefully high company culture.
"For us, IBM involves a long-term thought, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survive and prosperated for hundreds of years for this reason, because his basic principles have remained faithful, but without fear of changes around.
This has allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope to prosper even more in our second century," he confirmed during his anniversary, the current director of Samuel J. Palmisano company.
A sophistic system
Watson, already in the 30 years, was concerned about the care of their employees as Bai's businessman in Chequia (the employees of IBM were the first US workers who enjoyed payment, secure, elegant uniforms and a sophistic reward system that prefered the best inventors and sales.
The same long-term sustainability holds IBM in connection with the client.
Since the beginning, the company had decided to discover talents (as being one of the first world enterprises to end with any kind of discrimination, could choose without problems).
In the line of anti-discrimination strategy, IBM's current plan, which will replace it in Palmism the year coming to a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has already worked for thirty years in IBM, where he has been head of sales, merquetins and strategies.
During the last years, IBM has participated in virtual meetings, online plung of ideas, which surrounded infinity of future strategies and innovations.
It is not surprised that they overlook ideas, because in the signature they work almost half million people.
A institution with a good reputation
The position set in the business provides the company a strong internal and external image.
"To begin, IBM had a concept of institution more than the technological company," said the professor of the Harvard Business School and author of the book on IBM Rosabeth Moss Kanter.
"IBM is not a technological company, but a company who is trying to solve business problems for Technology users", points George Colony of the Forrester Research adviser.
As the own company says, there is a difference between entering business and establishing a business directly.
IBM - or "Green" - as it is known in the United States familyly because of its logo, it has become in the last hundreds of years in one of the world's greatest companies.
The most versional technological enterprise (developed both teams, programs, infrastructures and services in a wide range of services from servers to nanotechnology).
The largest number of patents of all northern American technology companies and five of their employees have received Nobel Price.
Automatically card, pay cards, financial changes, bar codes and discs are found among their inventions.
IBM will make this year $220 million. This year has been converted to the second Technological sign for market capitalisation (the first is Apple), when he overcome first in 1996 to Microsoft.
Looking at the future
Not all products and innovations have been satisfied with the customers' pleasure and the moment (IBM has not added by your own operational system, OS/2, prodigy online services or PCjr computers).
"If your business is based on progress, it can't be emotionally proclaimed in the past," Samuel J. Palmisano recognized.
Therefore, IBM has no problems to build their bases in other platforms (and also, if they do not work, leave them).
And that's the difference of competition, Microsoft, which basicly keeps and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Future technology
In the case of sales, IBM is dedicated in particular to services, which approximately one fifth part are programmes and another fifth team.
Nevertheless, yet in 1990, the teams represented more than half of the share of suppliers.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low performance activities for a total of $15 million. During the same period, $ 58 million has invested in the buy of future technologies.
Investment has continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis was first demonstrated.
IBM acted according to the premies of his first head, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment during the 29 major economic crisis.
It seems that the IBM company has been able to catch the crisis.
The value of IBM's actions since the beginning of 2008 has increased strategicly to 120 per cent, the net benefit of the company has not left to increase.
The IBM Division is to change it all, except its value.
It can therefore be hoped that when the next crisis comes, this flexible huge green will be sustained.
History of IBM: From the cortour of Chess to space flights
IBM (International Business Machiness) was founded in New York for hundreds ago, as its original name Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM is already adopted in 1924 - originally was a brand used in Canada and South America.
The IBM's base was placed at the birth of four companies returning to the decade of 1880.
I could find inventory as the famous "fishing lines", which allows you to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was the man of business Charles Ranlett Flint, who also presided his supervisor council until 1930.
Flint set the head of a competition company, Thomas J. Watson, to assist him with the company's management.
The new leader eclipsed the IBM founder (the Watson's ideas remain the firm basis on which culture and corporate identity are supported).
Watson directed the company until 1952.
IBM, as indicated its name, started with the production and sale of any type of devices for business, from meat cortlers and cuts to recording cards.
During the first four years of Watson directed the company, the factory was doubled in $9 million and started the great expansion of the company for continents.
Watson was so crucial for the company that, almost fourteen years after the captain, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
On its address, IBM began to work in the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programing language.
In the 60s of the IBM staff and computers helped NASA leading space flights (a Mercurio, Saturno and in 1969 the famous flight to Luna).
While soon, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classics "peces", which imposed the standard of computers for that time, arrived in the market name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Fifteen years later, IBM sold its production of computers to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, on its part, acquired the part of a consultant from the Pricewaterhouse Coopers company and began to provide a complete added high value advised advice and services.
The IBM strategy in these three last three years is the Smarter Planet concept, i.e., "a more intelligent planet".
Its goal is to make a more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet planned or improved the circumstances, for example, in relation to transport and management of cities.
For the trade sector, IBM has not much presented the "Smart Commerce" platform that allows minors to manage the full trade cycle.
IBM has a long story in this country.
In 1932, he opened a sugar in Checoslovakia, the first country that had her in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, the IBM ◆R also works the Brno externalization strategy.
The centre for Central and Eastern Europe is located in Prague. There is also a global theme research team that works with voice recognition.
Rychtáovah concerning your husband's infidel husband:
Wait, stay at that bunch, that I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rychtáćová (53) said it was over!
After his husband Josef Rychtá (53) had become the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also his friend, Darina continued with the hope that Josef had come out of his red dream and returned home.
However, it will no longer wait and has established clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can return home, but no longer like my couple," she explained.
When Darina Rychtáćov had come during the summer in Bartošové in his house, he could not imagine how his marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta hadn't moved thirty days after íčany and Pepe had not left the cantant.
Today, he explained publicly that I loved her.
With time, Darina was resigned, apparently accepted the relationship of his husband and even departed from him forever.
The Rychytá isn't interesting with whom she is accused of her wife.
If a day Rychtá's breaking with Bartošová, his wife wouldn't wait for him at home with open arms.
It's the biological father of my children and, if you want to live the rest of his life in our house, nobody will cast it."
"But here wouldn't live as my dear and old oak who was earned, but as a man who encountered me some lakes," said Rychtá-ová, and added that he had already been disappeared from his husband and he just insisted on the mutual respect.
Josef isn't interesting that his wife has closed her back door.
"I get my wife's decision."
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible."
"My wife set it as a marriage on the paper, and I respect it."
"The company is still in force, I do home arrangements, guard the garden, house, do the buys."
"Darina and I are talking to us with normality, the only thing we don't share the bed," said Rychtá.
If Rychtá's finding a new love, he wouldn't be obliged.
"We're not sleeping together and she's not interesting me, nor where or where if he's got any boyfriend.
I know that it's my fault, I'll love Iveta's and take all the responsibilities," Josef concluded.
The worst old women: Are they also referring to you?
If you ask men to be able to cite some kind of women's vessels, generally each of them will appoint them without thinking.
Dear women, are you recognized in the following lines, where are certain women's vessels that can make blood to men?
Go to buys
Do you revoke her narrow average that has dependent on the purchases?
Do you have to buy at least a trap in a week?
Do you like to buy sometimes in the bathrooms?
Then in your case you can say that we go from buys has become a vic.
Some women are recognized that their steps should be paid for buys, at least a little bit.
But to see, what woman could resist to try to pass without any more by the clothes, looking for well-justed and then try all in the tester (i.e. in all different colors)?
Although the majority of women go to buy is a passenger, men can become practically in a fair.
Only remember how many times you already told her cop that you better wait at the door.
Consistent insufficient
"I'm not too gorgeous?"
"I need to add at least five kilometres - should you start doing?"
"I really like you?"
Doesn't these sentences belong to him?
Yes?
Then it is one of these women obsessing their aspects.
It is not that you should leave to worry, but many men are allergic to listen to your neighbour to stay all the time of your physical aspect.
The stronger sex is also agreed in the increasing frequency of the cases, the more painful women become women.
Order and cleanness in first place
It's like an infinite soviet.
Clear windows, through the aspirator, shopping the ground, remove the dust, breaking the bathroom and all this at least two times a week.
Does he reply to his couple that he had broken the clean land with a sweet feet, his children who have made a clean clean wave and an exit with visual doors so that it costs it clean?
In the case you suffer this "disviation", you want to be aware of that nothing should be extracted and that order and cleaning must not be primary in the family.
This unforgiving desire of cleanness could threaten its relations and family welfare.
Consider unagradable comments
"The skins used are left with the swimming robes."
"You want to do too tomorrow these used calcetines."
"The moving street isn't left on the ground!"
If you do these comments to your couple more times a day, you know that you'll get it out of your boxes.
Sure. You don't mean anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Maybe if men knew that, women, on their part, wouldn't do so many comments.
Students and chims
Some women will also be attacked, chisms, but also offences and conspiration against someone.
Women focused on relations, therefore they like to talk together about what kind of kind, where, with whom, how and why.
The best of each of us is sometimes a little and unforgiving asking.
With the hand in the heart, this is own of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are chismose women who do not be controlled, who loves chismorify and do often, disappoint all and are dangerous for those who run them, especially in a female work team.
Jágr and Voráček helped the Philadelphia.
The former of hockey Jaromir Jágr participated in the NHL meeting with two helps that led over the Philadelphia 5:3 in the crowd of Caroline and returned to the cheque players in the advantage of competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux triggered the star played in 39 years, and gave a further step and was declared better player of the game.
Two helps were added to the game and also the partner of Jágr, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jágr confirmed a great night before the supermar journalists that Giroux had preached.
"On before the game, he told him he would triple."
"I'd present it."
"After they seem to be embarrassed," Jágr explained, after his action this is a goal to Giroux, on the first trail of the Flyers.
A time later, the second intervention of the team also had a cheque raster.
Voráček was made with the disc behind the turtle of the Hurricans and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, which put a gol.
A second before the first Pause, a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expulsed, but from the beginning of the second side already dominated the Flyers.
Concrementally by Giroux.
After cooperating with Jágr, he put the third gol, after his cut was caught in the room of Wayne Simmonds' gate.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't want to say that it is the best player of the ball, but it's uncertainly among the three best ones," Jágr put to his center.
"Now would happen to me that at the end of my road I would play with a reporter like him."
"I'm very pleased about it."
"I want to play for him."
All these years in NHL, my fellows played for me, and this produces results," adds Jágr.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with the Tuum Ruutu goll and then again from Dwyer, from penalti, until he was put to a distant hair.
Matt Read did not allow more complications, although they overlooked two against one.
"Pronger had a good action on our field."
"Speaked the disk, I took speed and read went to the lower side."
"I tried to touch you on the disco and I'm glad because I made it so far," describes Vorázeek the last gol of the game as she lived.
With its victory, Philadelphia has been headed by the East Conference.
The Chess Defensor of Montreal, Jaroslav †paček, did not play until the end of the game against Buffalo, in the second third, was led to a lesion in the upper part of the body.
The Canadians lost not only a player with a great defence experience, but also for a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec couldn't be able to use one of the disasters.
More than the points lost the local tranner lacked the large number of lesions in the last row, and playing the game only with five defenses.
"It's bad."
"We play the game only with a veterian player, the rest was news."
"Now, but it's that it's not easy to do anything, we have to go with it," said James Martin.
"So turning to players returned to us, we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify more game, to remove the disc of our field."
"And so let's goats," said one of the defenses, P. K. Subban.
Ond月ej Pavelec had contributed to thirty winnipeg interventions in the winnipeg winner of 5:2 on Tampa Bay.
Jets' goals were marked by five players that ended at a series of disorders that were already for five games.
How the prices of the travel prices since 1989 have evolved
Until 1989 in Checoslovakia had only five government travel offices: ◆edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies at that time were sold in most cases to the socialist block only, since the travels to West were very limited.
The Czech tourists therefore went from holidays to the RDA streets (The Republic of Germany), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea in the Black Sea) to Bulgaria and Rumania (at both in the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period understood between 1962 and 1972, when it was able to travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime turned to the west and the Chemical tourists were then quite limited.
A great paradise of socialism was the fact that the citizens of the socialist block (or also the Czechlovacos) are not allowed to travel free and individually and even from socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, in Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed a invitation letter, if not, the individual travel was not possible.
Travel offices offered in those times also traveling to West, but one must be put to the collar with a shot to sleep and pass so all night, or have "good known" in the agency.
Not all of that was over.
The call "changing provision" which was the condition for the west trips, was not granted to the "politically little reliable gentle," so he could not travel absolutely.
The Checoslovac currency was not a freely converted currency and, without change guarantee, it was not possible to get resources (west currency) to travel to West.
The greatest majority of the cheques passed over their holidays in their own country, so there was a large number of cattles and summer houses that the cheques were getting. This costume still remains.
The way to travel from Checos has suffered a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 we wouldn't pass the holidays in the RDA or Bulgaria, the cheques did 4.5 million holidays to countries around the world.
A great paradise result, from which today we are not already aware, the fact that the current favorite destination Croacia could not be able to travel freely until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia from then.
At the beginning of the 1990s, the exemption of visa is imposed to travel to the neighbouring countries in Western Europe, which caused a huge oil of short-term visits over Venezuela or Germany.
Chesslovacs, for a long time, were not seen hearts of excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, the groups of cheques in the campaign parks were sleeping, since our income from then wouldn't allow us to pay a hotel or pension.
A typical characteristic of the cheques of that time was the food to be brought (conservation, embuted, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the conversion of the Czech corona, so our tourists finally could finally buy freely western currency.
Our life level increased and with him also the middle wages, which around 1997 caused an increase in the demand of travels.
With an increase in the trip demand, the agency began regularly to prepare travels using carter flight connections, which had unrepensively lowered prices of travel prices in comparison with the passenger, thanks to the possibility of obtaining passenger volume.
At the end of the 1990s of the past, the cheeks had already traveled without visuality to almost all developed countries, except the United States, which simplified even more our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of the pos-revolutionary tourism has occurred in 2000, when organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from Chekia to an exotic country, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, all years charter flights with cheap tourists had made long and warm countries. This winter will already be flighted directly from Chequia to 12 exotic destinations.
Exotic countries are currently visiting them about 100 thousand cheques per year.
Another interesting moment of this time, which symbolizes our pos-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States elected visa for the Checa tourists, with which our country has been to be among the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the cheques, for the first time in his history, have passed over half of their holidays in the foreigner (50.3%) and first in their history, and have been exempt in travels to the foreign foreigner more than 15 thousand checas crowns per head, including the costs on the stay site.
The General Assembly for the election of the President, which could again end at the dead point.
Since about five months the Czech Football is without President and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hašek as President of the Czech Federation of Futbol (FA月R), it will not be known nor after the convocation of the next General Assembly, which will take place in Nymburk.
In fact, there has been no agreement on the rules of vote to follow.
Without the same, it cannot be voted to choose between the three candidates.
The interested to preside the Checo Futbol are Jindich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek revoked his charge in June without before calling his colleagues to find a strong person who wanted to be occupied of the football in the future.
However, after the Hašek was concluded, a dispute was dismissed between the two federalities of the unable association to come to an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This remained clearly on 16 September when the new President had to be elected.
The delegations of the General Assembly met in vain in the National House (Národní dåm), located in the Prague Bar of Smichov, because the discussions had been blocked and not only for the election method.
There was no consensus or the right to vote in the General Assembly - only legal representatives or also delegations with full powers.
From that moment and because of this only point, a partial agreement was also supported by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which the representation by full powers is not possible.
However, discussions on the electoral code are still open.
More light on the situation could not be thrown or the Executive Committee that, at its meetings, ordinary or extraordinary meetings, he did not decide anything.
The opinion on the possibility of vote has already changed a couple, but the neurgal point remains the same.
The question is the following: what way is going on the third round to avoid the dead point?
"The discussion turns back to whether the statutes should be held in accordance with or find another model," said Dušan Svoboda, one of the three Vice-Presidents of the FA月R, which represents the professional bottle from the direction of the association.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, the third round will gain that candidate who has more support percentage in the federality to which its candidature will be presented.
The Moravia Region is prepared to reach an commitment to gain that candidate with a greater percentage of votes in both federalities.
However, the Bohemia Party implies the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, should have the majority of at least two thirds.
"I would, however, the sense of the two previous rounds and will fully refuse the concept of bicameral system," is as Svoboda understood the objections of the residence, as the best would not touch the order and vote in accordance with the applicable statutes.
In this regard, surprisely, there is also Tomaš Paclík agreed, although the electoral regulation established by the Statute of all candidates shall agree more to Pelta.
"I would like to vote to the maximum of the statutes."
"Of there are no thunder on representatives such as in the last General Assembly," the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is first requested as a candidate and directed their comments to the Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, the new president will be decided in Nymburk and he believes that candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All steps will be agreed with today's game of our national team at the European Camper.
"The Futbol will be a protagonist, and so it will be more co-operated to well" said the representative of the Jablonice, which of the three candidates has more experience in the management of the futbol, both at professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the most retaining.
"I hope there is a agreement, but, unfortunately, the situation is much more complex."
"It's not a conflict between bohemios and lodges, but there are attempts to adapt the rules to their own consent."
"This can have a new block of the General Assembly. "
"In any way, I hope that the common sense will be imposed," said Rajchl.
There is no longer time for all parties to go to an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be done in Montenegro, but who can know until the game starts if the futbol team will be complete?
The special airport, in which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others, Vice-President Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, has not occurred this morning by technical problems in Prague, with a alternative to transport the Executive Committee to the place where the classification party will be placed.
You would like the decision-making meeting, finally, could be the one that will be at ministerial level, which will, according to the account, be held.
In Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, he would like to much integrate the parties divided to the most powerful sports organization in the country to reach agreement.
There are many in game: State subsidies, the credibility of the football and the next General Assembly of the Czechoslovac Czech Federation Committee, which will attempt to give a new direction to the cheque sport after the financial problems in the Sazka house.
Paclik will fight to reach the presidency, because he does not find any more appropriate candidate.
If the Chief of the Pilsen Solidants, Tomaš Paclik, before the General Assembly, had known the name of an appropriate candidate to satisfy all its ideas on the new President of the Czech Federation of FUtbol (FA月R), and would not be presented as candidate to a such relevant post.
"If it had a proper person, I would be fighting for her and would not present me as a candidate to the elections."
"But until today there has been no found a person so," said Paclicik for the Tschech News Agency (≥TK)
What Paclík motivates to enter into the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the opportunity to block Pelta, the self-profit of the elections, which opens the way to the Chairman of the Futbol Federation (FA月R).
Paclík also pointed out that, in the event that the President would remain only until 2013, when the regular meeting was turned.
In that order, you would like to see a good expert and manager that is not too related to the erobolistic events.
"I've been talking to some people I could have taken into account."
"For me it was a laugh to hear some say that at this time they don't even want to be identified with the Checo Fotbol."
"I'd like to change that vision," adds.
What is now more painful to Paclík today is the relationship with the President of the Regional Association of Pilsen Roman Berbr, a man with a contravertised past, known outside the world as a powerful lobby capability to affect the vote of delegations in the General Assembly.
For Paclík is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidency silk.
"In the case of winning, the livest status would be kept and nothing in the football will change."
" With the support of Berbra, a man of ambitious business, the Futbol will lead even less proved," said Paclicik.
It also mentions the fact that the name of Pelta was connected with a telephone ear during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta went out impune.
"I don't know what kind of privilege to the football could bring the Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes the UEFA and FIFA will look at us," Paclík said, "and with certain care, that he also takes his previous statement that "the Club Pilsen would come if Pelta becomes a president."
In the case of winning Thursday elections, Paclík could plan cooperation with Pelta in the future.
The same view is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first I would follow."
"It's very capable."
"I could imagine it, for example, as chief of the representation."
"but not as a partnership manager."
"I don't have the narines where I am not able to make it," add Paclík, which in September emphasized much attention to support the suspension of the shipment of the shipments presided by Ludek Macel, replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that it would be attempt to manage the association.
Returns its capacity to management of private enterprises, as the Director of the Pilsen has also been the Director of the Pilsen, which has held the triunf in the first section.
"I have the force to change some things in the flowball area and to contribute to its safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably have to affect the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, produced inadequate situations, Paclik said without hiding their anti-patiaries to the President of Spart.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FARENR and the Chemical Olympic Committee, with the assistance of which the political leaders had made pressure in order to provide more money in the sport of lottery taxes.
"It is one of the key problems that the new President should be dedicated."
"If they increase the taxes on speeding games, as announced by political parties, it would support their arguments, but, in particular, they must tell us where we are going to stop all this money," he said.
At the same time, Paclík has not even taken into account its partnership with Club Pilsner, though he himself claims that the President of the FA月R must be "non-party".
Pelta is with Jabl until and Rajchl with Dukla de Praga.
"It's not ideal."
"But I don't see a sense of hypercritically ceasing my actions of the Pilsen Club to another person and then return there after a year and a half", said Paclík.
Petta promised the FADERR new status that would end with the dead point of the elections.
Two days before the Fumtbol Association Assembly, one of the candidates to the presidency, Miroslav Pelt promised, in the case of electoral, to ensure that the FADERR had some new status that would finally serve to solve, in the future, disputes regarding the electoral regulation.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic as regards the meeting of this Thursday in Nymburk, and believes that the preelectoral conflict could advance a solution today with the possible overcome of the flutbol team.
Before the elections not carried out in September, Pelta promised to be focused, in the case of election, exactly in the representation and preservation of funds.
He decided to participate in the last minute in the general meeting, so that this post-up of two months could go well to protect and present, in a broader context, its ideas on the management of the football.
"The people of all levels are occupied on the football already a long time and waits to meet this Thursday to the new President."
"On the time that someone has been able to manage the association," the man who has been partnered mainly with the Japonice Club, but who worked in the Party and the Executive Committee of the Association.
For this reason, you think you have enough experience to manage the Checo Fotbol.
It is convicted that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphory who reigned in the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Grevenly, the Statuss were adopted in the June General Assembly which were not so perfect as all thoughts."
"If we exclud certain interpretations, we have a president since September," he advertised Pelta.
Exactly, the read-up of the most important document of the Catholic Association was used as a synthetic to gain delegations.
"If you choose me, I'll take it as a personal challenge and I'm ready to answer if this falls."
"It's a question of principles, without which we can't exist," said Petta.
Furthermore, in theory, try not to look with his opponents.
He had already noted that he had been working with Henry Rajchl, who respected her training in law, being aware of his opponent would also be his first Vice-President.
He had already been a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, opposite Pelta, had not left the turtle with his head.
"Leave more than one year in the Futbol world, and has already achieved some success."
"They were attacks but they were astonished, and many people were surprised by the electoral campaign."
"Therefore many of them doubts about their true character," said his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the declarations declared already in September.
His strongest weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of the football, from the lower competition to the top.
This should be disappeared from fotbol promotion.
"As well, I would try to solve all the scandles that occurred because of the Bohemians as a result of the scanning of corruption in the past year."
"Instead afterwards I would involve in negotiations with the public sector and the private, to ensure that there's enough money for all the football," said the candidate for 46 years ago.
He also promised that his appointment as a President of the Football would not contain any personal amendments of the model.
"I would like to know first the tasks of each employee," he said, refering to Strahov, where, after a long period of anarchy, a comprehensive nervism is set.
Despite the current catastrographic scenarios that are vaticined before the next general meeting, he believes that delegates will not travel in vain this Thursday to Nymburk.
"If the only point of disappearance will be how to vote in the third round, we will certainly achieve it over.
"The flutbol requires credibility, which will only be recovered if finally has a leader," still two days before the most decisive day on his representative's road, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promised, under his leadership, the FA月R would start working with gains.
If the fourth General Assembly elected the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl as a new President of the Fütbol Association, many people would certainly be present.
Rajchl promises that, if you were elected, it would work hard.
It wants to implement a systematic change and to make the members of the Executive Committee responsible for each area of the football individually.
The Bohemians are also engaged in solving the case, improving the relations with UEFA and FIFA, obtaining more money for the football and continued with the work initiated by the previous President Ivan Hašek.
"As President, I would like to dedicate me to the flowball."
"Dece international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to selection, passing through vocational football or leading young high-effective juvenile bottles."
"In this I don't mean I'd do it alone," Rajchl said in a interview for the TK.
"I am a team player and I want to share the competences of the Executive Committee so that each member may be dedicated to a specific area."
"And I will draw difficult tasks so that the football can, in each of these segments, continue with a lot of improving."
"To many people, it probably will not like it, because it will mean start working very hard and not only critic the work of others," added.
Following the critical atmosphere in the ironic movement, it was said that it has considered the possibility of not to be submitted again as a candidate.
"All know that work 20 hours daily."
"But I need to know that this will be a sense and that there will be no people behind me who will prevent me and make an obstacle to every step," she explained so the reasons of their appointment.
"Much people said I shouldn't give me for vengeance, because then they would be given for the others too."
"It's trying to have faith not to leave so, without any more," said he.
According to them, he also motivated him to continue the work he already started with Hašek.
"In these two years, a great part of the work that I don't want to be paid now."
"There are processes that have been started and having their effect within a couple of years and I wouldn't like someone like it," she declared concerning the fact that, if they were elected to another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be again as it was before Hašek's epoca.
"I believe in the order, and it's something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to keep.
"From him is above all those people who would be occupied from the football to be just a privilege for some chosen ones."
"You can reprove a monster of things, but not the fact I am for someone."
"I intend to be a goal."
"I want to do a flowball for everyone, because they will only feel well all and not only the chosen," said Rajchl.
It also refuses the idea that the President would only be bohemed.
"When some are trying to confirm the contrary, I mean to do the maximum of Moravia."
"Before, it's time to think about the fact of divide the second division in a cheque and another flat, whose winners would go to the first division."
"I wouldn't be given the current situation in which we have only three teams of Moravia, which represents a problem for young guest players," said Rajchl.
In the fight of the presidency elections, Tomaš Paclík, President of the Club Pilsner, Rajchl did not believe in his opportunities to be elected.
"Today I feel like to have a strong support of the Czech Federation, which elected me as his Vice-President and knows that there are clear success behind me," said Rajchl, who had successfully understood the appreciation of a tens of millions of diventative contract coronas, televisional contracts and negotiations on the Lateria Law.
On the other hand, it recognises its part of fault in which federalation is not unified.
And while she proclaims that Pelta is "negalised to recover confidence in the Checo Football", considers the other rival, Paclik, as a strong candidate that has something to offer to the flatball.
"No one can deny that did a great work by the Pilsen that year."
"In the case that it is chosen, it will probably follow what Ivan Hašek had already started and will not be significantly changed in the committees."
"I don't want to use this for my favour," assess your Rajchl rivals.
Europe's best pools
Salt to blue
for Julia Stanek
Pinks from an incredible optic, enormous bathrooms in Budapest: The one who visits Europe can live its blue beauty, and, after a visit to the city or a turtle, spring its pigs in bridge bathrooms.
A book shows where the best well-being is in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip over the past year and half, there was something that couldn't miss in his balance, a bathroom.
Tomb of backs on the water, looked at the pooled artistics on the top, nothing towards the marmol angels, waiting for it on the beach side and sighted before the modern covered meticulous pool.
He liked the bathroom, noted in his book at the time of all interesting details on the style and the history of the building.
The Architectonic Meder studied more than 200 pools in this way and presented them in its recent book "Badefreuden", the pools covered in Munich, the historics of the bathroom in the Selva Black Selva, the "hormigone" in Taunus.
He realised its "award by the most excellent bathrooms in Central Europe" by 13 countries: also Germany, Austria and Switzerland, visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a real enthusiast of the bath culture.
He doesn't want to have anything to see with the sport, says Meder, only water is different.
Only it urges that the bathroom efficients have to comply with blue and clothes, while efficients can respirate the smooth oil of the bull forests or listen to the trine joy of the pearls in the park.
"On day I asked why the pools should always be so feed," said this inhabitant of Vienna.
"I started collecting good pools."
The surface of the water doubts architecture.
Chapter in the pool and the etery oil of the sauna. The well-being factor in the pools is so great because all senses are emerging, according to Meder.
And if the constructor runs out, the covered pools can be a true gift for view: "Instead of the ground, there is a water surface in the baths."
"For one side it is transparent, on the other hand reflects the beauty of all the building."
Everything is doubled optically: the blue highs, the colours blue, the trampolines.
The book with small photographs "Badefreuden" offers in 190 pages very interesting data about architecture and the history of art in the history of well-being oases, but mostly gives wines to salt up to the blue.
Meder, the pool collector discoveres the highlighted examples in their research in Hungary.
Along with the magnical medicinal bathrooms and the Szechenyi bathroom of Budapest, 100 years, waters with nitrates in a unique quarter cuvity (Battles in Miscolc-Tapolca), as well as the terms, whose pools are of alcalin waters and are found in a building with bottle (Városi Termálpredö in Jászberény).
Many covered pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectrum views: While all the city puts the eyes in Zurich's tear pool, you can look at Arlberb, covered snow, from the outdoor pool of a bathroom in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bathroom there is a window from which you can watch practice in ski ski pistes.
The design may be most extraordinary waiting for customers in Longenfeld: The Origin Water Cathedral seems to be a sheep that ends to land in the Alpes.
Three open sources rise up in winter, while the mountains of Austria rise up in the sky.
Alhambra in the Hells of Black
In Meder, the swimming collectionist did not invade the oil to chlor in all the pools.
Many thermal bathrooms take up to sugar, in the baths of Arpád in Békescsaba, Hungary, the gas weight is so strong that people believe that they have reached a health bathroom.
Oil comes from the medicinal water containing bicarbonate and alcaly, and the legal hair is throwing into the pool, a pleasure of the well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also discovered in a place in his search for good places for the bathroom, when I wanted to visit discovered pools and sun bathrooms in the Luhatschowitz bathroom, was found with a blocked ground.
The 1902 Bad of Duan Jurkovic Architek was closed.
When Meder looked through the democrated windows of the red, white and soft building, he saw the fault growing between the blue.
The decade was contrary to a lovely pool in the Black Selva: the Termal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction after themselves; not only can only be discovered neuromanic elements of its construction time in 1844, if not even an Alhambra Arab style hall added in 1900.
Since its exmerged modernization in 1995, the Termal Palace is the favorite bathroom of the pool collector, Iris Medder, and not only because it is natural of the Negra Selva.
"There has a lot of mercy to fum different architectonic styles in such a fantastic unit," said Meder.
In a palace so the inmersion in the third pool apparently does not have much importance.
Agriculture
German Bank analysis the business of primary materials
For Christian Teevs
Requests the German Bank to its business with primary agricultural materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has undertaken a working group to control the impacts of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the chief of the consortion wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg,
For citizens, the matter is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of the Germans not seem to be acceptable that banks spectify with agricultural primary materials such as trip or mass.
Two thirds of the investigations revive that the German Bank and other credit institutions are removed from this business because it increases the problems of the poorest world.
This is the result of a survey on the Foodwatch consumer organization.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in the middle October.
The author Harald Schumann shows that the adoptions on global primary material boundaries make prices, and the banks are charged with the responsibility of the world of hunger.
The consumer defender campaign is directed in particular to Josef Ackermann, the German Bank director, even though the large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting similarly.
Originally, primary material posts were thought to protect traders from price hospitalities.
The main experts agree that the players have disappeared from the offers and demands, and have been gained from the poorest costs.
Ackermann reacted to the criticians differently than the United States competitors: Promised to revise the reivindications and said that no business "effectively compromise the good name of the German Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, a international working group is revising the revivals of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be concluded at the end of the year, then the results of the German Bank shall be submitted together with the recommendation of how to manage the matter.
At the end of January, the bank address will inform the consequences.
At the end, the business of primary materials could be reduced, or even its total left.
Ackermann tries to fix her image.
The Thilo Bode, Foodwatch Foodch funder, held the news, but reaffirmed its criticians to the financial sector: "The approximates to growing food prices are particularly drastic how bank-related banks now cause public welfare."
Ackermann is the largest bank-capacist, especially in the obligations.
"The German Bank must announce all investments of your card in which put money for food prices," said Bode.
"Again, if Ackermann handles the theme of people who pass hungry or the name of the German Bank."
The inspection of Ackermann is surprised at the first view, but it is clear that the chief of the consortion wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leave your post.
On Monday, the German Bank published that the President of the Direction Council would change something different to the un planned in the Administration Council.
With the left of the contravertised agricultural speculation, you can improve your image.
And you need to import possible losses, so your successor will be occupied.
Two thirds analyze the investment in primary matters
Foodwatch is endeavoured to maintain pressure on the manager.
Until now, more than 30,000 internals have participated in the organization campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1.001 people on 7 and 8 November.
Nevertheless 10 percent, the German Bank considered legitimately that investments were offered to the food prices.
Many bank customers have shown personal consequences when discovered that his bank had participated in such businesses: according to the investigation, two thirds would analyze all investments from which money was sold from agricultural speculation.
The 43 percent of the disagreement would be a bank to its known, the 49 percent would request, after reflecting, reporting its account and changed to another institution.
Home 21 and Vienna
The mount moved
For Ingeborg Whitski
A story of architecturing with altibbies and an end of happy, the bottle of the Austrian universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 received premiums, was in Vienna for a museum, left empty and democrated.
Now it is opened as a house of exhibitions.
The modern poster architecture, clear forms, crystal halls, valent curves and new construction materials, types of thinking on technical progress, so the Australic architect Karl Schwanzer for the universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 is an appropriate and known example.
The Zwenzer's Pabellon then obtained the Great Architecture Price for its light and flowing steel and visual construction.
The construction is considered to be a contemporary heat of architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the brown of Austria in the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary tour of four cilindros for MBW more the adjacent building planned in Munich, it was internationally known.
His pabellion, designed as a temporary building for exhibitions, was raised after the universal exhibition in Swiss Garten near the south station of Vienna, was reformed in 1962, and a museum of the 20th century was called "cause 20".
The building was appropriate but was absence of appropriate spaces and technologies for a museum; no wall to collate art or a good environment.
Despite this, it was used until the contemporary art in Vienna had a new house.
The building is empty since 2001 and is always more than 10 more.
Currently, Adolf Crisanitz reformed the architect, now called it "cause 21" and it will be used in the future as a contemporary art museum.
On Tuesday afternoon, the beautiful museum inaugurated, which belongs to the house, with the first exhibition, a lot of luck in a certain way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the austrian Belgian Gallery since 2007, has achieved a new start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor in art history with a significant chariot, among other things, art patient on glaci in his youth, later in Sotheby, the Guggenheim Museum and the founder of the modern art museum of Salzburg, made reforms with the intensity of political and protectors of monuments, provided public funds and private patrocinators and established their use.
Except the contemporary art, the work of the Sculter Fritz Wotruba of the human fundation should have a cafeteria and a library and also build a office building.
Structural control, lower budget
Crisisanitz was the best choice to do it.
Not only because he reformed the section of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, it enlarged and added him the concours, if not because he studied with Zwenzwer in the Geneca University of Vienna and the Pabellon was a "weightful and immense light" in which he considered "the whole ends of week" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its use change with generosity and easyness.
In the current reforms there are great problems, the building was a "energy consumer", said Krishanitz.
The profile of the windows of the cristal flood has been changed, a reforested asylum crystal has been set with glass fiber and a cristal team was replaced by a special security crisis.
The thermic pumps and steel vigs were strengthened or replaced and the friendly teas were restored.
Two corners were used for the new use, a light panel down between the house and the street provides lighting, a servicing pub to enter into almost the new building, but still the Schwanzer pop.
Stay the original outdoor doors, the house is painted in old cold sounds and protected against oxidation.
And the film room is exactly as it was before.
And all this with a close control by the monumental office and a lower budget.
"Often I had to find materials that would be good, barato and also like the monument protection office," said Krishanitz and advise from a soil in the steel.
Despite all pressures, problems and reforms, the building is flexible and light.
The "the wine of Brussels" has been difficult, confirmed a little Krishanitz, a typical "accidental aparition in the history of the city".
A architecture so is "ever on the wrong place" and therefore he wanted to "detect the correct conscience".
In this case, house 21 is not in the wrong place, it has been a battle of urban happiness. The totally new and planned "center station bar", with homes and offices, is located near Swiss Garten.
And perhaps another luck occurred: The house 21 could receive a reinforcement of another construction of Krisanitz, because the French collegeist of Habsburg has bought the temporary artist's room in Berlinesa and, as it hears, businesses with the city on a neighbouring place in the Swisser Garten.
German Bahn plans a winter crisis package at millions
The company has idead a crisis plan that would avoid the railways of trains in winter.
The staff number must be doubled.
What's going on for millions.
In the fight against winter trains and delays, German Bahn has been expensed in this year more than 70 million euros, according to a periodic report.
The "Picture" period informed an internal crisis plan of the group of investments planned up to 2005 of a total of EUR 300 million.
In order to get a better availability of vehicles and railway networks still in an extreme time.
In addition, internal and external employees are planned to be doubled to 16,000 posts to disappear the neck of roads and drivings.
The goal is to clean the neck and iron eggs for the operation and 90 percent of the needed eggs for the operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grub, President of Deutsche Bahn, also advised the trains and delays during this winter after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Germane Bahn suffered significant problems in travelers transport, since, among other things, there was no reservations for adverse meteorological conditions.
Many new regional trains last years are waiting for a authorisation of the Federal Railway Office.
Furthermore, there is a delay in delivery of high speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn works for years in checking the eye of high speed trains in the workshop, after a high speed train suffers the rock of an egg in the central Colonia station.
The German Bank pays many billions in the United States.
After the tumult on President Josef Ackerman, there is a new problem of the United States, the German Bank must pay a lot of thousands.
As if the problems were not sufficient for the Deputy Bank, their past in the United States to acquire the sector's hazard, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million) in an agreement to put an end to the contents due to the removal of five large credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of hipotecary titles.
The NCUA financial market regulator recovers many large banks to bring credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized risks.
Those titles lost their value during the financial crisis and moved banks to deep levels.
"We are pleased to clarify the subject without the parties have to bear the courts," said a German Bank portfolio in New York.
The bank does not admit any fault with the agreement.
This is also applicable to Citigroup, which has granted a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, President of the NCUA, held the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for the credit cooperatives of the United States and provides support for the protection of customer investments.
NCUA is trying to reintegrate the losses of millions originated.
Currently closed agreements are their first type.
The regulatory also requested other large banks and on summer floods against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of the doubts of hypothetics, the named values supported by hypotecs are subject to the subject.
These are based on living credits.
When the United States ' s real estate bubble moved in 2007, the loss to many financial entities was lost.
In September 2008, the United States Investment Bank Lehman Brothers, on the financial crisis, declined the United States Investment Bank.
Although the results occurred a few years ago, it is now a complex wind for the United States banks.
The investors and inspection have undertaken uncontaminated processes to receive compensations or to sanctify lacks.
The Federal Financing Agency (FHFA in its English silks) has produced the greater number of demands.
Requests the 18 major international banks that the two US state hypothecary agencies have been used in the use of the hypertecs business in a volume of approximately $200 million.
The German Bank also has a request for FHFA, which is business for $14.2 million in 2005 to 2007.
Inspection requires that the Frankfurt Institute responds to "the substance loss", without a exact number.
The German Bank rejected debts as infunded and explained that he wanted to defend.
Warren Buffett contributions with 10 million IBM
The gorge of financing, Buffect, invest with force in the IBM Information Technology Company.
Since March, actions have been acquired for more than $10 million.
Until now the large American inversioner Warren Buffett has always declared not invest into computers and technology companies because the long-term development progress of the companies is negative.
But it has read the commercial report of IBM and changed its opinion on investing in the sector.
It was a lot to understand before IBM offers on all services and checks for computer systems for other companies' information departments.
In the financial world, an investment of Warren Buffect is considered as a honour.
Therefore, the primary of information technologies should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffect has currently developed in the CNBC economy emittor that IBM's actions had received a $10.7 million since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway investment has reached one of the most IBM attractors with a participation of 5,5 percent.
Buffect said IBM couldn't know anything of the commitment until now.
He welcomed the direction of ordinary benefits in the economic crisis.
"They have made a great work," said Buffect on the strategy.
IBM has been established since a time ago the services of lucrative information technologies as the functioning of calculation centres.
The old computer pioneer for more than 100 years also offers software and advice as well as powerful companies teams.
Buffett avoided technology companies until the date.
He said he was only investing in companies whose business it understands.
On the other hand, Buffect made the time on a train of goods, a manufacturer of lobbyers or mechanical engineer.
Your Berkshire Hathaway has nearly 80 own filials, and part of all of a series of great consortiums such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former Münchener Back.
Buffect, 81 years old, was charged by the small textil company Berkshire Hathaway in 60 and, with sweet investments, improved it to become it into one of the most precious enterprises of the world.
Yet, their style of life is humble.
That's why it's an idle for innumerable inversors throughout the world.
His fast and inflammable sense to win money has provided you the surname of Omaha's "Orcle".
After discovering Buffect's investment, IBM's actions in boost submit one percent.
"The blue Great", as it is known to IBM, has a bold value of more than $220 million and figure, together with Apple and Microsoft, between the most precious technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, signed Buffett, doesn't want to cooperate.
Bill Gates, your founder, is an immediate friend.
The threat is concrete
After the discovery of "Zwickau cell" the Turkish communication media are under the German law status.
A newspaper speaks of a " bloody ideology" that returns to live again.
Eight slaughters and Greece killers between the years 2001 and 2006 have a transbound of the extreme right.
In Turkey and in the German population of Turkish origin was reacted with fear and concern before this newspaper.
For many Germans of Turkish origin returned a fantasm that had been dead, from the attacks with a form of fire in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there were no more episodes of violence with extreme right to Turks.
Nevertheless, there was no question that xenofobia exists in Germany.
The overseer network discoveres a size which were not, or much less, predictable.
"After live the blood ideology?" titled the Internet edition of the Turkish "Haberturk" journal.
The "Sabah" period was contrary to the fact that one of the authors of the crime was an informant of the Federal Defence Office of the Constitution and is concerned that the German authorities may be involved in the ultra-detective Pantalla.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted with sensitiveness, the weekend recalled the victims of racistic violence with a watch before the Brandenburg Port.
Two weeks ago, the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish politicals reflected in a summer act of the fifty-year-year-old Turkish Agreement.
Conviction was made in scene with joyful colours, like a story with happy end.
The information came to some Turkish means as a bofeted: "The German gift for the 50-year-old, says the title of a article in the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", referring to the foundation of the murder chain.
The German emission "Hurrive" has not been able to translate this mental connection.
"Come to a bad olive oil," says the title of the Ahmet Wielahci column.
He stressed that murderers were those who payed their taxes and made an important contribution to their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
In the Turkish German Internet Fores, the police behaviour and its success in search is very critical.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not been seeking sovereign in the surrounding round.
Someone shows some less retourical regarding the drastics: "To now, immigrants will not remain more than self-defense and weapons."
"This will be the best self protection."
"The internal peace of Germany is strongly depending on the quality of clarification and adherence of sanction to all the network."
This means that, if the internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attacks of Mölln and Solingen will be cleared in nine years.
The image of Solingen's damage has been recorded in the German and Turkish memories.
No other success showed clearly to the Turkish people living here that there is a concrete threat to the Germans and that infection and disability could be disappeared in violence.
Attaques have aggressive feelings of the Turkish side.
Do not repeat past errors
The Turkish press was therefore criticised mainly by the deficiency of the German policy after attacks, Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the attraction in the form of a fire of Solingen, he sent a telegram of offence to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his minister of Foreign Affairs, he replaced it in the Colonia festival. Kinkel detailed in his discipline what contributes to the taxes of Germany.
It is clear how the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of its taxes.
The current information of the Turkish media returns to show that it is since then the lack of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the efforts of an overall explaining and revaluation of the extreme right terrorism in Germany, this time there are lack of French words.
The Scanning Bank of the Zurich Lake
The biggest European bank is not found in Italy or France, unless in Switzerland.
UBS almost entered into the financial crisis, and since the crisis was solved to the next.
Now it leads a German.
I'm sure Axel Weber hadn't thought about it.
After his spectrum left from the sum of the Federal Bank, in July 2013, it was recognized that he would start in a new and almost equally spectator of work: President of the Administrative Council of the Swedish Grand Bank, an unexpected and lucrative step on his road.
Axel Weber is publicly glad, enlightening Swiss for its beauty and the UBS for its receiving solidness and leaves good comments on his future fellows.
"The USB has achieved revitalization."
"I'm glad to cooperate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
In September, it was clear that everything would be completely different.
A USB financial operator in London prevented all bank security systems and disappeared 1.7 million euros.
Oswald Grübel, the USB General Director, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to appreciate.
The Chairman of the USB Administrative Board was considered as well as touched, and all asked: "When is Axel Weber?
Weber was recognized to be advised to the bank since February 2012.
And will be responsible for the presidency of the Administrative Council in May, not at the beginning of 2013, as the bank communicated on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
It is not a banker, more well, professor of economic and ascertain, and has had a certainly necessary adaptation period.
At the same time, the bank strategy is responsible, which has completed to prove that the title "the highest bank of the scanning of Europe" has been paid for a time.
On the one hand, the USB is large, until a few years ago was the greatest manager of global goods, and on the other hand, for years, is removed from a scanning to the next.
Nothing, so it seems to be offered to so proud Swedish bank year.
The financial crisis started.
The USB had a excellent name until 2007.
The image of the discreet and solid Swedish manager, but also mass, was combined with ambitious objectives, also wanted to be a large number of investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1,6 million, the USB manages more money of advertised customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, he grew up as a bank of investments in the link of the great banks of the world.
It's impressive.
Hans Geiger, the old banker and poster professor in Zurich for many years explains: "Before my students, I always calculated the USB as a model of a good bank."
"As the current point of view, one questions: How could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007, something was very bad in the USB.
During the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, Director-General, who had been considered as a gentle and very intelligent banker, was surprisedly allowed.
Some months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank investment fund was embarked in losses with high risk titles and had to love thousands of millions.
To load this, the USB announced a capital injection of nothing less than 13 million francs.
For this he found inversors, of course, that some looked with disappoint to a little time ago: a Asian and opacity state fund of Singapur and a Arab State Fund, such discreet, which never had heard his name.
This was just the first sword.
In April 2008, he started.
The Bank had to declare the loss of thousands of millions, Marcel Ospel, President of the Administrative Board, in 2006, at the lowest payment of Switzerland, he left.
In October 2008, the UBS continued the catastrophe, in view of its wrong investments, was found in the financial crisis before the clash and had to be redeemed by the state.
The National Bank has bought problems to the UBS for thousands of millions, and the Helvedtic Confederation gave six thousands of francs for a obligationly converteable good, which would be converted to the bank's co-profit.
The whole Switzerland was affected, confirmed the dramatics that it was for a small country, if he stayed at such large banks.
Finally, the amount of UBS balance in 2007 was more than five times more than the economic results of Switzerland (see graphical).
"We can't return to UBS," said Geiger, bank expert.
The first catastrophe joined the second.
A few months later, UBS capitalized in a fiscal conflict with America and was prepared to deliver the data of asseted clients, which might have detrued taxes with bank support.
Furthermore, the number of $780 million is of $780 million, the reimbursement of injustified benefits from these businesses with a payment compensation.
In this regard, UBS confided more or less of aid in fiscal offence.
Successfully he lost something that had been its capital in the competence by rich customers: the discretion gold.
After the screw, the secret of the Swedish bank is no longer the same.
This was followed by the Chairman of the Directive and the Chairman of the Administrative Board.
And the excursion of the customer's funds.
Thus, in a few months, the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in the investment bank through erroneous speculations and the administration of goods through fiscal fraude assistance.
And just when he returned to be something more quiet, just when it was thought that the UBS has returned to reach it, this disappointed story of the operator, a individual operator fell down 1,7 million euros before the bank was recognized that something was bad.
And, seeing, this is not yet working well with risk management in the investment bank.
"In the case Adoboli, risk controls have been too little changed," said Martin Janssen, professor of economy and financing at the University Bank Institute.
The financial director of a large German bank is also safe: "UBS's problem is that we do not dominate risk controls."
As a result of the idea of precaution, with which the Swedish bankers had been present for a long time, being the garders of the world’s greatest goods: there is no too large risk, in a case, the money security wants to cut on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security depositories of the Swedish banks were the symbol of the incredible reliability, such as Lindt and Auditors of the real chocolate.
The UBS center in Zurich does not bear with the Swedish private Bank Solid, only a little larger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its main seat on the Bahnhofstraße Street of Zurich, which goes from the main station directly to the Zurich lake, marked by the swimming snow covers of the Swiss mountains.
Here are the buildings close, the rentals are one of the highest in Europe.
There are joys such as Tiffany's traditional business between Swedish businesses as a confession.
For years, Swedish banks live: from the national bank, through the Credit Swiss palace, to private bank elitarys like Julius Bär.
It is entered into the UBS receipt room through a weak round door.
Inside the walls are revested by marmol, before there are large sills of corner, near the bank logo, there is a great litre to indicate the "safeness".
UBS knows what the client seeks here: Security.
The two Swedish banks, UBS and Credit Swiss, at some time, have put the idea of the Swedish Grand Bank, or have traded it, as the President of a small Swiss private bank.
Prefere not read their name in the newspaper, at the end and at the end, such as all Swedish bankers, also with both large banks businesses.
UBS has been too large, thinking, mostly in the investment bank, where the Englishs have gained the ground.
There the Swiss had nothing else to say.
"And have been shot up for a long time to the coasts of the English."
In fact, the UBS changed the bank of English investment, gave its first great gain and then came the disaster, no European financial entity had lost so much money in the high risk juung and the Swiss large.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was clear.
"The government coalition of the small country of seven million decided the greatest rescue operation in his history," the author Lukas HUM in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The UBS crash of" in Spanish).
Politicals granted up to 68 million or approximately 45 million euros to save the large bank.
How are they going to happen?
It is talking to Swedish bankers, so see the problem in the dimension of the UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three Swedish major banks are in a powerful consortium.
Surge a bank that, because of the fusion, was too large for the small Swiss, and continues to grow.
He therefore served to complement the UBS’s two different precursors banks: a rich bank but sleeped with the center of goods administration in Zurich and a poorer, but stronger.
At the sudden, internationalized investment banks arrived timely with a lot of money, which could make a big financial bicycle.
There are two names related to the UBS subside: Peter Wuffli, head of UBS from 2001 to 2007 and Marcel Ospel, then President of the Administrative Board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team," said Hans Geiger bank expert.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands much of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive that had continued to open a step from the learning in the bank to the summer."
Finally, Ospel was done from Wuffli.
And at the end Wuffli probably made a decisive error: "It thought that his models were a reality," said Geiger.
"It's a political case."
Tragic, maybe.
It's clear: The destiny came before the case.
UBS employees are clearly reminded of the directive meetings, in which Wuffli, the chief of the consortion, always reflected the same lema: down from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
"League Tables", classifications that then documented the success of the banks.
UBS wanted to be in the summit.
Some steps went out well.
The division operations and the negotiation of actions were the most highest.
However, undertaking advisers could be deep: In the international interest business, in the "fixed bank" language, there is a large compensation for the large banks.
UBS has empty in the American Hipotecary products.
To fill these emptys, the UBS started a adventure that almost cares of its existence.
Growth factors involved the same bank as one of its high risk funds created in high-risk US investments.
It was transformed into a powerful machine to hold the US hypocentric credits and sold them on the following, holding certain risks on their own account.
And, like other banks, they looked down for a long time.
"In summer 2007, as the American real estate market was called, the UBS bought there," said Geiger, bank expert.
So large the euforia, so deeply the fall.
A manager had to go, since the trial of order was more complicated than they were waiting.
The UBS posts became projectable seats and are insecuted until now.
Currently, who leads a big bank, has an almost impossible work.
There should be a strategy for a bank, before all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, expert in banks, has an idea, putting end to the investment bank, focusing on the administration of goods, returning to the Swiss races.
The bank doesn't want to reach so far (allway).
But the investment bank must decrease much, it is currently clear.
The next Thursday, Sergio Ermito, the new President of the Bank, will present its future strategy to the world.
In fact, it was only thought in the Italian-Swiss of 51 years as a transitional solution, since the bank was surprisedly separated from his President Grebel.
In addition, he is imposed: the UBS business must permanently direct the ships, communicated the Zurich bank on March.
Ermtie wants to return to the investment bank to your state at middle of the nine.
Press 3.500 posts.
But that's not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is he?
What do you want to win money?
These are the questions that secure makes Axel Weber currently.
Until the moment only says he will first find a housing with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.

Some like, others want to escape very quickly from them, the grass belong to the image of the city for years, but in many municipalities the neighbourhoods of the neighbour for the chariot and the voice of the animals are gathered.
Although it hasn't appeared any means against the "related farms" until now.
The grass are no longer out of the cities, acknowledges the experts in the first symposium on grass in Leer, East Frisia.

The grass are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 playing couples in Soest, Westfalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Ahim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
In 2005, a contravertised project was taken to kill mass to the district grass.
Criticals have calculated the cake of animals by traps for pigs and murder with pales as particularly brutal.

Divise with water to nids or throw trees are not desired consequences, also states Manfred Kaiser, expert in the middle of Lahr, Baden-Wurtemberg.

A long time, the project is accepted by tourists.

Mask at personal level
The intense and generous new book of Peter Englund, the beauty and the pain of the battle (The Beauty and the Sorrow): A great story about the First World War, "Come with a long dramatic person of the type that can make one the soul falls on his feet.
Here are some action advice: Take carefully this page and check it on your pagesmark.
It will be very well to know these people in the new newspaper of Mr. Englund, and this dramatic person will work as its GPS, a fair during the few moments where, as one of their men and women, is confused and uncommonized in the Neebla of War.
Mr. Englund is a Swiss journalist.
It is also the new Permanent Secretariat of the Swedish Academy, which grants the Nobel Prime of Literature.
What you have written here is a little correct book, which describes, surely, as "a anti-historia work".
It contains some noticeful names, important or famous battle treaties; practically there are no embarrassers, elegant journalists or discourses on tactics or materials.
It's not so much a book about what happened, explaining, as " a book about how happened."
" Beauty and pain of battle " combines experiences in wartimes of more than 20 men and women, both sides of war, from collectors and botanics to scales, doctors, ambulance and administrative conductors.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will be converted in war prisoners, or will lose their members, return or die.
Their lives are parpad here as a voting vessels in a church; some news add to the mixture while others spend.
The book of Mr. Englund is a deviation of the standard history books.
It is also a correct idea that the first World War was only the functional trincher war at the Western front.
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" moves in a form of expert through other war teaters: Alpes, Balkans, Eastern front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall on their coloms; one steps the Christship in Egypt under the piramides; the tse-third muscles are an intractual problem.
This is a conmovitor book, almost since the beginning.
The war affects the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, a Katrina Catholic Uriano who is catened.
When the artillery fire hears from the distance, and you're a woman who's at home with your children, are you staying or knees?
Who's coming from all ways?
Somebody understands what's going on, not even why you have to fight this war.
"Free of facts," notes Mr. Englund, "ha has been filled with conjuries, summers, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, theories of conspiration, dreams, weddings and rumores."
"The beauty and the pain of the battle" continues to individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English sister in the Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, a German young German fleet.
His stories have been obtained in most of the memories, letters and other materials already published previously.
The explanations of their lives may be grounded or consumer, but they are more full of life in the collection of small moments, lost details by Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about privates and to correct them with what it is.
About the story of a German collegial says, "Sucedans, by all parts of the Sudan."
"Café suddene, false aluminium, analyze gum, paper sales, wood bowl buttons."
It continues to speak about suit-developed food in Germany.
Describes "carne made from coyed arrow and pregnated in fat of meat (and recovered with a false wooden oil); tabaco made of races and pillars of sewed patates; saffles with wooden woods."
There are, notice, "837 allowed meat institutions in the production of salts, 511 recorded coffee institutions".
Some stories are about honor and value.
A American recognizes its own impuls towards the salvation and manuscription about the war: "Hearing that, after all, this is for what men are granted and not to sit in sillones with a cigarette and a whisky, the newspaper of the late or a good seller, and imagine that this barin means civilization and that there is no barber behind that almided and tacchaned."
An British soldier is understood that it will probably die, and that no one will be buried or imported.
"After one is resolved to think to be sacrificed, one would like to think it could happen before the public," writes.
Instead, it's terriblely like "a condemnation to be stretched in secret."
Another comments are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
"The conflict has always become a more economic competition," said Mr. Englund, "a war between manufacturings".
Release the arrival of what he calls "a new kind in the young beast of the age: The eloquent murderer and convicted ideologically with good confidence robes that performs his flesh while he sits behind a desktop."
People act in imprevised ways; there's both unnoveable behaviour and heroic.
Mr. Englund speaks of the soldiers who have actively tried to catch a venear disease of prostitutes as a form of evacuation of the service in the face.
"The greatest expression of this can be seen on the trade of homocotic puss, which soldiers buy and embark with it their genitals with hope to end in the hospital," describe.
"Thes who are really disappeared it on their eyes, what often gives place to a smoke of life."
In this translation of the Swiss made by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund agil, but it is not extravagant, it is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In tens of small scenes, the way the war to "exceptionally uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why your leaders are making them fighting.
The best books about the First World War often have been indirect, such as the Great War and modern memory of Paul Fussell, or the news as With News at Erich Mary Remark, instead of integrated storys.
The volume of Mr. Englund is a little conventional pantone.
Your book has one of the most destroying ends than I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I won't open it.
But it's like if I had come from his book, cut off from your fingers this dramatic person page, and would have burned it with a circle.
After a false step, a planned a minute
A hundreds of police officers were involucrated, some of them taking antidisturbs cases.
The night of Monday was chosen on Monday because the Zuccotti Park would be empty.
The operation was secretly kept for a few high-rang officials, saying to others who were joined to a year.
The police inspector of Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence subrayed how the operation was crashed by challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks could not be repeated, such as the cleaning of pyramy spray on the demonstrators, infringing the rules of the department and creating a public sympathy torment towards the "okupas".
And therefore, the police operation to disappear the Zuccotti manifestator park was revealed after two weeks of planning and driving.
Officers had been prepared as they had developed occupations in other cities.
A larger catastrophe image was located in Randalls Island, with an eye looking to Zuccotti.
The agents increased the named disordination - contra-terrorism measures that involved the mobilization of a large number of police officers - to focus on the Manhattan Lower.
The last entertainment meeting was in the Monday night, on the side of Manhattan of the East River.
The orders to enter into the park arrived in the "first minute," said someone familyized with the orders, which were revealed to the mission only as a "finder".
"On the little police I know they were called for this, not told them that it was to enter into the Zuccotti park," said the person who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter the Zuccotti park were at the highest levels of the apartment."
A reason for secretariat was a election learned by the city.
On October 14, some agents wanted to disappear the park, but they dismissed when hundreds of demonstrators rise up before hearing about the plans.
Martes operations involved agents of various police units, including special forces of all the municipal district - tens of mobile agents who usually wanted to introduce barriers with high crime index.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, such as those traveling daily to work, were going and coming from the park during the day, doing a good hour to enter.
"It was appropriate to do it when I was the lowest number of people in the park," said he.
Roosevelt Drive, near Manhattan's pool, was gathered in the Pike Slip cross with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive.
The lights and the prescripted messages that were removed from the highlights appeared to intimidate many demonstrators.
Many demonstrators simply collected their things and went.
No tent was touched until 1:45 a.m., said the police, giving time to the manifesters to collect their own skills.
Other agent teams were seen in meeting in the parameter to enter if they needed to detention in the park.
The periodists in the park were forced to leave him.
Paul J. Browne, the leader of the Department of Police, said that he was on his security.
But many journalists said that he was trying to avoid the police to enter into the park, and that they had been treated in brushly by the agents.
Mr. Browne said that the mobile television units in Church Street, on the west border of the park, could take images.
As the police moved to the west through the marriage density of personal effects of the demonstrators, including carriers and boards of paper and plastics, teams of the Department of Limpiece followed them, collecting what was left behind.
Some demonstrators that they refused to move were moved out, appearing images on the Internet a few times later.
A central group of demonstrators took positions near the kitchen area, near the park center.
Some have made a barrier, and the police went to arrest them metodally.
In turn to some 10 people in the camping epicentre, they were swallowed by their arms.
And two people caught down the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Aid officers of emergency service were called to cut the canded.
They have not been arrested in the park until less or less than 3:30 a.m.," Mr. Kelly said.
The disappearance operation was completed about 75 minutes later, said the police.
Mr. Browne said that some 142 people were arrested in the park.
The majority of the arrests were "alargement of the public order and resistance to the authority," said.
The highest rango at the scene was Joseph J. Spisito, head of the department, the highest former officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, head of detectives of the apartment, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while he was present, "I was not directing the operations," said Mr. Browne.
A second group of agents was waiting on the east side of Broadway, between the streets of Liberty and Cedar, where they had to enter.
They came to barried on the Cortlandt street, a block on the north of the park, and on the Pine street, a block south.
Since these positions, the police was seen extending the parameter even beyond the Zuccotti park.
At a moment, a series of agents, many of them with slaughters, were seen dragging people to the outside.
There were 28 people in the North Permetre.
Some of the laughest action in the night had place on the south of the park.
At the south of the Pine street, a demonstrator fell on the head of a police car, and others saw them get off the air from the roads of a police moonet.
At a given moment, a piece of contracepting went out of the multitude.
Finally, a agent and a manifestist were hospitalized.
The rate of support workers shall require the city for dismissed
The incident representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs in the past month planned to ask the city to the Middle of the Middle and stated that the dismissors were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their deproportioned impact on schools at poor students.
The demand may be the last weapon available in the municipal district 37, in its efforts to revok the disappearances.
Sixty-seven and two school assistants, the parents-co-ordinators and other employees who were among the poorest paid in the city lost their work on October 7, in a movement of synthetic leaders described as a political winning for their negative benefit to allow the past, the access by the city to a health fund based on the work groups to close its budget breach.
The municipal authorities have dismissed the accusation by catholy.
In a hearing at the meeting on the past month, the Board of Education, Dennis Mr. Walcott said that the waste were a part of the budget approved in June.
One member of the Council was contrary to him that nothing in the budget indicated that the members of the school support staff would be released.
The municipal district officers 37 said that they were submitted a written appeal by warning to the Department of Education that it would be requested. A press conference will be held to announce the official presentation of the request in the Supreme State Court in Manhattan.
The request will include Mr. Walcott and the Department of City Education as accused, and take account of eight employees who were defended as requesters, all of their black or Latin women, as well as the majority of the employers who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, by the Department of Justice of the City, said that the city had not seen the demand and therefore could not make comments on its specific statements.
According to a resumer of the demand received by The New York Times, the incident was focused on the number of dismissed in the poor schools of the city's poor areas to support an injust treaty, saying that poor schools lost more assistants, as they had been inadequately sustained in chronic form.
It is noted that, although there were no dismissed in Iceland and a few schools in East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in the District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn and 46 were released in the Distrits 8 and 9 in South Bronx.
Bearing in mind the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the demand said: "It is not a bar of adjourned parents who can retain funds to cover the budgetary deficit."
P.D. The Distrition Budget 36 was reduced in a 3,26 percent this year, and also lost money when the city has changed the way to calculate additional funding for each teaching by poor students in schools.
The incident also claims that secondary school directors may have been denied by the language in a memorandum that allows the release of parents coordinators.
The memory used the word "excepted" to describe the action, described more often the acts of translating to a teacher of a school to a work box, which are paid by the Central Office.
"Sept and six parents coordinators were released," said the borrower, "and not only in excessed".
Mission finished, the Congress prepared to reach an agreement on Libya
It seems finally that republics and democrates in the Capital Capital are willing to agree on something related to the resurrection in Libya.
All that was needed was that the rebellion had successful, that the ancient dictator Muamar the Gadafi had been captured and killed and the participation of the United States had come to his end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution which was made by President John Kerry (democrat by Massachusetts), together with Senators John McCain (republic by Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent by Connecticut), enclosing the libraries for his outstanding rebellion and the United States troops for its "valentity".
"This resolution is to honor the valleys of Libya, starting to reconstruct its country," said Kerry.
"It is a bipartite support for its democratic aspirations."
The language may seem inofensive, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy to now.
This summer, both parties legislators were shot between themselves and the White House on the formulation of a series of resolutions to adopt or reject the role of the United States military in the OTAN mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorised the limited use of United States military forces in Libya.
The draft law was thrown in the Chamber by a wide bipartist marge, which has never been voted in the Senate.
But on the same day that the law project was rejected in the Chamber, the room also rejected a measure that would be recovered the funds for the United States Operations in Liberia.
This left the U.S. in a kind of legislative cleaning - with the Congress it enoughly molest as to critic the manager by Obama of the mission, but not so painful as to actually seal herb under his feet.
As a result, the assumption of the Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of Libian rebels in August, and Gadafi was killed on October 20.
The OTAN mission was officially concluded on 31 October.
Now the Senator could be ready to act.
The resolution of the Foreign Committee "Good the people of Libya for its core and extraordinary resistance to save themselves" and "elogie to men and women of the United States Armed Force and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary valority and professionality."
The resolution also "reclams the national interest of the United States in a outstanding and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure provide the full support of the Committee for Foreign Affairs, or will he divide the legislative lawyers as did the draft June?
The last version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Location (India), the main republic of the Committee.
The location portrait said the Monday that it had not yet seen the final version of the new law project.
On the other side of the Capital Chapter, the Chamber will vote this week on a constitutional amendment that requires a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all republic congress and some democratics.
The measure, sponsored by the Republic of Bob Goodlatte (republic by Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other subject that actually achieve a vote of the whole meeting in the Chamber or Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not been successful until the time to reach its amendments to the meeting, but not because of the lack of attempts.
Goodlatte is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments introduced in this Congress, which cover a wide range of topics.
Some are doubled - the same law project is proposed both in the Chamber and in the Senate - and others with light changes.
There are at least 15 versions of the amendment of the budgetary balance only in the Chamber, and another pending that "Foveral expenditure will be monitored."
Some of these law projects are also identical among themselves, but they give their sponsors - above all new republics that seek to refine their curriculums - the opportunity to be tackled that they were "auteurs" of that measure.
The Budget Control Act, adopted in August, requested that both Chamber and Senate would vote a amendment of the budgetary balance.
In March 58 Senators voted for a non-binding resolution which supports the idea of that amendment.
In addition to the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates that the members of the Congress can meet, while the representative José E. Serrano (democracy by New York), wants to take the limit of two mandates to the Presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrated by Illinois) proposed a series of amendments which guarantee the right to quality and health care, inter alia.
A amendment which prevents homosexual marriage is a pere proposal, as well as one who prohibites the band cluster.
Some legislators also want to allow the allegation of federal laws if two thirds of the state are rejected.
Thus enthusiasm that members have been at the time to propose amendments, they are not moved to a faster ritmo than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments and submitted 66 on 110.
The ritm is unacceptable in comparison with the 1990s, when members regularly presented more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the numbers provided by the Senate Library.
But they did not have much more success then than what they have now.
The last amendment that was added - 27 was ratified in 1992, but actually the Congress was proposed in 1789.
"Golpeda but don't break down," Giffords speaks in his first TV interview from the tirote
On ten months after a weapon shot him in a former act in Tucson, the representative Gabrielle Giffords (democrat by Arizona) appeared in the national television the moon night, sing with the Broadway melody "The sun will come tomorrow" and said he wanted to recover more than he wanted to return to the Congress.
In his appearance in ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords fought to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The programme documented its difficult way of turning the damages occurred by a ballo that fractured his crown and overlaid the left side of his brain, and passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he was surprised to the Chamber to emit his triunfling vote in the debt team agreement.
In his first television interview from January, who killed six and killed 13, Giffords sounded, ridded and shouted - and described his recovery as "dificil".
When Sawyer asked him how he feels, Giffords, 41 years old, he answered, "That good."
The interview with Giffords and his husband, astronauta Mark Kelly, was part of a special program of "20/20" of a duration hour, which was emitted the vision of the publication of the new book of the couple, "Gabby: A coraje and hope".
The special programme analyzed the recovery of Giffords since the 8 January.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first weeks, it sees it in his hospital bed, with the abeded head and a long cicatriz through his face.
She can only keep one or two wrested fingers, while her husband's soul.
Last months later, he sees Giffords sitting in a road scene while the terapeutes teach him how to do simple actions.
A head move.
A fruit of the lips.
And then, his first word: "What".
In a few days, Giffords announced another word - "today," a request for change in his disaster menu.
Videos distributed by ABC show that the music played a central role in the recovery of Giffords: See the Congressist sing together with the therapeutes "Girls Just Wanna Have Fune" from Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" of Tom Petty.
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, which has two hours of treatment every day, said he didn't remember the day of the tirote.
Her husband said he was reading to Giffords a new article on the murder of 12 March when she had held him to ask for the first time about the six had died in the accident.
The suspect weapon, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a prison of Missouri and is medited by force while waiting for judgment.
"So many people died," Giffords said to Sawyer.
"Down, hard, hard."
Kelly said to Sawyer that at a moment of recovery of his wife, she said, "I was shot."
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been disappeared," said Kelly.
"You just have been killed.
And you'll go out of this, and you'll get back and go back with more force than ever."
The troops feel more slow than respect
The event was a Wall Street galate that regained millions of dollars for no households in New York.
Kid Rock shouted a ball on impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundreds of soldiers, mariners, aircraft and marine infants were shot in his posts back to him.
The multitude of the label was standing and shot.
"The men and women were considered as heroes," said David Saltzman, who organized primary funds.
A high-rang military military officer in the gala, also known as the President of the Joint Mayor State, Almighty Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops in different ways.
"They showed them as a kind of dark child," wrote the officer in an email.
I'm sure the organizations had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But he wasn't respected, it was slow.
The marked contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has been supported by military people and a American public often distant, sometimes, worshiper.
The troops are promised for their sacrifices.
But pleasure has a price, the members of the service.
The public is always more acting as if they have suffered of those uniforms.
"We are not absolutely victims," said the general of brigade Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way some show their support is to bring us into the role of disobedient souls."
The subject is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, which do not wish to look insufficient or in uncomfortable with the public they serve.
It was also recognized that the wrath to which troops came back in the last years of Vietnam war was very worse.
As a result, most of the discussions on the laste are held in silence and privately among war veterans.
After her two children returned to fight against the Marina Infantry, the retired coronel Mark Cancen warned them that the individuals of the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would be asking whether it would be a "harry and violent life under the surface," said Canzan, who played in Iraq and returned to a high level of government work in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had asked him soon if it would be able to water under the pressure of a requisite work of Washington immediately after his fight.
"When you talk about your service, you need to face negative impressions," Canzan remembered talking to his children.
The military concern is, partly, of the United States indifference to wars.
The achievements in the battle field are rarely elected for the pleasure of a country that has little family with the military and see little direct benefits of Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, are no longer valued the military heroism in ways that were of all commons in the Second World War," said the general retreated David Barno, who commanded the United States troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, the elections of political and public policy are highly focused on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
The troops are recognized by the number of rounds that have supported, the number of friends who have lost or the ration of their lessons.
The Army faces a growing pressure to end with violation
This week, a historic hearing will decide if 28 women and men have an case against the army for their admission of passivity to the violation.
If not, hundreds of applicants are organized for the next.
The first Elizabeth Lyman soldier had 25 years and 11 weeks of marriage the night in which she said that she was violated by a fellow.
It was October 2008, and turned back to his quarter in the Miramar Base Air, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he found a colleague with a 12-band bracelet package.
He asked her if he could join her in her room to take a drink.
"It was a alarm sign," says Lyman.
However, Texas's birthday left on one side his concern.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"It's Texas," says he.
"If she had listened to my instincts."
At a few minutes to enter Lyman's room, the man came back to him, throwing her down and seeing her, added.
This week, on 18 November, Lyman and other 27 of the current military personnel and old members, are concerned that a court decision will be held in Arlington, Virginia, which will decide whether the request they have to be interfered against the Defence Secretary of Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Rumsfeld will be judged.
The question stated that Gates and Rumsfeld had affected the reduction of generalized violation between the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
In February, presentated by Susan Burke, a Washington's subscription, D.C., the question was initially involved 17 applicants, but grew up to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all claim that they were violated or sexually adhered by their fellows, and that the army expired at the time of investigation, processing, or learning proper justice after the proposed aggression.
Burke says he's going through the larger plane of the army, because the problem begins with them.
"The army is an upper structure," says he.
"Who are those who are in a position to eradicate the culture of representations? The high order."
Burke also says that since February, they have been contacted with her about 400 survivors, many of which could be part of future demands.
Its strategy: Instead to assemble all the applicants in this case, putting all eggs in the same time, so it will be given a number of cases, if necessary, to keep pressure.
The defence team for the Department of Defence, undertaken by the Federal Industrial Neil MacBride, has presented a motion to dismiss the case.
The documents of the Court, obtained by Newweek, detail the Defence Strategy - there is no, that military forces cannot be requested by current or old soldiers by the lessons suffered in armed forces.
For a sentence of the Supreme Court of 1950 called Doctrina Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for the damage suffered by the staff in active service.
"Againd damages are part of the military service of the applicants", says the documents.
The Department of Defence refused comments to this article.
The things have changed from the 50 years.
While women are still officially prohibited to serve in combat, this distinction is only nominal: modern wars are rarely clear the lines of the face.
As in Iraq and in Afghanistan, sold women teams are always playing more important roles, especially to reach local women in war areas.
The result: among these two wars, 150 sold women died and two thirds of them in battle situations.
It's time that the army is also modern, says Burke.
She is not alone in her fight, and other three questions are gone, besides your own.
In the Yale's Law Faculty, the Veterian Legal Service Clinic is preparing an case against the four main military academies for the purpose of promoting a missionary environment.
In addition, the non-profit organization of Vietnam Veterans of America is composing a request against the army focusing on the " personality diagnostics" diagnosis for victims of violation to give them the high service - a common success, according to the activeists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women Action Network, a group of Human Rights.
His group presented a request in December against the Administration of Veterians, accusing her of discrimination practices in the managing of benefits for persons who said have been sexually enhanced in the service.
Nine Legislation Projects were presented separately in the Congress by a bipartite mixture of Senators and Representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010 there were 3.158 denunciated sex attacks, under the Office for the Prevention of the Sexual Action and Response of the Department of Defence.
However, aggression was notably unlawed, and by the own estimates of the Pentagon, which is approximately 13.5 percent of the 19,000 estimated incidents that have occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also reviewed processing indexes: in 2010, 20 per cent of the cases denunciated in the army was judged - half of the system of civil justice.
The applicants in the case of Burke, describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he acknowledged the premature violation of military police less than one hour after it happens.
That night, he said, he was asked to tell the details of his violation 11 times different to a multitude of police, doctors, and commanders.
She submitted a kit of violation, and the blood of her aggression - of a corte in his arm-- was found in his bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a hearing before a judge, during which he asked about having sexual relations with her husband on the day of the attack.
Six persons declared as a witness of personality on behalf of the author, which was finally absent.
"I'm receiving the day when the verification was read," says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to work -- I found crying out of the room."
"They put me into the psychiatry unit, and when I went out, I remember that I told him my command officer, "It was not your judgment. This was my judgment."
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatr, which finally diagnosed a carrier of personality, which did not fit it for the service.
In January 2010, the service was dispersed under less honorable terms, and it impededs to receive any benefit.
As regards whether the case submitted by Lyman and his companions of demand continues, it is a very remote opportunity, says John Turley, professor of law in the George Washington Faculty Faculty.
However, he notes: "In my view, they should be able to continue."
What is interacted between them and a verification is this doctrine which has been criticised since the first time it was published.
I was a permanent critic of Dr. Feres.
The army is decayed behind because he has no same incentive and dissuasion planned for the responsibility.
And he adds: "The probability is strongly against them, but it's important for them to try it."
These things only change when good people are ready to fight.
If the audition doesn't go through your way, Burke, advocated by the applicants, you will put to the cola to its other hundreds of applicants for future cases.
"We'll continue to fight the army on this subject until the reform is produced."
"O until we die, what happens first.
The walls have eyes: How researchers are studying you in Facebook
Before converting in the new face of the extreme right face in Europe, Anders Behring Brevik was just another type that was on his online anti-immigration point.
On Monday, Brevik, who admitted a murder in Norway in July, who left 77 dead, was the first public hearing.
While Brevik could only have acted, he was far away from being on the ciber Space: it was the majority of the time before his attack against his computer, with some of the millions of nationals that support the rights groups in social networks.
After the tragedy of this summer, the investigators wanted to know more about these people.
But, how do we find them?
Facil - you just have to go to Facebook.
"We know that it was not so difficult to reach them," said Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recently published report on the European digital population by the British DMOS research centre.
The Facebook personal information site is so encycllopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the publicity tool to determine their demographical features desired with a scientific precise - the way that vendors have been used for years.
Bartlett's team found average million fans of the right groups throughout Europe and then told them announcement, but instead of linking them to a new band or dental product, the advertisements invited users to complete a survey he asked about their educational level, attitudes toward violence and optimism on their own future.
As he arrived through Facebook, Bartlett and her colleagues were able to study more than 100,000 followers from 14 extreme right parts in 11 European countries - all without going out of the office.
"It's a totally new way to make an investigation," says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not all surprised: the on-line partners of the rights groups have to be young, men and immigration.
However, in a kind of rotation, "whichs who combine their online activity with the outer line activity are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind the computer screen".
DEMOS's work is only a example of how Facebook is becomes a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research Centres, medical and political researchers are using the site to study everything, from health problems to social trends as expressed in "I like", messages in the walls and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users, adding a average of three pieces of content per day, the "super new data" of Facebook is generating an increase in research, stimuling the number of academic work with the name of the site on the title up to almost 800% in the last five years.
For some researchers, Facebook beauty is allowing you to study people that you couldn't approach with a folder on the street.
"There, when you tried to find people in the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You would like to go through the game, and they would never allow you to access," said Bartlett.
"Facebook removes all this - you'll go to them right."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address social health problems.
A recent study carried out by Dr. Megan Moreno, the University of Wisconsin-Madaton and its colleagues, found that university students who talked about their skills to remove in Facebook had significantly more risk of having drinking problems than students who remained quietly on the subject.
Moreover, it suggests that students’ partners, such as residential consequences, could control the site and intervene to help a student who has been publicly updated with their borrows.
"You can't do a problem if you can't diagnosize it," said Dimitri Christakis, Co-autor of Moreno and Director of the Health Centre, Training and Development of Children in the Seattle Child Research Institute, said Washington Post.
"We found a way to identify children in risk that otherwise they wouldn't be diagnosed."
Facebook is also constantly "pinching" to your own population to get data.
The Site Data Team has developed statistics on the state of the relationship and the San Valentín Day, the electoral participation expectation at half of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Felicity index (the mainly using the information you can access - digital liberty defenders have been given a long time that the site should provide its large number of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the website is watching them, pleases them or not - the victim to play the Scrabble with a friend to thousands of kilometers of distance is allowed to the site my my my personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users are going to form part of a investigation that they don't even know?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data outline, online is a free bar for all.
"I don't think many of the users have even thought of the fact that a investigator could be examined by its profiles," says Neil Selwyn, a Sociology of the Londres Laboratory, on a study of 2006 who carried out with the public Facebook student walls.
"In what they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends."
Then this is the question of methodology.
Even outside line, there is no guarantee that a question of research is fully honest.
In Facebook, it is impossible to know that part of the information about a user's profile and wall messages are true.
"What you say in Facebook and what you're doing outside Facebook are two completely different things," says Selwyn.
This is why, despite its years as technological researcher, Selwyn believes that a sub-papels and a bulletin are still the best research tools that no one can use.
"It's no institution to enter into the real world and talk to the real people," says he.
"Society research is supposed to be on the social - and a amount of social is still going out of line."
"Free and inhuman: Anders Behring Brevik makes its first public appearance in the court
Anders Behring Brevik, the man who convicted to be the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has been described himself as a fighter of "resistance" during his first public appearance in Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Norwegian Temples Caballeros," said a room full of 500 people.
"I oppose the court because he received the mandate of organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I know the facts, but I don't make a fault."
The judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Brevik during that monologe, because "I didn't want to give Brevik the opportunity to use this audition as a platform to expose its views."
For the same reason, it was refused to allow Brevik, which brought a written talk with a prelation, to be addressed to the families of their victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also commanded the police to keep Brevik under garde for 12 weeks more, prohibited access to communication media for four weeks and said that the authorities should have a close control on all visits and matching for eight weeks.
Foreigners of 30 survivors and families of victims attended the audience.
Some came with hope to look at Brevik at the eyes, others to confirm that it was recruited under the key.
All attended the goal of progress towards the conclusion.
"I think it seemed so fred and inhuman," said a survival from Utoya to the Norway Emirate NRK.
"That's inconsistent, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Seeing with a dark and blue tray, Brevik was calmed and professional at the hearing and looked at the journalists and survivors when he entered and went out of the building.
Despite Brevik's strange notion of being part of a "growder resistance" movement, the judge determined that it is not a mental sick, and said that there are no evidence that it would act with compliances.
Some may be consequent that the attacks of 22 July may appear to be an extremist work instead of a root group.
But this does not automatically seem the pain and confusion that all a nation still feels.
"I would like to look like a monster, but it doesn't look like," said a family of a victim.
"It would be much easier if I would see it."
7 Lections of the lost interview by Steve Jobs, are shown in a teatro this week
After the death of Steve Jobs, on October 5, there were some comparisons with Henry Ford, distinguing the genie of technology as the Great Inventor Modern.
But what Apple's fans could find more discovery, in a recent interview to Jobs revealed to which it has been disappeared as an advancement of a series of special projects in the highest markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about trade processes and products workers.
It was uncertainly a designer, dream and hypersensitive authorized, but also was a meticulous organization and a yonki of the fluid diagrams - a man who thought that many executives would suffer " a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is the 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a great amount of work between a great idea and a great product.
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds (The Triunfo of the Idiots) on the albums of the personal computer, and sat up for more than one hour with Jobs for an extended and rare conversation.
At that time, 10 years since Jobs had been bound to leave Apple, and had already worked intensely in its new NeXT informatic company, waiting for the public adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the Cringely interview was used in Nerds, he said that the original interview was disappeared during its transport.
It was only after Jobs’ death that was discovered a complete copy in VHS in the garage of the director.
This file material, lightly reedited, is the basis of Steve Jobs: The lost interview, of 68 minutes, which reachs the cinnes of Landmark this mercury and Thursday.
For someone known to hate deep interviews, Jobs here seems a surprisely ready to expose its technological philosophy and commercial strategies.
And very thoughtful.
In four different points on the length of the interview, there are great silence between questions and answers - from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly subjecting their thoughts, looking for precisely.
There are also moments in which Jobs' perfectism comes to the surface, where it seems to be imposed because of Cringely's questions, urged him to go faster to the topics or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before Pixar, iPod or iPhone, there's something extraordinary prophetic in the lost interview when Jobs evaluates what other companies do well and bad, and offers their own vision of the future of the information.
One thing is reading pseudomy evaluations of Jobs' road, but there's something crude and inspiring on Jobs that we see here, the worried dream on the border of the greatness.
He has a vision of how they can and must be things.
Not far after explaining it all with details here, he went and did it.
A rapid summary of seven notable sequences of the lost interview:
On how he learned to take a business:
"In the years of business, I always asked, "Why do you do things?" and the answers that give you unchanged are: "Oh, that's just how it's done."
No one knows why he does what he does, in business no one thinks of the very deep things.
That's what I found.
Jobs takes its efforts to simplify Apple's accountability.
The costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard Costa" that had been made with good cow eye, and then corrected with a "variable" - developed a automated factory that could assure the costs of trade in the detail.
Over the brome to Daddy:
Jobs tells the "Caja Azul" that he himself built with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to make the telephone company effectively calling to a long free distance.
It has been widely written about the device, but Jobs' eufory here, described the AZul Caja as an empodering act is contained.
Description how he and Wozniak tried the box through the use of a public phone, making a call, and then connected from a AT & T network to another, while creating a buckle with the most possible quantity of satellites.
"We've played things around the world a 12-fold and you cried through the public phone and returned a minute later to the public phone from the door on the side", says Jobs with a laugh.
"We were young and we learned was that we could build something to us that could control thousands of millions of dollars in infrastructure throughout the world."
We two, we didn't know so much, but we could build a small thing that could control a huge thing - it was an incredible choice, and I don't think there had never been Apple without it.
Jobs continued to describe a glorious bromea that he and Wozniak almost left, calling the Vatican through the Caja Azul at midnight and requesting to talk to the Dad, while he made his best follow-up by Henry Kissinger.
Since several Catholic Jerarchy members were gathered half night to speak with the United States diplomatics, the two were washed in carcasts right before the Pope was discovered to go to answer the phone.
Based on love of technology (and sale by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, at the laptop of retained pieces to build a frequency container, he searched Bill Hewlett on the telephone guide and made him a call.
A few minutes after its 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs took a partial summer job in Hewlett-Packard.
"It was a notable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen that age and formed my vision of what was a business and what they were doing with their employees."
Jobs became afterward to one of the HP employees who visited the company's research laboratory in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first table computer never done".
It was so big as a malte, had a small cathodical tube screen, and I'll love him.
It would gain a travel to HP as adolescent and lose time with that machine and write programs for it.
To improvise innovation:
In several points of the interview, Jobs speaks about inventating new products on the road.
Immediately on his road, since it was commanded to sell a base plate shot, a client asked him if he could touch the whole team.
Working with only 30 days of credit, I needed to see the mountain and delivery of the complete devices.
Furthermore, while he was in Apple, remember the fights he faced in the development of a computer mouse:
"I agree to have dramatic arguments... they cried that five years would be needed [for creating a mouse that would cost $300], and I felt and went out and found a designer.
Nothing days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15, and that was totally reliable.
On large enterprises losing force:
Before Apple's renaissance, Jobs had prophecyly prevented the way that many leaders of the industry would throw into their vision and lose the control of their market quota.
"Do you say that you're working on IBM or Xerox, so you're doing better pictures and printers, and what?"
You have the monopolie of the market quota, so the company has no longer success.
The sale and marketing departments will increase successfully, so this kind of persons who end through the direction of enterprises and those undertakings of products are exempt from the forum for decision-making.
The genius of products brought to this monopolio is caused by persons who do not have the notion of good products vs bad products - the knowledge of the necessary office.
That's what happened in Xerox...
Xerox could have been added from all the computer industry.
Maybe it had been ten times your size, it might have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They took the waste of the victory.
On innovation as artist expression:
"There is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as it evolves the big idea, changes and grows."
A lot is learned about the sustainability of the same.
There are sacrifices you have to do - some things you can't do that the electrons, the visa do it, the robots do it, the factors do it.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain - these concepts - just correct them all at the time...
Finally, everything is reduced to the hot - it's turned to try to expose whatever a man's team has done, and then try to adapt these things to what you are doing.
Picasso said the good artists copy, the big artists rose.
We never had angry about ruining great ideas.
What partly did at Macintosh was that people who worked in him were music, poetes, artists, zoologists, stories, who eventually were the best computer scientists of the world.
If not through the computer, it could be done wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with the rivals of the health law while the court accepts the case
The day that the Supreme Court was closed to the door to consider the politically contrary question of whether they would accept the challenge of the health law of President Obama, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were assigned at a dinner sponsored by the law of lawyers that would be made before the High Court.
The time was the past Thursday, when the nine judges were meetings in a preliminary hearing to investigate the requests of review.
One of the cases concerned was a request submitted by 26 States by dismissing the overall reform of health assistance adopted by the Congress last year, a law that was a war cry for conservators throughout the country.
The judges agreed to grant the request and, in fact, expected an historic advisor of 5 hours and average March, and the result probably will be more tolerated by the presidency route of 2012, which will be fully supported at the time that the decision of the Court was known.
The lawyer who will compare to the court and will declare that the law must be denied will probably be Paul Clement, who served as a general fiscal of the United States during the government of George W. Bush.
Clement lawyers, Bancroft PLLC, was one of the almost two ten enterprises who helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federal Society, a group which takes many years dedicated to the defence of the conservative legal principles.
Another sign that paid the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that disappeared the law, the National Federation of Independent Negotiations.
Another sponsor was the Great farmaceutic Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the result of the litigio.
Dinner was held in a Washington hotel, hours after the preliminary hearing of the court on the case.
Among other assistants, Mitch McConnell was the most important republic in the Senate and a declarated health care law.
Special invitations at dinner?
It's nothing new: the two judges have attended events of the Federal Society for years.
And it's not something to enter into conflict with ethical rules.
In fact, the judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the acts of the lower federal judges.
If it was not, it might be said that they would fall under the Canon Code 4C, which said: "A judge may assist events to ensure funds of organizations related to law and others, although the judge cannot be a speaker, a honor-inviter or to contain in the programme of such a event " .
However, the absolute neighbourhood of Scalia and Thomas at two of the lawyer buffets in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was sufficient to warn the government's actives.
"This impresional breach of the ethical and indiference towards the code is contrary to the requests of several judges which have taken the court by the same rules that apply to all federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Cause (Common Cause).
"The judges were aggregated in the recruitment of gala funds with lawyers who have cases depending on the court."
His appearance and assistance in the recruitment of funds for this event suffered any demand of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in the criticals that say that they are too easy to mix the court's activity with the agenda imposed by groups such as the Federal Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a great conservative activist.
On the other hand, the conservators argue that it is the Judge Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as a general prosecutor of the Administration of Obama when the first legal challenges were presented to the law in the court of first instance.
His criticals have been pressed that Kagan stopped seeing the case, saying that he was too involved in defending law as for now to be impartial.
Kagan hasn't given any indication that I'm going to do it.
Boeing receives an record request of $18 million
The Emirates Airline requests 50 double passenger flights Boeing 777, with option to 20 more.
Boeing also sold six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft, an operation valued in more than thousands of dollars.
Rarely news when a company gets a request of 50 units of your product.
But it is a great transaction when the company is the Boeing Co car producer and the sale price for the 50 airports is accompanied by a 18 million dollars record.
It's so large as the place of Boeing received the order: Middle East, a gold mine in growing in future flight requests.
In a Monday study, the Chicago company considers that in the next 20 years the airlines in the Middle East will need $2,520 airports for $450 million.
Boeing announced during the weekend your greatest demand for commercial aircraft for its value in dollars - $50 jets Boing 777 double past.
The requested wine of Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy more than 20 aircrafts, which would increase the total sale price to $26,000, announced Boeing in Dubai Airport 2011.
Then, the moon, Boeing said Oman Air had asked six Boeing 787-8s, the named Dreamliner, which was imposed from a fuel warrant and a few services for spectacular passengers.
The sale price for six is more than a million dollars.
"It's clearly have a huge positive effect for Boeing," said the Morningstar Dihora analist.
"The quality of these customers in particular is very strong."
Many airlines in the Middle East are property of their petroleum producer nations.
So they have not only money to pay the airlines, but that an increase in fuel prices - generally perjudicial for airlines, because it is one of the greatest costs - it is not so damaging, because the country is winning money with the increase of the petroleum price.
This is important because they have less probability than other airlines to cancel or switch flight orders when fuel prices increase, said Dihora.
"There have a natural protection," said.
The demand of the Emiratos solidarizes the Boeing leadership on the wide fuel market and helps to maintain the attempt of your airbus SAS invade their dominio with the A350 passenger aircraft.
Boeing's victory in the air burden is produced four months after Airbus said that it was going to retain the debut of the largest A350, which is directly with 777-300ER.
He retained the debtor to add more impulsion after clients extract an increase in useful load and rango.
Boeing Co actions were 1.5 per cent to 67.94 dollars.
The sister of the President of Mexico, seeming to be destroyed in the Michaan vote
Luisa Mary Calderon states that the narcotraffaries helped their opponent of the PRI, Fausto Vallejo, in the containing for manager.
The sister of President Phillipe Calderon seems to have lost its candidate to Michaakán's governance during the elections of the violent state, and she confirmed the moon that the narcotraffaries helped to draw the road for one of its opponents.
Preliminary results gave the front for the Western State Governor to Fausto Vallejo, the institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI.
"The intervention of the crime organized during all the electoral process and, above all yesterday, is not only alarming for Michakán, but for the whole country," said Luis Mary Calderon in a radio interview a day after the vote of Sunday.
"Amended our candidates, our electoral workers... helped the urines, installed barriers... and ordered people to vote" for the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until the presidency was lost in 2000.
However, it is the lance of a return, and the victory in Michaan is an important step in that efforts.
The PRI has hope of winning the presidency elections in July.
Vallejo seems to have overcome a little marge to Calderon, who had led the investigations before the elections.
Calderón, a candidate of the Conservatory Part of National Action of his brother, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left candidate by the Democratic Revolution Party or PRD, currently occupied by the Governing Office, remained thirdly a great delay for the left divided and unfortunate before the presidency elections of 2012.
Aureoles were also refused to recognize the previous results.
Vallejo, exalcal of the capital of the Morelia State, refused links with the narcotrate and urged other candidates to accept the results.
Michoakan has long been dominated by cartels of drugs specialized in marihuana, heroin and metanfetamin.
It is the birth state of Chairman Calderon, and he elected Michoakan to launch a military offence against traffickers in December 2006.
However, violence has remained.
A PAN hall was killed a week prior to the elections while the campaign by Luisa Calderon, and many candidates left local candidates for fear.
Although the PRI, because it is ungrateful that appears to Michaan's elections, will help the game to encourage.
The man who is present will represent the PRI in the presidency elections, Enrique Peña Neo, speaking from Washington, welcomed Vallejo and said, "I think that this victory should be very excited, faced in the next year."
The BASD urged Asia to assist the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has made a call to India and China to be prepared to help rescue the eurozone of its sovereign debt crisis to avoid long-term reaction that would prevent the growth of Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, Director-General of the Asian Development Bank in Manila, said that the two larger growth economies in the world had to "do everything as possible" to accelerate the recovery of the economic block already outside the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He advertised against the BRIC [Brasil, Russia, India, China] countries that observe Europe’s difficulties in a "parte" way and said that Asian financial assistance together with the leading and European resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all together."
"So everyone who can help Europe to get out of the crisis is useful," said the Financial Times in an interview under the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asy can be protected in some measure, but it cannot be immune."
"So if China and India can help, it's all the means."
The European monetary unit has been seriously disappeared by a sovereign debt crisis in the last months.
During the last days, Italian debt costs have been dangerously disappeared and the first ministers of Italy and Greece have dismissed.
The current crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has increased fears that the global economy could support reception and has generated the main emergency economy to help the eurozone to find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any Asian support would be canceled through the FMI, but he said that bilateral assistance - as the purchase of the goods of the EU rescue fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered a greater negotiation force for the Asian partners of Europe.
Anand Sharma, Indian Minister of Commercio, said that "India will do everything as possible" to help the eurozone since his own economy was now suffering the fall of exports and the extension of foreign capital entrys.
"No one wants the euro zone to continue to be instable and turbulent," said he.
"We have monumental challenges and we need to keep a high level of growth."
"It's a option, it's an imperative, because where we found employment for ten million of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies such as India have no responsibility to assist rich Europeans when their own and deep economic problems face.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor of the University of Brown in the United States, said that it would be very difficult to sell Europe for millions of two hundreds of people in India, of which up to 800 million live with about 2 dollars per day or less.
"In some time, it will be seen that Greeks will be played at the age of 50 years and will go from vacation to the streets and that will not fall well," said.
Lee Howell, manager of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India's reservations had to be used to maintain the numbers and well-employed workers of the Greek public sector, in bad management posts, and loss generators such as railways.
Mr Nag said that the crisis of the eurozone threatened by "interest effects in chain" for all Asia.
The prognostic of the Asian Development Bank of 7,5 percent of economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now on the "low" risk due to Europe's threat.
He said that weakly vulnerable markets needed to make "containment plans" to protect a crisis and significant outcome from their economy.
Pentagon Reviews series of possible discharges in defence
The Defence Secretariat, Leon Panetta, calmed the Congress on the moon, warning that the automatically budgetary recruits that could be paid to national security and cause financial reaction in chain from the Pentagon steps, Afghan battle camps, civil mountain chains.
The Pentagon is already giving $450 million over the next decade, but now I fear an additional reduction of 600 million or more in recruitments that may be imminent if the Congress does not achieve an expenditure agreement.
"The impact of these recruits would be a destructor for the apartment," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, republiced by Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, republiced by South Carolina.
He said that the Congress ' fraction to reach a budget agreement and its consequence, the 'Search', would lead to a 23 percent of global reductions and a high number of new projects.
"A so large, applied in this undiscriminated way, would make the majority of our native and construction projects can't be executed - can't buy three four parts of a boat or a building - and seriously harm other modernization efforts," said Panetta to Senators.
"We would also be obliged to separate many of our civil officials in an involuntary way and, because the reduction would be to be so fast, it is almost sure that we would have to license civilians in order to achieve the goal."
"This change would break faith with those who keep our army and seriously harm the good provision."
The records with time would reach the battle troops," said Panetta.
"Although the financing for war times in the ultramar continginging operations is not directly affected by the survey, the efforts of the war would be negatively affected by serious transfers in the basic budgets," Panetta warned.
"The staff contract would be reduced, what would lead to delays in contracts and monitoring the contract supporting war."
"Nomin staff would be reduced, giving place at payments to providers in war time, and legal and political support would be interrupted."
The two Senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking information about the possible effect of the automatic records in the Department of Defence.
"The consequence of a survey at the Department of Defence would cause a rapid decline of the United States as the main military power of the world."
"We are firmly contrary to this draconiana action," the Senators said in a joint communication the late of lunch when they published the Panetta letter.
"This is not a result with which you can live, and certainly it is not one that we must impose ourselves."
"The secure is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it must not be allowed to happen."
If the Panetta Letter and the recent warnings of Senators will increase pressure for a budgetary commitment or strengthen calls to exit the Penalty of Records.
Panetta has always been more franchise about the possible recruitments, although it has come to a work on the Pentagon top with years of experience in the Congress and the White House and knowing that he had faced difficult decisions.
In a press conference last week, the Secretariat of Defence pinked a sovereign panorama of what could be before - a army with a concha, but not a nest.
"It's a boat without mariners."
"It's a brigade without balls."
"It's a airline without sufficient pilots."
"It's a paper tigre, a quarter, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers prepared to fulfil the mission," said Panetta in his opening words in the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers low moral, deficient preparation and is not able to keep up with the adversary potentials."
"Actually, invites the aggression..."
In addition to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta states new details about how the reductions "generate important operational risks: the time of response to crisis, conflicts and disasters; our ability to be deployed and inherited before the world; and there is an unacceptable risk in future combating operations."
And Panetta said that some of the older defence projects could face haha, including those already tested and some only in the first stages of planning.
This list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter battle airport, a new planned bomber, the Ballistic submerge of the new generation, the new litoral battle ship and the new vessel of fighting in the land that the Army and the Marina needs to replace, humble.
Detention of the development and additional tests of F35 could generate about $80 million for over 10 years, but their partners say that it is the next vital step to improve and face potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to find a lie
A view to the recent titlers shows us what serious and every present are lie and lie in daily life.
The Presidential candidate, Herman Cain, is undertaken by changes of sexual abuse with several women; each party accused to lie to the other.
The Officers of the State University of Pennsylvania have been accused of condemnation for reports that said that a retired flatbol container was sexually added to children.
Last week, the French President, Nicolás Sarkozy, was "pleased" with a open microfon claiming the President of the United States, Barack Obama, that the first Minister of Israel Benjamín Netanyahu is a liar.
Mentir has destroyed rail and convulsioned countries.
The Congressist by New York and Exhibitionist in the Internet, Anthony Weiner, made the riddle with his desserts quickly relaxed by the unfutable test.
The former presidential candidate John Edwards has been accused of infractions in the financing of the campaign related to the recovery of a foreign relation.
And again, no one who lives will ever forget the medicine circles laid down by President Bill Clinton when lies during his second mandate about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
The legends on tramps are very extended in school and university exams.
There were cases in which teachers have given responses to students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Meners who should be teaching the contrary are sending the message to lie and lie are acceptable.
How many stuff are we finding us?
On one day, studies show that you can lie everywhere from 10 to 200 times.
This is sure, many of these lies are painted lies.
Another study showed that the unknown were three times in the first 10 minutes to know.
Detect lies, or "localization of lies", is an essential skill that we must buy all, for personal and professional reasons.
Alongside to be a table like, for example, Charada, where the goal is to explain: "You have," the false detection is a scope of the serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades in universities that have performed research projects in deepity, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old halfs on the lie have been revealed.
The lies look at their eyes.
Not always tartamudean, balbucean, if they run or worry.
It cannot be concluded that the lies are difficult to deteriore or dismant.
A detected lies can come to the truth learning about the structure of the declaration, micro-expressions, question training and time.
I've passed a few years through the scientific discovery on the lie in the wide and always emergency body of knowledge, and it was clear that the detection of the false is a modern technology that is easy to learn and help navigate through our complex world - especially if their professional responsibilities include contracts, interviews, or negotiations management.
The good lies have the ability to read well to others, making them well feeling, manageing their own emotions and feel intuitively how others know.
We know about the investigations that the extrovers are more than the investors, that men say more "jury toward themselves," while women say more lies "oriented to others -- normally to protect the feelings of someone -- that people married feel less of their neighbour than those who are not married (but the lies that they say to be "enorms".
We also know that if you're precipitated as a mishechor, the others will feel less guilty because you lie.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the usual behaviour of the subject.
This is called "create a baseline".
Aid to provide reference points to measure the changes after.
Watch the position of the subject, rise and vocal characteristics.
It's better to know if someone usually hit his foot all the time to do wrong accuses when he sees his feet striking half of the meeting.
Following the following, searching for false, verbal and not verbal groups.
Consider these behaviour groups as alarm signals, not as a false test.
People who false can conged the top part of the body when trying to remember their story, they can touch their feet towards the door, turn to a exit, change their position in significant way or exhibition a "dehogo postinterview" -- the exhibition of alivio and changing of post, once all difficult questions have been completed.
As often the questionnaires are falsely seen that the interview has completed only to find this postinterview.
Also takes attention to the subject vocational.
Scott Peterson laid the back to the foundation and used the past time while he claimed that his wife killed was alive, launching a search on her at national level.
People who lie too can use a distant language: "I have no sexual relations with that woman... Mrs. Lewinsky" or repeat a hard question.
The most common spectrum indicators are sustainable.
Somebody can use a month of "restrictive" when he answers a difficult question: "I mean... true... until I'm... to understand."
This makes the response a perception instead of a fact and is often a warning sign.
There is no mass formula to detect lies, but to develop ability to discover lie is possible.
These skills will improve the possibilities of any person to avoid being victimed by stage artists in their professional and personal life.
The contrary plan of oil dismissed after the threat of the U.S. in its adoption
When Obama’s administration threatens the adoption of a planned oilduct from Canada to the Mexican Golf -- with the flowing of the incidents, while he had the ecologists -- the company which seeks to build oilduct says that it is ready to redirect the project to rebuilt it.
TransCanada said moon by night that the oil was planned out of the ecologically sensitive area of Sandhills in Nebraska and trusts that the project will win the approval.
The company announced the decision in the press conference in the Capital of Nebraska.
TransCanada, Alex Perbax, says that the company holds its trust that the oil with time is approved, although it is true that with a different road.
This comes after the advertisement last week by the Department of State that it would take the decision by a Federal License for the project until new potential routes that prevent the areas of Sanhills of Nebraska and Ogalla Aquifer, a large subternal water supply.
"This is a real progress way," said the Representative Lee Terry, republic of Nebraska, Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the Department of State is likely to take away any decision until 2013, after the elections of the next year, although officials refused that the policy would be invoked in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the request of the Department of State, and expressed all its support.
Oilduct, from 1,700 kilometres, would be extended from Canada to Mexico Golf.
It would be 700,000 barriers per day of Alberta's province to the repairs in Texas.
For this, it would be necessary to cross six states.
It is hated by the ecologists, but loved by the working groups, which have affected the estimation of 20,000 jobs linked to oilduct.
But Nebraska's lawyers are subject to legislation for the strengthening of the area of Sandhills and the Ugalla water, the greatest source of potable water and irrigation.
The current environmental impact study of the Department of State found that the project only planned limited environmental impacts, but the source of energy industry said that the Department's general indicator has ordered an independent test of the revision process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the member of the lobby contracted by TransCanada, Paul Elliot, who was a campaign Adviser of Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the programme.
The other is if a signature that was contracted to direct the original study was an inadequate election because he was bound to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle requested by then cause a child to disappear
A family of New York claims that the dry of the music CD, Patti LaBelle, was made as a lounge in the building of Manhattan, shopping her little daughter to the point he escaped out of fear.
The diatriba of the song of "Lady Marmalade" murdered Genevive Monk of 18 months of age, so as he suffered "related personrooms, dreams of dream" and "hasted his fear to the strangers," says her family in the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was the 10 November of the past when the tramoyist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, teacher of childhood garden, and Genevive was prepared to go to a family trip.
While Kevin Monk cogged the car, Roseanna Monk went to the building of the Boulevard Riverside building, with his equipation, bringing Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she was close to the door and put her daughter on the ground for a moment.
'It's someone came back and told me,' Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I told her, 'I'm going to cut it down,' said.
The Beelle ambassed the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tonne," she didn't have left her daughter near the door," said Roseanna Monk.
I said, "I don't have any interest in what you say or think."
She flew and began to use bad words - the C word and the word J in a loud voice...
He had a bottle of water and began to throw the water of the bottle on me."
He said Genevie was story.
'I told this woman,' see what you have done to my daughter,' said the mother of the girl.
The Beelle shot her mother -- who still subjected to Genevave -- and had to be contained through its surrounding and retired to a car waiting for her, said Roseanna Monk.
The little was weeping so strong that she had gone down, he added.
Later, the family sent a notice requesting a LaBelle's excuse, but didn't get an answer.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle have not returned the calls to comment that was done.
The question is looking for unspecified damages, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he took the case free and that the family plans to give all money that allows children's support association with cancer.
"The purpose is to do Patti LaBelle responsible for his behaviour," said Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is completely unacceptable, especially when it is directed to a child's teacher who leads to a 18-year-old child."

Free manager
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactoral, for the economics Gerardo López Cervantes, Director of the Economic and Social Science Faculty of the UAS, the growth of disemployment can be explained indirectly, in line with the actions made from public policies.
"What is seen is a growth of the unemployment that has to be seen with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market for the effects of a restraint of resources by the legislation adopted in the Congress to combat money laundry, already for people who take $$ illegally is not easy to work, invest and use them in something," he said.
Migration detained
López Cervantes pointed out that the growth in unemployment also exists a demographic factor.
"The number of people who are going to work in the foreign search, in the United States has been limited, first by the difficulties to enter, and second because they have many difficulties to find work, that people are still still and are asking sources of work here in the state, what does the unemployment choose."

Economic Light
Loredo López showed that success as the results of the principles of the year have detained the State economy and reduced their performance and growth.
"The lower economic stream is a product of several events, including the heats, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not return enough to generate a economic dynamism that allows to have a acceptable level of stream in the processes, products and services, and so at the end of the year, we are closed very under the expectations we had", said.
Edit vocation

Work to do
The Chairman of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a future vision that would improve the efforts of the Government.

He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way to lead public policy.
"There are elements that allow you to say that the Government is more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I believe that the Government is aware of the work to do," he said.

The Guideline for Social Development indicated that even though the work programmes have been advanced, they are in danger since the Government of the State had not met with the contributions corresponding to the resource of more than 11 million weights in the three programmes.
He noted that in total investment in these three programmes is approximately 50 million weights of which the State corresponds to 25 percent and that until now only the Federation and Municipation have provided resources for the work, so that the possible delay in the conclusion of these are made vigent.
"There are almost 12 million things that touch you to bring and, although the year is to end, they have not given us nor a fifth, when they had to give us a part since July," he said, "nothing to not depart us we started the work and are very advanced, but we lack money."

"There are almost 12 million what they touch and although the year is to end, they have not given us nor a fifth."
The Court valid "alermatics" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of digital analogic signals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in the last years
The Supreme Court of Justice (SCJN) described the constitutional controversies in the Senate and the Chamber of Deputy against the Presidency Decree added to the "Analgon" from 2021 to 2015, not to meet the eight votes necessary to illegalize it.
A minority of four Ministers, including the President of the Court, John Silva Media, considered that the President Phillipe Calderon had not been overcome in its allocations in the emitting the decree detailed by action to continue to clarify the transition to the earthquarter digital television.
With that result, the constitutional controversie promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed by not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes to be proclaimed on the constitutionality or inconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains vital.
The draft sentence, prepared by the Olyga Sánchez Corder, proposed to declare unconstitutional decree, since the regulation of radio and television materials is a law reserved by law to the Federal Commission on Telecommunications (Coffee), in contravention of the Jericho subordination principles and law reservations.
For the project, they voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and the Sánchez Corder.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputy Members have promoted two constitutional conflicts to impose the decree, and by admitting the requests, the Sánchez Corder Minister suspended the implementation of the decree and all actions in it prepared for digital transition.
The full of Ministers also decided to disappoint the request made by the Chamber of Members, without entering into the discussion of the project, also on the service of Sanchez Corder.
In its intervention, the Chairman said not to relate to the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executor cannot be structured through general standards, measures to prepare public administration.
"I can also consider if it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector, which had a constitutional mandate, the recruitment of the State.
The replacement of digital analogic signals is one of the most important changes that the world has suffered in the past years, and it is translated to better use of radio-electic spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.
Instead of the change, it would still be put to the benefits of digitalization, which involves a decision of public interest, which does not only have technical dimensions, “againting economic, social, policy and national security issues”.
These questions, noted, "the operation of all the system established, in accordance with the principle of the State's economic recruitment, includes a group of allocations that the Constitution leads to the power of the State executive."
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world has already concluded the digital transition, and has done it through the Executive, although it was highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the executive, by emitting the imposed decree, in any way invade the field of competence of the Congress, has been entrusted in the administrative field the observation of the laws issued by the Legislative.

On 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (SCJN) solved the constitutional controversie promoted by the local legislative Poder and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the vote of the State mandate to constitutional reforms, unless he has no right to "sank or to see them."
In turn, the possibility of the "reclame by vote", Mary of the Bederal Angeles explicitly expressed that, thanks to the adoption of the lines concerned by the General Council of the EEM will be able to carry out partial and comprehensive receipts of the vote by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial receipt of votes, of one or more electoral packages may be given in the case that: the results of the acts are not consistent; the act of scrutiny and compound in the receipt of the box or not in force of the President of the same; or, when there are clear errors or changes of the acts.

The new Italian government will be formed
The designed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will be meeting tomorrow with the President of Italy to present the new government that will be faced to a crisis that has been put to that country on the border of the economic disaster
The designated first Italian Minister, Mario Monti, will meet the mercury with the President of Italy to present the new government that will be faced to a crisis which has placed in Italy on the border of the economic disaster and has put into danger the whole eurozone.
A Communicator of the presidency palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, would meet the middle of the President, Giorgio Napolitan, to confirm that it can form a Government.
It is expected to present a tank composed of the majority of technocrats, although it is not clear when the new executive will be assembled.
Monti said he would submit to the President the result of their discussions with the political parties in their attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's capacity to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner.
Monti did not expressly say that a government could form, but the tongue of its comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
The "Marco is now well delined," added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, while Italy fights a political and financial crisis that has affected the costs of their debt at insufficient levels.
The new administration directed by the former European Commissioner Monti should approve a hard patch of austerity required by European leaders to recover the slaughter confidence in Italy.
Subjecting the pressure on Monti to be taken, the inestibility of the markets placed the performance of Italian BTP goods to 10 years by about 7 percent, the level in which Greece and Ireland were obligation to be redeemed.
Emma Marcegilla, leader of the Italian Conductor, said to the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would much support this government."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity to get Italy out of this emergency situation.
Monti’s success possibilities were significantly impressed by the support of the PDL PDL party in Silvio Berlusconi, which the crisis had obliged to dismiss the sabbath.
"We believe that the efforts of professor Monti are intended to have a good result," said the President Angelino Alfano, secretariat of the centered game.
The support of the PDL, the most Italian party, is significant because many of its members have been imposed to the Government of technical majority which is formed by Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new Government of Monti must have a strong Parliamentary support to implement what probably will be imposed of austerity reform.
Any block or deteriorated in its efforts could cause a new and destructor on financial markets.
The Italian foreign banks association was advised to pressure by warning that a monastery's fracase would be a disaster.
Monti initiated its consultations with political, slaughters and business groups, as well as youth and women.
He will end on your meeting round on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitan, which has enabled a extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a short respect at the end of the past week, when it was clear that Berlusconi would diminish, the costs of the Italian debt have now turned to critical levels between uncertainty on whether the new Minister will be successful.
Rent to Italy, with a public debt of EUR 1,8 million, would be too much for the current financial defence of the eurozone.
Monti said that his Government should continue until the next elections planned for 2013, notwithstanding the generalized predictions that politicians will only give time to implement the reforms before the elections.
Monti said that he would like to include politicals in his tank, but the large parties stress that only should be formed by technicals, an indication of its repairs to a process binding by financial pressure.
Political outcomes noted that mutual disappearances and disadvantaged over the parties are complicating the attempt of incorporating political figures.
The Spanish rock is above the tics

A May contrast to Costa Rica, if those 22 called by both countries for today's friendship, at 3:05 p.m., in the National Station of San José.
While the global and Europe campaigns, number one of the monthly ranks of the FIFA, contain a broad register of class A interlection games, the Tricolor only poses the defender Michael Huaña as the only one with the 50 international games.
This figure has reached the previous Friday in the Panamá game (0-2), in the Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish thumblists playing in the Liga of the Stars and powerful clubs of the England Premier Liga, holding an intensive activity in liga and home bottle campaigns, and high levels in European cops such as League Champions.
The previous experience is taken by the Spanish Furia in complicated eliminations from the Eurocopa and the World of Fullball.
In contrast, the Italians have a limited international rock in a area, such as Concacaf, which is considered the lower level of the FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish selection selection is the architect Iker Casillas, which the previous sabbath before England (cade 0-1 in London) was equal to the register of the Andoni Zubizarreta exporter, with 126 international meetings.
Cases will play today before the Tricolor and will put a new record for Spain from 127 internationalities.

Cases and Xavi, including, were recognized the previous week by the UEFA together with the other hundreds of the Icelandic team, the Zubariat cite with 126 and the Schalke's heading, Raúl González, with 102.
Case near the centurial number is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
The Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fabregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
From the tic side, and near Michael Huaña, they are the left side side Júnior Dayz, with 48 presence and the Bryan Ruiz artillery, with 45.
After this, only five over the 30 parts: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
At least.
With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national side, with less than 30 meetings, Roy Miller appears with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and 23.
The rest is not about 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Elman Vargas and Edder Nelson is still not debout.
History golector of Spain is David Villa, with 50 diamonds, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who registers more with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.

"Go to Costa Rica is a real dream"
In exclusive interview with Viva, the Battery Jeff Ament, of Pearl Jam, said that the band is ready to offer one of its best concieries in the next Sunday, in the National Station.
It was more than 20 years of expectation, but the band is sure that they will also become the dream to touch in the country.
So the Battery and Fundatory Member, Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Live, from Brazil, last week.
The grouping is located in the south American side of its celebration of two decades of work, and on Sunday 20 will be the only scale in Central America.
That day they will be presented in the National Station, from 7:30 a.m., together with the angelic band The X and the La Roberts nationals.
This is an extract of the conversation, whose complete transcript is in the United Nations in the Internet.
For its constant followers, is a real dream that Pearl Jam will touch in Costa Rica, are you aware of what you are living in your fans?
Go to Costa Rica is a real dream for us too.
It's just our second time in South and Central America and it's been great until now.
I was in Costa Rica just once and a vacation; it's a so beautiful country, and I think we'll be able to stay there a few days.
So it emotions to bring our music there.
It is asked for there is a kind of devotion to the band, fans live with intensity the previous days.
What are they saying to their most warmest followers?
Thank you for staying through all these years.
We took about 21 years to come to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so much and we're sorry that he took us so much time to get there.
Some have already been referring to their concert as the largest show of the year.
Does this add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the largest shows we touched over the last 21 years have been last a couple of weeks.
We touch a couple of huge shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that this has been made us for this concert in Costa Rica.
Actually, we're very worried about to touch there.
We love this country, it loves us to overflow and juungla; for both things, Costa Rica is among the best world.
How did Costa Rica and her olives discover?
We have many friends who are surfectors and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the olives there are incredible.
My friends always went over to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, together with Mexico, are great places to surfy; so it was how we learned, through people who love the surf.
By seeing the round, they came delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have they planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we never touched there before, then we have no restriction on what we can do.
We will try to give the best show with a good variety of songs; we will try to touch a couple of songs of each album and give them our fans a good and different repertoire.
You're never repeating the repertoire.
What's that to do?
I think it is partly because we have nine discos and we can touch more than 120 songs and each like different songs, so it's difficult to choose what songs to touch every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire we have not to touch, this keeps us focused and also keep us surprise because we remember the reasons why we like these songs and that we could have been forgotten.
This makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I think it will also be more interesting for people.
With this round, they're celebrating 20 years of trajection.
Looking back, is it difficult to believe what has happened?
Yeah, absolutely.
First of all, I think no one of us is imagined we would be in a big rock band and have done it over 20 years ago to look like a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and feel much that we can continue to do music together.
We all want and love creating music.
We're happy to go to the world's places we always wanted to go.
The things couldn't be better for us.
What did you mean to have been the fundamental part of the superstition of the grass?
It has always been a honour to be part of this group of large bands.
We are very friends of Soundgarden people, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprised when a move is rising from a group of friends and it's a little common.
At the same time, a band of a city stands up, but it's much more strange when five or ten bands come out at the same time of the same city.
We are pride and honorable to be part of the Seattle Group.
We still touched some of them when.
Last year, we were in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on his road, so we were happy to be friends of all of them still and we honored to be part of the sound of Seattle.
It's also very strange that a band like you are standing together and with the same members so long.
Yes, four of us are together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which only is much more time than many bands.
First of all, I think we are all happy to be still with life and, in the second, we are all worried about the others.
We are all very close friends, and, thanks to that, also have been opened musical adventures that gives every one free to experiment.
We trust each other with the music of each and could not be better.
The relationship with the name word has not been simple; however, thanks to your success, they have been able to do what they want.
How do you find a balance?
As we went growing, it was easier to find a balance.
We're sure that you're not too much around because it's easy to fall in this game of the great multitudes and people who love your music.
While one remembers that people are there through music, it remembers you that you should respect the music and what I bring it, without capture of being known and being a rock star, something that no one of us really interests it.
How do you remember your other mother Love Bone project?
I think we wrote very good songs, and at first was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and we never published a disc until Andy died (Anndrew Woods).
There was many frustrations because it was so long and the most important that we are still very friends of Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I heard a song or see a photo thinking in the incredible person Andy was and how he did to relax, it was always a pleasure to go to work, we see, talk about music and saltball and much more.
It was a surprise human being, and we're surprised.
The National La Robertas will be responsible for opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know your work, especially Eddie Vedder, and why have you chosen it for opening?
Yes, the production has sent us videos with several proposals, and that was the band that more pleased us, so we are careful of see what Las Roberts can offer and must be very interested.
Why do you always change the Yellow Ledbetter letter alive?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
He sing her, and I think he's doing it with the first thing that happens to him.
As a battery, who are your influences?
They're so much.
The first ones that happen to me are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
It's so much I could talk about the bathrooms that love me.
How did Pearl Jam maintain relevant wheat, although it is no longer a way?
I think we all always feel a little unconnected of the word.
When I think about it, I remember the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that happened at the same time, and, if there's a relevance now, I think it's something wonderful because it's musical that is the penalty to listen and bands like Mudhoney are now doing better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content, and now it has become more positive.
Why should this change be changed?
It's interesting because I think there's a couple of songs in the new album that may seem more livians, but there's also songs, such as The End or Just Breathe, which calculate as very dark songs, even though they can sound a little positive.
With both, when Ed touched them, I laughed when I listened to them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think that when you grow and there's some traump in your life and you'll be paid to a family or a friend, these things start to influence your art and music and these two songs, uncertainly, represent this for me.
Moreover, I think it can be a happy person and still can do music that is dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is newly internated for medical exams
The former President Alberto Fujimori was invested on Tuesday in a public hospital to be assessed by the loss of muscular force presented in the pionees, he informed his headmaster.
Fujimori, of 72 years, which meets a sentence of 25 years of prison for violations to human rights committed during its Government (1990-2000), suffers several dolences, including a cancer in the language which has been operated four times and remains under control.
Alejandro Aguinaga, who is your personal doctor, said to Canal N of Television that Fujimori will be evaluated during three dji in the National Institute of Neoplastic Endurances to determine the reason of pain and loss of force of its lower members.
Aguinaga noted that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the inquiry for humanitarian reasons, however, he said that he would not want it because it is unrecoverable.
It was four times operated from cancer to the language, it has a perish of 18 kilometres to which other patologists have been assembled, such as severe erosive gastrity, the quite of the páncree, renal calculations, arterial hypertension and the circular problems in the pioneers, and he put the doctor to survey.
It was satisfied since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Office.
In April 2009, 25 years of prison were condemned by death of 25 persons by a military squadron of aniquity who had been caughtly in the first years of his government.
Music travel to Mexico to strengthen political areas
A official commission, undertaken by the President of Uruguay, José Mujica, and integrated by several ministers and entrepreneurs, will start a visit to Mexico in order to expand trade between both nations and address political issues in the region.
Musique will meet the next middle with its Mexican, Felipe Calderon, higher point of an extended meeting agenda with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the uruguay collection in Mexico, according to the Uruguay Presidency agenda.
The meeting between both Presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "profit for the exchange of information in all the political matters between the two nations," as published the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local means, Mujica would like to achieve Calderon supporting Uruguay in the case with France overwhelmed when the French mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country in a list of tax paradises, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his statement, Sarkozy was undertaken excluding from the international community to the countries that continued to be fiscal paradise, the declaration which caused Uruguay rejection and the call for advice to his employer in the European country.
Mexico since November, the G20 group integrated by the emergency and most powerful world countries, and has victory with the South American country since January this year, a convention to interchange tribute information in order to avoid dual taxation.
The Uruguay Government has tried to act in the last years with the convergence of fiscal exchange agreements in order to exit from the "Green List" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OCDE), formed by countries that have not implemented all international standards for fiscal cooperation.
At the commercial level, Mexico and Uruguay have a Level Trade Treaty (TLC) which has increased the exchange of goods between both nations.
Bigotudo source passes the three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fighted, incansable, for 25 years to save the Princess Peach of the worsts of the Bowser Bad, but has never done it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" the "Super Mario Land" will strike for the love of the girl in esterooscopic technology.
The title, which reaches this month to the tents of the world, has been designed from a principle to use the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS port consolation, which allows to play in three dimensions without need to use gaps.
"Mary is the person who needs to say how to work the stereoscopy, "which has been announced by the responsibility of Nintendo Prison in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game, which was originally thought for this support", since until now successful as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Selda: Ocarine of time 3D" was an adaptation of existing titles.
Nintendo's portfolio has supported that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and flowing game.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "single" to win less accessible users.
Once over, the most experts can give a "seventh turn" to the levels of the game, which this time presents more difficulty.
Furthermore, users can choose real time between aggressive D or one who only affects the deepness of the action, but it is necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not to subtract optical illustrations".
This Super Mario incursion in the three dimensions also suggests the turn of the person to a portfolio comfort, as it was not done since 2005.
In this Nintendo video game, there are dogs to followers of the ski and repairs the form of success of the previous delivery, which consists of the source of the bigot will need to recover threatened danger platforms with the aim of delivering Princess Peach.
Although the player will find news in movements, around us, disputes and enemies, and also a Luigi "jugable".
Columbia shapes the extension of Portuille to the United States
The President Álvaro Colom announced this march that he gave the exhibition of the former Alfonono Portillo for answer to the United States for the conspiration for the washing of US 70 million.
This ends the process that Guatemala would respond to the request of the country in the north calling for Portugal to judge it there.
In the press conference, Colum stated that his decision was obliged to the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a court of judgment had already ordered the extradition.
He asserted that during his mandate "not put his hands" into judicial resolutions and gave all the extraditions he had known.
Besides Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marrochin, by murder and serious lessons, and Edgar Strada Morales and Victor Strada Paredes, both by narcotrate.
The fact by Colom proposes a executive trial after the extent of all judicial and constitutional institutions to process the expert between 2000 and 2004.
In accordance with the resolutions of the Fifth Penal Court and of the Court of Constitution (CC), the Portolo must be issued once the legal situation in Guatemala has solved and guaranteed its human rights.
The portfolio was absoluted by the disabilities of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence when President, which was the process that was prior to the extradition, but the Public Ministry called and reactivated the case.
Trinjove helped 6,000 young people in risk
The entity was born to avoid the fall in the marginality of boys without training
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the Trinjove Social Support Entity is important: 6.000 young people in the exclusion risk have received assistance to overcome a difficult situation during this fourth century.
This is added to the hundreds of employment workers currently achieved for this social group.
He served yesterday to be balanced in a act held in the former Fabra i Coats' former factory, which attended more than 300 people.
Trinijove was born in Trinitat Vella bar in 1986 with the goal of helping young people with little training, without work, with doubling problems or in situation to fall in marginality.
The dinner celebration in Sant Andreu focused on a large number of officials of entities and institutions who cooperated with the Association in these 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unity of the work made by Trinijove.
Jordi Pujol, President of the Generality, Arthur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the act the ex-consident of Social Education, Ernest Maragall, and the extensive of alcalde and current economicist Ricard Goma.
They also joined the large room of the Fabra i Coats the current Consident of Benestar Social i Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director-General of the La Caixa Social Work, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas confirmed that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current is also, but added that the work done until now "is a good basis".
The President made Trinijove an example to know how to fight the evil circumstances and to give hope to people with difficulties.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work that is done," she showed.
Deployed a busy paid where macrofies were made
The invasors were added from 11 of the 13 pools of the building in Balmes, 51.
The 12 employees left the middle of yesterday without offering resistence
Everything seems to indicate that the pearl that lived the neighbours of the 51 street of Balmes has come to their end.
Two persons left the middle of dinner voluntaryly the immune that had been illegally occupied, and where macrofiss organized who were disappeared to the neighbourhood, in the court order and without the need of a police intervention.
When the operation ended, the door close was changed to prevent the situation to be repaired.
"At now there will be a access control," the manager confirmed.
The posts, which were invaded 11 of the 13 pools of the building - the rest of the building are inhabited - were taken all the electric and part of the water, except to paint the walls and left residues of all kinds, especially the sides of alcoholic drinks.
The first three pools were the scenario of the municipal holidays, which remained until two days and were desired to the inquiry.
There is a discoteca on the side of the building, Balmes 51, which has also seen damaged.
His properties, Mary Pantinat explained to Europe Press that since the building was busy, 80 per cent was lowered.
The poster of the disco is pointing that the invasors of the finca had made him unlawful competence, since they sold the cups to three euros, while the disco is 10.
Furthermore, the advice of the Ocho local had to respond to neighbouring complaints by noise, while the molestians did not cause them to cause the discotec clients, but the inhabitants of the occupied house and, in particular, the assistants to the festivals that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in the last weeks, according to the neighbourhoods of the area.
The response of the discotec explained that the paintings were so large as even to an agreement with the owner of the immune and had nine months ago that "remit it" the rental.
Urban Guardia also confirmed that in the past few weeks more neighbors had been received for the situation.
The President of the municipal group of PP at the meeting, Alberto Fernández Day, had called for the past week, "againing immediately the immune to end with the conviction problems and civisms that produce neighbours, and the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only a plant of the occupied building, but over the last months the jobs were going to enter into all the plants of the building and almost all the pools, and that in some months even roads were produced.
In this sense he added that, "You need to end with impunity and be convicted against the incivisme which has been generated in the finca."
Yesterday, the Mossians divorced a building in Nou Barris.
At 15:30 p.m. the police moved to 35 from the Mont-ral street after receiving a neighbour who had noted that four people had reached the building.
The four were arrested at the time.
For a mountain or mountain?
Architects are involved in the opportunity of the colleatory beyond polymics on honoraries.
The municipal Congress on the 16 gates reiterates the discussion on the role of Collserol in Barcelona
Middle of the 80s, in full support of the extensive Metropolitana Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration imprisoned several passengers of Collserol's promotion.
The bulletin defined the mountain as the great metropolitane park.
Moreover, he was accompanied with a comparison, in numbers, with the Neolorquino Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park returned, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, as the catalanic capital of the pockets that are not directed in the north-west egg but above (Montaña) - ground (mar).
Calculation of Collserla as a natural park refined in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the jabalís in the paper of the Iogi Hospital.
This was until September, the meeting gathered a megacompetition composed of 16 concours for other gates of access to Collserol.
A door moved to the park idea, uncertainly.
Or that or someone's trying to put the doors on the field.
The question comes alone: Collserol, park or mountain?
The concert, both by its fairly organizational ones, as well as by the view of the city, is the subject of conversation between all the barcelone architects.
It is almost a recurring the subject that earns the hand when two members of this old castle of elected are recognized in an ascensor.
And this fact is just one of the few consents between what they think of three barcelone architects, and university teachers, who have been presented.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Módol and Marta Bayona: the concert is timely.
For Roldán, after addressing the litoral face "see it is necessary" debate on "the front of the mountain", although the talk of Ildefons Cerdá, the green manzans, has not been carried out.
"Cause from the basis that Barcelona's most expanded park is the street.
Among other things for their great accessibility.
Collserla is more complex," the architect for which the title of "poers of Collserol" is closing a "lexic tram": there is no need to think about them "such as access to a park, but the delimitation of an area where you need to act".
Medol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, calculates the proposal for "intelligent network" with "other dangers".
Pellowers resulted from the "incert that is today to predict public space" after experience living in the 80s and had in the area of the Fórum "to sing of the cisne".
The first fear is the own delimitation of a border on where you can build.
"Limiting something is to already set the next step," it means, its overflow.
"There must think in new urban instruments, planning, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can stand on real disasters."
More about the question, Módolo thinks that, simplifying, the beauty of Collserola's valley "I can understand as a park, Barcelona, no" by a greatly topographic question.
Modol remembers that there is already a work made by the Collserau Patronat that "n't should fall in rock," even though you thank the opportunity that the advice offers his group to intervene in this project "after the first time".
And further, it understands that the neighbouring of the mountain with the city is the free conduct that allows the architects to enter into the debate, but "doubt" on whether this technical profile is that should lead multidisciplinary teams ("tote an actate," point) which must have been created: "The architects should be only a tool".
Bayona imposes that the response to the question that gives this piece is comprehensive, because on the bases of the concurrent there is no global vision of Collserol: "They have been called 16 transversal concours - say- in the sense of the mountain-mar, but there is no long-reading, which sees and understands the area in its whole."
It causes at least in its case, which has opted to participate in 16 concourses.
On the other hand, a project for one of the doors can roll in the program and define the architect of the door on the side.
In his view, that is true, the advertisement should ensure that the breach immediately above the Delt Round should, in all its extension, provide an equipation area that makes a nice transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgive Jonás Larrazábal and will go free
After 72 days of furniture, the legal assistant of the Red Casino gave the forgiveness to the brother of Monterrey's alcalde of the process that was followed by contempts.
After staying 72 days, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will go free after the legal supporter of Casino Network will cause him the forgiveness to the Second Penal of Distrito, which remains a process against the brother of Monterrey's hall.
After the attraction to the Royale Casino, the owner of the Red Casino, Sergio Gil García, made publics a series of photographs and videos in which early Manuel Jonás required payment of a financial contribution to allow regional advertisement to the clandest operation of the house of charges.
After the public complaint, the State Procurement opened a criminal process against the brother of the Panist alcalde and the 2 September was arrested and arrested for 30 days.
Four hours before the Office of the Public Ministry of 3 in Employment Deaths, was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, situated in the Antigua Bar of the State capital.
It remained during 49 days following the decree, a second order of exacerbacy after the official of the Public Ministry was denied of cohesion and organized crimes.
On 19 October, it was transferred to Cadereyta's Penal, prematurely by driving with a million and half weights to the owners of the Red Casino; however, only a few hours remained in the median security receipt because there were death threats in its opposite.
The authorities allowed him to follow the internal judgment in the municipal cells of San Nicolas of the Garza.
On 25 October, the Secretary-General of the Second Criminal of Distrito, Jorge Yánez, who said that almost two months of warning had been checked sufficient tests to determine John's crime, such as the cut of 1.5 million weights to the representatives of the house of appointments to change the operation of the same.
This lunch, the legal assistant of Casino Red, Victor Aldo García Gómez, accused before the judge José Luis Pecina to ask for the brother of the regional hall; so in the next hours he could recover his freedom.
During the legal diligence, the officer of the Public Minister admitted to the Judge, Ramiro Aria, asked García Gómez if the damage had been repaird and who of the partners of the household's appointment had been the one who had the forgiveness, even though the lawyer tried to retain the name.
On the basis of the exemption of 197/2011, the legal pardon to Jonás Larrazábal is imposed, and the proceedings may not be submitted in turn to the pursuant process; as well as the refund of harm or punishment shall not be required.
After the hearing of the legal assistant of the house of appointments, approximately 15:50 the immediate liberty of Larrazabal Bretton was ordered.
The secretariat of the Judge, Jorge Yánez, was transferred to the prison of the San Nicolas municipality of the Garza to notify John that he has been legally forgiven and his exhibition will be registered.
He will also notify it of the immediate order of liberty emitted by the judge.
The Dionisio Pérez Jácome Secretariat gives details of the air accident where life was lost the government secretariat, France Blake, and seven more people
The Secretariat of Communications and Transports (SCT) reported that the results dropped on the accident in which life lost the Government Secretariat, France Blake Mora, and seven more, indicate that helicopter had been directly affected on the field in full structural integrity, without that the pilot could try to a forced aircraft.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretariat of Communications and Transports, reported that before the aircraft, the pilot found that climate conditions were the appropriate for flight.
"The elements seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the aspas had contacted with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuseljae."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, as well as the requirements required to transport staff.
Furthermore, he said that in the area of the impact investigations the appearance of pieces on the ground is not reported.
"In a search is reported that there are no pieces or components of the ship on the other place, the impact was made structurally.
"The design of the helicopter was for 19 passengers, contained appropriate requirements to transport passengers.
The ground provides a delay of seven degrees at 30 degrees of inclination.
At this time, the Secretariat has ensured that it was a priority to be given to the previous results; however, the investigation could continue several months, even a year could be reached.
For its part, Gilberto López Meyer, General Director-General of Airports and Services, assured that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Major State operated in crossing speed and that it happened on a black ground.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal crossing operation at the time of the impact", expressed.
At the press conference, the SCT holder, Perez Jácome, entitled six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual plane:
In accordance with the aircraft, the flight has been implemented under visual flight rules, this means that tripulation should have visibility during the flight and the ground.
Weather conditions:
The reports in the AICM were appropriate for deployment, in accordance with the advanced aircraft towards DF and the Mexico State, there were capabilities of cloudness to low height.
Selected paths:
The tripulation is likely to be searched for a area of smaller highness and more visibility towards the Cuernvaca valley.
Consequence location.
The impact coordinates and the last record of the radar aircraft included, probably before the impact, there was no control or change in the aircraft.
Air conditioning in a reduced area:
The information available until now allows to suggest that the impact occurred in a right and side traject.
The aircraft patroon of disappearance is allowed to suggest that helicopter has affected the field under structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion has been detected:
On the left site, they continue to be shown without evidence in the rest of the ship of some kind of explosion or fire.
The latest research results indicate that there could have been multiple contacts with the field.
During the field work, the aircraft was found to a highness of 9,200 feet on the middle level of the sea, the field presents a dependent on the seven degrees from the seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
Photos show the sequence in which it was prerecibly disordered by the long of that recruitment.
The information provides elements indicated that helicopter could have had many impacts on the ground.
After the smaller search in a broader area than the site, around the accident, have not found dispersed pieces of the aircraft, which strengthens the pressure that the impact has been presented in structural integrity conditions.
MSS announced Protocol to find obesity gen
Teach the Social Safety a research to discover the genius of obesity in children and youth; it is supported in NIP specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Secure (IMSS) announced that a research leads to discover the genius of obesity in children and youth, named 'Genetic Protocol of the Obesity of Child and adolescence', which will allow you to contain the oversight trademarks.
In a communication, the Chief of the Medical Research Unit in the Biochemic Hospital of Specialities of the National Medical Centre Siglo XXI, Miguel Cruz López explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, sicknesses, nutrients and social workers was integrated.
The team is supported by specialists and postgrade students of the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and from the Aboriginal Political Institute (Cinvestav) of the National Political Institute (IPN).
The investigation is invited to participate in the population or not legally, to assess the sports units of the IMSS participating in the Mexico Valley, where the tests are carried out to the younger, every sabbaths from 8:00.
He pointed out that the Protocol started at the Portuguese Unit Cuahutemoc (Est of Mexico Ponente) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualkoyolt Unit of the Nezahualcholt (Est of Mexico East).
Once the goal of meeting 500 or 600 children, the study will continue in the Federal Distrition Unit (Official Distrition) and finally in the Portuguese Unit (North of Federal Distrition).
He noted that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obesity and identifying in children and young mexican risk factors to prevent the appearance of chronic genital diseases.
On 14 November, the World Day of Diabetes said that the goal is to meet three thousand children and young children between six and 14 years, with the consent and monitoring of their parents, for the implementation of specific food questions.
They will also be questioned about physical and pre-heritage heritage of diseases, with a view to avoid risk factors that have disappearances such as diabetes or renal insufficience.
He stated that the Sabbates were applied to all parts of anthropometric medication (pes, tal, circle circle), taking arterial pressure, determination of glucose levels, trigliceds, colesterol and insulin and genetics (as seeking to identify genes related to child obesity).
Cruz López noted that this investigation is obliged to concern the health professionals for the alarming increase of weight in young people.
'The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 noted that in only six years, there was an increase in children, 77 per cent of obesity, and 47 percent girls; in terms of oversight, a dramatic rise was also observed, 'he noted the specialist of the IMSS.
He pointed out that the justification for the search of trademarks was understood that the population of the country was different from others for their genetic history.
He informed that in middle, the Mexico has 65 percent of Indian heritage, 30 per cent of Europe and 5 percent of African state, and this condition is reflected in the genes related to diabetes and weight excesses.
He explained that the obesity genetics are generally translated into the incapacity of the excession of energy that we consume (Chloria) and which is stored in fat.
The investigator explained that the direct benefit for the participants was an integral assessment of children, which allowed to determine whether there was any oversight or obesity.
Even though he said, the presence of dark (acantosis) dark color plugs in the hair and analyz, which indicates the probability that the metabolic changes are paid and up to preabetics.
The information is managed confidentially, the doctors give it written to the parents, to which each of the medications and changes in the lifestyle must be made to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause superfluous, obesity and other chronic paths: the sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remain the most of the day settled in front of the television and use the vehicles instead of walking short distances.
The high caloric injection, i.e., the highest consumption of sugar drinks, carbohydrates (atmospheres, pan, pizza, hamburguese, etctrea) with higher content in fats and proteins and the genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM's Asfalt would avoid baths
Rafael Herrera, UNAM Chemical Faculty Research, developed asfales amended with polymers to produce a mezcla with better performance, independently of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signs sent by the landscape were expected, it would not be necessary to repair approximately 200 000 baths at the Metropolitana Valley of Mexico, Rafael Herrera Nájera, Research Facultad of Chemical (FQ) of UNAM, which ensured that if the construction and maintenance of a asfáltical peacekeeping process was appropriate, the baths could be reduced in quantity or, even, to be completely removed.
At its conference A technological view of the baths, described in the framework of the International Chemical Year of the International Chemical Laboratory, was informed that the laboratory to its charge developed abuses changed with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to the asfalt but with a greater mechanical resistence, both high and low temperatures.
Mrs. Najera said that this kind of modified asfalt could be used in places where climate is extremely warm, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve their play and therefore bathroom training.
He explained that asfalt, the lower part of the petroleum, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, a high molecular weight, called asfalten, and others of under molecular weight, called maltens, which brings to the landside their viscoleastic behaviour.
The accent viscosistic behaviour is that at high temperatures, nearly 180 degrees, it is contained as a liquid, 120 degrees of its viscosity is very high and 50 center degrees presents a almost strong state, while at very low temperatures, the asfalt turned down and added.
The previous means that in the streets the resistance of the asfalt is not uniform, but that it will be changed during the day in accordance with the environmental and temperature conditions, the specialist in chemical engineering warrants warned.
The FQ researcher noted that the roads of the Mexico City in most are covered by flexible landscape, which composed of six capabilities of materials, of which the last three are involved in the aspiration.
Among the most superficial scenes is the asfaltic folder, composed of small stones bathed in asfalt and then compacted.
Each of the feet that represents the folder, attracted, is bailed with asfalt.
In transition of vehicles and being generated efforts, it allows forces to be very well distributed in the peacekeeping.
If the modified asfalt would be disappeared even better, the chemical engineer thought.
On the asfáltic folder, it has increased, there is a latest capture called road folder, which is made of a stone material until the end, that is, a area that is also bailed in asfalt.
As this is the box that will be in contact with the drivers of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asfaltic folder and provide frequency on the road.
Being the part of the pace that you will receive and disseminate the efforts, the road folder also requires the appropriate spectrum and needs to be covered by the material that is done.
Climately, in particular humbleness and temperature changes, also are a very important factor to consider, in particular water, because the playing of the asfaltic folder is significantly affected.
When the ground is humble, the water is divided within the folder and is difficult to go out, this results a relaxation of all levels of the planet and therefore bathrooms.
In the process of training of a bathroom, the first in disgaining is the film of roading and only afterward affects the asfaltic folder, but damage is not immediately happening, but is a process that should be accepted to the first signs with appropriate maintenance programmes.
The member of the National Research System has also explained that the vehicul load is another important factor in the training of baths and therefore the speculator of each of the grounds of the planet must always go in relating to the vehicular load and ensure that it is satisfied, to avoid that bathrooms often form.
Rafael Herrera warned that there are still many to investigate and work on the asfalt, for example, asylum emulations, which are already present in other countries and are allowing bathrooms with easy and without need to use high temperatures.
What did you do to the candidate of the Valley to be the new Madam Colombia?
Analysis of the factors affected that Melina Ramírez Serna will not reach the crown of Mrs. Colombia.
The Valle receives its title number 14 of the prince.
Again the Cauca Valley remains with the gains of the Madam Colombia corona.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to comply with being in the podium of winners, gain the silver crown and the band that believed it as a new prince of Colombia.
With the outcome received in Cartagena, where Mrs. Atlantic was reached with the corona and the cereal, the apartment already takes 14 titles of Prinça and Melina was one to the ready of the vallecocan women who were next to the corona, but who were proclaimed princes between them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellinia Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Mary Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romaro (1993), Giselle Garza Aljuez (2000), Catholaina (2000), Stephea (2007), Garce (1988), Almenica Evers (1989), María Consue Pineo.
Today, what is the big question that many are doing?
Because the result represents the disappearance of a great favourite in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Madam Colombia, not in vain was chosen Queen of the Police, and best Roster Jolie de Vogue, the titles that received kings such as Taliana Vargas or Navarro, who took the crown of Madam Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision that the jury took to design her Prince radic in which he did not agree with his answer to the question "What is this book that has marked you and why? by Martín Murillo Gómez, from the Letterary Cart.
When the valley was interrupted, the valley answered:
"Let a lot, I think quite in literature, I think it's a form of culturalizing, definitively think the book that signed me of childhood is "The principle" is a pretty deep book.
Currently read "Crimen and punishment", is a book of universal literature that we all have to read; and today I'm reading the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Harder of blood".
A response which was little pleased first by the term "culturalization" and the second, not to explain specifically how each of the books mentioned it have marked.
But at the end of the ceremonie Melina she showed to feel quiet and happy with the result "The University is wise past what must happen.
And for all people, please read a little, "The principle" is a great book.
Among the lanced hypotheses, it is said that Valle burned the favoriteism.
A Bogotian journalist insisted that when being the favorite, the ovationed and the candidate who was carried out all the pre-pre-pre-priced premies (Oster gastronomy network, vote of the public by the best Artesanal bringing, and Reina Madre), "the celestial of the other candidates, stretched the Queen and therefore didn't broke in the scenario."
And this was noted in his first presentation in bathroom trail on the Hilton street and its two defiles in the coronation area.
While both of them were safe, it was noted that he was lacking the force and impotence that the representatives of Magdalene and Atlantic were demonstrated.
Ariel Osorio, the periodist of the program "Come at home", of the Canal RCN believed that the fact that Melina was designed princess "considered that the most premium candidate won't remain as a queen."
Furthermore, Valle showed the last very shot with the press, and there he was equity.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has not reached the jury to his interest to social work, which is finally the existence of the National Congress of Belza.
Something, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty showed that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their country.
"The only beauty is not enough in a Miss Colombia, we need to look over the physical and focus on their social sensitivity, which before entering the Concours are already involved in projects," explained.
It was also spent that Valle had sinned for his defects in the detrimentation and the fibrosis noted him in his abdomen, but it is contrary because the jury had elected her as the candidate 'Best of Nature' with the most healthy body, good food and physical work responsible.
The Queen Preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina had not the best body, "but his fibrosis problem in the abdomen, that the truth for my was not very notory for me was, was his points on the last day."
Among the periodist Guido Hoyos, the Cromos magazine believes that the valley error was the cherrgy interventions that were practised.
"The cypresses are okay, but Valle isn't sure to do it.
His body never was her strong, and here they caught her."
For this privilege, which firstly delivered the National Concours of the Belleza, after the displacement of bathroom, he surrounded a cruel vatician that had been fulfilled, because he said that it was the content that Raymundo gave him Melina to not give him the crowd.
Reality or no, it is true that Melina starts a year of king, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, which gives you the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the international certificates for designation of its own National Congress.
However, she will pass through the story as one of the queens that despite his arroller passed by Chargena, she was cut off the crown.
This was the work of the heat that identified the cadáver of Alfononso Cano.
Cali's lofoscopist was the story as the man who confirmed the death of Alfononso Cano.
The work of these officials is key.
Last 4 November, a CTI de Cali lofoscopist went to the story as a man who confirmed the identity of the maximum captain of the Farc: "Alfononso Cano", through the cocktail of its digital pills.
Of the seven lofoscopists working in the ICT section, that week he touched the turn of "facility" to Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada who worked 21 years in the court investigation area.
When he started his road, González worked in the municipalities of the Choko, where many times he had to enter for more than five days in the forest to get to the place where the cadbraes were to be identified.
In 2000, it was transferred to the capital of the Valley and then carried out the courses, specialized in lofoscopia, which is the study of the fresh hair, i.e. from the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operation against other Alfonono Cano to Eliazar warned him that he would bear at least three days.
Something great was waiting for him.
Saturday in the night, he went out to the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that two chambers should be identified and that one of them was one of the man who drew to the oldest army of the world, so they asked him to take the decade card from Guillermo Leon Saenz (the real name).
However, when he came with the research team at the site where the cadáver was found, he did not recognize him by his physical aspect, because he was very different to see in the media.
It was without bar, clothed as a campaign of the area, without tastes and much more disappearing.
But the threads don't count.
Compared by a galtonian lupo, kitt, a transplanter and a linter, Eliazar compared the dactullar impressions of the cadèver with those of the card.
His eye didn't miss it: it was "Alfononso Cano".
The same night, the orangeman of the Tejada Puerto was the defence minister of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón, who was the maximum captain of the Farc.
Searching the hole
For a dactloscopist of the Sixon of Cali, the recognition made by President John Manuel Santos to Eliazar González, in the press race by the operating "Canan", is very significant.
Many people don't know our job.
Dactiloscopia is a exact science, without a mark of error, which may be key in the crime resolution.
Besides the identification of cadávers, lofoscopics support investigations for crimes such as furniture and murder and confirm the identity of persons taken.
When they are captured, many criminals present false cedles or have no papers.
We take them the dactyal print and we search them on the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of crawl, he touched him to remove a wall of a house wall, because in that place the ladron had supported his hand to bring a strong cave full of joy and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not appropriate surfaces to pull a dacty impression, but in that case we could get the hair of the whole hand and identify the crime, which had been involved in different turts," he remembered.
The skins may also disappear or reaffirm suspicion in cases of murder.
It's a little time they found a dead man, with licor bottles around it.
The investigation was determined that a family could be suspected by the crime and, in fact, a bottle in the bottle was involved.
Although this does not ensure that the murder has been, it is the place in the scene of the crime.
A Dactiloscopist of the CTI explained that in the “the skins are taken with chemical or physical reactive” objects.
When it appears, a transplanter or kit is used to raise them.
After this, the impressions are sent to the Asif, which is the database of criminal data, or the Registration.
"The problem is that there are still many in documented colonies", the CTI expert.
He stated that not all is as shown in the CSI television program.
So as not everything it lights is gold, not everything it touches returns to heat.
However, if you can be used, the respective quote is performed.
The "indicated" was disappeared to the authorities in New York
Centers of manifestators were shot up before the Zuccotti plate to camp.
A great part waited for the dishwasher order and moved to a close park.
The integrators of the Business Wood Street dismissed this march to the authorities of New York by trying to enter again, under the appointment of a court order, to the Manhattan plate from where they were disappeared from murdered and trying to occupy another park of the Grand Manzana.
A hundreds of demonstrators were moving before the Zuccotti plate, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order that allows the "indicated" to camp again in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the dishwasher with a greater park in the north of the city where there were new detentions.
"Our idea is that, if the court does not allow us to return to the street, we'll be installed in some other place and we will continue the legal fight to return to Zuccotti, and through peaceful seats and manifestations," said one of the ports of the "Obcupa Wall Street", Mark Bray.
Bray reported that the response of the "indicated" to the departure of his camps personally designed by the hall of New York, Michael Blomberg, came to the courts, where the judge Lucy Billings made an order which prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the manifesters to keep in camps.
Furthermore, the "indicated" went to the occupation of a new park situated in the confluence of the Canal Street and the Sixth Avenida, very close to the entrance to the Tunnel Holland, a New York and New Jersey parish, and the property of Trinity Church park.
At least for a hour they continued to take the place, but afterward, the police tried to arrest some of the demonstrators, although Bray could not confirm the specific cipher, while he assured Efe that he saw several periodists who were also married.
The organization is ensuring that there are hundreds of people who have been installed at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already been moved in support of the integrators of the movement and which has tried to mediate with the police.
Subsequently, the Zuccotti Place - which is a private property recruitment - continues to be closed at the expectation of a judicial view planned for the same March in which the legality of the evacuation of this drug must be analyzed.
Some of the displaced demonstrators had to bear and returned to these hours copies of that judicial order and even delivered them to the officers who keep the plate, which caused "learn contempts," Bray said that some officials had pushed attacks to the demonstrators.
The judicial order prohibites the authorities to dismiss the members of Business Wall Street or apply "thes who were published after the starting of occupation or prohibiting demonstrators access from the park with tents or other properties that had been used previously."
The bloomberg apartment pointed out that, because of that judicial order, the city had suspended the opening of space to the public and the demonstrators, which he warned, however, that local laws would not allow them to be installed with campaigns and sacks to sleep.
The Register has personally defended the disagreement carried out from the Zuccotti plate, an operation in which about 200 detentions had been carried out and decided because the manifesters were "proliferated by law."
Blomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the place because it was become "in a place where people are not coming to protest, but to violate laws and, in some cases, to harm others," because "other business have received threats" and the neighbours fear "for their quality of life".
"The disappearance of this madrugad was aware and shows that the Bloomberg Fund is more interested in maintaining the financial interests than the United States workers," added the movement portrait, which accused the chamber of "flowing respect to the freedom of expression".
"Obcupy Wall Street" also pointed out that they think to organize "growd actions" for youth in collaboration with Community and insigned organizations, in order to remember the two months held by the protests, which started on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Virgin Mary in a special TV ship
Join to Michael Bublé and other important Canadians, it will appear in the TV programme "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" next 1 December
The Canadian Pamela Anderson has been the assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", assisted in "Baywatch", connected by "Playboy", the wife of the rock Tommy Lee music and now, the actriz and model will be the Virgen Mary in a special nature of the Canadian TV.
The private CTV television channel today announced that Anderson, together with the "Crooner" (baladista) Michael Bublé and other major Canadians, will appear in the "It's to Russell Peters Christmas" next 1 December by giving life to a very special Virgen Mary.
CTV has distributed pictures of the television program in which Anderson also known by the wide distribution on the Internet of a pornographic video card that appears together with his husband, the battery of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appears covered as the Virgin Mary, which is put on a fishery that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a known Canadian coomico of Indian origin who recently acted as a presenter in the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" of Charlie Sheen, appeared as José.
Besides Anderson and Peters, the CTV special shipping with the Canadian Cantor Bublé, which finally caught in Buenos Aires with the argentin model Luisana Lopilato, and which is not extraordinary to the controversie.
Recently, Bublé called "sorra" to the United States Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan renaiss the earthquake
The PIB increases 1,5% thanks to domestic consumption and puts end to the spirale of falls launched in March.
Since March last, the Japanese economy was paralleled, still convicted by the earthquake of the earthquake that became in a nuclear crisis, the worse catastrophe that paid the Niphon country from the II World War.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo ciphered material losses in $300,000, a battle that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have been attained.
After three consequent cubits, the date of the Brutto Interior Interior Product between July and September served to pass, finally: PIB has increased 1,5% in comparison with the previous quarter and 6% in an annual rate.
The recorded in the second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 - also suggests the highest growth ritm from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the point of the purchase of machines to restore the zones assolated by the sex and the tsunami post.
In fact, the enterprises increased their investments at 1,1 per cent, with 0,9 per cent in capital expenditures from January to March, the first recurrence after six months of interrounded submissions.
However, the true revulsion of the Japanese economy is not exclusively based on the key-spot that encourages the use of crises to strengthen - or rebuilding - infrastructures, to serve cares to grow from brain.
Japan has discovered, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60 per cent of the Japanese PIB.
This change has scaled a 1%, affected by increased expenditure in vehicles, travels and ocio activities.
The Een's ground
Tokio has been recommended to the internal market, when yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the "refuged values" elected by the investors who have fled from the debt crisis in the euro area and the previsions of the US, a privilege that despite a lower in the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger division, the products are worse in the foreign, a serious reveal for a country whose economic flexibility line is determined by the health of the large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, acquired their weak results between July and September to the cotisation of yen.
While markets continue to be assembled to the EU's perpetrator countries, the Government of Yoshiko Noda does not lay down the watch.
"There must be attentive to the risks persisting, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of Tailand’s inundances and the rapid appreciation of yen," she noted yesterday to the secretariat of the Economic Political State, Motohisa Furukawa.
And, in fact, the perspectives are not enthusiasm.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OCDE) said that most Member States had presented in September the most negative economic ralentization characters.
The indicator, which advanced the infringement points in the world economy, stressed that the main powers are rupting.
Since he was four decades until 100.4 points, against 100.8 August.
The euro area, including, was located under the average, at 100 level, at the precipitation of eight decades until 99.13 points.
Atenas return to feeding doubts
Daddy say that the amendments will be adopted, but the conservators will not sign any obligation written.
With dispersed risk prices and the incertainment reorganized in the parks, Greece continues to enhance the laberine that leads to the outcome of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consent" of the new serving government of transition is more imposed by the needs of Brussels than by a real consent of political forces starts to be confirmed with facts.
While the new Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there was no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of an agreemented day may be short to apply them, the leader of the New Democracy Conservative Party, Antonis Samaras, ensured that it would not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterate its requirement of new elections for the specified date, on 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to apply the decisions of the Summit of 26 October," said Daddy by opening a parliamentary debate tomorrow with a confidence to the new Executive vote.
A package with 24 programmes to encourage employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against fiscal evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras does not dismiss the doubts of his post: "We have committed us to help the Government of transition, but we have not undertaken anything else."
The Conservative leader was a farer step in the EU and FMI's pool, the agencies that were to deploy the 8,000 million Atenas needed with urgency, and left clearly that their view will not give any compliance letter.
But the European Commission, still elected by the impact caused by the Order of the Popendreu referendum, reiterated yesterday that his requirement is firm: it will not deploy the help if the new Government and the leaders of the chief parties are not signed " a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible."
The Port of Economic Affairs Amadeu Altafaj explained that the inspectors of the troika will return to Athena to discuss with the new Government "the need to pay the sixth stage" of 8,000 million, even though there is no final date.
The Greek wood still has hail for time.
Women Sophia: "There are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen stresss the place "president" of Spain concerning this type of finance
Spain "ha reached a world-level place in the role of the Microfinances".
The Queen Donna Sophia reminded yesterday that the country has become in these two last decades in the second donor of the planet in relation to this building of cooperation, whose "entry" indicated that it was a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope of a better future for all humanity, based on trust in human beings".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the World Summit of Microcreed in Valladolid with the convention that it was "not a doubt" of operations is "obviously essential" to reach the United Nations Millennium Goals with horizontal 2015, and "My particularly, in which it has the reduction of half of the volume of people living with lower income than a daily dollar, with which the "embourge of poverty" is set.
Spain "we continued to expand the network of benefiters" to all the planet's renowns, and assess this task with "competence", said Dona Sophie, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions originated in the Summit would be extended to the Thursday, "garantiate the creation of new capacity and best opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women," main benefits of these princes.
They are "please the achievements reached" and "Much as the challenges we do."
The Summit of the Microcrédit is planned not only as a debate forum, but also as the platform from which it encourages "two basic goals".
His Majesty explained that 175 million poor families who have accessed to these financial services and that hundreds of those homes have gone out of the shadow of poverty in which they are summited.
The impuls in the conception of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "had followed the seat pioneer years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, raised Doña Sophie as a "act of justice and recognition due".
And it is that he described the father of this tool as a "a wonderful idea for the universal cause of poverty fight", whose work knows for 15 years, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know about the field of its princes policy.
The first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as the celebrated in Costa de Marfil in 1999, Canada, and "In all I could find the continued evolution," explained Her Majesty, whose link with this project had been made to her yesterday the qualification of the "famile Chamber" collected in Valladolid by the "Backet of the poor".
Finally, the Queen Sophia concluded its intervention by encourageing presents to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to progress in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical Imperial"
The minister of Foreign Affairs, Jimenez Trinity, warned that solidarity " is an ethical imperative" for all democratic states.
In this regard, he expressed that it would be an error to link cooperation with countries in developing ways to emerging economic welfare, since it is a " permanent commitment".
Jimenez believed that microcredits propose "real and rigorous policy dedicated to eradication of poverty" and now "because never" developing countries should work under solidarity criteria and leave it to be victim of the recovery.
For Spain, the microcreed consists of "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For its part, the Secretariat of International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, added "the success" to give "consequence" to those "exclused to who all clos the doors"; and the hall of Valladolid, France Javier León de Riva, welcomed the presents to a city that "aspoke the doors contained by the solidar spirit".
The CDU proposes to choose the European President for universal subfraction
On the first day of the Christian-Democratic Union Congress (CDU), on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulties for Angela Merkel, Canciller and President of Christian-democratic party.
At first, the future of Europe had not been included in the agenda, but the subject is imposed in October, in particular to satisfy military people who believe that the Government's policy is currently too small with the Greeks and could be in an future with the Italians.
The proposal on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the direction, was practically adopted by onenimity.
Of the 1.001 delegations, only nine votes were registered against and ten abstentions.
The allocation of several minutes with their interventions, Angela Merkel, and, after a few hours, Wolfgang Schumble, the Eurofilm Minister of Finance, make any doubts possible.
The key idea of the Canciller and the motion is resumed in a lame: the response to the crisis "not less Europe, but more Europe."
Not only because Europe offers peace, but also because "New million jobs are directly depending on the euro".
For the Canciller, "the time of opening the path in Europe."
This could be shown in amendments of the Lisbon Treaty to enable the strengthening of the European Union's control on the budgetary policies of the euro area, although it could also be deployed in the election of the President of the European Commission for universal subfraction to "to give it a face to Europe."
In any case, this is one of the proposals for the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schumble.
Unfortunately, it is little likely that the twentieth arrived rapidly to an agreement on this radical change: Great Britain is hostile before him and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy also.
But the hair is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates rejected by a majority by enlargeing the proposal to lay down the weight of each country of the Directive of the European Central Bank on the weight of each economy, which would evidently strengthen Germany's weight.
The Canciller has increased the references to Conrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl in the middle of its game. But it is not that he has tried to gain its congress at the cost of the European 'peak' or countries in difficulties intended to criticize Germany' arrogant.
Although the motion on Europe is a member of the importance of "Franco-Elmana", Angela Merkel did not refer to France.
I'm alone.
Remembering that, two centuries ago, there was a bloody fight in Leipzig.
In fact, he was one of the most humble throats for the Napoleon Army.
Discrimination in lows per disease
Following subsidies, the UMP and the Government undertaken an offence against lower diseases.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, 15 November in Burdeos, to visit a family subsidies responsible and to proclaim a discussion on the subject, already recursive since 2007, of the fight against social fraude and assistance.
Furthermore, in order to accompani such offensive, which is part of the will of maintaining rigorously, but still recalling an eye of the presidency campaign of Rights, most wants to focus on lows by disease.
First, for the implementation of budgetary recruitments: the Government was intended to impose workers in the private sector a fourth day of lack before it can cooling the lower.
Finally, unless a specific company agreement exists, a hospital worker would lose four days of wages, i.e. at least 15 per cent of its monthly income.
This is a measure that could arise an iron oil, but it would allow 280 million euros, according to the Iceans.
Furthermore, it would be associated with another measure with a more symbolic approach: imposing the officials a disbursement day without payment in case of low work (for the time they have no lack, against the three days applicable in the private sector).
While these issues are discussed, most of them will again put on the table the issue of fraude, this time-oriented to the abuse of lower workers.
"There will increase significantly the controls and also if someone has been discovered by a fault, the quantities must be reimbursed," he advised Xavier Bertran, speaking on Sunday, 13 November.
As in other cases, the effects of the announcement seem to be low-proportional for the reality of fraude in the area of lower work.
Since 2002, a constant monitoring of this issue has been carried out and different political offensively launched which usually have produced fruit.
The Frenchs are not sick only in the rest of Europe.
We take care of the national numbers first.
According to the French Social Security Institute (CNAM) in 2006, more than 237 million euros were submitted to lower workers.
According to the French Research and Documentation Institute in Health economy, lower subsidies represented in 2008 5 per cent of the health costs of EUR 11,300 million.
The amount of the amount is 46 per cent of the lower maternity and laboral accidents, while 54 per cent is related to lower per disease, the number of EUR 6.200 million.
Therefore, 2.5 per cent of health costs.
In 2010, the French collected a average of 14.5 days of low work, against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of the Alma Consulting Group.
A average which, uncertainly, hides deviations: another investigation, published by the professional manager Monster.com in 2007, showed that 75 per cent of the incurred French asylums had not been collected or only a low day for disease.
Another study, in this case of disease, indicates that in 2010 37 per cent of disease lower than 8 days, 22 per cent of 8 to 14 days, 15 per cent of 15 days and a month, 15 per cent of one to three months and 11 per cent of the most extended.
If we compare them with our European neighbours, the French workers are not more proper than in other areas to coaper low by disease.
A long study carried out in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that between 1994 and 2001, the total unnecessary rate of work (for other reasons of health) was 15 per cent in France, between 10 per cent and 11 per cent, with 20 per cent and 28 per cent in Denmark, in the United Kingdom or between 16 per cent and 18 per cent in the Netherlands.
Between drugs for disease is not particularly significant in comparison with unredeclared work.
fraude has a quite limited altitude.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has caused low controls of over 45 days to be systematic.
In 2008, from 1,5 million inspections, the CNAM tested, at 13 per cent of 285.000, that short-term duration was "injustified or too long", i.e. 37.050 cases.
In the case of lower than 45 days, subsequent to systematic inspections, 11 per cent of the cases were "related or unjustified; a number that, with a total of 1,2 million, approximately 132.000.
A total of 169,000 cases "unjusted" are therefore reached among several millions of employees that were low for disease.
Unfortunately, a insignificant figure in comparison, for example, with the black work.
According to the Deputy Dominican Tian, the author of a report on this issue in June would represent a loss of tax income between 9.000 and 15,000 euros per year, more than the total cost of lower subsidies and, uncertainly, significantly more than fraude in this last area.
Papodemics: Greece must apply a new set of adjustments
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to enhance its economy.
This is what he declared on Monday, 14 November, Prime Minister Lucas Papademus before Parliament; he also added that the hundred days that they have been granted to his Government of union would not be sufficient to achieve this goal.
"To achieve efforts to recover the economy, we need support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme," said the Chief of the Government, which proclaimed its first public debate during the inauguration of the debate on the speech of confidence to the Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions taken during the Euro area Summit on 27 October will be the "prioral task" of the new government, as "the country is in game" added.
Consequently, the country's public deficit will be reduced by 9 per cent of the PIB before the end of the year, after reaching 10.6 per cent in 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the Chief of the Rights Group, showed the moon its support to the already adopted measures to try to exit from the debt crisis, but warned that its party would not be engaged with additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he confirmed during a meeting with the Members of its Party "New Democracy".
He noted that it was agreed with the objectives of reduction of debt and debt, and with the fight against disappearance, but against any policy that prevents economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that FMI and the EU would not deploy the cost of 8.000 million euros required without a written guarantee of the support of all parties to the planned measures, Antonio Samaras answered that it would be sufficient and that nothing would be signed because of the external pressure.
A Expert Committee claims that the Eutanasia and the Assistant Suicide must be legalized
The Canadians live by denying death, as indicated in the report of the Real Society of Canada
Concerning Palestinian care, the Committee calls for Governments, health institutions and doctors to cooperate in order to ensure the best Palestinian care, not only in cancer cases.
Canadian society lives by denying death.
In fact, just 9 per cent of the Canadians are ready to speak to their doctor about the conditions they want to die and take provisions to that effect.
It is one of the conclusions of an imposed report of the Real Society of Canada, which has mentioned the participation of six experts in different areas, including ethical, legal and doctor.
The Committee recommends the Government to amend the Criminal Code so that the Assistant and Eutanasia, when the patient is planned to this option and has been judged to take the decision.
For the beginning, experts cited a recent investigation of the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries in the world.
Although Canada is occupied by the tenth post, the study notes that "the medication of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people fear to treat the issue of death."
With medication or no, 77 per cent of the Canadians have no access to Palestinian care as indicated by the Real Society of Canada.
And, despite the majority of the Canadians want to die at home, 68.6% of them have been falling in the hospital.
In general, the highest rate in this sense is registered by Quebec, where 86 per cent of the deaths are produced in the hospital.
With regard to the delicate issue of Eutanasia and the Assistant Suicid, the authors of the report have reached conclusions that do not match the post of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it would not wish to amen the Criminal Code regarding Eutanasia and the Assistant Suicid.
However, according to the experts, that also have studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or not represent a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that a criminal offence has not been considered has caused an abuse of its application, i.e. the use of eutanasia or the subsequent prosecutor with non-competent persons or who had not granted their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, the co-autor of the report, confirmed yesterday by teleconference that, in the contrary, more excesses were observed in countries where eutanasia and attended suicide had not been legalized.
"In Canada Eutanasia is a clearly illegal."
"In Canada, although it is clearly illegal," Jocelyn Dowie explains.
Canadians, favorite for Eutanasia
Remember that 85 per cent of the Canadians have already been proclaimed for Eutanasia, as they believe that he would allow people whose death is near to disappear their suffering, as indicated in an investigation of Angustus Reid in 2010.
Furthermore, 66% believes that the fact of legalization of Eutanasia will not give it to understand that the life of older persons or disabilities have less value.
As regards those who have practised the attended suicide, 41 per cent of the investigations believes that a process should not be started against them.
With regard to maintenance or interruption of health assistance to a patient, the situation is not so clear, as indicated by the authors of the report.
Furthermore, among its recommendations suggest that the Criminal Code is indicated that the receipt of health care, if legally rejected, does not impose a criminal crime.
The Expert Committee also requests the health professionals to respect the fact that a patient rejects assistance at the end of his life without fear to face a complaint.
Concerning Palestinian care, the Committee calls for Governments, health institutions and doctors to cooperate in order to ensure the best Palestinian care, not only in cancer cases.
Finally, in relation to Palestinian or terminal sedation, which is already used in Canada sanitary institutions, the Committee requested, unless he served to reduce physical pain, it is considered as eutanasia and is subject to the same procedures.
Other experts manually reserved
Other experts in the field of health have already shown its reservations regarding the conclusions of the report of the Experts of the Real Society of Canada.
Peter Deshamps, specialist in the right of health, has calculated the post of experts signing the report, among other things because it is not limited the practice of eutanasia to patients in a terminal phase.
"This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who has stopped to live and may have more than 18 years to ask for a survival," said Deshamps, who consulted yesterday a summary of the report.
Mr. Deschamps also emphasized that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy on any other value of society.
Now, he adds that "in society, there are labels and limits."
The Margaret Somerville Health Specialist also expressed its “fit opposition” on the conclusions of the report, which had "manifessed for Eutanasia".
Margaret Somerville, which also belongs to the Real Society of Canada, is particularly the lack of abuse in certain countries where Eutanasia and the Assistant Suicid are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The king of Jordan urged President El Asad to leave the power
Damascus claims a "complot"
Syria is always more isolated
Bachar El Asad had appeared yesterday before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Tomorrow, the diplomatic pressure on the Syrian of Bachar El Asad was strengthened that, with Russia's support, the resistence and the declaration that there is a "complot" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab Liga, the European Union has strengthened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbourings of Syria, have been demonstrated for the leave of power by President Asad.
The King Abdala II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader who requested the President Bachar El Asad to "depart from the power" in Syria, where a quarter of civilians and members of the forces of the regime have already failed.
"If Bachar really worried about his country, it should also be allowed to create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, neighbouring Syrian country, in an interview for the BBC.
By its part, the Chief of Turkish diplomacy, Ahmet Davidoglu, has regretted that the mediation efforts carried out by Turkey since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have ended in a fracase.
"Whoever are not in peace in the Middle East with their peoples and can't satisfy them, they're going," he declared by neighbouring Syria, with respect to which Turkey is taking a more harder position.
After the decisions of the Arab Liga and of the European Union, the United States have held that "the consensus against Asad and the actions of the Syrian regime" has been "forced".
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab Ligue and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking a more hard tonne" in respect of the repression in Syria, notes Mark Toner, the Department of State.
While soon, 16 civilian lives have been lost and at least 19 members of the regime forces in the South Syria, as stated by the Syrian Observer for Human Rights (OSDH).
Other two civilians failed to "during bombards and tirotes with weak furnitures in Jobar" in Homs city, as indicated that NGO.
During a press race, the Syrian Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid Al Mualem believes that the country "aparts to the end of the crisis."
Furthermore, he has reacted firmly before the decision of the Arab Liga to sustain his functions, which is "related step".
Syria "not will blow," added, ensured that "the complements against Syria will fracase."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab Liga has currently examined a "mechanism of Civil Protection" and wants to send 500 members of human rights Arab organizations, military media and observers to the country.
The French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, also demonstrated its support to send United Nations observers to contribute to protect civilians against the repression of the regime which, in his view, takes place in the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League in Rabat is planned to take the implementation of the crisis outcome plan adopted on 2 November before, in particular, the retirement of the armed forces from the cities that are in hand of the opposition and release of the detained demonstrators.
The Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov has judged yesterday as “incorrect” the decision of the Arab Liga, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis outcome plan, although he did not demonstrate its support to the implementation of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti requests time for the markets and sacrifices to the Italians
The future chief of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, has requested time for the markets to form its team and to implement a programme that will include "saficis" aimed at recover the lossed credibility during the last months of Berlusconi Government.
The former European Commissioner discussed yesterday with the political parties, and today he met the incidents and the patronal.
It should be a relatively limited giant, combined by external technology to Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a large programme with numerous sacrifices," said Frances Nucara, deputed by one of the numerous small parliamentary groups who participated in meetings after meetings with the President of the designed Council.
For its part, the President of the Chamber of Members, Gianfranco Fini, has stated that Mario Monti would require a vote of confidence to the Parliament in order to ensure that the new Government provide sufficient support.
The consultations will end with the presentation by Mr Monti of a limited list, unlikely of a tenth of Ministers, the Head of State, the Napolitan Day.
Monti has commented the nervousism of the bustal markets and the obligationists yesterday, asking them time.
In the "Democracy, there are some necessary terms" to form a Government and prepare its programme, added that it is "sure that the markets will have patience and understand it."
The Chairman has initially obtained the pleasure of the markets, but then the concern is imposed, particularly after an imprevised fall of the industrial production in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister designed should create an mainly technologically formed technological team, even if he noticed that he would like to include "politics".
The new Government should work until 2013, on the date of the next legislative,.
According to the President of the Chamber of Members, Gianfranco Fini, the new Government will receive the vote of confidence of the Parliament before Friday.
Monti has been engaged in that, when it is concerned, it will take into account the urgency and the goal that Italy 'required its protagonism' in Europe.
A European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that "including a new government, our diagnostic diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change."
The EU, agreed that Rome will not achieve its goal of a budget balance in 2013, despite the austerity plans adopted for the past months, requested the adoption of new rigor measures.
The "head of the Jefes" Italian Emma Marcegilla, who will see you the murder, also stressed the need to encourage the economy, "because a country that doesn't grow is able to respect the requirements of deficit".
Monti, known by its competence and independence as the European Commissioner (1994-2004), proposes a "country time" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconsism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the retreat of the series" and "other Italy", according to the editorialists.
The great unconscious will be the length of your team.
The President of Napolitan wants to avoid an advanced election, since Italy needs to place before April 2012 about 20 million euros in State obligations.
A Russian scientist has cooperated with the Iranic Nuclear Programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danlinko, has cooperated with Iran in the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapons, as stated in Monday, a American NGO specialized in the atomic risk.
For the identification of the investigator, the International Science and Security Institute (ISIS) is based on a recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency Agency (AIEA) and on other documents issued by the United Nations Agency.
AIEA demonstrated the past week its “related concern” by a “pouble military dimension” of the Iranian Nuclear Programme.
According to the ISIS, based on AIEA documents, Danileko, born in 1934, would have been working for three decades since 1960, in a Soviet Military Military Centre in Tscheliabinsk (Oural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, it would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nodiamants" in Kiev.
The economic problems of their company would have brought you to contact, in 1995, with the Iranian Ambassador in Ukraine.
Afterward, it was believed that he cooperated with the Iranian programme between 1996 and 2002, before he returned to Russia.
In its last report, the AIEA states that there are "claves that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system " with the assistance of a foreign expert, which did not only know the technical, but also, as a Member State has informed the Agency, worked during the majority of its road in the military programme of its country of origin."
The crimes and crimes against musulmans have increased 50%
The crimes and crimes against musulmans have increased approximately 50% between 2009 and 2010, while the remaining types of racial and religious violence in the same period have disminued or increased only slowly, as indicated in the statistics published by the FBI in the month.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence against musulmans have increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, i.e. 49 per cent in the case of acts of violence against catholics, 4 per cent of the crimes against Jews and 14 per cent of the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of "related crimes" has grown slowly to 6.628 cases, of which 47.3% must be at racial differences and 20% to religious differences, as indicated by the FBI.
"Of a declusion in 2009, it was concerned that this type of crimes and crimes has returned to increased this type of crimes," said the human rights organization, "the increased acts of violence against musulmans are particularly significant", added the organization in a communication.
"Human Rights First takes a long time noting that violence against musulmans, as well as all kinds of hatred crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights," adds a license of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The United States Government can and must be endeavoured to end these abuses," adds that these efforts could include an improvement of the police reports on the "nood crimes".
The "homine crimine" in the United States Federal Law was endangered from the time of combating civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence associated with race, hair color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes your platform and seems more to Facebook
The microblogging Twitter site changed the moon the presentation of its platform to allow users, in particular, to observe the activities of people to whom they continue, which causes your service to appear a little more to Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" called allows to continue more legible and directly the activity of other "Twitts", which is, of those internal whose messages ("tweets") still on the Internet or that they continue to you.
This allows you to know if you follow messages, if they are subscribed to new accounts, if they calculate a favorite message, etc.
This new Twitter formula has been tried "with a small percentage of users in August" before you spread it on the rest of the moon, as indicated the AFP, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, who was known by its little instinctive operation, with lowlyэтic terms (RT to return another person's message, followfriday to recommend following another user) with the happiness of the initiatives, then opened a broader public with a more comparable manual to the great public networks Facebook and Google+.
In the network, users have discussed the interest of this innovation.
"It's an invasive, invasive result and seem too much to Facebook," write @jemb123.
"The Activity function will help me to follow some of the items of my Twitter flow," write@dannykronstrom.
Austria
Introduction of a "or" budgetary" in the Constitution
The Government of Great Social Coalition and Democratic Criminal Coalition, which is in Austria, has decided to include a "or" budgetary "just" in order to reduce public deficit and, thus, avoid a possible degradation of the sovereign notice of Austria through credit qualification agencies (A).
It was the own Social Democratic Canciller, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian Public Debt reaches 74.6%, a very higher number of 60% of the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solution is reduced at a single level, from AAA+, we would have to pay $3,000 more in interests every year," said the Vicecanciller Democratic Democratic of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindelegger.
Austria also answers the request of the Brussels Summit to the Member States of the euro area of the last 26 October: The Heads of State and Government requested the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of public deficit and recovery of the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in an equivalent law.
The device adopted by the Austrian Government is close to the German model, since Germany was the first European country who adopted this "related" type.
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease each year at 0.75% of the brut internal product (PBB) and, since 2017, the structural deficit of the Federal State should not exceed 0.35% of the PIB, while regional States and communities should present balanced budgets.
The goal is that public debt is reduced by the Maastricht Treaty to 2020/2021 under the criteria of 60%.
A strong one
Noah threat with a new change market intervention
The Japanese Prime Minister, Yoshiko Noda, announced the March that the Japanese authorities would reiterate the change mark if it continued to increase.
"We'll interview, as we've done last time, if we're sure that a supercessive bird is produced" in the type of yen change, she explained Noda to the Senate.
On Tuesday, yen reached up to the next levels of the historical maximums that had made the intervention of the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
That day, Tokio sold massively yenas per dollars to lower the value of the Japanese division, which ended to reach a new record from 1945 in comparison with the United States currency.
But the yen has gone gradually since then, inspired by buying investors who consider it as a "refugied value" in these incertain times of global economic ralentization and debt crisis in Europe.
The drager returned to quote the marge at least 77 yenes and the euro has descended under the symbolic bar of 105 gains, reaching the next levels that caused the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dalar was at about 120 genes and the euro to more than 160 gardens.
This explosion of the niponese section affects the export of the archipelago, as it enriches Made products in Japan and reduces the value of income obtained by Japanese companies when they become them to the national currency.
"Japon is fighting for reconstruction" after the sixth and the tsunami on 11 March, which destroyed the Tohoku region (noreste), reiterated Noda, which fears that the short-term growth of the race weakness.
The third world economic power has recovered growth in the third quarter (a 1.5% in relation to the previous quarter) first time in one year, thanks to an increase in export and the consumption of households affected by catastrophe.
But the Prime Minister believes that the high level of eten did not reflect the "Economic bases of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, requested the Japanese Bank (BoJ), which held a two-day meeting of its monetary policy Council, which takes all possible measures to disabilize the eten.
However, the added Governor of the institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that BoJ had already taken “the appropriate measures” in view of understanding that monetary flexibility should not be expected.
During its last meeting at the end of October, the emission Institute increased in five jane bills (47,000 euros) its buys from Tesoro Tesor's Texas, taking 55 janes bills (519,000 euros) the shadow of the funds dedicated to the acquisition of various financial titles to income the liquidity market.
Eurozone:
The types grow, the bottles flash
The risk of debt crisis continues to harm European indexes.
Despite the appointment of new Government Heads in Greece and Italy, as well as of better growth numbers in France and Germany, the rates of the most debilitated countries are still increased.
On 15 November, the European bottles are still worried about the stability of the euro area’s stability.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., CAC 40 feeds to 1.4 per cent and sets up to 3.064 points.
The Dax felt in Frankfurt at 0.4% and London is 0.1%.
"Bearing into account new tensions relating to the performance of the costs of the most affected euro area, the busy markets in the world continue to reduce part of their recent gains."
"The investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the contagio risk," Terry Pratt explains, institutional corrector in IG Markets, cited by the Reuters Agency.
Tokyo Bolsa has closed the fall of 0.7%, renewing the concerns of the market intervenants in Europe's capacity to contain the debt crisis.
"Japon, as the rest of the world, has the view fixed in Europe and exchange will continue to be implemented in a margin of reducted changes so that investors will not have evidence that the situation has been established," considers Mitsushige Akino, a fund manager in Iyoshishi Investment Management.
The reappointment of concerns for the future of the euro area affects the only currency, which continues to be lowering on the marges.
The euro remains at its lower level since a month and a half.
Before 10 hours, the European Division was $1,3570, a fall of 0.4 per cent.
According to the correlators, it has lost the value after the ship of the Canciller Angela Merkel, the CDU, which was meeting the month in the Congress, accepted a motion which preved, in particular, the option that a country in difficulties came out of the euro area without abandoning the European Union.
Italian and Spanish types exceed 6.% of growth
Italy and Spain's credit rates remain at a very concerned level.
On Monday, the performance of Italian obligations at 10 years was 6.85%, while Spanish titles at the same time offered 6.2%.
These tensions relating to the types of interest in the southern countries, even though also France, continue to devour fears of the interventioners.
The Chief of the future Italian Government, Mario Monti, has requested time to markets to improve the situation in Italy, which is the risk of employing the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademus said that the implementation of the decisions adopted in the Summit of the euro area on 27 October would be the main work of its Government.
Spain is on the market view point, while the Sunday will be held on the legislative elections there.
The difference of the types ("spread") between the obligations to 10 years in Germany and Spain has reached a new historical maximum.
At the expectation of the euro area growth figures
From the statistical point of view, France has registered a economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, i.e. a more favourable number than 0.3% planned by domestic consumption.
However, the Insee has revised the low number of the second quarter, with a reduction of 0.1% of the brut internal product (PIB) instead of an exchange.
Furthermore, the fourth quarter is that really worried about the economicists.
Germany has registered a growth of 0.5% during the same period.
The first provisions for the whole euro area are provided at 11 hours after the European Commission announced on the risk of a new receivation.
Energy policy:
The facts must be more than dogma
If there is a subject that can't be treated, taking into account short-term considerations or just thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
Availability and electricity costs directly affect the acquisitive power and competitiveness of enterprises.
It is appropriate that a electoral meeting is the time of reflecting such issues and the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if the whole of the economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options will be examined.
The French must base their view in facts on rational data.
Now that we are 7,000 million people in the planet, the demographic evolution will make the duplication of the electric demand before 2050, unless a major part of the world's population is of a vital element.
At the same time, it should be needed to deploy the weakness of fossil resources to continue to produce electricity continually, without forgeting the imperial need to reduce emissions of winter gas effect to combat climate change, a theme which has disappeared in the environmental debate.
The accident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to reject nuclear energy.
This is not the case or Belgium, which is the need to find a source capable of replace it, or Switzerland, which only has to build central objectives for the last generation.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil continue to cite some examples.
The United States, on its side, decided to add a unit to their park, back to the construction of a central interruption after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is present in occasions as an example, the reality is against that talk.
Berlín's election will propose an increase in electricity price, a greater energy dependence because the increased gas need, particularly Russia, increased CO2 emissions by the construction of gas and carbon centres.
In some months, the damage effects will be noted.
There should be thought about the case of Denmark.
Europe's campaign in the ecological sector, 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest carbon and gas users because of the intermittion of wind; therefore, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are respectively 65% and 50% higher than the European media.
On the contrary, our neighbours are a 40 per cent of electricity than the French households.
While in a globalized economy the energy cost is a key factor of competitiveness and guarantee of industrial use in the national territory, French companies benefit from the most barried electricity of Europe.
For this reason, any significant reduction of nuclear energy would submit a strong subsequent on the price of electricity, which would remain realistic to the great declarations on the reindustrie of our country and the defence of our acquiring power.
It is a price that most of the French refuse to pay and, in fact, they do not manage opposition to this type of energy, as shown in the investigations.
Remember that the energy policy of our country has lost the construction of a industrial sector with 125,000 director workplaces and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Increased export galaxy opens specialized pyms on international markets and they can create unlocalized jobs.
If France decided to leave nuclear energy, it would submit largely the victim of these PM and the loss of the 6,000 euros annually in French nuclear balance and services exports.
What electricist would a EPR designed to function sixty years when the decrease of your manufacturer is planned?
In order to solve the ecuation of nuclear energy, there must be no wonderful source of electricity production as well as a diagnostic source.
The development by the Area of Solutions with low CO2, nuclear and renewable emissions shows the complementary character of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, the maximum security level is imprecible.
In France, we have a security Authority to exercise a close and transparent control both on existing centres and on Flamanville's construction.
Our teams, professional recognized teams, are also obsequent to security.
In the mid-eighth century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one of the Three Mile Island has been produced in normal operational conditions; no consequences nor environmentally caused persons.
In Chernobil, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and a few undonable human falls.
In Fukushima, some people seem to be forgotten that the accident was due to two natural catastrophes of an unprecedented area, which caused the death of tens of persons.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as did by the two previouss.
Thanks to these progress and cooperation between security authorities, and French and German operators and constructors, the EPR provides a design that can resist these philosomes.
While all electric actors who want to build a central, the interruption of their construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, because it would leave them free to assess the leadership in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is essential and legitimate to find the best energy options for our country, but it would be unrepensable to allow emotion, dogma and partisan managers to dominate a very important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised from various views: the saturation of police, judicial and administrative services under the figure policy, the compatibility of this policy with the "auto-proclamed state of the human rights countries" in France.
Recently, it is the administrative actor of foreign students who has led to the holders with the Minister of Interior (see the Libération Journal of 23 May) and proclaiming from the past that France "not need for foreign talents, workers and roads."
However, it is rarely analyzed from the economic point of view.
The question is that there is enough consensus between the left and the right.
In the case of the right, James Chirac set the guidance in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country accounting close to two million inmigrants" while the tonn gave it to Michel Rocard in 1990.
The only difference, the degree of generosity
In 2005, both the left and the right shared fear of the invasion of the national territory for a multitude of polaric sources.
At both sides, immigrants are considered to be a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity acting with regard to immigrants.
In its programme, François Holland is limited to include banalities, indicated that the code-roll will allow the " migration problem".
This is the idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, perhaps an electricity, but economicly gets very face.
As the Economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron stated in a recent work that resumes the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional people: How MigrationMoused Our World and Will Defines Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a wide consensus between the specialists on the positive impact of the economic growth, the wages and the employment of the migrant countries.
The limitation of immigration deficits growth and threatens employment.
The fears relating to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace national workers, in particular the few qualified, and pressure to reimbursement their wages.
But the experience shows that immigrants are actually more complementary than national workers' institutions and are mainly performing professionals in sectors with unemployment.
A few qualified migrants work in sectors that do not meet national and qualified employees in dynamic sectors where training does not meet staff demand.
A positive effect on wages
Likewise, a circle would have difficulty to work in a country that lacks of anestists, the complementality between national and immigrants causes that the arrival of these recent influences is positively affected in the wages and employment of nationals.
In view of the above, John Peri calculated that an increase in the 1% of migratory flows was submitted to a long-term real wages between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, notwithstanding the fact that the diversity of immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (the great proportion of naturalized Nobel USA and companies such as Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were funded by immigrants).
The immigrants also are net contributions to social systems, as they are average of a 1% of the total budget in the European countries.
For example, the International Labour Organization calculates that an immigrant in Germany with a 30-year-old will make a net import of EUR 150,000 to the average public budgets throughout its life.
At the beginning of its mandate, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the growth points that had been missing " with the dens".
These dees, who disappeared the immigrant, had exactly the inverse effect.
Europe has discovered democracy, only the lack of thinking in a European democracy
Democracy is a good precious, but also fresh.
The European continent should be able to agree in this since, although it has been found in Athens over two thousand years ago, it has suffered the tragedias of the World War, totalisms, Holocaust, the guilty, but also in Spain, in Portugal, the crowds in Greece.
Some may have believed that, for democracy finally triumphed on their enemies, it would be sufficient to execute the vote and directly possible.
We know, from Napoleon "The Child" that was about something thinking.
The universal sufragio, although it is a condition necessary for democracy, it is not sufficient for himself only and even can be converted into a "Operpression instrument", as an anti-republic philosoph of Etienne Vacherot has said.
No, democracy needs much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organization, separation and control of powers, education, Luces, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we live in Europe is a economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The Greek referendum, in this regard, had a double repercussion: he showed the need for a powerful return from the political area, but also the worried sensation of its improvingness, of its inconsistentness.
It should be reflected on this ambiguity to overcome it.
The truth is that the lines of the anti-democratic battle are currently displaced and that, in many cases, republic soldiers are no longer progress in good sense.
We will not go over if we require a success of national references, organized according to the needs and disordered.
A white sign to absolute European monastery or high to the empty of the national axe: what options for the citizen!
No, we don't want to bring effects, but a common exercise, of full law, quiet and continuing, from the options and democracy this time at European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (the fact we wouldn't know where the list ends), because there is only a crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The whole Europe is that extends the orders of markets and qualification agencies, which paid its impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers a humbleness in the international area.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all Europe who slowly asks sovereignty and, with her, each of its nations.
The most urgentest is that popular sovereignty will recover the term of the European project.
Because only together Europeans can reduce the weight of their debts, free from the markets and prepare their future through investments.
The outcome of the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without a complete democratic legitimacy, except to lead us to disaster.
After long-term fighting this proposal of socialists and James Delors, the whole person is now asking a European economic governance.
That's it.
But to think about it without a greater political and democratic integration, and without being lived as such by citizens, it would be a new late and bring us to a new dead point.
We must take a new stage of the European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to make republics.
The revolution motivated by interests would not be sufficient.
This selection remains applicable.
We must build a more integrated Europe from the economic point of view.
Only one can be achieved by building a more democratic Europe at the political level, a genuine European sovereignty.
To build Europe, we do Europeans.
The cards with chip "no contact" are generalised
The world salon of Chip cards starts the Tuesday in Villepitant, near Paris, with an optimistic environment.
In fact, 2011 should end with an increase in 11% in the global card sales with microprocessors (bank tarts, SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6,000 units according to the Eurosmart provider.
The most powerful segment is the technology without contact, which allows to subscribe common transport or purchases simply close to the card to a reader.
This year will be sold in the world 460 million cards with no contact, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its contribution should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units) and represent approximately 10% of the world's card market with chip (6.925 million cards).
Europe, which takes long time for the Asian and Pacific region, is winning land in the payment sector without contact.
Available of 26 million bank cards Visa already have this function, accepted in 75.000 payment terminals.
In France, their starts are more modest: 400,000 cards are used without contact.
But the large surfaces are four.
Carrefour has emitted this year 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
However, in order to put the upper drive, banks are required to provide them from their customers.
"There are two major French institutions that have been committed to systematically distribute between their customers, bank cards paid from the system without contact", says Gerard Nébouy, Director-General of Visa Europe France.
Banks test the mobile phone payment
But only represents a first stage towards the means of the future: the mobile phone.
There are now few devices equitable with NFC technology (Now Field Communication), essential to carry out transactions.
"They're ride."
"But I should experience a real age of the year that comes."
"We prefer to be sold between 80 and 120 million in 2012," Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the front.
The Crédit agricultural bank announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and the next June in Caen.
The iPhone will be equipped with about 200 clients and collaborators with a fund that allows the payment without contact.
The ECB has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marsella.
And the General Society also stated yesterday that it is preparing the marketing of a offer that allows its customers to pay without contact through its mobile.
De Sahara to Nigeria, terrorism will increase
Party is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb and the sect of Boko Haram.
The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb (Aqmi) and the sect of Boko Haram, which has been suspected since a time ago, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the Foreign Minister, Abdelkader Mesahel, even confirmed that Argel already "intacts the certification."
"The way both organizations work and the reports of the intelligence services show that they are cooperating", explained, without to provide more details.
It seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation on the survey of two French in Niger last January would have renewed the passengers.
In a restaurant of Niamey for persons related to Aqmi, Antoine di Léocour and Vincent Delory died next day with several of its surveys during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the squares of the intervention, French and Nigerian researchers discovered several telephone chips that were involved by terrorists.
Earlier terrorist
The study of the calls indicated to several partners based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers took particularly the interest of the researchers: one leads to a nigerian who remained a long time in Maiduguri, a city of the north of Nigeria, the coast of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who, expectedly, is close to Aqmi and the sect.
"It's a progress, but we have to hope to have more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We know for years ago that the sect enjoys financial and external intellectual support and is always more active", says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
The last months, these "spoyos" were always more clear in Boko Haram's evolution and talks, or in its operational ways, which are now involved the use of camics or explosive devices always more complex and the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting by Washington, is from then pressing to Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
In fact, the Nigerian authorities take time when considering the group as a community of lightnings a little worth of interest.
Quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri in the mixture, a school and the fundamentalist image of Mohammed Joseph, Boko Haram (the meaning, in hause, "Western education is a sin"), teaching the establishment of an islamic emirate in the north Muslim of Nigeria.
In this poor region, partnership is a fast success.
It is politics and requires a strict respect for the sharia, while his military forces are launched to fight against the imposed central government.
These are first directed to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram warrants were particularly active and many attacks were multiplied.
Abuya's reaction was, as it was, generalized.
The army attacked the city and recorded 800 dead.
Mohammed Joseph, arrested in life, receives death in prison.
From then, the sect is radiized and leaves its fires from the north.
The Christmas pasts, revitalizes an attention caused by 80 dead in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram returned to attack Abuya, in particular against the police protected general quarter, with a suicidio attack, the first of this type.
In August, the United Nations local seat becomes its first international objective.
The establishment of a terrorist eye in Africa, which would leave from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, is concerned about all security specialists.
While Aqmi attacked Mali and Níger and the Summers of Al-Céba operate in Kenia, Boko Haram stands as a new threat in the continent centre.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and confirmed that he was ready to "partite all the information."
The world in accordance with the candidates is republiced to the Presidency
With regard to China, with Iran and with aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry revaluate in simpleness and lack of knowledge.
A America disabled by the crisis, can you manage a complex world with simple ideas or, even simplistics?
Hearing the republic candidates for the presidency, electors could think that it is.
Since a few days, Middle Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates always make more exciting statements and acts on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of republics.
The legs are often enthusished, on China, Iran, helping Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best candidate on the road towards the design by the "Grand Old Party" has threatened to bring Chineses to the WTO and to announce them "for manipulation of your division", a key topic in an ex-awaited America by migration of all fragments from its sector to Asia.
Even if it involves the explosion of a commercial war, he confirmed.
Jon Huntsman, the former Ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate that has a sophisticated vision of the external policy, is nearly emphasized by an attitude that "apabulla" emotions.
She asked a firm dialogue, but constructive, with Pekine (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who remains enthusished in the depths of the sonds, remains unaudiable.
For Reagan style
Romney has also promised a military intervention in Iran if sanctions could not interrupt their nuclear programme.
"If I'm going out, I'll stop Iran," she's fantased.
"If Obama's sold releged, you'll have the bomb."
He also promised an increase in military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama of having infringed its obligations in relation to that partner.
The Master Herman Cain, the second best classified candidate, of its part shows a shameless unknown of these subjects.
Recently, he urged the contrary to the Chinese military threat because Pekin 'third nuclear development capacity' appears to be ignored of the fact that China already has military attack since 1964.
The technological Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says that, on its part, it is ready to deploy the United States Army in Mexico to fight the drug cartels.
Resource to torture against terrorist taxes, prohibited by Obama in 2009, also subsequent Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the Republic of 2008, John McCain, a weight of external policy.
The opponents of the current President replied that Reagan also had simple ideas and that the Fry War gained.
They remember that the own Obama was an effective, and that he had to flood the pit on combating terrorism.
In fact, in the fraction of his ingenous dialogue with Iran, in the precipitation of the "boys" of Iraq and in its territorys in Libya, and the label of weakness.
But attacks are not simple.
The population judges more positively the national security balance of Obama, which has completed Bin Laden.
Since Iraq, the disconflict of the military interventions generated by dogma.
And, argueing that we need to rebuilding America economicly to raise his leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more fair.
North Stream, new Russian entrance door in Europe
The north Stream gas, which communicates directly Western Europe with Russia through the Baltic Sea fund, has already been served.
Gas must provide to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian Great of Gazprom, has desired to celebrate the event with a big pompa.
The past march, more than 500 invited, including four heads of State and Government, participated in the Baltic orchests, between the music of the orchest and a delicate buffet, in the inauguration of the North Stream, the new gas that communicates directly under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Similarly, the German Canciller Angela Merkel, the Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, the French Prime Minister François Fillon and its Homology of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte, have turned together the flood of the flood that controls the entry of Russian gas into the West Europe network.
With this new gaseduct, each year, 27.5 million Russian cowboys will reach additional in Western Europe through a first team of 1.224 km that communicate the region of San Petersburg with the country of Meckleburg-Pomerania.
A second tube should be concluded at the end of 2012, which will allow for a total of 55,000 million cowboy meters to cover all French consumption.
Furthermore, it is already talked about the possibility of building a third tube by the same recovery.
For Gazprom, the end at time of this huge work presents victories.
Poland and the Baltic countries have been strongly affected by the project.
In fact, the North Stream will allow Gas directly to Germany by avoiding the earthquake through third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
At the same time, these two countries are worried of their power: for them, it will be more difficult to influence Russia by bringing it to the access to the Western Europe markets.
At the equilibrished point of the debate, Varsovia did not doubt to compare the North Stream as a "new German-Sovian covenant", in relation to the partnership between Hitler and Stalin to occupied Poland in 1939.
I mean, if the subject is politically delicate.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has obtained a greater supply security.
But the price is a weakness of the energy Europe, since the project has produced a break between the Eastern and West Europeans.
Russia knew, in only five years, to triunfar their vision of direct partnership between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with more limited reservations.
"This gasoduct represents a component of our association with Russia, a new arteria that is one of us in organic ways," confirmed François Fillon during the inauguration of gas, demonstrating what point the large gas sector contracts are both political and economics.
All this explains the broad sounds in the faces of Gazprom directives, numerous in Lubmin, at the Gazprom Gazprom point.
The construction of this gas also proposes a technical achievement.
The submarine tube is manufactured by covered stage of cement to protect it against the ships.
The fund of the sea is supported at a average of 200 metres of deepity.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mine fields given from the Second World War.
"They should be necessary to resume or destroy a hundred of them, by precaution," says Jens Müller, port of the North Stream society.
Furthermore, it was necessary to extend fauna protection measures and flower.
The tube is a long metal serpent that weights like 242 Eiffel tours and is not interrupted throughout its length: nor by wavelenes, nor by maintenance stations.
It was planned for a control platform in the waters of Sweden, but the managers of the project refused to see that Swiss were not very ready to allow Russian State society to be established permanently in the sea against their costs.
"In case of warning, we'll interrupt the gas past at least one minute," says Jens Müller.
In the case of flight, the gas of the gas will therefore be freed to the atmosphere.
However, the constructors consider little likely that a flight is produced, since juridictions have been planned that, according to the previsions, will be a flight every 100,000 years.
The control of the state of the gas is guaranteed by a submarine robot moved by a ship, which makes external inspections, as well as by a device moved through the interior of the gas.
With the form of a clean, it is entered into the tube, which has a diameter of a meter, and moves with the gas.
At its arrival, after three full journeys of travel to a speed of three meters per second, provide specific data on possible metal information.
Gasoduct has been designed to function for 50 years without need of any rehabilitation.
The gas movement is simply guaranteed by pressure.
The principle is 200 bars and, at the exit of 100 bars.
Five enterprises have joined their forces to be able to carry out this project.
The leader company is Gazprom, which has 51% of the participation.
The Germans E.ON and BASF were joined (15.5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (9% each).
These five companies have created a common company called North Stream, responsible for build and expansion of the gas.
He has his seat in Zoug, Switzerland, where the opposition is particularly favourable.
Afterward, Gazprom accompanied that society, during a renewable twinty-year period, the total of gas transport capacity.
"A Gazprom will pay you for the total capacity, independently of the amount of gas that is really transported", specifics Jens Müller.
The funding of the construction of gas has resulted in a 30 per cent with the allocation of assets and 70 per cent by banking costs.
The total cost of the work should reach 7.400 million for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, investment has reached 240 million.
But minoritary attractors are sure that they will not overcome their investment, since Gazprom is only risk of expenditure.
The emergency gas of the Baltic in Lubmin, in a hot seasoned cost of pins.
A flat, with 4,5 meters of height, form the gas output door.
There are some sensors that mix pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of gas to arrival before the German gas is transferred.
Since the past march, the terminal receives a million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At total capacity, three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a brand book.
A half-eighth century for a Italian company, Moleskine wants to resume people the pleasure for writing.
He has a air of aventure, from hours of writing to the light of a vessel.
The Moleskine book is easily recognized, with its red black steps, their goma, its red white color sheets, as oldly.
However, Moleskin books with the current aspect were born... in 1997.
The Italian ModeMedit company, based on Milan, decided to launch a book of design notes on the market at that time, but differently.
Mary Sebregondi, for that company's adviser, was bound by the launching of the new product.
The library is inspired in an old production technique, the skin mole (tope pile), regarding a barnified cotton that was used, inter alia, to cover banks.
This type of book was very valued by the writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the current hot an old and forgotten object, a icon of the Vanguardist artists until the XX century," account Mary Sebregondi, which has been become responsible for the brand in ModeMM.
And it reached the success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent until reaching a volume of 12.7 million sold units.
Alongside the first years the confidential production has remained, only 3,000 frees have been designed.
Moleskine goes beyond Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notice cut takes both business men as well as students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, their users are cosmopolits, open and collapsed.
The small Italian company, containing twelve employees at its beginning, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He divides our carriers in liberty, from Fnak to the small trade in the center of the cities, and you have known to impose their identity.
"We adjusted the time and the need to write, despite the increase of e-mails," Mary Sebregondi explains.
This cultural signature goes out of the hand with Moleskin' development: recently, the mark has launched the exhibition "Detour" where Architects or artists exhibit their own kitchen.
In August, he also launched a kitchen with leopard Festival, because of the cine Festival of Locarno.
Provided your success and this will be cultural, Moleskine has known to diversifie its products: bouss, agendas, bullets, computer funds... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that causes envie: in October 2006, Modem was acquired by the SG Capital Europe's capital investment fund at the currentness of Syntegra Capital, written a new page in Moleskine history.
Why is the parish rate of disabilities that remained so high?
Alongside 19% of disabilities are looking for employment.
The XV Semana for the employment of disabilities starts today.
Despite a public policy applied since 2005, the unemployment rate of disabilities doubts the average rate: 19 per cent, compared to 9 per cent of the population.
Deshalatora?
"No", said Erric Blanchet, Director-General of Adap, the association organizing the week for the employment of disabilities.
"The progress achieved for fifteen years is significant.
"In that time, the unemployment rate was two times but three times higher than the average.
"But yet remains much to do."
The unemployed unemployed continues to face a number of obstacles to access to employment.
It is likely to have an increased age: 37% has more than 50 years (17% of average).
There is a little high quality level: 80% has not ended the bacteriat and, of 2.3 million students in high education, only 100,000 are disabilities.
Finally, the long duration park is very extended between them: 53% for disabilities, against 38% of average.
There are many issues that are particularly difficult to return to the work world and that "constitute the problem," Christian Grapin, Director-General of Tremplin, a partnership created in 1992 to help enterprises to contract with disabilities.
These are the objective obstacles.
Furthermore, there are those not mentioned; the mentality of people's progress, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprise Association noted that the directors encountered have “the level of knowledge of under-related disabilities” with a “excessive representation of people in road, physical or intellective screens”.
The result: the private enterprises with more than 20 employees are very far from the goal of contracting 6 per cent of unemployed workers, which has been established in a... 1987 law.
According to the latest available figures from 2008, 2.6 per cent are reached by 2.6 per cent.
"With now we reach at 3 per cent ", notes Peter Blanc, General Director of Agefif, the body responsible for maintaining the contributions of enterprises that do not respect this law.
The test: the number of "allowed to this import", as well as dismissed quantities, reduced between 2007 and 2011, passing from 59.000 to 46.000 structures (and 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased the contributions, has generated a great pressure for enterprises," Peter Blanc explains.
"But this improvement also reflects a true conscience, particularly among the large groups."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of the companies contained between 20 and 49 employees with disabilities in their plant, against 82 per cent of the companies between 100 and 199 employees.
"A joy"
On the point to face the Bleus on Tuesday (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure that this friendly game generates.
We will not attempt to say that conniveness was noted among them, but the image is symbolical.
Becoming one with another, at the stage of the audience of the City of France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard actually made peace.
Five months after the resolved manager of his front against Turkey, the Belgian elector has only election for him.
"I've been glad for Eden, for their progress and because it's a Belgium."
"I want to advance," said the front of Lille.
With regard to the contrast between its presentations in your team and in the selection, "It's a whole" has been justified.
"In Lille, I'm all the year, what does not apply to Belgium.
"I have to stand on me."
Invited to play against Rumania on Thursday by night, taking into account this game against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to, finally, "brill."
Don't forget us of the "placer".
It was encouraged Bleus from seven years, as well as during the victory campaigns 1998 and 2000.
"I always was your fan," he said.
Unfortunately, this will strengthen particularly the "particular" character of the meeting.
Specially because " a Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) will be faced ", remember.
"We've been ending for a little time.
"To play against them is always a joy."
With simpleness, Leekens has made reference to "orgal".
"Orgular" to discuss "a gala game".
"Orgular" also by comprombar, as "birth", which France "auts to be a very high-level team" nearly one year after Knysna traumatism.
"Laurent White has done a formidable work," said with enthusiasm.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the technical would be encouraging to share aircraft with the Blue to... Brazil, in 2014.
"Our small belgs are growing up," he said.
"We're building something; the players are ambitious, they're hungry.
"They can see it in the next parts," included the game against France.
Portugal shows great confidence
The Portuguese of Paul Bento is optimised with a great optimism to the backing game against Bosnia (22:00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the ida game, they lacked realistic to both teams.
"When these 90 minutes passe, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country."
Paulo Bento has already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt; the Selecayao, directed since September 2010, will be qualified for the Eurocopa in 2012.
In fact, only 90 minutes are separated to Portugal from happiness.
But there's a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, that's going out.
Taking into account the ida game (0-0), the Friday in Zenica's infection, it seems clear that the thing is not decided.
Portugal housed the game for more than one hour, yes, but he couldn't mark the valuable gol that would have given him quiet.
"It's a good result, but at the time she made a risk, because we didn't mark out of the house."
But at home, in the Light Stadium of the Lisboa, the portugues are convinced that, before a public that should be equal to enthusiasted, even if it appears that the game "es very equal," said a optimistic but played Bent.
"We hope that the game is very equal, but we are completely convinced that we can take the front," said the portuguous engineer of 42 years.
"We continue to have 50 per cent of the opportunities to participate in Eurocopa 2012", he has, however, concerning the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The beginning of Friday in Bosnia is obliging the portugues to mark and win.
To the boss, they could get an impressive, although they also need to mark.
"It's a good result, but at the time she made a risk, because we didn't mark out of the house," lament Bento.
"We're going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and has a large individual quality" he added.
Like in Zenica, the portugues will go with the intention to execute, since the beginning, a maximum pressure on the bosses to "not allow them time to think."
A good idea, always that, this time, it's realista.
