about how long are these symptoms?
and all pain in the cell should be treated in such a way, particularly in view of your age
and with high temperature
and needs also to check the level of your colesterine and arterial pressure
And now you have high temperature?
Do you now trial this pain in the cell's cell?
And, besides, it's difficult for you to do.
And can you tell me what other symptoms you have?
and how high it was your temperature.
And I have a kitchen.
And I have a little bathroom with a box.
And I have really a huge pain today in the cell's cell.
And whether this is the time of showing the burden that you have been assigned
and the pain is in the cell's cell.
And I think I've got a little temperature.
And I want you to describe what place you're trying to hurt.
and they also have a little increased temperature
And with your diabetes' story
And do you know, it's feeling like my herd would be disappeared?
And you know, people are constantly worried about me.
And you're trying to hurt in the cell's cell.
And you said it's the pressure in the cell's cell.
Any family has a problems with heart, heart time, microfriendry information, high level of colestery, high arterial pressure
Any other symptoms or problems noted to you and related to museum disease?
Do you have other homes with the same symptoms?
Have you any other symptoms?
Are you now trying to be paid?
Are you still sick in the cell's cell?
'Cause this is a playpa region
But we should not also stay without attention because the pain in the груд cell has a cardiological nature
However, now the more important problem is that pain in the cell's cell.
But I've got a hard disappoint.
But I know a lot of people hurt me.
But we have to be treated any pain in the груд cell with a maximum seriousness.
But you're right now, right?
Because I don't remember this pain in the cell's cell.
Does it look like somebody smoke your cell's cell?
You're still feeling tickets
Are they crazy in the presence of bad self - self - symptoms?
Do you have any other chronic diseases, such as high arterial pressure or something like that?
Do you have any other chronic disease or medical problems such as the diamond?
Are you trying to be paid at this pain in the brush cell?
Do you have high arterial pressure?
Do you have this tickets?
Do you know what she had?
Do you see this picture?
Sleeping a lot of juices today
But I'm going to get the tests on the diagnostic
But she had symptoms as I had.
How high do you have the temperature?
What arterial pressure do you have?
If you still have high temperature
if you have the temperature thirty-eight and nine or above
If you think your symptoms or problems are guaranteed to improve the external view
I got up to the temperature yesterday.
I've also got some temperature yesterday.
I had the temperature yesterday.
I'm testing here in the грудly cell's rare pain.
I've also got a little hard smoke.
I'll send you an image.
I'm testing some pain in the breast today.
I've got a little bit of his head today and I got the temperature up.
I think it's a game.
I think it's a game in a easy form.
Do you remember that as if a very hard man's sitting on your hair?
All this started almost one-time with the main pain and the temperature increased.
I'm trying to hurt in the middle of the breast.
It's gonna give the pain in the cell's cell.
That's in my neighborhood.
It's in the center of my cell's cell's cell's.
It's in the center of the cell's cell
I've got a pain in my breast.
I'm very concerned about this pain in the breast.
I want you to describe me this pain in the brain.
as high arterial pressure or diabetes
As exactly in the center of the cell cell
from high temperature you can now take thexipins in the form of lambs
And now, Mary, tell me, for a few days, these symptoms have been shown for you.
Now you said you're feeling pain in the brain
From time to time I feel a little pain in the breast
All right, if you've got some other symptoms in place of pain.
Or someone sits on your brain?
Exactly the same high temperature and heavy, main and museum pain
suffering directly in the middle of my breast
Show me the pictures where you feel pain.
Since you have high temperature
So you think some of these symptoms could be related to marriage?
So your kids have some of the same symptoms?
Tell me about your pain in the brush cell.
The temperature rises night
temperature that I had in the last two days
The temperature began up last night
This is Dr. Porter in the acceptable room of assistance
Okay, can you tell some details about your pain in your brain?
Well, I feel pain in the front of my body, here, in the brain.
Well, I feel a strong pain in the brain.
So when I feel pain in the herd
What kind of kids are you feeling in your breast?
When were you starting to feel this pain in your breast?
Where do you feel pain in your breast?
Where do you feel this pain in the breast
You're trying something like the feelings of yourself in your breast
You know, I've got a diabet, and all that's like that.
You said you tried this pain in the cell's cell.
Quick growing indicator of the cumulative carbon infection (COVID-19) in the European Union and Britain during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
CoVID-19 (COVID-19) has similar trends in Europe/European Economic Area and Britain, thus reaffirming that, despite the various stages of its development in different countries, the COVID-19 mastery grows in all countries.
In view of the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive therapy, it is necessary to increase the level of preparation to the impact of patients from COVID-19, which require treatment and, in particular, intensive therapy.
On 31 December 2019, a number of cases have been identified in the Single Ethology Province of Hubay.
On January 9, 2020, the China Centre for Control and Prevention reported that the Infection Reserve was a new form of coronavirus, currently known as a coronaurus of the hard island of the 2-year symptom syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
From this moment, the disease of SARS-CoV-2 was called coronvirus infection (COVID-19).
According to the present day, approximately 80 per cent of COVID-19 diseases are in easy form, i.e. in the form of discipline infections with the pitchery or without it, and most of those suffer.
Approximately 14 per cent of COVID-19 cases are developed in a harder form with the need for hospitalization, and the remaining 6 per cent is critical when intensive therapy is required.
The mortality level of patients hospitalized from COVID-19 is approximately 4 per cent.
In this study, the trends of COVID-19 cumulative disease in each Member State of the European Union (EC) / European Economic Area (EES) and Britain and are implemented with trends in the Chinese province of Huba.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 diseases in the EU/EEC and the United Kingdom with Italy data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 disease cases in the EU/EEC and the United Kingdom
After the income in China, COVID-19 was distributed to other countries, and it is currently developed in the rest of the world of the COVID-19 madam, as well as in China.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 master.
On 5 March 2020, Mr. Spetteri (Spiteri) and his colleagues reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 disease in Europe, which responded to the criteria that WHO defined diseases.
Three first confirmed connections in the EU/EEC were registered in France on 24 January 2020, all three sufferings returned from the Single Province of Hubby.
As at 15 March 2020, the cases of COVID-19 infringement were identified in all 30 EU/EEC countries and in Britain, with a period from 31 December 2019 until the date specified, 39 768 cases of infection and 1 727 deaths of 17 750 cases, including 1 441 with a death source, are set to only Italy.
Determination of cumulative quantity and COVID-19
The European Centre on Control and Prevention (ECDC) daily updates the number of COVID-19 cases in each country received from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of those countries, national and regional authorities of Health and WHO.
These data are used for the analysis of COVID-19 trends in EU/EEC and Britain and for comparison with the data in Italy.
As a level of dissemination of active cases, COVID-19 was calculated all cumulative diseases in COVID-19 for 14 days, taking into account the usual temperature of COVID-19 in each EU/EEC countries and Britain for the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented a cumulative number of cases identified in each country at 8:15 March 2020, compared with Italy's data for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 development trends in EU/EEC countries and British countries
The trends of development of COVID-19 cumulative disease for the 14-day period in the EU/EEC countries and Britain compliance with the trends observed in the Chinese province of Huba (ris.1).
The COVID-19 co-matural disease in the EU/EEC and Britain began to grow approximately 21 February, and the 28 February 2020 was a clear scene of this indicator (additional material).
This was mostly aggravated by the growth of the number of cases registered in Italy but also in all other EU/EEC countries and in Britain, the similar trends to the growth of COVID-19 civil disease (additional material).
Quality 2. The cumulative number of COVID-19 diseases in the EU/EEC countries and Britain, compared with the similar indicator for Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
According to this, the total number of cases, already registered at 8:15, in 15 March, of the EU/EEC countries and of the United Kingdom, are compared to the number of cases set out in Italy by about 3 weeks previously.
Our results show the rapid growth of COVID-19 registered cases in the EU/EEC and in the United Kingdom.
The tendencies of the cumulative disease of COVID-19 allows the mastership to develop with comparable speed in all countries.
In spite of different stages in different countries, the difference in reaction measures taken by national public health bodies and may be different criteria for recognition of cases of diseases and different rules of selection of patients in order to analyse COVID-19, including “related” testing.
At the beginning of March 2020, the doctors of Italy reported that approximately 10 per cent of COVID-19 patients were required to intensive therapy and that the hospitals and intensive therapy were already filled in these regions.
At the present time, COVID-19 in the hospital and (or) incentive therapy offices in the EU/EEC are only 6 per cent and 1 per cent of cases respectively (not presented).
However, the systemic collection of these information should be carried out to complement the current observations that are the number of cases registered and the number of deaths.
According to the results of the research conducted in 2010-2011, there is considerable disappearance in the coke offices of intensive therapy and intensive hospital care offices: from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 per cent of men in Portugal.
This means that other countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 kitchens in intensive therapy and intensive care offices for patients in 2010-2011).
The sixth updated report of the ECDC on the results of COVID-19 risk testing is presented in the scenario of the loading of health resources with an estimated COVID-19 hospitalization data in each EU/EEC countries and in Britain, when the risk of the lack of access to cokes in intensive therapy offices exceeds 90 per cent.
As at this time the cases are grouped by certain EU/EEC regions and Britain, and hospitals and intensive therapy offices usually serve the population of a certain territorial group, information on the incident and cokes in intensive therapy offices are recommended in order to provide the units of the Territory Nominature for Statistics (NUTS-2).
The investigation of Italy and the current trends in other countries shows that the EU/EEC/EEC and Britain Membership of COVID-19 is slightly developed.
The countries, hospitals and intensive therapy offices should therefore be ready to scenario the contacts of SARS-CoV-2 for a long-term delay and to increase the number of patients with COVID-19 needed medical assistance and, in particular, intensive therapy, which, for example, can be observed in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the last report of the ECDC on the results of risk testing, a great importance to maintain the distribution of SARS-COV-2 is an operational, preventive and integrated approach to the follow-up of the detention to the minimumization of the impact, since, taking into account the predictable growth of the diseases taken by decisions of persons and hospitals, there may be no enough time to consider, accept and correct their responsive measures if such measures are not taken.
The report on the results of the expressive risk assessments also included public health measures that have been called to reduce the impact of the pandemic.
The countries have only a small period of time during which they can intensify their control efforts in order to deploy SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the load on their health systems.
If not so, the nearest days or weeks of health system in other EU/EEC countries will be affected by patients that will need intensive therapy.
The infection of coronavirus infection 2019 (COVID-19), named by the severe reproaching island (SARS) of the 2-type (SARS-CoV-2), became a tragedy for humanity: at the present time in China and other countries of the world have been completed over 30,000, and the number of infected over 80 000.
As a geologic virus of SARS-CoV, which was designed by the development of a hard island recruiting syndrome in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 may also be transferred from the railing mouses and caused eastern symptoms using similar mechanisms.
However, COVID-19 is the less severity of disease and lower mortality than SARS, but it is much more low and affects older people than young people and men more frequently than women.
In response to the widespread growth of the number of new diseases in this article, an active and comprehensive review of the rapidly developed research object is proposed.
We will consider the basic aspects of epidemiology, ethnology, virus, diagnosis, treatment, prevention and prevention of this disease.
Although the answers to many questions would only be found, we hope that this review will help understand and eliminate dangerous diseases.
The wedding feast (New Year), which was issued by 25 January 2020, became an unprecedented and unprecedented event for all Chineses, with regard to the success of the new virus infection, urged to stay home for the whole party and for many weeks after it.
In 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) was the 11 February 2020 virus of SARS-CoV-2 as a result of the hard reproaching island symptom (SARS) in 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the co-virus infection of the 19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in the Chinese city of Oak, and quickly spread throughout the country, and then nearly 50 other countries in the world.
According to 2 March 2020, more than 80,000 recognized cases of COVID-19 have been healed, more than 40,000 patients have ended with more than 3,000 patients.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the “born number one for society” and it is potentially more often than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.gov/pubmed/), less than two months of COVID-19, including articles on its virus, epideology, these diagnostics, diagnosis and treatment, starting from the first report of 7 January 2020, which defined the follow-up of the virus selected from the whole number of patients.
This review is an attempt to facilitate the results of research in the new and fast development of the subject.
As a possibility, we are trying to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other disease coronavirus — a coronaurus of the Middle East Syndrome (MERS), which has occurred in 2012.
We will also discuss the data known on the moment of the prevention and prevention of disease and some others not less educational issues.
The coroniums were traditionally related to the number of patents that are not mortally dangerous for humans and mainly approximately 15 per cent of general recruiting diseases.
Nevertheless, in this century, we were two-folded with high-patogenous human coronars, the coronium of the hard island symptom (SARS-CoV-2) and the Coronavirus of the neighbouring East Representative Syndrome (MERS-CoV), which have resulted in the improving diseases in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, soon and soon spread to many other States with the terrible difficulty of disease and mortality.
The current COVID-19 is therefore the third consequence of the coronium infection in the history of humanity.
As indicated by Ris 1.1, the report of the classics of the unrecognised origin had been made first in the National Committee on Health of the CPs, from Hungary 31 December 2019.
Following seven days, the genetic follow-up of virus was issued.
On 15 January 2020, the first death case was registered in Mr. Huhan.
At the same time, the epidemic was rapidly expanded into the neighbouring city, province and country.
The 20 January was known about the institution of the doctors, which allowed the possibility of transmission of virus from humans.
On 23 January, Cortanian was introduced and stopped the work of the city public transport.
On 24 January, the first clinical study of this disease was noted that in 21 of 41 patients with confirmed coroviral infection direct contacts with the marine producer market in the Oak, which was considered a direct point of dissemination of infection from unrecognised animals.
30 January, the WHO declared that the injury of corovirus was a global emergency of public health.
At the time of the preparation of this report, the disease was spread throughout China and has already been about 50 other countries around the world (ris.2).
In view of the efforts to develop the situation, the final scope and the risk of success is still needed to be determined.
11 February 2020 on the results of the multicentric clinical study, which had participated in 8,66 patients, including 4 021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, was submitted to the following updated image of the epidemic development (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_HPXa1qHA2bhdA).
The Institution of SARS-CoV-2 was undertaken by all age groups, but mainly suffering people from 30 to 65 years.
Since half (47.7 per cent) were more than 50 years old, most than 20 years, and only 14 invalidizeds have not yet been filled 10 years.
SARS-CoV-2 among men above (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was principally distributed by classs in the province of Hubay and nearby regions.
The average time since the COVID-19 symptoms had occurred before the diagnosis was 5 (2-9) days.
The interim period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) of the period.
Since the symptoms had been shown in the middle of the death, 9.5 (4.8-13) of the day.
The basic reproduction indicator (R0) was 3,77% (95% CI: 3,51-4.05), and the corrected R0 was 2.23-4.82.
On 23 January 2020, there was an expensive growth of the number of in-developed transports of the Chinese new year.
The mortality of patients with confirmed diagnosis was 1,44% (95% CI: 1,10-1,86%), and the corrected mortality rate between patients was 3,06% (95% CI: 2,02-4.59%).
Three major risk factors in the case of COVID-19 damage were: pul (Mign), age (≥60) and hard accidents.
Coronavirus represents the subsistence of the large-scale viruss containing one of the meanings of the CNC.
They can be divided at four views, i.e. alpha, beta, gamma and alpha, of which alpha and betacoronavires are worried by people.
In the case of the fraud of the SARS type and MERS low-coprotein of disappearances (S), the cell receptors of angiotensian preventing farmer (ACE2) and the diplomaticism-4 (DPP4) are consistently related to the mime-production synthesis.
The cytotolam is freed by the genius of virus RNC; after the repair of the virus genome RNC, together with the low-proteins and proteins of the necleopapsis, the virus of the helicopters that then lie with the mimbrary cell, the liberty of virus.
The first reports on the generic follow-up of SARS-CoV-2 appeared on 10 January 2020.
It is stated that SARS-CoV-2 represents a new type of betacorrorism, with 99.98% with 10 follow-up species collected in the first time of disease in the Hahanan Sea market.
Genetically SARS-CoV-2 closer to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
In the assistance of the SARS-CoV-2 electronic microscope, parts of the SARS-CoV-2 were discovered in the globe of the human-disciplinary episode.
The human farmer ACE2 was a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as for SARS-CoV.
However, S-protein SARS-CoV-2 relates to ACE2 farmer than in the case of SARS-CoV, which explains the fact that SARS-CoV-2 is less severely severely than SARS-CoV patients.
SARS-CoV-2 may also generate an unrecognised short-wide white, encoded orf3b, and a secreted white, encoded orf8.
The white orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 can play some role in the view of the virus and add IFN月 expression; but orf8 does not contain any known location or model.
On 18 February 2020, the authors collected Chapter with Chew (Zhou) reports on the crioe-tecnology structure of the ACE2 human farmer, with a resolution 2.9 in the integration of the B0AT1 transporter.
They discovered that the open and closed information was collected as a diamond and that the ACE2-B0AT1 component could bind two S-protein, which served evidence in the recognition of coronium and infinancement of them.
B0AT1 may be therapeutical mechanism when he conducted a medical scene for the damage of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Prostitution and interim duties
It is known that the source and SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were flowing mouses from which the virus was transferred to a person through cibates and rooms accordingly.
In the middle of the philosogenic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus was determined that the first farmers of SARS-CoV-2 are flighting mouse, since the new virus at 96% identified both similar to the SARS coronavirus, namely the coroniums of the SL-CoVZX45 and SL-CoVZX21.
However, it remains unrecognized what kind of being an intermediate man, thanks to the virus that has been able to overcome a species of barrier and plane a person; the path of transfer also needs to be explained.
Mr. Tsi (Ji) with colleagues suggested that the translators of virus from the mouse to the human were dreams, in the process of which the geological recombination had occurred in S-Protein.
Following their research, Chinese scientists from Guancheo suggested that the pangolenes are long-term molecules that were used by museums and often used in the traditional Chinese medicine, are potential foreign farmers of SARS-CoV-2; this proposal is based on 99-procent to the Genetic Commonwealth between the Panolonic Coronavir and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the difference of 1 per cent among both genomen is very large, therefore, that final results with specific evidence are not yet received (ris. 33).
The physical and chemical properties SARS-CoV-2 are still not known mostly.
In the laboratory of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 48 hours in the middle and 5 days in the temperature below 20 °C and 40–50% of the property.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
It is known that SARS-CoV-2 is sensitive to the altraphiolet and aggression to 56 °C for 30 minutes; effective exploring virus activity may be epharr, 75 percent cell petrols, chlororsis defined vehicles, perxic oxygen, chlorofors and other live-related factors but not chlorrogxid.
The human population in general does not have an immunity to SARS-CoV-2, so people are accompanied to a new virus.
There is no data on the detailed investigations of immun reaction on SARS-CoV-2.
So we can only refer to the early study of other cornevirus, first part of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (ris. 4).
It is usually recognized that the immunization system is recognized by image receptors (ORR), including C-Tip electrical, Toll-подобers, NOD receptors and RIG-I similar receptors.
In the middle of the various virus mechanisms, the exposition of repatriation factors, the establishment of deversional clips and the interferon synthesis of type I, which maintain the spread of virus and accelerate macrophages for virus anti-virus.
However, thanks to N-Back SARS-CoV can avoid immune reaction.
Soon in the fight against the virus, an adaptive immune reaction is included.
T-mithrocytes, including T-CD4+ and CD8+, play an important role in the protection of organism.
T-clocks CD4+ stimulate the generation of virus anti-secticians in B cells and the T-chills of CD8+ are immediately killed by huge cells.
T-helpers produce opposite cycles helping protection cells.
However, corovirus can inherit T-Click functions by encounter their programmed loss.
Guamoral immunity, including components such as C3a and C5a, and anti-intelle also plays an important role in combating virus infection.
For example, the anti-persons selected from the healthy patient were neutralized by MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, the hyperactivation of the immun system is the local education of a large number of free radikals, which may be a serious damage of light and other bodies, and in the ancient scenario to polyorganic unability and even death.
The infection of SARS-CoV-2 for which classified demonstration is more likely to be affected by older people with containing pathology and female women.
The possibility of invalidation above for people affecting a large number of viruses or have violations of an immun system.
The results of the study of the first 425 cases of infringement in M. Huhan, the average injury period of SARS-CoV-2, consists of 1 to 14 days, mainly 3 to 7 days.
However, the study of 1 099 cases showed that the interim period was 3 days, and that the extension was from 0 to 24 days.
The later described study based on the demography of 8,866 cases showed that the innewalation period was 4.8 (3.0-7.2) of the day.
The health body is very important to correct the time of the cortaninary measures entered, taking into account the most precise calculations of the long-term period, which allows to prevent the spread of the virus of the topics infected, which is insufficient.
The general practice became a 14-day cortanine for persons having contact with virus or virus.
Are you supposed to extend the cartanine time until 24 days?
The main and primary symptom COVID-19 is often a high temperature that may be the only demonstration of other symptoms, such as smoke chashe, smoothed disappearance, museum pain, head-up, head-flowing, pain, weapon, weapon, breasts, diamonds, thick and breasts.
Some patients a week after the start of disease noticed the deployment and (or) hypoxis.
In hard cases, diseases have been rapidly progressed, and patients have developed the harassment of representative disease, septic shock, metabolic acids and coalogopathy.
The patients with high temperature and (or) recruitment symptoms and heavy hate symptoms should be checked on virus for the previous order of diagnosis, even when there is no patchology on the scenes of the cell.
The Demographic Research held at the end of December 2019 discovered the following indicators of the distribution of symptoms: 98 per cent of high temperature, 76 per cent of smoke, 55 per cent, and 3 per cent of the diare; 8 per cent of patients had the artistic ventilation of lights.
Similar results were received in two recent studies of crimes in the family and the transfer of virus from unsymptomized insufficients.
Compare results were received in 2012 when patients studied with MERS-CoV, the main symptoms were also high (98 per cent), sweet heat (47 per cent).
However, 80 per cent of them were required to produce a slight ventilation, this indicator is much higher than the COVID-19 patients, and it is higher than MERS than COVID-19.
MERS patients also observed the diagram (26 per cent) and the disease in the garden (21 per cent).
The main symptoms of SARS patients are high temperature (99-100 per cent), sweet heat (29-75 per cent), the diameter (40-42 per cent), the diagramy (20-25 per cent and heat (13–25 per cent) and the artificial ventilation of the patients is 14 to 20 per cent.
At 14 February, COVID-19 death was 2 per cent, and the total number of recognized cases in the world reached 66.576.
Compared with this indicator of mortality from SARS to November 2002 was 10 per cent of 8 096 confirmed cases.
In the case of MERS demographic research conducted in June 2012, 37% of 2 494 confirmed cases showed death.
As a result of the previous study, the basis indicator of reproduction (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 was determined at 6.47% to 95% reliable interval (CI) within the limits 5,71–7,23, while R0 for SARS-CoV was only 2 to 4.
The comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV to demonstrate symptoms, mortality levels and R0 are set out in Table 1.1.
The above indicators show the higher ability of SARS-CoV-2 to disseminate comparison with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the level of mortality in the case of institutioning a new virus below compared to two latests.
So maintaining SARS-CoV-2 epidemic will be much more difficult than MERS-CoV epidemics and SARS-CoV.
The classified demonstration is often placed in a family or group of people gathered together for any reason or assembled to any transport, such as the road layder.
The patients often traveled to Mr. Huhah or other suffering regions, or have been contacted with infected or less than two weeks before the start of disease.
However, as reported in the reports, people may be virus cards without any symptoms for more than two weeks, and the patients issued from the hospital can be re-extrained by virus cartonists, and it is an inquiry signal for the long period of cartanine.
At the early stage in patients, a normal or degraded number of lecocytes (a particularly limphocytes) in the Perifer blood.
For example, 1 099 patients from COVID-19 have been fixed the limphose level of lecocytes 4×109/L, including leocosit levels 1×109/L, as well as an increased speed of minerals and virus.
Some patients were discovered higher levels of printing, muscle farmers and microbide, and most patients observed the highest levels of C-reactive white and the blood eradication.
In patients during the hard disease of D-Dimerge, the product of the fibrion presented in blood was increased, and the number of limbocytes has constantly increased.
The majority of patients from COVID-19 was discovered in the recentgenic cell’s cell’s rectangular study, which characterizes unrealised ambitions with both sides or an estimated “matematic steel” in lights.
Patients often have developmentd the ethical breastfeeding, the harassment of light-representative diseases (ORS).
During the development of the ORS, uncontrolled restraint, copying of iron and progressing philosophys have resulted in substantial damage of gasflows.
The disclosure of types I and II disagrees the level of super-active connections and increases the surface density, thus reduced the capacity of easy to increase and increase the risk of the heirs of easy.
Thus the worst results of rectangenic research are often compared with the most difficult cases of disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the removal of pneumatics, the formulation of hylenic memblons and inter-level literature infringement, and the multi-aged synthetic cells in the light patients died from diseases correspond to the pathology of virus infection and ORZ and similarly found in patients with SARS and MERS.
As the main criteria in the diagnosis of COVID-19, RNC SARS-CoV-2 was used through a polymic trap reaction with a back transCryptous (PPC with a re-transferation).
However, taking into account the high level of falsely territory results that could accelerate the ends of the epidemic development, since 13 February 2020, China began to make a diagnosis based on clinical demonstrations (the lower confidence of the PDP with the back transparent).
It was analogic situation with the SARS diagnosis.
This is therefore important for the effective diagnosis of critically and needs to combine the data of the history of diseases, clinical demonstrations, laboratory tests and results of rectangenic research.
On 14 February 2020, the SHERLOCK Group of Specialists under the management of Mr. Fan China (Feng Zhang) described the Protocol for the application of the SHERLOCK methods based on the repeat of CRISPR, to discover SARS-CoV-2; this method allows the synthetic flows of RNC SARS-CoV-2 to 20 × 10-18 m/l to 200 × 10-18 ml/l (10-100 copys on the outstanding mixture of the mixture) with the assistance of the individual pipelines less than for the timeless use of the equipment.
This new method, if it is successfully checking clinical treatments, may significantly improve the sense of tests and use of them.
Since the absence of experience of anti-recognized anti-recornium, medicines can principally provide patients with COVID-19 supporting therapy only by seeking to apply any terrorist methods that were used or proposed when treatment of other coroniums, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as other virus diseases (Tablitics 2).
These therapy methods include current or potential use of anti-virus treatments, immunity doctors, steroids, plasmas of healthy patients, traditional Chinese medicines and psychological support.
It was proposed to use even the plasma of healthy patients.
The factory companys are striving to develop anti-intollars and vaccines to combat virus.
During the initial phases of SARS-CoV-2, the main light and may at least affect other organs expressing ACE2, such as the ill-known and pockets.
Nevertheless, the violation of work and the refusal of drug organs is the main threat and cause of death of patients.
Therefore, to facilitate the symptoms and salvation of living critically important, the support of the discipline, including the general oxygen therapy, with a high concentration of hydrocarbon, non-invasitive intensity and invitable mechanical enthusiasm of easy ones that are defined depending on the gravity of disease.
The patients with severe representative symptoms needed support in the form of extreme memogenic oxygenation (ECOMO), the modified methodology of extrapollumon blooding which is used for the treatment of a threat to life of heart or disability.
Furthermore, the important importance of patients with SARS-CoV-2 is maintaining water-substantive balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septical show, and the protection of the functions of livingly important bodies.
It is aware that the cytoin burm is the result of the immune hyperactivation of the patients infected by SARS and MERS.
The cytokn corner is the form of a system-play process, which is developed in response to the settlement of the series of cytoks, including TNF eius, IL-1月, IL-2, IL-6, IFN月, IFN月, IFNgam and MCP-1.
These cycles promote immunities to emission a huge number of free radikals that become the main reason for development of the ORS and the polyorgane inadequacy.
In the treatment of the cytoin corm, particularly in patients in a hard state, the most important decline of immunity.
The corticosteroids and tunismabs were used for the treatment of the cytoton corners used as an interlakin-6 inhibiter.
In the number of other methods of cytonyne sanitation treatment based on immunity, it includes an immunity reaction designed on the T-Click control; the blocking of the IFN Em, IL-1 and TNF; the delivery of Ignos-kinas; the bulnotomab, the conpressory of citain signals 4 and the synthesis inhibitors.
In order to reduce the gravity of the confusion of processes in the treatment of SARS viruses, steroids are widely applied as immunity doctors.
Nevertheless, steroids in large drugs have not benefited in the treatment of severe light damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
On the contrary, they can cause serious damage effects, particularly abusal oxygenecros that have significantly disappeared prognosis.
However, short corticosteroid rates in small and medium-sized rates are recommended to apply carefully when patients were treated with COVID-19 in critical state.
The document has not been revealed at the time of the preparation of the document.
However, the internal introduction of radebiaire, mileotic analogus, was effectively treated by the American patient from COVID-19.
Remindevier is recently developed by an anti-virus preventor, initially developed by the Gilead company for the treatment of diseases called by Ebola and Marbourg virus.
Later, he also demonstrated the possibility of decrease of other virus from the unique RNC, including MERS and SARS viruss.
In view of these data, the Gilead company has provided a medical composition to China in order to conduct paid studies in patients in the SARS-CoV-2, and the results of these research are expected.
Furthermore, as possible options of patients with neighbouring repressive symptoms, baricinib, interferon, lopinavior/ritonauir and fisheries were proposed.
The combinated treatment of lapinavir/trionavira may be accompanied by diarees, toxics, rhototes, frauds and other malicious actions.
It should be carefully addressed to the interaction of these patients with other medicines designed to patients.
Plasma of healthy patients and anti-intellect
The ceiling of blood in patients affected from current disease is already used to treat other patients suffering from the same disease or to protect health population for long time.
In fact, the blood of healed patients often contains relatively a high number of anti-intyles to combat the patent.
The antiquilla is in the immunologines developed by B-mithomhocytes to combat pattogenics and other other objects; they recognize individual patent molecules and addressed to neutralize them.
Based on this proposal, a plasma was issued from the blood of patients affected by COVID-19, which then brought 10 patients to hardly patients.
Over 24 hours, their symptomics improved, reduced the repatriation and virus loading and increased the oxygen blood.
However, in order to propose mass to apply this method to the processing of special therapy, it is required until the verification is carried out and not made clearly.
Furthermore, taking into account the therapeutical effects, some of the lacks related to plasma.
For example, anti-intellects can extremely stimulate the immune system and call the syndrome of the cyclic emission syndrome, which, taking into account the toxicity, represents a potential threat for life.
The concentration of anti-intillars is usually not high, and the plasma for the treatment of patients in the critical state is required.
It is not easy to develop and make special anti-persons so fast enough to fight global episode.
Thus, the most important and practical choice of the B-Calents and the genetic code of active anti-persons or to find effective anti-persons against critically important virus blanks.
So we can go to the mass production of anti-alle.
Chinas used traditional medicines to treat different diseases.
However, its efficiency depends on the combination of the multiple components of the formula, which is different depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the Chinese traditional medicines.
Most effective components are still unrecognised or have an undetermined action, since the selection and verification of these components or the optimistic combination of these components are difficult.
The Chinese traditional medicinal medicine has now become one of the main alternative methods of treatment of patients with a easy and average severity of symptoms or patients affected after hard disease.
For example, Captain Shaw Fen Cez Dw (Shu Feng Jie Du) and Captains of Lan Hoa Cin Vene (Lian Hua Qing Wen) were recognized effectively during the COVID-19 treatment.
The largest percentage of health patients from COVID-19 was noted in several provinces of China, where Chinese traditional medicine was applied in treatment of 87 per cent of patients, including Sinus (63.7 per cent), Nice (50 per cent) and Hungary (50 per cent), while in the province of Hubay, where the Chinese traditional medicine was only 30 per cent of patients from COVID-19, was low to healthy (13 per cent).
However, it is sufficiently rare comparison, since the assessment should be conducted in view of the majority of other impact factors, such as the number of patients and the gravity of their diseases.
On 18 February 2020, Mr. Boli Chian (Boli Zhang) and its colleagues published the materials of research, which were conducted exclusively on the methods of the Western Medicinal and combined treatment on Western Medicinal and Chinese traditional medical methods.
They discovered that the standardization of body temperatures, symptoms and medical assistance in the statistics was less than the patients for which combination of western and Chinese traditional methods had been applied than patients that were only treated by western methods.
The most surprised is the fact that the percentage of patients began to disappear symptomic (for easy condition to hard), was noted below in the group that was treated by the comparison of the Western and China traditional methods than in the group that had only been treated in Western methods (7.4 per cent compared to 46.2 per cent), and the first level of mortality in the first group was lower than the second (8.8 per cent of compared to 39 per cent).
However, the effectiveness and security of the Chinese traditional medicine still requires more close control of research carried out in more screen and more regions.
The assigned interest also provides the possibility of description of the action mechanism and clarification of the aspects of the effectiveness of the components used in the Chinese traditional medicine methods or their compliance.
The patients who understood or confirm COVID-19 have principally tried of a strong fear of the abrassed and even death disease, and the persons covered by the cartanine are also tested to shock, singleness and extreme anger.
Furthermore, infection symptoms such as heat, hypsyxic and cashille, as well as huge treatment actions, such as corticosteroids, may cause further concern and psychological stress.
In previous stages, the disease resulted by the SARS virus was reported on a number of psychiatric diseases, including chronic depression, increased concern, patent attacks, psychotroming, psychography symptoms, oral and even society behaviour.
The obligatory deterioration of contacts and cortanines in the number of measures undertaken by health bodies to maintain COVID-19 epidemics can strengthen people with concern and feelings of infection, karnitical and social climate on their families and friends.
Consequently, psychological and psychological assistance should be provided to patients with COVID-19, subject to suspect and contact with them, as well as all the rest of the persons that it is required.
Psychological support should be formed multiprofesive psychiatric assistance brigades, provide clear information with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans and use professional electronic devices and applications to avoid close personal contact.
Effective vaccines play an important role to interrupt the chain of infection from animals and infected persons to hosted farmers and often apply to the anti-virus therapy used to maintain epidemics issued by new viruses.
S-protein-based work was conducted for the development of long-level and high-activised neutrals and (or) protected immunity for SARS-CoV.
In studies on animals, vital vaccines were developed from the SARS viruses.
However, before the start of clinical studies, the effectiveness of these possible vaccines in natural circumstances is needed to be determined in the age of patients, the model of the infection of mortal damage and the protection of local viruses.
Maybe the reason that the SARS virus has disappeared 17 years ago and has not been reported to any new case.
At the same time, convictional cases and classs of disease called by the MERS virus in the Middle East and distributed in other regions through the conservation of zone sources in the Endemic Airports.
To combat MERS, the vaccination strategy was developed with the use of an innovated virus, DNA-plasmide, virus vectors, newspapers, similar parts and elements of recycling balls, and some of these strategies have been evaluated on animals.
The development of secure and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for immunity persons is an urgent and critical challenge that requires the decision to maintain the crucial episode.
However, there are serious difficulties of the long period (in average 18 months) required for the development of the vaccine and the dynamic diagnosis of corovirus.
As an unrecognised disease previously, COVID-19 is only starting to show a full picture of clinical temperature by thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients will be able to be permanently healed without a complex.
However, COVID-19, similar SARS and MERS, also related to highly complex and high mortality among patients with severe disease.
Consequently, health bodies are critically important to determine priorities, particularly in areas where resources have been noted.
Based on the clinical studies presented at the present time, the following factors may affect the prevention of diseases in patients with COVID-19 or be related to them (Tablel 33):
A age: A age was the most important factor in the prevention of the disease of the SARS virus, which also corresponds to the truth in the case of COVID-19.
COVID-19 is mainly affected patients from 30 to 65 years, 47.7 per cent of which more than 50 years, according to the above study 8,866 cases.
In patients requiring intensive therapy, there was more reliable that there were source diseases and complications, and they were significantly larger than those patients in which such therapy had not been required (in average 66 years against 51), which shows that age is a pregnancy factor for patients with COVID-19.
Pol: SARS-CoV-2 among men above than women (0.31/100 000 against 0.27/100 000), as mentioned above.
The disease and complication: the patients with COVID-19 needed intensive therapy, above the probability of the development of a rare micro-reduction and aritmy.
The cardiological views were also the main reason for the death of patients with SARS.
It was reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also be linked to ACE2-Plaint Holangicities, which could cause the violation of the pressure work in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and original diseases are closely linked and can find results.
The rejection identified in laboratory studies: the S-reactive ball level reflects the gravity of the reflexion process or the damage of the tyres and is proposed to consider as a potential prognostic factor of disease, therapy reaction and final health.
It was also proposed to take into account the relationship between the S-reactive ball, the severity of disease and the prevention of COVID-19.
Furthermore, the increased level of glutatdydrogenaz, apargain-mininatraspherasis, alanine-minotraspharsas and cyanasis may also provide results.
These farmers are divided by different organs, especially by heart and cup, and their emissions happens when wearing the ticket.
Therefore, they are traditionally markers of heart or painting disfusion.
The main clinical symptoms: to predict results and complications when treatment of COVID-19, other factors should be taken into account the data of the recentgenic cell study and the development of clinical symptoms during the time.
The use of steroids: as described above, the steroids are immunity students widely used in infection diseases as an additional therapy to reduce the density of the relief process.
Since patients with hard forms of SARS had widely used corticosteroids, many of the survivors have increased an abishopal oceanrous, caused a perceived disabilities and low quality of life.
Thus, in the case of the use of steroids for the treatment of patients from COVID-19, these parameters should be appointed in small dozens and short courses.
Psychological stress: as described above, many patients suffer from an unprecedented force, since they are often to keep the long periods of cartanina, to be high-determined and to observe the death of their parents and other patients.
To disappear the stress of such patients and help them to return to normal life, they should need to be conducted with psychological consultations and long-term support.
According to demographic studies, COVID-19 epidemics are seemingly different from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to repairs in the lower paths, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as well as other coroniums that cause normal educational diseases may be successfully multiplied in the high-disciplinary paths and that there are weak symptoms or that there are no symptoms at the early stage of infection.
For this reason, the patients in which the early stage of disease or not yet end the innewalation period may lead to their usual lives to spread virus into significant levels that are essentially difficult for epidemological control.
However, the transmission of the SARS-CoV virus was made when patients were seriously sick, while most of the cases had not occurred at the previous stage.
Therefore, the COVID-19 epidemic is more serious than SARS epidemic and it is more difficult to control it.
It is currently a great work in China, which has announced global cartanine in the Huhah and neighbouring cities, and has been extended by the cortany regime for the whole population to stop the end of the proliferation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Although these measures have a huge damage to the economy and other fields of life of the country, the number of new patients has been reduced, the number of epidemics has been reduced.
By the optimistic accounts, the disease influence ends until March, and the heating phase is extended 3 to 4 months.
However, some experts are not so optimistic.
Mr. Paul Hater (Paul Hunter) and colleagues emphasized that the COVID-19 summit, which looks much more current than SARS is not completed in 2020.
Researchers from the group undertaken by Ira Lungini (Ira Longini) were designed to pronounce the end of the episode and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could affect two thirds of the world.
The group of Canadian Specialists reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was discovered in narrows and warmings of patients who were healthy and recorded from the hospital two weeks previously showed that the new virus could be a cyclical disease.
However, the reduction of the new cases in China has discovered that the strategy might have been evolved.
According to the initial prognosis, the missile of patients had to be attacked by millions of people and to be a cause for the loss of half million.
However, by severe cortanine and isolation of sickness at the end, it has been possible to control.
There is a probability that, like the SARS-CoV virus, the power of the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be degraded, and in time he will disappear or be converted to less patent virus related to a person.
The COVID-19 epidemics of SARS and MERS are below. (Ris. 55).
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is a high speed of transmission through chale or work, and may also be directly connected to the materials threatened by virus.
The virus was also discovered in the coal, which means that it can also be transfered oral and effectively.
According to one of the last studies, 41 per cent of the 138 studies may have resulted in the hospital, including 17 patients with other previously identified diseases and 40 medical persons.
Therefore, serious precautions should be taken to protect the population, particularly health workers, social workers, their parents, colleagues and even multilateral, contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defence in the fight against the reduction of the risk of the infection is the provision of the person; and the chirurgic mass and the N95 class repressors (series No. 1860s) helps control the spread of virus.
The chirurgic masks are not given to microscopics from potentially infected flight to the air and settle on the surfaces where they can be transferred to the environment.
However, only the N95 class (series No. 1860s) may protect from 10 to 80 mm size, only 5% of the vehicles; SARS-CoV-2 savings like SARS-CoV, and they both are approximately 85 mm.
Since the parties can even perceive five chirurgic mass, together, medical workers, directly connecting with patients, should be paid to the N95 massacres (series No. 1860s), not to the chirurgic masses.
In addition to the mass, medical workers should bear a protective card to reduce the possibility of contact with viruses.
Virus can also fall into the body through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor had deployed SARS-CoV-2, although he had sent the N95 mask; perhaps the virus fell into his body through the shining eyes.
Accordingly, medical workers should also be covered by transparent persons or protected eyes of closed type.
The whole population in the suffering or potentially affected threats of regions is urged more widespread to the desinting hands of missiles, to try not to go out of the house by respecting self-isolation, and to limit contacts with potentially informed people.
The acceptable distance to the patient is considered a distance of approximately a metre.
These measures reduce effective risks of infection and prevent virus distribution.
Despite the note of the humanity ' s virus SARS-CoV-2 previously recognized, the high-speaking of SARS-CoV, reported on 7 January 2020, had to be a threatened signal for China, taking into account the experience provided to them during the 2003 impact of SARS.
However, only after 19 January 2020, the Director of the Centre for Mediterranean Monitoring at Mr. Oakhaw reported that a new virus had low constraint and limited reproductiveness when transferring from humans to humans and that the prevention of dissemination and control of diseases would not be a problem.
This statement was significantly reduced social tendencies, particularly during the period that the whole country was prepared for the celebration of the New Year of China, and was delayed critically when sickness could be removed within the limits of the wages with minimum losses.
China's health organizations can make this serious lessons and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, health entities should be made: (1) more careful public statements, as each word is regarded by citizens and decisions; (2) more attentively addressing and reacting the unnecessary information from the clinic, and not to attend official reports from doctors and workers; (3) to take more decisive measures to maintain the potential episode at the early phases of its development, and not to enhance publicity; and (4) to continue to carry out official and effective studies to improve the expertise of the population of epidemic diseases and regular verification and the improvement of society reaction.
The COVID-19 recorded earlier unforeseen coronium of the hard island of the second type (SARS-CoV-2) syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) began at the end of December 2019.
For more than two months, the disease was covered by the whole China, and at the time of the preparation of this document, it has been distributed in 50 countries of the world.
Since virus is very similar to the hard-response symptom (SARS-CoV) and COVID-19 symptoms of the similar symptoms of the hard island of the symptoms of the SARS (SARS), when the COVID-19 records occurred.
However, some significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS are significant in terms of the epidemic and treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more aged than young people and men more than women; the percentage of severe cases and mortality among older people also above among young people.
Mortalities in result of SARS above in cases of COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients have even disappeared virus when the illness of sickness is inseparable, while the SARS patients usually affect the environment only in hard cases of disease, so keeping COVID-19 more harder than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is far faster and larger than SARS-CoV.
Some patients from COVID-19 may have negative standard tests for RNC SARS-CoV-2 available.
On the other hand, the affected patients may reveal positive virus tests.
This has significantly increased the risk of virus dissemination.
The COVID-19-development has remained some of the most important issues, namely:
What's the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus?
Despite the discovery of the 96-procent geology between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like coroneviros of the mouse, we can still not say that the SARS-CoV-2 Institution has occurred from the flighting mouse.
What animal was the interim species transmitted from the original household, for example from the flowers of the mouse, to the man?
Not to the answers to the first and second questions, we can't hopely stop the path of transfer, and the epidemological situation can be removed at any moment.
The moleculation and biochemic tests showed that SARS-CoV-2 was linked to ACE2, but how is the virus being implemented in the discipline cells and the follow-up pathological changes?
Are the virus also related to the produced ACE2 cells in other bodies?
With no clear answer to these questions, we can't ensure the rapid and accurate settlement of diagnosis and effective treatment.
How much will the epidemic be extended?
How is a virus of genetic evolution in the process of transmission from humans to humans?
Does it become a cause for the world, will he also disappear like SARS, or will he periodically recycling such a playup?
These aspects have the primary importance, but for the search for reply to these and to many other questions, it will need time.
However, we have no other choice, except what it should be to stop epidemic as soon as possible and to return to normal life.
The Soviet origin of human corne viruses
Mutuation and adaptation have promoted the coevolution of cornevirus (CoV) and their portfolios, including people for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human coroniums (HCoV) were aware of easy disease, such as normal study.
The consequences of the hard island reproaching syndrome (SARS) and the neighborhood of the Middle East Syndrome (MERS) have changed our presentation of how catastrophic and dangerous the life could be a hurt by the human coronium.
The appearance of the hard island recruiting syndrome of the second type (SARS-CoV-2) in the Central China, in the end of 2019, reiterated attention to the coronavires and surprised us with a high transmission, but more weakly exposed by the virus in comparison with the natural virus of SARS-CoV.
The coronaurus infection of humans represents zones and the understanding of its zoned origin will be very useful.
The majority of human cornevirus is from the flowers of the mouse for which they are not pattogened.
A well-known interim reservers of some human cornevirus.
The allocation of animals directly affects prevention of the dissemination of human diseases.
Study of the interaction of animals that are cornevirus carovirus can also spend light on the potogenic coronium of humans.
In this review, we provide information on the seven human corneviruss, focusing on the story of their discovery, and their rural origin and methods of interview transfer.
It is important to note that we are conducting comparison and comparison of different human coronaries in the view of virus evolution and geno-recombination.
In this context, the epidemic of the disease issued by coronium found in 2019 (COVID-19).
Besides this, the conditions required for successful change and the impact of the virus in the severity of disease are observed.
Coronavirus family relates to Coronaviridae, which represents a group of disagretic viruses with a positive political announcement of the RNC.
These viruses with the largest of RNC-container viruss containing from 26 to 32,000 nitroids have received the name by its form, which, in the examination of the electric microscope, recalled the Krone.
In the context of the structure, coronaviruss contain non-exempt genomens from the identical organization.
Approximately two third genoms contain two large openly openly closing core (ORF1a and ORF1b) which are translated into the pp1a and pp1ab polyethic replication.
These polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structured blankes defined in nsp1月16.
The main part of the genome contains open reading frames for structured white, including the shopping white (S), the plastic white (E), the meme-filled white (M) and 0xleprotein (N).
In other lines, the coronevirus has also been kodified a number of lines of assets.
Based on the differences in the follow-up of the white\ coronaviros are shared on four species (alpha, beta, gama and altacorniovirus), the majority of human coroniums included in four lines (A, B, C and D).
There are philogenetic evidence that the genetic source of most alpha and betacoronevirus is flowers and green, while birds are the main reservator for the gaz and the altacoronavirus.
Coronaviros continued to overcome interview barriers, and some of them have evoluted to the dangerous humans.
Today, seven human crowds are known.
Human alcool coronevirus HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63.
The other five biscuits include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, the coronvirus of the hard island symptom (SARS-CoV), the coronavir of the neighbourhood of the East Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and the coronvir of the hard island of the second symptom syndrome of SARS-CoV-2.
Human coronevirus HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are usually a simple form, such as study and (or) diagrams.
Otherwise, the SARS-CoV viruss, MERS-CoV and recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 are extremely discovered, causes severe infections of underlying drugs in comparison with a higher number of patients with a higher probability for the development of narrow reproactive diseases (ORS) and foreign symptoms.
The first exchange of human coronevirus HCoV-229E, B814 was received from a species separated from the narrow of patients suffering studies in the 1960s.
Since the extensive studies have been covered more detailed knowledge of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 virus viruses, which are called on local infection symptoms.
In fact, there was a common concept that was considered by human carbon abuse, since the heavy breath of the island of the reproach symptom (SARS).
In 2003, SARS was one of the most catastrophical epidemics in the current history; over 8,000 people have suffered, and the general rate of mortality was approximately 10 per cent.
The 10 years later the neighborhood of the Middle East Syndrome (MERS) has brought a long epidemic to the Arab Seaster, and the disease was dispersed in the rest of the world.
The new human coronium found in 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was later renamed in SARS-CoV-2, is the building of the current coronium infection epidemic 2019 (COVID-19), which at the 3 March 2020 has made more than 3 120 lives, and the number of infected over 91,000 people.
The threatening signal received, and the world should be prepared for the proper pandemic of SARS-CoV-2.
All of the seven human coroniums have a zone of origin, their sources are flowing mouses, mouses or homes of animals.
Many data sets show the use of evolutionary nature of all human coroniums from the flowers of the museums, which are well adapted to virus bodies and which are not patented properties but demonstrated wide genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic rejected China and the world of serious calls from medical, scientific, social and moral views.
Research of the areaal origin mechanism of human cornevirus allows them to understand their natural history moved to the power of their evolution and factors restricting interview transfer.
It may also underline or accelerate the search for a provisional and optimised saRS-CoV-2 reserver, which is very important to prevent recovery disease in the future.
This review contains the general information on the zone of origin, inter-visual transmission and the patent of human coroniums.
In particular, we are defining and considering the most general characteristics: the original viruss from which human coroniums usually have not been patogened for their carriers, but are acquiring a patent character after the interview transfer of the new portfolio.
We are also analyzing the trend of human coronium evolution, in accordance with the improvement of the transfer of carroses often resulting in the damage of patent properties.
In the same context, the result of the current SARS-CoV-2 support is considered.
The coronium of animals known from the end of the 1930s.
Before the B814 virus of HCoV-229E was first received from a species separated from the narrow of patients who were sicked by the study, different coroniums were found in different in-fined animals, including indictions, museums, cows, dogs, kitchens, and dogs.
In the last decades, seven human corne viruses were discovered.
Table 1 provides a short history of human cronological discovery in chronological order.
The first seam of HCoV-229E virus was received from the tests taken from the discipline of patients with infection of the high-disciplinary pressure in 1966; the virus was further adapted to the multiplication in the WI-38 lines.
The HCoV-229E patients have been studied symptoms, including main pain, feed, feed, general weakness and disease in the garden, where high temperature and cake had been observed in 10 to 20 per cent of cases.
Later, in 1967, virus HCoV-OC43 was issued from organic culture and following series of passports in the museum brain.
Clinical signs for virus HCoV-OC43 are similar to the similar demonstration of the HCoV-229E virus, the symptoms which are incompatible with other potatogens of drug paths, such as the type A and the Rinoris.
The virus HCoV-229E and the HCoV-OC43 virus have a global distribution in the world and, usually, are transferred in the winter times.
In the main period, these two viruses have less than a week, and there should be about two weekly diseases.
According to the results of Voluntary Research in healthy persons in the HCoV-229E virus, a regular study has developed a simple form.
A lot of patients with a huge immunity infection of underlying roads.
The SARS explosion, also known as “the ethical petroleum”, became the first of all the history of humanity a well-deployed mastery called by the human coronium and the building of disease had been the SARS-CoV virus, the third of the identified human coroniums.
The first case of SARS disease was discovered at the end of 2002 in the Chinese Province of Guandun.
During the SARS epidemic, 8 096 cases of disease and 774 death were added, and diseases were spread in many countries and in different continents.
Without account of the superactive disseminants, each sufferer could consider about two persons; the innewalation period was from 4 to 7 days and the beach of virus load was 10-sleeping.
In patients in the SARS-CoV, weapons, main pains, high temperatures, general weakness and comprehensiveness were calculated among later symptoms, coach and disability.
The spread of laboratory deficiencies from SARS standards are limphose, violations in press tests and increased cyana levels.
In patients with SARS are also observed the diphossic alveolar damages, the transplantation of episodes and the increased macrophages levels.
Approximately 20 to 30 per cent of patients have a need for intensive therapy and mechanical ventilation.
In such difficult cases\ In addition to the low paths, other organs may also be informed, including iron and kitchen treaty bodies, pressures and pockets, which are usually lifted to a citokin corner that can be an annual, particularly for patients with abused immunity.
The first virus was issued from the open bioossy of a limbing family who came to Hong Kong from Gunichou.
Since then, huge efforts have been made to research human cornevirus.
At the end of 2004, HCoV-NL63 was issued in a seven-month child from the Netherlands.
At first, it was determined that he primarily affects children of young age, older people and patients with abused immunity and recruiting diseases.
For the disease called by HCoV-NL63, it is characteristics of demonstrations such as the sulfur, the containment, the high temperature and the bronchyholit.
Another independent study describes the same virus from the name material covered by a 8-month boy from the Netherlands suffering from the wine.
The virus was discovered in the Netherlands, but in fact it was distributed to all.
According to the reports, HCoV-NL63 is about 4,7 per cent of the widely widely wide reproach diseases, and the drink of diseases of them are at the beginning of a year, birth and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is linked to the objective laringit, which is also called the larger.
HCV-HKU1 was elected in Hong Kong in the same year from 71-year-old men who had been hospitalized with an infection and broncholito.
In addition to unemployment and bronchyhold, HCoV-HKU1 is related to the astmatic diseases.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, a HCoV-HKU1 virus that produces easy forms in the world.
All of these four coroniums of humans who had an infection had been well adapted to people, and their threats to high-populated diseases, as usually, were little sure, although the incidents were not known as the example of HCOV-NL63, which, in accordance with recent communications, resulted in the serious infection of lower disorder paths in China.
Usually, the capability of transmiting and maintaining in human body, these human coronvirus becomes less virtuous or pattogenic.
In 2012, the Soviet Arabian Coronavir of the Middle East Syndrome (MERS-CoV) was identified in Saudi Arabia from the light 60-year-old patient with an eye of an inconsistent eye and the startlessness.
Most cases have been confirmed in the Middle East, but in various European countries and Tunesians have registered vessels and dissemination through episodial second accidents of warming in close contacts.
Another second consequences with 186 confirmed cases occurred in South Korea in 2015.
The clinical demonstrations of the Middle East Symptom syndrome (MERS) remember the symptoms of the hard island reproaching symptom (SARS) for both infections are characterised by the progressing area of the petroleum.
In addition to SARS, many patients with MERS have also disappeared the lack of deficiency, which has differed MERS from the remaining diseases caused by coroniums that are transferred to persons.
More than 30 per cent of patients are observed isolated and kiss symptoms, such as diagrams and robots.
As at 14 February 2020, more than 2.500 laboratory cases of the neighbourest repatriation syndrome with high-level mortality (34.4 per cent), MERS-CoV is therefore considered one of the most mortal viruses known by men.
During the middle to the end of December 2019, the Single of the Chinese Province of Huba was discovered by patient classs with the petroleum, which are now linked to the infection called by the Czech Republic of Habai by the 2-Type (SARS-CoV-2) hard-representative syndrome (SARS-2).
The World Health Organization announced that the continued infection of lower paths called SARS-CoV-2 is a global emergency of health health, and the disease had received the name “Corronviral Infection 19” (COVID-19).
At 3 March 2020, 90 053 confirmed events have been registered, and death is approximately 3,4 per cent.
It should be noted that mortality in the Chinese province of Hubby is 4,2 per cent, and over its borders is 1,2 per cent.
SARS-CoV-2, such as SARS and MERS, is a hard representative infection which is characterised by improvement of temperature, cash and disappearance.
Some patients also observe diare.
The phenomenon is one of the hardest symptoms, and it is easily able to go to the syndrome of disappointment syndrome.
Despite the similar appearance of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, taking into account the high geologology of micro-electricity (82 per cent), these viruses are, however, different rains of philogenetic trees.
SARS-CoV-2 apparently is less patent, but has more ability to transfer compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
In recorded cases of unsensitive SARS-CoV-2 Institution, which is revealed of the power of the virus to be rapidly expanded throughout the world.
As a result of comparison and comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other six human coronauruses, important situations and differences are shown.
First, the person of the cornevirus have similar inchange period and the continued deterioration of their diseases.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 shows the same trend that the remaining six human coroniums.
Secondly, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four human coroniums caused by infection (e.g. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On one side, the infection of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the most frequently observed by human coroniums caused infections, including inspective manifestations, light symptoms or even absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, as well as in the SARS-CoV, you can choose a small small group of cases of COVID-19, although it is a little bit below.
Third, in the plan of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the interesting laws, characterised as for human coroniums caused infections, as well as for SARS-CoV.
On one side, the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 is at least high as human coroniums produced infections.
On the other hand, it is still needed to check whether the transfer of SARS-CoV-2 was reduced with each subsequent virus transition (e.g. the infection of each next person), such as in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as well as other human coroniums that cause infections, SARS-CoV-2 can be found in the figures of the circle.
We still have to respond to whether the actual-oral path of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is so significant (in some circumstances) as well as in the case of SARS-CoV.
It is particularly interested in the possible SARS-CoV-2 season, characterised for human coronevirus infections.
However, the future development of COVID-19 will depend on the particulars of SARS-CoV-2, including transmission, patentity and sustainable dissemination after transition through people.
All four human coroniums that produce infections with easy shapes were well adapted to people.
On the other hand, these people may have been well adapted to these four human corne viruses.
Other words, and those, and others, would be called the only healings after the masters of human cornevirus in the past.
Human coroniums caused severe diseases to people, and people in which human cornavires have caused severe diseases have not been survive.
In order to achieve this, human coronaviruss must be replicated in human body sufficiently to take place of adaptive musts against the factors of restraints.
In this sense, more long the SARS-CoV-2 is extended and more people will be informed, more likely that virus is fully adapted to humans.
If it is well adapted, it will be difficult to stop through cartanine or other infective disease control activities.
During many years, four indigenous coroniums have been circled in the population who produced normal study in people with healthy immunity.
These viruses do not require animal reservoir.
High-population coroniums of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been sufficiently good to person, and their transfers to people cannot be supported.
They need to be kept and multiplied in their zone reservers and seek a possible fall in human acquired mouses, perhaps through one or more intermediate or forced carriers.
The SARS-CoV-2 is the same as SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four extra-body viruss of HCoV.
It is very easy to transmit, at least at least now.
But he's more potogen than the extreme HCOV and less patent than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to see whether it is fully adapted to the person and whether it will be circled in human environment without a reservation or an interim animal.
Before discussion of the HCoV virus origin, we will be useful to discuss the definition and characteristics of evolution, natural, intermediate, forced and reservation of virus viruses.
Life serves the HCoV-evolutionary carrier, if it translates a closely natural prejudice with the same high geologic at the level of the likeotians.
The former virus is usually well adapted and non-patient in this carrier.
Likewise, the Reserveer has constantly transferred HCoV during long-term periods.
In both cases, the carriers are naturally informed and are natural HCoV portraits or his parent virus.
Otherwise, if HCoV was only injured in the intermediate carrier right before or about the time he was degraded, he was not well adapted to the new portion and often patogen.
The intermediate driver can serve the zone of human infection and play the role of an enhanced carrier, allowing the virus to replicate silence and then transfer it to people, increased the dimension of warming of people.
HCoV can move a topic infection if you can't take the transmission into the intermediate driver.
On the contrary, viruses of HCoV can also be adapted to the inter-agency portfolio and even to establish long-term endemoticity.
In this case, the interim carrier becomes a natural carrier.
Epidemiological data retrospectively showed that the neck SARS patient had an anonymous contact with the smooth-producing animals (Child).
Further studies have shown that IgG anti-Ig-coV anti-virus in comparison to the population in general.
The Hymalai civies (Paguma larvata) and the homologic dog on the markets of living animals became the first set by virus ports, such as and almost identical SARS-CoV.
This was strictly reaffirmed that after the destruction of all quotes on the markets, SARS was no longer reported.
It was also reported that the hymylacs living in nature or farms and not on the market, in most of the cases of SARS-CoV, did not determine that the conclusions of the hymal cycles could only serve as an intermediate forced carrier, not the natural reserver of SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80 per cent of different animals on the Guancheo markets have an anti-SSRS-CoV anti-related, but it cannot be excluded that interim forced carriers can also serve many kinds of small minors.
They all look to the topics of the SARS-CoV virus.
The following search for the natural animal, SARS-CoV, founded the nearly coV flower mouse, which was called the therapy coronium related to the HKU3 subcarbon flights of HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-Bat CoV HKU3) and presented in Chinese sub-styles.
These mouses are positive on the anti-related side of SARS-CoV and the genetical follow-up of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
The other coronaviros of the mouse are 88 to 92 per cent of the same geoology of the micro-electricities, as well as SARS-CoV.
These studies founded the new concept that the flower mouses became new patents.
A few SARS coroniums (SL-CoV), but no one of them, except the WIV1 designed, could not be paid as a live virus.
The receptor SARS-CoV is a human anti-convergence ферm 2 (ACE2).
It was shown that WIV1, received from the factory of the flower mouse, uses ACE2 flower mouses, cilts and humans as a receptor for the entrance in the cell.
It was so nervous that the HIV1 healed patients with SARS could be neutralised.
Today WIV1 represents the most closely parent prejudice of SARS-CoV in the flower mouse, divided 95 per cent of the neighbouring follow-up.
Despite the high geographic between these two viruses, WIV1 is not an immediate parent virus of SARS-CoV, and the flight mouses are not an immediate retailer of SARS-CoV.
The philosogenic analysis refers to MERS-CoV the same group as CoV-HKU4, and CoV-HKU5 flowers.
CoV-HKU4 flowers and MERS-CoV use the same receptor of the carrier, diplomaticised-4 (DPP4) for the processing of virus.
The follow-up of RNK-Armaracy of MERS-CoV is philosophyly close to the follow-up of the biocarbon viruss identified in Europe and Africa.
Today, in the wild raw mouse, there was no live virus of MERS-CoV.
The MERS-CoV geologology of the MERS and its closest CoV-HKU25-based Mouse followers is only 87 per cent.
So there's a flower mouse could not be an immediate virus carrier of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, research in the Middle East showed that the sovereign rooms of Neutralized Anti-States, special for MERS-CoV, as well as neighbouring rooms in many African countries.
The live MERS-CoV, the identical virus found in people, was issued from the named chambers, which reaffirms the role of rooms as real MERS-CoV carriers.
It should also be noted that the MERS-CoV cameras, experimentally depressed MERS-CoV, have observed significant symptoms, but a mass virus unit.
It is noted that the intrusted rooms have chosen virus not only as a recruitment, but also a physical-oral way, which is also the main way to select virus in the flights of the mouse.
However, there are still questions, since many cases confirmed by the neighbourest reproach syndrome have not been contacted with compounds before the removal of symptoms and rightly relate to human transfers or the transfer of unknown channels including non-installed animals that are MERS-CoV drivers.
The geologology of SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% with CoV RaTG13 flower mouses selected in the Rhinolophus containers.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the coherence of follow-ups between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to register their parental relations.
So there are flowers that could not be a direct reserver of SARS-CoV-2, unless only the identical coroniums are found in the future.
The immediate animals of SARS-CoV-2 virus must be among the wild species sold and killed by the oil market, which has been related to many initial cases of COVID-19, which is likely to be transfered from animals.
Several recent studies based on metagenic sequence have been found that the groups of being threatened by the destruction of small molecules known as pangolines (Manis Javanica) could also be transferred to the parent betacorrovirus, the family scene SARS-CoV-2.
The geologic follow-ups of these new genes of pangolians are 85-92% compared to SARS-CoV-2.
However, they also are closely linked to RaTG13, with 90 per cent of the identity at the microchief sequence level.
They are classified in two species of virus differencing, such as SARS-CoV-2, in the philosophy tree, one of which is the receptor-receptionnaire (RCD) more closer to SARS-CoV-2, with the identicality of aminoslot sequences at level 97,4 per cent.
Together, RSD sexs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more survey, despite the higher geologic consequences in all genius.
In the early study of hospital pangolyns also reported about the definition of virus containers from light tests that were similarly found by SARS-CoV-2.
Other methods of collecting and manual processing were applied to obtain genome followed by approximately 86.3% of the total virus genome.
You can't exclude the possibility of Pangolin to become one of the intermediate animals of SARS-CoV-2.
However, in view of the consequences between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolyn biocorrorisms, parental SARS-CoV-2, there is no evidence in support of SARS-CoV-2 direct origin.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is more short than between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolyn biocarbons related to SARS-CoV-2.
The SARS-CoV-2 evolutionary path in flower mouse, pangolones and other glucopes is not yet installed.
While the highest geologic follow-up was found in the RSD between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronavirus of pangolyns, family of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13's highest geologic follow-up.
It's very theoretical, high-knowledge comparisons between the pangolyns, family of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related to parallal evolution through electricity.
The promotional proposal is for the recombination of the biocarbonrous pangolyns, family of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third form of wild animals.
As the movement force of evolution, recombination is widely distributed among the betacoronavirus.
The final decision on the immediate origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still not yet.
In addition to HCoV high-population virus, HCoV-229E is also studied in the zone of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1.
The philosogenic evidence shows that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E can happen from the fluorescent coroniums, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 are discovered in the greenhouses.
It was reported that the coronavirus of the mouse called ARCoV.2 (Appalachin Ridge CoV) and identified in the North American Triple Congress demonstrated nearly by HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was geneticly linked to the other coronevirus of the mouse named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/9/2008, which was discovered in the Guinea, although there was a suspect that his provisional carrier could also be a view.
In order to clarify the modern knowledge of the animal origin of the known cornavirus are reported on the picture 1 and table 2.
The philosogenic analysis gave evidence of the HCoV interview transfer to anamnesis.
When approximately 1890 was an interview transmission of HcoV-OC43 and people were relocal from home animals, the domination of refluence infection was registered.
The HCoV-229E story is not so clear.
Alcowroniums were discovered, close HCoV-229E.
In the middle of them, the Alphorovirus is alpha.
Some data support the direct transmission of virus from the museum.
Firstly, people, not alpain, could contact the flower mouse in a common environmental lower.
At the same time, people are in close contact with alpatics.
Second, alcool coronaviros of the museum, family HCoV-229E, in the flowers of the mouse different and non-patiogene, while alpha coronavirosis led to reproach diseases in the infected animals.
Finally, Alphorovirus was not found in wild animals.
It is therefore impossible to exclude the probability that the alpatics had received alco-coronavir from humans.
Really, the flights are the direct source of human patent virus, including virus of refugee, the virus of Ebola, the virus of Nipoh and the Hungary virus.
It is therefore no surprise that the flights could directly transmit HCoV-229E people.
On the other hand, while alcool coronaviruss could serve HCoV-229E HCV-229E, alpatics and soil rooms could become interim portraits that deliver viruses people, exactly as in the case of MERS-CoV virus.
MERS-CoV serves a wonderful example of intermediate transfer from the flowers of the museums and the soft chambers of man.
The evolution of the MERS-CoV virus from the flower mouse known by its initial identification and then confirmed follow-up research.
Apparently, the flower mouse gives a rich flag of virus varieties for intermediate exchange of Gender Exchange and Interview Transmission.
Adults, housing colonies, close social interaction and ability to flight are made by “the real distributors”.
On the other hand, the virus of MERS-CoV was extremely one-year-old cubits ago.
It was well adapted to those clothes who were made from the interim portrait to a statistical and natural carrier.
These MERS-CoV viruses are very easy and are relatively low often mustation.
His episodian transfer to a person is an accident, and the person remains tolerating MERS-CoV, since his transfer is not supported.
Apart from the role of rooms in the MERS-CoV transfer, the pangolons role, if there is, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In particular, the biscuit of pangolins are high-potone in the pangolans.
They may be the topics of betacoronavirus, natural SARS-CoV-2, as well as cilts in the case of SARS-CoV.
The future research needs to confirm or exclude a number of opportunities of intermediate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals.
First, the flower mouse may be a carrier for virus, a family of SARS-CoV-2, almost identical SARS-CoV-2.
People can share ecological low with flower mouses thanks to the hydrocarbon or the separation of these animals.
Secondly, the pangolines may be one of the intermediate forced carriers in which the family SARS-CoV-2 fell recently.
People are worried by the virus through the fresh and use of the meat of wild animals.
It is possible that many animals, including households may be acquired to SARS-CoV-2.
The investigation of households and wild animals is justified.
Third, as indicated above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could happen in a third form, which contacted as a flower mouse, as well as a mangolins.
Search for the SARS-CoV-2 origin.
In addition to different types of animal containers, three main factors of virus were also helped to move interview barriers.
First of all, they are relatively high-speaking muscles in the RNCC replitation.
Compared with other viruses with the unique RNP, the frequency of the coronavirus arts can be considered by the average frequency of the replacement of approximately 10 to 4 in the year, at the same part of 2, depending on the adaptation of the coronaurus to new farms.
Coronaviruss have a correct espectacular espectacleace, which is removed by extremely high speed of moving and acceleration or even incompatibility.
It is interested that the nucleus analogus of Remindevier reduced the replication of cornavirus through the inhibitation of this espectacle and RNK independent RNK-polemerasie.
Remindevier is one of the most popular resources against SARS-CoV-2 that needs to verify in clinical research.
Nevertheless, the frequency of the coronium is almost millions of times above than their carriers.
Furthermore, the frequency of motion may often be above if coroniums are not well adapted to the portfolio.
Compared with SARS-CoV with high frequency democracy, the frequency of the SARS-CoV-2 mutuation is seen below, which is a higher adaptation level to people.
This virus has already been adjusted to another neighbour, close to a person.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, it is also related to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to solary camels.
Theoretically, heavy vaccines and anti-virus transports from SARS-CoV-2 rapidly lost effectiveness resulting from the genetic drug.
Secondly, the large geno RNK in the coronauruss has greater plastics in genomalization with regard to museums and recombination, thus increased the probability of intervisional coevolution intended to renew new coroniums with relevant conditions.
This contributes to a number of unique open frameworks of readiness and the functions of the blanks encoded in direction 3-End of the genome.
Third, thanks to the unique selection of the matrix, coronviros are accidentally and often overcome the matrix during the republication of the RNC.
During the transcription of the DNA coronavirus in the portal, which serves a heavy vessel, often is the switch of the nitrogen.
High-dimensional and subgenous RNPs can recombine and create new coroniums.
The philosogenic evidence of natural recombination was discovered in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coroniums, such as SL-CoV and bathCoV-HKU9 flowers.
Relationship of virus-contributors on transfer
In addition to three of the above-line virus factors, a key factor that is important for interview transmission, is the intermediate interaction of virus with the carrier receptor.
This article as a typical example, which also demonstrates a positive selection in the events of interview transfer, provides the SARS-CoV recombination.
On the basis of a comparative analysis between the SARS-CoV human sexes and civitats, SARS-CoV is considered to be rapidly adapted in different portfolios, particularly in relation to MSD ball S.
In general, the S coronavirus's white is involved with the clothic receptor, and the response of the carrier is intensely elected.
RSD in SARS-CoV is an amnoxisols, from 318 to 510, at the S1 fridge, which is related to the combustion of virus in the cell to the 2 (APF2) and its cortepters.
RSD virus SARS-CoV is able to recognize APF2 different animals, including a flower mouse, circles, mouses and homosexual dogs, making possible interview transmission of virus.
In fact, the RSD was discovered only six aminos of human and civitates, with 4 of them in the receptor-based model for interaction with the AFF2 Receptor.
SARS-CoV civics are moving K479N and S487T in the SPD, which may increase the ability of interaction of shopping white with APF2 human receptor.
In other words, these two immunics replacers may be particularly important for the adaptation of virus to man.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 has the same climate receipt as SARS-CoV.
The difference of 30 per cent between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 white S in the seminar is that the associated S blankness at human APF2 could be changed.
In fact, research through the crioelectronic microscope said that the effectivity of this connection at 10 to 20 times above between APF2 and S-bit S virus of SARS-CoV.
It would also be interested to determine whether any other corrigents were required to transfer SARS-CoV-2.
It is surprised that HCoV-NL63 is also linked to APF2, but other S white segment.
There are many other receptors of HCoV, such as the N-mymptyids for HCoV-229E and 9-O-cetyl oxygen for HCoV-OC43.
They may also respond to successful adaptation of these cornevirus in humans after interview transfers from animals.
In addition to CV receptors, the result of intermediate transfer HCoV is also managed by other factors of dependence and restraints.
The divergence of these balls between people and natural retailers of HCoVs, such as flighting mouses, sophisticated rooms and rhythms, may be a barrier for interview transfer.
For successful interview transfer to virus, HCoV should be monitored by the factors of dependence and the factors of the restraction of the carriers.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of interaction between the virus and the carrier are still needed in definition and classification.
Good results may provide an impartial comprehensive comprehensive scenario of factors of dependence and restraints for SARS-CoV-2 through the new CRISPR Technology.
New HCoV occurrence: back to zero note
The diversity of the coroniums of the mouse has made wide opportunities for new HCOV.
In this sense, the coronavirus of the mouse served by HCoV genital pumps.
Furthermore, the rapid motion and genetic recombination are also the HCOV power moved and served by two important steps in this process.
For example, acquiring or losing new genes codecing white has the potential for radio-modalization of virus phonyms.
Among the accessiory balls SARS-CoV, ORF8 was considered to be adjusted as viruses of the ORF8 flower mouse, natural SARS-CoV were deployed, but they were defined that they are encoded ORF8 visual balls.
The 29-ninkleotic delegation, characterised for the SARS-CoV coronevires, was discovered in the stimms of human epidemics.
The delegation puts ORF8 to ORF8a and ORF8b and considers an adaptive motion that accelerates the change of carriers.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV has the story of possible recycling lines with alpha and ammoniovirus lines, where the RNC-Asociation RNK-Polemenez was defined by a large number of smaller recycling participants.
Localization of recombination was also defined in non-structuring white nsp9, most nsp10 and parts nsp14.
It was similarly shown that the Epidemic MERS-CoV was recombined among different lines that occurred in the Sowd Arabian Chambers.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombined events were also observed in other HCOV in which HCoV was recognized with other animal coroniums in their non-satural genes.
It is also necessary to predict that the industrial selection can contribute to unrealised changes in virus genomen, which is more importantly due to the elimination of virus from selectional pressures, such as the immunity system.
The example of such effects is the loss of a full ORF4 in the prototype shape HCoV-229E by the dual-leody delegation.
While an intact open ORF4 screening frame can be observed in the aircraft viruss of HCoV-229E, the alcool coronavirus demonstrates one-clothic insert that leads to the movement of the frame.
Finally, the new HCV evolution is also subject to the selection of their carriers.
The lowly expressed symptoms or lack of their absence, which said of the mutual adaptation between cornavires and the flower mouses.
It was said that the flowers of the mouse were well adapted to cornavires.
For example, the explosive response in the flower mouse decreases the pathology called by coroniums.
Furthermore, the natural activity of the killer clothing in the middle mouse was deployed by the aggregation of the inhibitary injury of NKG2/CD94 and the low level of the molecule of the main hysopistity complex of class I.
Furthermore, the high level of active oxygen, which is provided by high metabolic activity of the mouse, may reduce the replication of the coronavirus in the same time, with the impact of the ecsybobunklease espectacular, thus creating the selection for the generation of semi-virus, which are provided in the new carrier.
More patent coroniums can also evolute through recombination, which leads to acquiring new white or white properties for the adaptation of the carrier.
Thus, there is no case that three new human cornevires over the past twenty years have occurred.
The coroniums of non-patogenics or the easy symptoms of their carriers, such as flighting mouses or rooms.
They are safely reployed, not having a strong immune response to the carrier.
This is a secret why we have seen unsismatismed portfolios and that causes the hard cases of human infection.
The current symptoms are mainly linked to the hyperactivation of immune response and a citically-cytokian warm, with which the immune response is more seriously affected by lighters.
The immune refusal does not comply with the replication of the coronavirus.
However, immune response strategy may have well-effective effects in therapy against SARS-CoV-2.
The Mouse is particularly forced for an interferon response.
Therefore, accepting type I, at least at the initial phase of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, people must have a well-effective effect.
Furthermore, the NLRP3 inflames have been violated.
Based on this inhibitation of NLRP3 infloms with MCC950 may be useful when COVID-19 treatment.
The result of SARS-CoV-2 is to be a common scheme with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While the biocoronavirus was found by the floods of the mouse, the mileotic homologic of which 95 per cent confronts with SARS-CoV, there is also the coronium of the museums, which is 0,2% of the SARS-CoV-2.
Although it was discovered that circles and other animals on the market move, the SARS-CoV viruss were not directly installed for SARS-CoV-2.
Betacoronaviros were discovered, apparently geologic SARS-CoV-2, which said that Pangolyns could serve one of the intermediate transporters or that the genes of the biocarbons of pangolins could enter into the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Despite the remaining questions, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was intended or accidentally created by man.
Coronaviruss focused on the recent success of SARS-CoV-2.
The investigation of coronauruses in the flower mouse and other animals has changed radio-changed our importance for the zone of origin and animal reservoirs of HCOV in human transfer.
The survivors showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have been transferred to the man through interim portfolios.
If the SARS-CoV infection is from contact between people and cittads on the markets, closing pollution markets and disappearing civilians could have an effective end of the SARS epidemic.
For the same reason, in the light of the opening of different rows of pangoliums, the close natural SARS-CoV-2, to prevent the zone transfer of the product markets should be removed.
However, whether a SSRS-CoV-2 was transferred to a person through pangolins and other glucose students, and how the tasks of future research can be done.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV virus has been a long time in the sugar rooms.
These rooms serve as an important vehicle as well as the main source of meat, milk, kitchen and sacks for the local population.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to provide all MERS-subjects to control, as it was done on the wild animals of China to prevent the distribution of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to stop MERS periodic constraints, an integrated approach should be made to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for rooms in comparison with other infection control measures.
Since we can't miss these viruses, new genotics may appear to be resulting in the impact of diseases.
In the world, different zone coroniums are circulated.
In particular, there are extremely different coroniums of the mouse with zone capacity.
There is a great number of opportunities for evolution and recombination of these zone coroniums, which will lead to the decrease of new cornevires that are easier and (or) more mortal for humans.
In order to reduce the number of different contacts between people and animals, the culture of use in the food of wild animals should be rejected in some areas of China.
Following serious tests as SARS, MERS and COVID-19, the best preparation and response plan is required.
In fact, many viruses exist on the planet during a very long period.
They remain in their natural reserves until the possibility of covering the new territory.
Although many characteristics of museums are welcome to disseminate viruses if people learn to keep their sides, they can minimize the probability of human contacts with flowers and other kinds of wild animals.
For the best understanding of the coronaurus ecology and their natural носrs, a permanent epidemiological supervision for smaller feeding, which will be used to prevent the transmission of coroniums from animals and future diseases.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent the virus Zone is to keep people far than the ecological lower reservers of rural viruses.
In the main area of SARS-CoV-2, there are still some fragments.
First of all, if the Mouses had transmitted the previous SARS-CoV-2 pangolinas, it is interesting to see what kinds of mouse and pangolins are divided one of the same environmental lows.
Secondly, if the flower mouse plays a more direct role in the transfer of persons, it is necessary to determine how people have entered into contact with flighting mouses.
Third, if the role of the real intermediate carrier plays a third player, it is necessary to explain how it is involved with different species, including persons, flowers of mouse and mangolyns.
Finally, as many of the plastics, including domestic animals, can be accompanied by SARS-CoV-2, should be conducted as epidemological supervision and experimental infection.
If the Mouse, pangolin or another glucose is expected to be determined in the future of SARS-CoV-2 or its prior viruses in their natural carriers.
Further studies in this area have the light on the evolutional path of the SARS-CoV-2 animals, which will have an important impact on prevention and control of COVID-19 people.
Diagnostic criteria needed to update for “subjections to disease” and COVID-19
Once February 6, 2020, our group has published a short-scale management on diagnosis and treatment of the new coroviral infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), which provides information on our experience and provides faithful recommendations to combat this mastery around the world.
However, the Coronaviral Infection 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased through the current research results and clinical experience, so the diagnostic strategy and the terrorist practice have also been updated unprecedented.
In this letter we have responded to one comment on our recommendations and bringing new diagnostic criteria for “seven cases of subjection for disease” and “confirmed cases” in accordance with the Recommendation on Diagnosis and Terrorism for COVID-19” (seventh version) by the National Health Committee on the Health Committee.
In December 2019, a new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which has now been an official name of the coronaviral infection 2019 (COVID-19), and the racial disease was called “the severe island reproaching syndrome 2” (SARS-CoV-2).
The 11 March 2020 WHO qualified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat the infection of SARS-CoV-2, our group has developed a short manager and published it on the website of the Military Medical Research Journal on February 6, 2020.
This publication has taken a great attention.
It is noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, so our understanding and knowledge have been gradually increased based on current research and clinical experience, so the diagnostic strategy and the therapeutical practices have also been updated unprecedented.
For example, from 16 January to 3 March 2020, seven documents “Diagnostic and Terrorism Reviews for COVID-19” issued by the National Committee on Health (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), whereas some provisions have been changed significantly.
Recently, the comments on our recommendations have been made in the work prepared by Chijou (Zhou) and the simple proposals on the diagnosis based on the climate experience already.
This work was added to our recommendations of new practices, as well as to provide a valuable performance information on this mastership covered by the whole world.
We reaffirm the high importance of their work and express thanks to us.
However, in accordance with the latest outcome “CoVID-19 Diagnosis and Terrorism Reviews” (seventh version) and on the results of current research and their work is needed to update.
In accordance with the seventh outcome of the document (on 3 March 2020) to carry out a comprehensive analysis in revealing awareness of diseases, one of the Epidemological History characteristics with two clinical diseases:
The Epidemiological History: (1) History of movements or depression in H. Watch and its neighbourhoods or in other populations where the COVID-19 diseases were registered during 14 days before the demonstration of symptoms; (2) the history of contacts with the patients with the diseases invented SARS-CoV-2 (as a positive test on the basis of the nicks); (3) the history of contact with the patients with high temperature or re-representative symptoms from Mr. Huhanni and his arrests or other population items where the accidents of the COID-19 were registered during the 14 days of the follow-up to the events; (4) the resistance of the contacts with 2 core-prises and non-responses.
Clinical demonstrations: (1) High temperature and/or recruiting symptoms; (2) Availability of external infection of COVID-19; (3) The total number of leakers is normal or degraded with a lower number of limphoses at the early stage of symptoms.
The status of the diagnosis for the confirmedness of disease should be based on the case of suspecting one of the following paragraphs of pattogenic or sirological evidence, such as: (1) PKC in real time process is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the complete seal of the virus shows high-homogenicness relating to new coroniums; (3) positive results for special for SARS-CoV-2 anti-Ig; or change the results of the ad hoc to a positive for SARS-CoV-2 anthle IG, or increase the period of 4 times for the factors of the relevant factor.
It could also be noted that in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) the testing of the document was added in the real time for calciums in disorders or blood tests.
The Patogenic blood test diagnosis was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and the fifth (8 February 2020) emissions, and then the seventh outcome was added to the need for serological evidence.
These changes are based on the results of the non-interrupted work of researchers looking for the optimism set for the detection of necklein oxygen at the rapid settlement of diagnosis, as well as the analysis of the tests taken from discipline paths, including the selection of blood testing, which increases the access of different species and helps to include positive test results for special anti-persons in the disease criteria.
However, further evidence of need to demonstrate care when patients treated with therapy symptomics and patients without expressed symptoms.
Therefore, the marine card presented in the work of Chijou (Zhou) and Dr. should be updated, since the persons who do not have clinical symptoms are classified as a group of “the low risk”.
The evaluation system also requires clarification in further climate practices and research.
In conclusion, we hope to obtain more direct evidence and call for readers to give their comments.
With regard to the diagnosis of “subsponsory cases” and “convened cases”, we call for readers to reveal and closely implement the latest recommendations given in the countries where they live.
Our group will also be to update timely its recommendations to provide effective assistance.
Banglass reports about five new cases of COVID-19 - a day of maximum
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new death cases in the COVID-19 results.
It's the greatest number of deaths from virus per day.
During the last day, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Monitoring and Research (IEDCR) reported that, in the number of registered cases, 114 of the current cases and 33 health patients who were home.
It was recorded 17 deaths.
In the online Brifing Director IEDCR, Dr. Merdjabi Sarrina Flora said that victims were four males and one woman.
According to Dr. Merdjabi, two ended ages of ages of 60, two of the ages of 51 to 60, and one of the ages of 41 to 50.
She also reported that the two losts were from Darky.
The World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 master.
The Clinic Assistant reported the local new Agency Anadau that one of the dead was Jaalal Siffur Rahman, the Director of the Bengoul Anti-Corruption Commission, which was in the Kuwait climate.
On the Sabbath, the Minister of Car Transport and Montes of Bangadesh Obaddal Cavader said that the work of the public transport would be stopped for a longer period of time as it was planned, before the next sabbath.
The work of public transport was stopped since 26 March and should be renewed on Sabbath, 4 April.
The transport of the first needs — medicines, fuels and food — is still allowed.
The first cases of the COVID-19 crime were registered in England on 8 March in two persons who returned from Italy and one of them.
By 19 March, these three people have already been endured.
SARS-CoV-2 override a million of cases of infection throughout the world
According to the University of Johns Hopkins, the total number of cases of the damage of the corovirus infection of SARS-CoV-2 around the world has exceeded one million.
The COVID-19 cornevir died at least 52,000 people.
Reuben was the same day when Malawi was confirmed the first case of infringement, and Zambie was the first case of death from the corovirus.
North Korea stated that it was one of the few countries in which there were no accidents of the damage of the corroboral infection.
During the last day, the World Health Organization reported about 1 051 635 confirmed offences, including 79 332, at the end of the twenty-four hours before 10:00 to Central European Time (0800 UTC) 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases were registered by coronium crimes, of which less than 5 900 were an annual end.
The CBS News of the University of Johns Hopkins reported that more than 1000 deaths were identified by Coronaviral Infection.
Countries around the world have declared the damage of measures to prevent the dissemination of diseases.
In Thursday, Mr. Moscow Sergey Sweden extended the mode of self-islated citizens until 1 May.
The previous President of Armymond Putin stated that Russians in the country, despite self-dependence, will receive payment until 30 April.
The Parliament of Portugal voted for an emergency prolonging 15 days; the results of the vote: 215 votes, ten abstentions and one voice “opposite”.

The Gubernator of the Ugayo State, Michael Dawne, declared that the home self-ission regime has been extended by order until 1 May.
Magazins in Australia are limited to the number of tunnel papers that can be obtained once
On Tuesday and Saturday, Australian store networks of Woolworths and Coles have reduced the number of a tunnel paper packages that can be acquired for one time in all country stores, to two and one packages respectively.
ALDI also introduced restrictions for one packaging on Monday.
These restrictions have been reported in cases advertisements, as well as on the Facebook website.
As reported, the citizen began to make extensive stocks because of the assurance that COVID-19 could lead to the introduction of the general self-solidation regime.
In the middle of Woolworths, also limited the number of a tunnel paper to one package.
The 4 and 5th March respectively, Woolworths and Coles have already limited the number of 4 packages.
On 8 March, the touring network of Coles reported that, with the invoice of the four packages, “for many tunic bummy stores, they buy still too fast — one delivery for the hour”, and called such a “president” question, while ALDI at the afternoon of Facebook issued on Friday, he called the trend of the “nevergence”.
According to the representative of Woolworths, a significant growth of sales has been observed last week.
Magazin Costco was also limited the number of two packages last week.
In order to fill the deficit, Coles began ordering larger parties to provide providers and increased the frequency of deliverys, Woolworths made additional partys, while ALDI had made stocks for special provisions in the middle.
Russell Zimmerman, executed by the Australian Rilemen Association, reported that the rivers were trying to fill stocks, but it was difficult in connection with the limits of local authorities concerning the transfer of vehicles.
It is expected to increase productivity, as suppliers are trying to meet the question, but thereby it is still less profitable proposals.
In Tuesday, ALDI announced that some stores could not conduct media actions.
In the report of news.com.au Dr. Gery Mortimer, the expert on the trade of the Clinsland Technician University, said that stores are filled every night with stocks.
He noted that the tunnel paper was a major good, so the number of composed stocks was small and after the total of the average ranges of the goods remains empty, increased the lack of stocks.
“Coles and Woolworths believe that if the pillar could be filled, and goods such as the tunnel paper and defined resources for the hand could be placed in these large numbers, the buyers probably would not be paid”, says Russell Zimmerman.
In the middle of the processed tunnel paper, who Gives a Crap reported the end of stocks.
According to the news.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, the tune-producer company Kleenex and Solaris paper, also produced brand products of Sorbent, reported that they work around-softly to ensure sufficient goods.
Domain.com, the site of non-mobility reported that when the number of actors in Melbourne was declined because of the absence of buyers for the working party, some of the sales began to propose the first players of a free-year bumm.
The fourth daily publication of NT News printed in Darwin included the pages of eight pages designed for exhibition and use as a tunnel paper.
According to the ABC Australian report of 3 March, the stores had noted limited the number of purchased goods and noted that they were not planned to do so.
The Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have been used with an increased demand, including medical mass, desinfined hands, galantery, brackets and muscles.
In addition to the events in Australia, it was noted that he was online of the British Supermarket Occo also limited the sale of a tunnel paper by Andres by two packages by 12 robs.
The World Health Organization announced COVID-19 mastership
In the middle of the World Health Organization (WHO), the pandemic of infection disease COVID-19 produced by the SARS-CoV-2 cornevir.
Despite the term “pandemia” is only a scale of disease, and not the danger of specific cases, the WHO notes that the Governments need to take measures:
“All countries are still in a position to affect the development of the pandemic.”
This may be placed if the countries are identified, testing, treatment, isolation of deficiencies, disappearance in cases of disease and mobilization of their citizens”, explained the Director-General of WHOWS Mr. Tedros Aden Gamberisus.
“We are deeply concerned with the levels of dissemination and gravity of disease as well as the damaging levels.”
According to the opinion of Dr. Tom Freden, the former Director of the United States Centres for Control and Prevention, this mastership is “president”.
He said in his interview, translated by CNN in February that “not one other reproach virus except the gamepa has not yet disappeared from its renewal to an uninterprettable global distribution”.
Mr. Gabrisus expressed the similar view, saying that “We never observed the masters called the coronium.
We also have never seen the masters that can be controled.'
At the beginning, the WHO announced that emergency situation of public health, which had an international importance, and then granted her a new state of domination.
The Director of the National Allergy Institute, Dr. Antony Faking, said: “It is just the beginning and will be worse.”
According to the Asociated Press for Thursday, at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19, more than 4 600 people were completed.
The Pandamia Coronavirus 2019–20, which is the present time of the corneviral disease pandemic 2019 (COVID-19), called by the severe reproaching island of the symptomic (SARS-CoV-2) (SARS-2).
The success was discovered in Owen, China, in December 2019, and the emergency situation of international health, which was later recognized by the Pandemie on 30 January 2020.
By 10 April 2020, approximately 1,1 million cases of COVID-19 diseases were registered in 210 countries and regions.
It was about 364,000 people who lived.
The mortality level in China was 4 per cent, while 13.04 per cent in Algery is of 13.08 per cent in New Zealand.
The most widely distributed symptoms include the heat, the chacal and the hardest respiration.
The possible complications are of the drug and island reproaching dissolution.
It is usually about five days from the first demonstration of symptoms to the drink of the disease but may also be reduced from two to fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or special treatment currently not found.
The main treatment is symptomic and supportable, and the recommended preventive measures include the lack of hands, the closure of the wheel, the compliance of the distance between people, the identification and the safeguard of the self-identity of people understood.
The authorities around the world have reacted the situation through travel restrictions, cartaneous measures, the commentary time, the risk controls on workplaces and the closure of various objects.
The Panama has brought serious global economic impacts, transfers or abolishment of sports, religious, political and cultural activities, as well as the widely widespread lack of goods damaged by the mercenaries.
Schools and universities were closed at national or regional levels in 193 countries, which was about 99.4 per cent of students around the world.
The Internet began to disseminate virus information, occurred cases of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other citizens of East and South-South Asia, or people recalling their external groups, as well as other groups of people living in areas where significant cases of virus dissemination are noted.
The reduction of the number of travels and the closure of hard industry has reduced the pollution of air and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, the Ohuhan-Capital of the Province of Hubay reported that there was an unrecognised cause and that the situation was started at the beginning of January 2020.
The cases of an offence were, above all, related to the costs of the Howan Sea producer market, so the virus, as they believe, had a zone of origin.
The virus, which was caused by the disease, was known as SARS-CoV-2. It was recently an open virus that had a major occurrence with the coronauruss of the mouse, the coronavirus of панgolin and SARS-CoV, and then found that the first case of the disease was occurred on 1 December 2019 and had not been visited on the market after that date.
Two cases of the victim registered in December 2019 have been related to this market.
13 March 2020, in the publication of the South-Child Division of the Maorning Post, the information which was not verified was proposed that the first case of an offence occurred from the 55-year resident of the Hubai province 17 November 2019. On 26 February 2020, the OMS reported that the number of new events of crimes in China was decreased, but it was unexpected to grow up in Italy, Iran and South Korea, and the number of new cases of crimes over the borders of China had first exceeded the number of new cases of incidents in China.
The number of cases of diseases may be significantly degraded, inter alia, because of many cases with weakly expressed symptoms.
On 26 February, a few cases were registered in terms of prejudices between young people, with less than 2,4 per cent of the world, and the main scientific adviser of the United Kingdom of Patrick Valens said that 60 per cent of the British population would be infected until the form of an effective immunity group in the country.
Statistics include cases of crimes that were checked at COVID-19 and whose tests were made positive in accordance with the official protocols.
As at 23 March, no country had been able to check more than 3 per cent of its population, and in many countries such as Italy, Spain and Switzerland, a official policy was adopted, which had not been tested in only uncertain symptoms.
The investigation issued on 16 March showed that until 23 January 86 per cent of the COVID-19 crimes had not been discovered, and that such unregistered diseases had been a 79 per cent recorded cases.
The statistical analysis issued on 30 March showed that the number of cases of factful attacks in Italy significantly exceeded the number of cases registered.
The initial assessments of the basis reproductive infection (R0) for COVID-19 are of 1,4 to 2.4.
The U.S. Monitoring and Prevention Review Research is expected that this indicator may include 5.7.
Most patients from COVID-19 welcome.
In others, more complicated cases, the time from the start of the symptoms to the death moment was from 6 to 41 days, the most frequent period of 14 days.
As at 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were related to COVID-19.
In China by 5 February, 80 per cent of death cases were more than 60 years old, and 75 per cent of the dead persons had confronted diseases, including heart-sociated diseases and diabetes. Official data on the death of COVID-19 Pandemics usually include information on the death of patients with positive test results on COVID under the official protocols.
The factful number of deaths from COVID-19 may be far above, since official numbers may not take into account the dead persons without the testing — for example, in cases of death in homes, pregnants, etc.
In comprehensive data in Italy indicate that the actual number of deaths during the pandemic has exceeded COVID officials at 4 to 5 times.
The United States Secretariat for Control and Prevention (CDC) recognizes: “We know that [recovered numbers] below fairly.” His words were reaffirmed by some elephant cases in the United States, and that the notice of the unpleasing data was met with the masters such as the epidemic of the H1N1, 2009, and the first confirmed death was registered in Ugana on 9 January 2020.
The first death was registered on 1 February in the Philippines, and beyond the Asian borders, France, 14 February.
On 28 February, more decade of death was registered outside the border of China: in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and regions in all continents, except the Antiochics, have been reported about death cases. For quantity assessment, several methods are usually used.
All indicators are different from the region and time to dissemination of disease; they also affect testing, quality of health systems used by treatment, time since the starting of diseases and parameters, such as age, sex and common health. The factory of " mortality/relatedness" represents the number of deaths affected by diagnosed cases.
According to the Statistics University of Johns Hopkins, the global number of deaths and accidents of crimes at 10 April 2020 is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204).
The data in different regions are different.
In China, the percentage of mortality was reduced from 17.3 per cent (of those in which the symptoms appeared 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent of those in the symptoms appeared after 1 February 2020). Other methods include the percentage of mortality resulting in diagnosed patients who die from disease and the percentage of mortality from infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of invalidated, as diagnosed and unrealised patients.
These statistics are not linked to a specific time and reflect the indicators of certain groups of people from the date of caution to the end of disease.
Some scientists tried to assess these indicators on specific groups of people.
According to the assessments of the Center for Auditors of the University of Oxford, the mortality level of this mastership is 0.1 to 0.39 per cent.
The higher number of this range is agreed with the first arbitrary testing of COVID-19 in Germany and with statistical research analysing CFR test impact.
WHO states that the current master can be controled.
Pick and precise duration of the expenditure cannot be determined and may be different from the location.
Mathema Boni, the University of Pennsylvania, claims that “infective infection successes, usually go to the payment, and then when the number of available disease carriers is completed, they start to hurry.
However, in the present situation it is impossible to do any reasonable prediction on the time it happens."
The elder medical adviser of the Chinese Government Chien Nanshan claims that “all can end at June” if all countries can mobilize and implement WHO recommendations on the stop of virus distribution.
The 17th March Adam Kucharian from the London School stated that SaRS-CoV-2 “the SSR will be circled, perhaps for a year or two”.
According to the study conducted by the Imperial Collegate by Nila Ferguson, “for the time that the vaccine has been created (perhaps, 18 months or more)” is required to comply with physical disability and other measures.
William Shaffner, Officer of the University of Vanderbyt, believes: “I don't think that this cornevirus will never disappear about it, because he's so easy,” as well as that he can’t be converted into a seasonal disease every year.”
The ability of new complaints will depend on collective immunity and motion levels.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively uncertain, and some infined persons may have a disease without symptoms.
Two most widespread symptoms are an increased temperature (88 per cent) and a sweet cape (68 per cent).
The most widely distributed symptoms include stability, mocle education in disorders (related), loss of disappearance, disappearance, pain in museums and surroundings, huge pain, main pain, owings, drugs, blood drugs or cianas. WHO states that he is seriously affected by the development of disorder problems for each six person.
The United States centres for control and prevention of diseases (CDC) are composed of an important symptoms such as the contamination of disappearance, permanent diseases or anxiety of immorality in the breast, the improving deficiency of recognition, the difficulties of provening and visiting of persons. In the presence of these symptoms, the medical assistance should be immediately addressed. The further development of diseases may lead to severe pitness, the sharing of the reproaching disssession, the seminar, the Sepsis, the Septual Chapter and Death.
Some infected persons may proceed without any clinical demonstration, but then the results of an analysis reaffirm the fact of an accident, the doctor recommends that the persons who are closely contacted with patients, the diagnosis who confirmed, under close control and investigating the object of infection.
The number of Chinese scientists of cases of insufficient diseases is of a number of units to 44 per cent of all cases.
The usual injury period (time between anxiety and symptoms) is closed from one to 14 days; it usually consists of five days. While there is no complete clarification on the symptoms of the decline: by the initial estimation of patients with COVID-19, which had developed this symptom, the meaning of 30 per cent and then fell to 15 per cent.
Some details on the ways of dissemination of disease are still not known.
It seems that the disease is mainly transmitted during a close contact, as well as through small capals that are divided in the air together with a cockle, kitchen or during the discussion; the close contact is under the radio from 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Some studies in open chamber can be extended to a distance from 4,5 meters (15 meters) to 8,2 meters (27 metres).
There are suggestions that the virus can also be transferred through small caps elected in the air during discussions that are able to stay in the air for a longer period.
Captains can fall into the mouth or portion of people, as well as easy.
Some medical procedures such as involution and heartly-licentic response (PPL) can lead to the distribution of products and, therefore, to spread virus into the air.
It may also fall into the body if a person relates to the pollutioned surface, including the hair that follows his eyes, the nail or the wheat.
There are also dangers that virus can be transferred through the fakeal, but the risk of such transmission is low.
The Government of China refused the possibility of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The most current virus is within the first three days after the presentation of symptoms, although it may happen as before the symptoms and the later stages of disease.
There were cases when the tests were made positive in the testing of three days before the mark of symptoms, and that said about the possibility of transmission of virus to express symptoms.
There are only several reports on the Laboratory cases that have been confirmed, but during contact-detection studies in some countries, there were also cases of transmission of diseases from unsymptomed carriers.
The European Centre for Prevention and Improvement Control (ECDC) claims that it is not completely clear how simple virus is spread, but it is known that one of the diseases usually affects 2 to 3 other persons, and the virus is able to survive from a few hours to a few days.
In particular, it was discovered that on the plastic surface (Plypropylene) and on the aggression (304) virus was able to live up to three days, on carton surface — for one day and on medical surfaces — to 4 hours.
However, these data dependent on property and temperature, homes and other animals received positive results on COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit virus to people, although British authorities advise the hands after contact with animals as well as, for example, after contact with other surfaces that could be attacked.
The wide island of the reproaching corovirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus that is first discovered in three persons from the group with island reproaching diseases registered in Uhana.
All the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in the nature of natural coronvirus. Inside human virus, you can disappear with a wooden heat that produces a protected ship. SARS-CoV-2 has a large course with the original virus of SARS-CoV.
It's expected he's got a zone of origin.
The genetic coronvirus analysis showed that he was classified with the kind of Betacoronavirus, Sarbecovirus (Climate Line B) together with two other viruses of the flighting mouse.
At the total level, it is 96 per cent identified by other fluid coronium coroniums (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only one difference in the mixtures of certain parts of the genome of pangolans and human viruses.
The total-geneous comparison of today showed that the largest percentage of similarity (92 per cent) was between the pangolin coronevirus and SARS-CoV-2, but it was not enough to demonstrate that the pangols are interim-hourish virus.
The crime of virus may be precisely diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, although finally it should be reaffirmed by the analysis of the polymical trap reaction with the back transcription (RT-PCP) of an identified secret or computer topicology.
The results of research compared with PRC and CT applications in Owen showed that the CTT was more sensitive than the PRC, although most of its visaalization functions were compared with other pressure and disease processes.
Since March 2020, the American radiology college published the recommendation of “no use the ICT for the sample or as a method of testing the first line in the COVID-19 diagnosis”.
The WHO published several RNC test protocols at SARS-CoV-2, and the first one of them was published on 17 January.
The testing of the polymemal tank reaction in real time (RT-PPC) is carried out.
It may be conducted on discretionate tests and blood species.
The results usually are ready for the period from a number of hours to a few days.
Normally, the test is used for the testing of a narrow, although the cereal can be used from the grain. Some of the laboratory and the companys have developed synerological tests that allow anti-tests.
As at 6 April 2020, no one of them was sufficient to obtain an approval to the general application.
In the United States, a series test developed by Cellex was approved for extracted cases only certificated by laboratory.
The characteristics of visualization of regenograms and computer teography (CT) are the asymmetric periferal combinations on the type of the mathematic style and the absence of comprehensive outputs.
The Italian Radio Society is established by the establishment of the international base of a remarked offence.
For similar infections, such as adovir, when COVID-19 identification, the non-confirmated PPC tests have limited climate specification.
A major study was carried out in China, which was compared with the results of the cell cell and the testing of the PRC, and it was clear that, although less special in the case of infection, they could be decrypted faster; and otherwise, they are more sensitive, and therefore, this method of diagnosis can be considered as a tool of scription in depressed areas.
Virus diagnosis, through regnition and computer technografie, have been developed solid neurone networks based on a artificial intelligent.
The prevention of disease prevention strategy includes the maintenance of the general personal hygiene, the hands, the avoidance of confusions to the eyes, the narrow or crush hands, the use of the chalet or the ceiling of the sand that should be elected immediately after use.
Those who have already been present should be covered by a medical mask in human places.
In order to prevent transmission of disease is also recommended to disabilize people. Many Governments recommend to be detained from any non-term travel in countries and areas losing from expenses and limite the movement of citizens.
Nevertheless, the virus has been able to be distributed in most of the regions of the world.
This means that the virus is distributed among the populations where some members do not know where and how they have been affected. The medical workers who are listed to patients who can be affected are recommended to use standard precaution measures, and the precaution measures in contact with other people and eye protection, and that the contacts are also an important method used by health bodies to determine the source of infection and prevent further distribution.
The use of the Governments on the location of citizens with the assistance of their mobile phones for this purpose was concerned about the compliance of confidentiality and organizations such as Amnesty International (International Amnesty) and more than 100 other organizations have spoken with statements required to restrict such observation for people.
Several voluntary applications have been developed and proposed; more than ten expert groups had worked on the development of personal confidentiality, for example, the registration of the neighbouring of other mobile phones through Bluetooth technologies.
If the mobile phone user has been closely contacted with the face of the COVID-19 test, it will receive a relevant notification. There are also an unstable version of how to prevent anger, for example, the draging of the narrow and the pit, which is indeed ineffective.
There is no vaccine from COVID-19 at present, although many organizations are working on its creation.
In order to prevent the dissemination of diseases is recommended to be breathtaking.
The CDC (CP) also recommends that the monitoring and prevention of diseases should be swimming hands with mixture and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after the visits of the tualette, or with a very pollution of hands, and before disappearing, kitchen, or ready.

According to Steve Griffin, a virus from the University of Lides, “the use of medical mass can reduce the curiosity of people concerning their faces, and the advocacy to the face of armed hands is the main way of infiction, and the machines are also recommended to use those who can be affected.
WHO recommends that healthy people bear medical mass, only if they are high risks, for example, those who have an earned person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that the use of the mass is actually allowed to reduce the number of inconsistencies to the person.
Several countries have been invited to use medical mass in public places.

At the end of March 2020, OMS and other health bodies began to replace the terms of the “Social Distaination” to “fistic Distribution”, so that it is possible to open this measures to contain its social contacts, with any social licencies.

Strategy of combating the success includes the detention of the proliferation of diseases, drugs or decrease.
The detention of disease is carried out in early stages and is aimed at monitoring and implementing infected, and understood other measures of infection and vaccination in order to stop disease dissemination among the rest of the population.
In the stage, where disease spreads are not yet impossible, efforts are made to reduce the impact: measures aimed at decrease and reducing the impact of epidemics on health and society.
Measures for the detention and reduction of the impact of diseases may be taken together.
Infection delivery requires more extreme measures to reduce the mastership, reducing the basic number of cases of infection to below 1. Often efforts to manage infection diseases are aimed at reduce the pipe of epidemic, known as the comparison of the epidemic crime.
Such efforts reduce the risk of overloading health services and provide more time to develop vaccine and treatment methods.
Individual interactions that can be helped with success, include personal prevention measures such as hygians, health-making and self-relatedness; public measures aimed at physical dissemination, such as the closure of schools and the removal of mass activities; engage the community to promoting such measures and participating in them; and environmental protection measures, such as the surrounding systems; since the seriousness of support was evidently made in China, more decision-making actions aimed at maintaining such measures, such as the goals of cities and the building of the surrounding prevention.

The optimistic policy of reduction of the impact of diseases may reduce a peak load on health systems to 2/3, and death is double but lead to hundreds of deaths and collapse of health systems.
It may be a predecessary method, but it is necessary to use until the virus is circled among the population (or until the vaccine has been developed, if it happens before), because in the contrary case the prevention of disease is rapidly renewed when measures are deployed.
The long-term interest in order to deal with the mastership's social and economic costs.

The Laboratory testing of the 2019 Representative coronavirus (COVID-19) and related virus of SARS-CoV-2 includes methods for virus presence and anti-products in response to infection.
The presence of virus in the formals is reaffirmed by the WTO, which recognized RNK coronavirus.
This test is specific and is only designed to find RNC virus SARS-CoV-2.
It is used to confirm sufficiently recent or active infections.
The discovery of antigency (seaology) may be applied as to diagnostics and for popular control.
The number of persons transferred diseases, including those whose symptoms were too important to return to the hospital or not overall.
The exact mortality of this disease and collective immunity can be determined on the results of such tests.

Peaceful threatening, bold power and consolidation are developed in progress in disease.
The results of research compared with PRC and CT methods that were applied in Ugana at the occurrence of the current mastership have shown that the CTT was more sensitive than the PRC, although most of its visualization functions were compared with other processes for the prevention and other diseases.
Since March 2020, the American radiology college published the recommendation “no use the ICT for the sample or as a method of testing the first line in the COVID-19 diagnosis”, as at March 2020, for the original CDC screen, it recommended that the PRC method should be used.
The infection response is often expressed in the processing of anti-intils, including IgM and IgG.
These anti-persons may be used to identify infection in the day following the 7th symptoms, to define immunity and to make population control. Analysis can be conducted in central laboratory (CLT) or by diagnosing (PoCT)
In many clinical laboratory laboratorys, these analysis will be able to carry out high-produced automation systems, but their accessibility will depend on the speed of each such system.
One perifer blood is usually used in the CLT, although immune response may also be used to disclose.
For the PoCT, one blood species usually receives each cover.
On the other hand of the CCP methods, the blood pollution stage was not required to take an auditing analysis. On 26 March 2020, FDA was called 29 organizations who have held all required registration procedures and can now expand their tests on anti-tests.
On the date of April 7, 2020, FDA was approved only one testing for the exceptional solution. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics had received European permissions for the use of their test sets that could be found in the anti-IgG and IgA blood species that have the ability to combat the virus.
The productivity of testing is a number of hundreds of students during a few hours, and therefore this method is more fast than the usual PCR virus analysis.
It is usually possible to detect 14 days after the institution. At the beginning of April, Britain discovered that no one of its anti-virit analysis has been satisfied at the beginning of April.

In Oak 5 February 2020, the BGI compromise was opened to 64 patients in the period of 2000. The 2000 '2 Metrometer ' s efficiency ' s efficiency ' s efficiency ' s efficiency ' s efficiency ' s efficiency ' s efficiency ' s methods.
The restructuring of this laboratory was organized by the BGI Vienna Foundation and completed over five days; the models showed that if the laboratory had not been operated in such an aggravated temperature, the cases of disease in Huba would be more than 47 per cent and, accordingly, Cartanine's expenditure would also be two times above.
At the opening of the laboratory in Owen, the Hoo-Jan Lab was opened in Shangjung, Tanzzin, Peking and Shanha, in the total complex of 12 cities of China.
On 4 March 2020, there were 50,000 tests daily, open multi-integrated origami Assays, which could test up to 1 122 patient analysis with only 93 tests. These balanced constructions could work in small laboratory laboratories, excluding the need for employment of live-based managers.
By March, the weakness and unnecessary number of reagents was the problem of the EU, the Britain and the United States.
A number of authors had resulted in the processing of test models, which provides an increase in 98°C (208°F) within five minutes to deliver the genes for further testing. 31 March was declared that the United Arab Emirates had now been tested by the United Nations Aboriginal Emirates to the soul of the population.
This was due to the possibilities of expression testing, while acquiring group 42 and BGI of the Mass testing Lab (created on their laboratory to detect emergency cases of Huo-Jana in China).
This laboratory, which has been disbursed within 14 days, is able to keep tens of thousands of tests of RTPCPs daily and is the first world of the Laboratory that is so large that works outside China.
Various test options aimed at different parts of the genetic coronaurus profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German option for the production of test cells sent to the country with a low income that had no resources to develop their own elections.
The German option was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the United States epidemiological centres was unlawful until 28 January, which brought the absence of test sets to the United States, and at the beginning of the Chinese and the United States had a problem with the security of test sets, and these countries as well as Australia could not provide sufficient numbers recommended by health experts.
In the South Korea, as the experts stated, the wide access of tests helped reduce the spread of the new coronaurus.
During several years, the South Korean Government worked on the opportunity of testing, mainly in private laboratory.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for the development of testing programmes as the best way to facilitate the spread of COVID-19 Pandemics. As a result of the growth of testing resulting from the rapid dissemination of virus, many private laboratorys in which hundreds of thousands of analysis have been overloaded, and the stocks of materials for motors and chemical reagents were rapidly existd.
In March 2020, China reported the problems with the accuracy of its test elections.
American testing elections developed by CDC have been “pays” and therefore the Government solved burocratic barriers that mixed private test developments. Spain obtained test sets in the Chinese firm Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results of the use of these sets were unnecessary.
She explained that the reason of the incertainty of results could be an unrealised collection of species or an incorrect use of sets.
The Spanish Minister stated that it had been resolved by the sets that had no results and would replace other sets of the Shenzhen Bioeasy company. 80 per cent of the test sets that Chechya had arrived in China have been wrong. 1,2 million test sets acquired by the Slovakia in China were also recognized.
Prime Minister Matovich proposed to move them to Douana. Athesh Kara, the Ministry of Health of Turkey, claimed that the test sets received in China had a high level of errors, and the Ministry “not used them” was bought in China 3,5 million test sets, but at the beginning of April 2020, it was announced that the inadequacy of these sets were used.
Co-CoV-2, and the monitoring of those patients contacted have been positive.
Researchers who work in the Italian city V, where the first time of Italy died from COVID-19, have held two cycles of testing the whole population of about 3400 people, with an interval about ten days.
A number of people with positive results had no symptoms, and all patients with confirmed diseases were placed on cartanine.
Introduction to the Territory of Population was closed, and this measure had fully stopped the dissemination of infection.
In terms of intensive relief of contacts, restrictions for entrance, testing and cortaninal measures of the Kronevirus of 2020 in Singapore had been much less deployed than in other developed countries, and there was no extensive limits to close restaurants and stores.
Many activities were abolished and the 28 March Singapore began to urge the people to stay home but the school, where the cancers ended the 23th March, were opened.
Some other countries, for example, Iceland and South Korea, have also been conducted with the Pandemics through intensive relevance of contacts, restrictions for entrance, testing and cartonic measures, but have been less aggressive character.
The statistical research showed that in countries where more tests were conducted compared to the number of deaths, the indicators of death have been far below, probably because those countries had been able to discover more patients with weakly expressed symptoms or absence of symptoms.
WHO recommends non-medical resources for the mass testing, as well as national laboratory with limited experience of COVID-19, to send its first five positive and first ten negative analysis results on COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO control laboratory for confirming testing.
7 of these 16 monitoring laboratorys are in Asia, 5 to Europe, 2 to Africa, 1 to North America and 1 to Australia.
The next graph of indicators of column "% positive results" depends on the test policy adopted in the country.
The country in which only hospitalized patients are tested will have a higher positive result in the percentages compared to the country where all citizens are tested, independently from the presence of virus symptoms, other equal circumstances.
The hands, also known as “giving hands”, are the process of cleaning hands to remove pollution, fat, microorganisms or other affective substances.
Regular arms with mixture in certain “Chrytical points” during the day prevented the dissemination of many diseases, such as diagrams and collars translated by physical-oral ways.
A person may also be reproaching diseases such as playp or normal study, for example, if you touch the eyes, naked or rock (that is the skills of skills) hands.
Five critical moments during the day after which the hands should be laid with a mixture: before and after defectation, after the heat of the child or the drugs, before the breathing of the child, and before and after the preparation of food or processing of soil meat, fish and home birds.
If water and swimming is not available, hands can be cleaned by the wheel. The World Health Organization recommends to lay your hands:
Before, at the time and after the preparation of food.
Before and after the procedure, he was a sick person.
Following the change of subsuppourers or the smoothing of the child falling into the tunelet.
After wearing, chalet or ready.
After creating animals, ramps or residues of animal origin.
The Medical Hygiene is related to hyginic actions related to medical procedures.
The hands before receipt medicines or medical procedures are allowed to prevent or minimize the dissemination of diseases.
The main health goal of the hands is to clean the hands of pattogenes (bactrics, viruses or other microorganisms capable of diseases) as well as chemicals that may be damaged or cause some diseases.
This procedure is particularly important for people who are preparing food or work in health, but it is also important for all others.
The hands are very useful for health: for example, it leads to minimum distribution of gangpipe, coronavirus and other infectional diseases, prevents infection diagrams, reduces reproof infection,
and decrease child mortality at home families.
The 2013 study showed that the hands of more quality may lead to small increase in children aged to five years.
In developing countries the indicators of child mortality related to reproaching and diagnostic diseases may be degraded through simple behaviour, such as mixture hands with middle.
This elementary procedure can reduce the mortality level of almost 50 per cent of those diseases.
Regular memories on the benefit of the low hands may reduce the number of cases of diasters about the third, and it will be compared to regions with low water income.
The decrease of the number of cases of diapers may be associated with mixture hands. It is the only effective and uncomfortable way of preventing diagrams and smooth reproaching diseases (WS) in the terms of the development of relevant trainings in each house, schools and other public places worldwide.
Independence, one of the mainly complicated ORI, is the main reason of mortality of children in age to five years, which is about 1.8 million children per year.
From diare and transcription, almost 3,5 million children are perish every year.
The United Nations Children Foundation reports that the mixture of hands with a mixture before the diagram and after the tualty becomes a strong custom may save more lives than any individually acquiring vaccine or medical interruption, and reduce the mortality from the diagrams nearly double and the mortality from astronomic reproof infection – at the fourth.
The hands are usually compared with other sanitarian activities carried out under water supply, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).
The hands also prevent the decrease of an imperium -- which is transferred to direct contact.
The small negative consequence of the frequencies of the hands is that it can lead to the removing of the hair and, despite it, to the damage of it.
The 2012 study showed that the thick hands could lead to the drying of the hair – to the disease known as the eye or the dramate hands, particularly distributed among health workers.
Too frequently, the hands may also be considered one of the symptoms of overseas and composable disorders (OCR).
There are five such “critical points” during the day when the thick hands with a mixture is important to reduce the risk of physical and oral disease transmission: after emptying (mobile exemption, defectation), after the removal of the child (subsists), before the breathing of the child, and before the preparation of food or processing of red flesh, fish or birds.
Some cases where you have to lay your hands in order to prevent the transmission of diseases: before or after processing cuts or wounds, after reading, chalet or mocking, after establishing the waste of animal origin or animals, after reconstruction to the furniture.
In many countries, wearing hands with mixture is quite smallly distributed.
Research, which was conducted in 2015 in 54 countries, showed that in the middle of 38.7 per cent of the middle hands, it was a common practice. The investigation of 2014 showed that the highest rate, 97 per cent, was identified in Saudi Arabia, and the United States in the middle of their 77 per cent, and the lower indicator was set in China – 23 per cent, and there are a number of methods of conduct and developments that we have the arms in critical situations. In developing countries, the group of the schools are one of those methods that help children with such procedures.
“Increased health programme”, implemented by the Ministry of Education of Philippines, is an example of widely important activities to strengthen child health and improve children ' s education.
On the basis of this national programme, the degradation of two times a year and the day-wide hands with mixture and daily cleaning of dents with the factor.
The same programme is successfully conducted in Indonesia.
The elimination of micro-organisms from each cover is more effective if weapon or mixture are added in the process.
The main action of the waves and mixture is to eliminate barriers for the production and improvement of its level.
The water itself is not considered an effective means for cleaning the hair, since fat and white are the components of organic pollution are badly developed in water.
The number of waters, however, contributes to cleaning process.
It may also contain bacteria that can fall on it at the previous use.
A small number of studies affected by each bacteria cover with a polluted pocket of a firm mixture said that the bacteries are smallly likely because they are drunk.
The CCC still claims that “which weight with a hand-driven is a predecessary option for the thick hands.”
The anti-Backterial weapon is actively advertised in communities concerning their health.
There is no evidence today that the use of anti-septics or deficiencies results in electional effects on organisms that have sustainability to antibiotics on their nature.
However, the anti-bacterial weight contains the anti-batterial agents, such as tricleas, which have been sustained by the numerous concentrated organisms.
Thus, even if the thumms sustainable to antibiotics are not elective in terms of anti-bacterial mile, their effectiveness may not be consistent with the advertised.
In addition to the surface-active substances and resources for the protection of the hair, complex connections can contain oxygen (exxus, alicing, molecule) as a regulator of RN, as well as a contra-mixed active benchloride oxide and other hydrocarbons (the faith, the vitamins, the mental, the experts), the complex analysis of the School of Public Health University of the Organism, showed that in the plan of prevention of lower diseases and elimination of bacteria from the hands, the simple diversity of the same, as usually antatic bacterial, contained in the triple.
The smooth water is comfortable for the human kitchen of the temperature is still not enough to kill battery.
The bacteries are more rapidly multiplied in the temperature of the body 37°C.
However, for the elimination of natural lives containing pollution and bacteria, heavy water is more effective than cold.
In contrast to the spread view, scientific research showed that the use of warm water does not affect the decrease of microwealth on the hands.
Desinficienciation of hands (seather) or anti-siptics for hands is a means for dying hands not containing water.
At the end of the 1990s and at the beginning of the 21th century, the popularity for hydrical hands on the base of water not contained (only known as deficienciation funds for petrole, anti-septetic resources for desinfection of hands or sanitary).
Most of these resources are prepared on the basis of an epolytical screen or stain, added to defenders such as carbomer (carbon oxygen) in the geal, or suppliers, such as glucines in a judging or pensional form, which ensure the use of these resources and reducing the effects of the resumption of the hair.
The addendum of the disbursed aquatic transboundary increases the anti-mixed activity, and the deficiencies containing at least 60 to 95 per cent of the carriers are effectively disappearing microworks.
The deficiencies on a petroleum basis are killed by bacteria, including battery with multiple medicines (MRSA and VRE), the tuberculose pillar, and some virus (including HIV, gerpes, RSV, rinovir, vaccine, gaps and hepatics).
The deficits containing 70 per cent of the samples are killing 99.97 per cent of battery (loryfths of 3,5 per cent of 35 decibel) on hands after 30 seconds after application and 99.99 per cent - 99.999 per cent of the battery (lorith reduction 4–5) on 1 minutes after application.
The deficiencies on a petrol basis are practically ineffective against the norovirus virus (or Norwalk) of the type, the most frequent reason of the infectional warranty. We need to use sufficient number of anti-septics or deteriorations to process and investigate the hands of both sides.
The linear and tiny surface of both ladones, and the space between fingerprints over the length of about 30 seconds until heatness, pension or harvest is fully investigated.
The fingers of the fingers on the two hands should also be swimed, and the United States's control and prevention of the disease recommends to be elected in the hands and not in the use of deficiencies, particularly if hands are strongly threatened.
The growth of the popularity of these deficiencies is due to their simple use and fast destruction of micro-organisms, but they should not serve as a replacement for the full hands if there is an opportunity to use water and mixture.
Often use of desincercise resources on a pencil can cause the smoothness of the hair, if their composition does not contain a smooth vessel and (or) owners.
The effect of the removal of the hair can reduce or disappear by adding glucreen and (or) other mixture substances in the composition of vehicles.
In clinical tests, the deficiency funds for hands on a petroleum basis containing the mixture components have caused significantly less anger and sweetness of hairs than milk or anti-mics.
Allergic contact dramatics, contact-sufficient syndrome or hypersensitiveness to the clothes or adds present in desinficiencies are almost not occurred.
The lower probability of the renewing of an irritating contact drimite was a factor for the selection of desincided resources compared with mixture and water.
Despite their effectiveness, resources not containing water are not cleaning hands from organic substances but just desinting them.
For this reason, deficienciering resources for hands are not so effective in preventing the distribution of many patent microorganisms, such as ordinary weapons and waters, since patent microorganisms are still in hand.
The deficiency of the deficiencies for the hands that do not contain the cover is significantly depending on components and composition, and has been significantly lower than the cart or the samples.
Recently, it was proved that the portraits in which the bulletin cholorides have a steadily and cumulative anti-military activity in different ways, which, as proved, have lost the effectiveness after a multi-related use, probably because of the progress made by all bad reactions.
Many people in communities with low income cannot allow themselves to smoke and replace it by smooth or density.
Forest or honey can be more effective than water, but they will always be less effective than milk.
One of the problems with this method is that if micro-related microorganisms, this may have increased diseases.
As a middle, the gold is a desinfic means because the water-containment of the water is smooth.
If weapon is not available, WHO's alternative is recommended to use race or skin.
In order to prevent the crime of the United States disease control, it is recommended that the following steps should be applied to the technicians:
Take your hands under hot or cold water.
The simple water is recommended because waters standing may be polluted, and this is the temperature of water as if it is not meaning.
Help your hands, spread them with a large number of weights, including the similar side of the ladones, and the area between fingers and foots.
Weather delets micros from the hair, and research shows that when weapon (and not only one water) people drew their hands more warm.
Get your hands at least 20 seconds.
The third helps to remove micros from the hair, and more than you're the third hands, more micros are removed.
Take the hands under the sugar water.
The flood of hands in the water of stand may facilitate a repeated punishment.
Take your hands to the cleaner, or give them to exalt yourself.
Mood and powerful hands are easier to be polluted, and most often people leave such areas as the big finger, the pit, the space between fingers and foots.
The artificial feet and feet flows can contain a variety of micro-organisms.
Often it is recommended to be used to prevent the extinction of hands that can cause the damage of the hair and increase the risk of infection.
If a protony water and milk is not available, there are many of the various inevitable ways to lay down the hands: water out of the top of the cancers or bottles with waters produced and (or) use of forests, if it is necessary, for example, in developing countries. In the fields of limited water (e.g., schools or rural areas in developing countries) there are water conservation solutions, such as the swimming powder and other non-country options.
It is the simple building of the emoticons in the skin, and the skin of the powder that should be on the hands of the water; so it should be used to use a hook.
The effective skin of the hands is an integral part of the drug process, but some of the disputes have been the most effective shape of sugars in public tunnels.
The increased research shows that the bulletin is much more hygic acid than the electric swimming for the hands set in many tunnels.
In 2008, the Westminster University in London was studied by the sponsor of the European Scanner for the production of bold salons and pools; the object of this study was a comparable level of hygicity of bummon powders, swimming for swimming swimming with hot air and more modern flows.
It was determined that after wearing and swimming hands, the total number of bacteries in the middle of the fingers has increased by 194 per cent, and the ladonians were 254 per cent.
It was also evident that, after wearing and swimming hands, the total number of bacteries on the pools increased by 42 per cent, and the landows were 15 per cent.
Following the middle and swimming hands, the total number of bacteries in the pools in the middle of the finger is reduced to 76 per cent, and the ladonians also have trialed to determine the possibility of interrupted interruption of several tunic rooms and the middle of the tunalette in each type of swimming.
The smooth-aeroplane that drives the air with declared speeds 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 km/h), has been able to shot microorganisms from the hand and from its own block and it is potentially to hurt other users of the tunnelroom and sanitary in the radio to 2 metres.
The use of swimming swimming swimming hands spreads micro-organisms to 0,25 meters from the sugar.
It was not found in the use of micro-organisms significantly used. In 2005, the TÜV and the environment campaign had studies on the evaluation of various guns methods in 2005.
The following changes are observed in the number of bacteries depending on the wheel method:
There are many different swimming producers, and swimmings are compared to sweet potatoes.
The cleaning of hands with the use of desinifting salfs may become an alternative decision during the journeys in the absence of weapon and water.
The desinficienciation of the petroleum fund must contain less than 60 per cent of the samples.
The medicine method of the hands was to be delayed after the Vengerian doctor Inniz Earthwis discovered its high efficiency (in 1846) in the prevention of diseases in statistical conditions.
There are electronic devices recalling hospital officers the need to lay hands if they forget it.
According to one study, the use of such devices actually helps to reduce the level of exposure.
The hands of the medicine are leaving at least 15 seconds, and there is a large number of mile, water or weight for smoking and opposition for each part of the hand.
The hands should be patiently suffering each other with the sanctuary fingers.
If there's a thickness under the feet, it can be used to remove it.
Since micros can remain in the water present on the hands, it is important to wake them well and to remove our clean pool.
Following the hands, closed the board, and, if necessary, close and open any doors, it should be used to use the bottle.
This allows you to avoid the repeated pollution of hands from these surfaces.
The goal of the hands in the medical institutions is the removal of patent microorganisms (Mikworks) and the prevention of their dissemination.
The magazine of New England Journal of Medicine reports that the roof of hands remains unacceptable in most medical institutions: a large number of doctors and sisters are regularly forgotten hands before attacking patients, and thus disseminating microorganisms.
As a result of a study, the correct hands and other elementary procedures may reduce the level of blood infections related to the use of the catera, 66 per cent. The World Health Organization has published letters with the image of the standard lips and hand process that should be applied in the health sector.
The WHO project on aby hand instruction is also available on its website and open to public discussion.
Whitby was conducted in the co-auditation.
If it is necessary to confirm the compliance of the regulatory requirements, it is possible to measure the hygiene indicators and check the hands of the commercial devices.
The World Health Organization means "Five moments" when the hands are necessary:
After contacting blood or biodiversity,
before use of anti-septic and
After the starting of the patient. Adding anti-septic chemicals to mixed hands (Medician or anti-mics) helps to destroy battery.
Such antibactric properties may be necessary before conducting chirurgic transactions or through high containings of antibiotics sustainable. For cleaning hands before the chirurgic transaction, a corner that can be included and excluded, not relating to his hands; also needs to use a little chlororguksyna or water for the pumping of hands, smooth plates for hands after middle, a threshing-shirt and another steel tool for cleaning foots.
All disappearances must be taken.
This procedure requires hands and prepayments usually within 2 to 6 minutes.
No need to lose your hands too long, for example, 10 minutes.
During the clamp, the water from the preparation should not fall back on the thickness of the hands.
After the end of the winter, the hands of the steel and the chirurgic chalet are clashed.
In order to reduce the spread of micros, better lay your hands or use anti-siptics before and after the outcome of a sick person.
To combat staffocic infections in hospitals, it was determined that the largest benefit from the hands was 20 per cent of mys, and that very few additional benefits were received when the thumb has been increased more than 35 per cent.
Compared with an anti-bathteric mixture, the smoke of the usual weapon is more than the tropic increase of the frequency of bacterial infection diseases transmitted through the food. The comparison of the hands of the prytoxicians with the development and the middle of the anti-batterial mixture, in average 30 seconds to each process, showed that the processing of the hands of the pryto-sufficients declined by 26% in comparison with the anti-batteratic mittle.
However, weapon and water are more effective than the hydrocarbons for the hands, in the decrease of the H1N1 virus of the H1N and the dispute of the Clasterium Difficulty. The hygians development measures in health institutions may include the training of the brain staff, improve the access to the skills for hands, and the written and orthographs of staff on the need to abolish their hands.
Additional studies on the most effective forms of measures in various health institutions are required.
In developing countries, the hands with mixture are recognized by the economic and important means to improve health and even food.
However, the absence of statistical water supply, waves or resources for smoothing hands in houses, schools and workplaces is difficult to bring the customs to the hands regularly.
For example, the majority of African rural areas are not far in each private or public tual, although there are more low ways to organize the middle of hands in such areas.
However, the insufficient hydrogen hands may also be affected by degradants, not by the absence of weapon or water.
Promotion and stimulation of arms with mixture can affect political decisions, enhance awareness of the benefit of hands and long-term changes in the population.
In order to ensure the effectiveness of such measures, the monitoring and evaluation of results needs.
The 70 research analysis was determined that, for improving the situation of hygicity hands in countries with income below the medium-level efficking of the Community-Epidemic Supervision at the level of 70, while the public marketing campaign was less resulting. One example of the promotions for drugs in schools is the approach of the Child Foundation of the United Nations “Three Star Approach”, it promoting the implementing in the schools of simple economic measures to stimulate students, as well as other hygiene requirements.
In ensuring the compliance of minimum standards, schools can increase their levels from one to three stars.
The establishment of managers is one of the possible measures implemented under the information campaigns on dying hands to reduce child disease and child mortality.
The World Law Day (Global Hand Washing Day) is another example of the information campaign aimed at change. The 2019-20th coronaurus pandemics, the United Nations Child Fund, moves the use of the emoticons symbolized by the arms.
In some studies, the total efficiency of hands in developing countries was considered in comparison with the DALYs indicator of the life without disabilities.
However, one study is expected to stimulate the mixing hands with a mixture to be a significantly more economic decision compared to other sanitary measures.
The importance of human health hands, especially for vulnerable categories of people, such as young mothers or pregnant soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the middle of the 19th century two newrors in the hygiene field: Gender doctor Ignaz Semmellight, working in Vienna (Austria), and Florence Nightingale (Florence Nightingale), English, and “Introductive Medicinal Foreigns for patients”.
Most people still believed that infection was caused by nervous shoes called myazms.
The 1980s have been more actively promoting hygiene hygiene hands as important to prevent infection.
In 2009 and the COVID-19 mastership in 2020, people in many countries have become better understanding how important wearing hands with a mixture to protect organism from such infections.
In Germany, for example, along with public tunnels, as well as the tunnels of official buildings and airports have been developed with “truggles of museum techniques. ”
The term “appreciation of the hands” means the demonstration of its desire to take responsibility for any or to be a party.
It comes from the Bible, the Gospel of Matteo: Pontius Pilate “lapped hands ” when decided to be crucified by Jesus Christ; and then this fraction had been more widely used in some English communities.
In the MacBett Pearl, Lady McBabeth begins to lay hands in order to try to cleanse from the impressed penalty that symbolizes uncertain conscience, regarding the crimes that she had committed himself and made her husband to do.
It was also determined that people recalled or observed any nonethetic action had more to lay hands in comparison with others and the hands of them have more important.
Furthermore, less likely that people who have the opportunity to lay their hands after the view will participate in any other “covering” compensatory activities, such as voluntary activities.
In the plots, the hygienic goal, and the symbolic importance of the spirit of water, but without a wave, is a part of the rival in many religions, including the bacalism, Indias, Tevilah, and netilat yadaim in Jewishism, Lavabo in Christianity and Wudhu in Islam. The religions also prescrive hyginic arms, particularly after certain actions.
Industria, judismo and islam are prescribed by the obligation of hands after the visits of Tualeth.
In industrialism, bodeism, synthesis and islamics, the needed hands are considered before and after each acceptance of food.
Control of production factors in relation to COVID-19
COVID-19 control is understood by the application of the working and health security methods for risk control and combating corronium (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk control is depending on the place and the work task, based on risk assessments, serious situations in the community and risk factors for individual employees that may be binding to COVID-19.
The Office of the United States for Labour and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) reported that the posts with the least risk have minimum vocational contacts with public and colleagues, and in such cases they need basic measures to combat infection, including hands, stimulate workers to stay home with acknowledgement, compliance of the representative ethic, and daily disappearance and deficiency.
The median risk needs parts or close contacts with people who have no confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis but have the probability of an offence in the current dissemination of disease in society or during international travel.
Those categories can be related to employers with public contact, such as schools, workers with high integrity of the population and some large different stores.
The risk control measures for such groups, not only the basic infection prevention measures, include high-effective air filters, the use of protections and accessive personal protection resources at the case of contact with the affected COVID-19.
OSHA believes that medical institutions and morgs with a person who has a confirmed diagnosis or suspected COVID-19 are a high risk; thereby the risk is very high in the conduct of such aero-related agents, or the collection/production of human tests with confirmed diagnosis or suspicion on COVID-19.
The risk control measures for such staff include the use of engineering and technical security, such as Ventilation rooms with negative pressure, as well as personal protection resources related to the tasks.
The COVID-19-sufficient may result in different types of impact on the workplace.
Workers can be disabled in the workplace as regards their own disease, the need for other persons or for the fear of any possible offence.
The commercial models can be changed as regards goods that are requested, as well as ways of acquiring such goods (e.g. improving purchases in non-country periods with delivery or service not out of car).
Finally, goods from geographical regions affected by COVID-19 are possible. It can be used in the protection plan for the preparation and implementation of response measures.
The plans are concerned about risks relating to different workplaces and tasks, including sources of warming, the risk factors of homes and communities, as well as the risks of individual employees, such as age and chronic diseases.
The plans also show the means of monitoring necessary to address such risks, as well as extractive activities to situations that can result in epidemics.
Plans for preparing epidemics and responsive measures may be undertaken to recommendations of the national or state level.
Some of the objectives of ensuring response measures relating to epidemic: the reduction of virus among staff, protection of persons undertaken to higher risks of health, business support and the minimumization of negative impacts for other organizations in their delivery chapters.
In response measures, the severity of the disease in the community is where business is.
The risk control is the structure widely used in security and hygiene for the grouping of such resources depending on effectiveness.
In the ability to solve COVID-19 risks, the most effective engineering and technical resources, then administrative measures and finally are personal protection resources.
Ingenie-Technology resources understood the removal of staff from the workplace and are not trusted in the conduct of the employer, which may be the most benefitful economic decisions.
Administrative measures require changes in working policies or procedures required by employer or staff.
Personal protection (PPE) is considered less effectively compared with engineering-tech or administrative measures but can help solve some risks.
All types of personal protection must be selected dependent on the threat to the worker (e.g. representatives) to be used permanently and regularly, to be checked, supported and replaced according to the necessary and correctly abstained, cleaning and retaining or binding in the avoidance of an host.
The Office of the United States for Labour and Industrial Hygiene (OSHA) considers that at least the posts have a minimum contact with the public and its colleagues.
Basic measures to combat epidemics recommended for all workplaces include fresh and severe hands, recommendations for suffering workers to remain home, compliance of the reproaching ethic, including the closure of the hands in the cocket and injury, to ensure the guests and containers, ready to disappeared or changed work, if necessary, recommendations for employees to eliminate other tools and equipment, as well as the daily collection and desinfection of the environment.
It is an critical step to protect employees, customers, visitors and other persons at the workplace.
The United States centres for the fight against diseases and their prevention (CDC) recommended that staff with narrow repressive diseases remain home until the ceiling of the wolf, the absence of increased temperature of body and many other symptoms during less than 24 hours without the use of the sponsory resources or other medicines that have been affected and provides the hypersiveness of the politics on hospital letters, allowing staff to stay home for hospital members and to provide awareness to those politics.
According to the OSHA, a middle level of risk require parts and close contacts to distance not more than six feet (1.8 m) with those with no confirmed data or suspects on COVID-19, but the probability of SARS-CoV-2 in relation to disease in the territory where business is or in recent travels of such persons in the field of distribution of COVID-19.
The growing rates of the population and some major different skills are related to these groups and groups with higher risk, for example, in schools, in the high-level level of the population and some major skills. The ingenie-tech security means for such groups and groups with higher risk are the installation of high-effective air filters, increased importance of the ventilation, the establishment of physical barriers, such as provisional plastic protection screens, and the currency of the clients without the outcome of the vehicle. Adminative measures for such group and group of higher risk include the restructural impact of the petroleums, the meaning of the meaning of the meanings of the meaning and the meaning of the meanings of the petrometers, the meaning of the meaning of the concentration, the meaning of the concentration, the mean value of the impact, the mean value of the impact of the concentration of the concentration of the impact, and mean value of the impact of the impact of the concentration of the concentration of the concentration between­durance of the environment, and the impacting impactive curs of the meaning impact of the concentration betweental impacts of the concentration,
In some cases, employees from such groups may need repairs.
If a person has suffered in the aircraft, the security of workers and other passengers shall be required for measures such as the elimination of a sick person from other persons at the distance of 6 metres, the appointment of any equipatics for a hospital, the delivery of a sickness or treatment to such person with request to cover the nail and the mouth of a sackety at the cockle or injury.
The adult members of Equipah must bear one-time medical initials when close to a hospital or in combination with physiological heavy or potentially affected surfaces and may be additional personal protection, if in a disease, regular chasel or disappearance.
Used primary and other unlike objects should be placed in the biological security mixture, and the damaged surfaces later must be defined and defined. In cases of commercial navigation, including road leathers and other passenger vessels, security measures are delayed in cases of disease, self-detection and immediate information of the health centre on the ship, where there is a race or other symptoms at anywhere on the boat.
In the idea, the medical survey should be held in a disadvantaged chain. In cases of schools and children ' s care institutions, the CCD recommends that the short-term closure for the recruitment or desinfection, if an invalid person was in the house of school, depending on the proliferation of disease in the community.
In the available minimum or medium level of infection in the community, the social distance strategy may be implemented, for example, the removal of exits for personal meetings, meetings and other mass activities, such as the occupation of physics or hot dogs, taking food in the coasts, enhance the distance between the partys, the regulation of time of arrival and income, the restriction of non-satisfactory visits, the use of a separate location of health institutions for children with symptoms.
In significant times of dissemination in the local community, besides social disabilities strategies, a long-term school deployment may be considered. For the law enforcement officers who perform daily responsibilities, a direct risk for health may be considered low, in view of CDC.
The law enforcement officers who have to contact persons with the confirmed diagnosis or suspects on the crime of COVID-19 are recommended to follow the same indications prescribed by the Feldscher of Aid, including the use of appropriate personal protection resources.
When a close contact is reached during detention, the employees should define and define their formal grounds and hypersensitives before repeated use by the use of cleaner airlines or by oppression, respect standard operational procedures to prevent the spread of diseases and stability of the use of personal protection, and the use of clothes.
OSHA believes that some categories of health institutions and marine are high or very high.
High risk officers are subject to medical assistance, support, laboratory staff and medical transport, contact with patients with a confirmed diagnosis or foresee COVID-19.
They have very high risk of an offence during the conduct of the airline educational procedures, or in the collection/processing of people with a confirmed diagnosis or foresee COVID-19 crime.
The airline education procedures include the management, procedures caused by coach, broncocoscope, some statistical procedures and investigations or collection of innovative methods.
High risk workers involve high-risk-related persons who operate the body with a confirmed disease or suspect on COVID-19 in the moment of their death; if such staff are understood, they are very high risk. Additional engineering and technical resources for such groups include the use of buildings for patients with reliable disease or suspicion on COVID-19, including in the conduct of procedures related to airline education.
Some health and health institutions may be used with a special ventilation with negative pressure.
The tests should be met with respect to biological security measures. 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that the progress of patients in deteriorated zones depending on the extension of suspects for COVID-19. In addition to other personal protection resources, OSHA recommends that employers should be used to 6% with patients with a confirmed disease or suspecting SARS-CoV-2 as well as those conducting procedures to enhance air-related education.
In the United States, NOSH retreaters for persons with N95 filter or higher class should be used within a comprehensive written programme for representative protection, which indicates requirements for individual resource collection and medical reviews.
Other representative types can ensure more effective protection and competitiveness for the staff. WHO is not recommended to use the special, since COVID-19 is the disease transmitted by recruitment, not by physical hedicity.
The WHO recommends only to use the chirurgic mass for the staff performing scening at the receipt of patients.
The persons who gathered the images from the discipline in patients from COVID-19 or the carriers of this disease without procedures related to the airline education, WHO recommends that the chirurgic mass, protected eye or protection screen for persons, chalets and primary.
The recorder N95 or FFP2 should be carried out during the training of the airline, instead of the chirurgic mass.
In view of the inadequacy of individual protection in the world, the WHO recommends that the needs of the protection of such resources through the possibility of discretional medicines, physical barriers, such transparent eyes, ensure access to the patient affected by COVID-19, only those who provide direct income only the resources of personal protection required for a specific task that continued to use one and the same remedior, unlikely with a number of patients with single diagnosms, monitoring and coordinating the provision of the personnel protection and reforms for non-complianced persons.

TEMA: [Covid-19] Loan and preparation for future
DAT/ORMATION OF THE PRODUCT: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
CC0: Protected rights are not available
We live in unnecessary circumstances in this month.
COVID-19 is the epidemic of the COVID-19 is the light of the relationship of people around the world and our responsibility towards each other.
There were no presidents of such problems, but we know that the effectiveness of our measures depends on the ability of feeling, cooperation and development of the community throughout the world, which is on the basis of such organization.
We have observed the friends and careful relations between all our colleagues, reflected in the electronic list, calls and chats, a wonderful confirmation of the fact that we are happy to work with a wonderful people.
I am with great gratitude and pride to speak about you as about colleagues.
Last week I reported a high assessment of our work.
I remembered how important the world is to turn to Wikipedia right now, and how useful it is for each person to have access to this key resource.
And this is possible by your work, whether to ensure the work of websites, our colleagues or the protection of the security of the community.
The world needs information from Wikipedia and today is more important than ever before.
At that time, to achieve significant results for the world, it is important not only what we do, but as we do.
With the importance of such missions and your role in this process, we will bring important changes to our joint work starting from the coming week.
Correction of the order of our work and graphs
As the Robine previously said, the 'c-Team' team' team was gathered yesterday to discuss our approach and graphy in the coming days and months.
During the communication, we have considered our ideas of the most effective measures in the current situation and the best ways to ensure sustainability of organization for that period.
The growing majority of us wanted to endeavour and support our long-term mission.
If you want to go away, let it be so.
In general, staff, officers and officers:
Our expectation is needed to work about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week before the post-off.
We will not announce outcoming days: if you can normally work for more hours, it will be allowed for our mission.
Nevertheless, peace is now unpredited; whatever your needs are, whether to be careful of parents, to acquire food products or to be sent to the doctor, your well - acceptance is our priority number.
We don't follow your work time.
If you're sick, you shouldn't work.
It's clear and unfortunate, but we're mentioned about it.
It is not necessary to provide a hospital letter or crash: simply inform your manager and help the review of the calendar and graph of work to ensure the cover of key areas.
(If you have a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, please contact Brian from the T-C Ops unit, so that T-C can help and take attention from the management of your situation).
The amount of time rates will be fully paid.
We have already announced and reaffirmed our intention to comply with the obligations of our subsequents and employees with the timely payment.
Each person will receive payment in accordance with the usual terms applicable to normal circumstances.
This is particularly understood the periods of disease when you can't work.
If you want to work, we'll support you.
Many people use the way to make their efforts around us.
What we do can bring a wonderful result, especially in such times.
And again it's about self-employment.
We ask you to talk to our manager so that we may know what to wait and can correct our actions as appropriate.
Some kinds of work are considered significant.
Such activities we must always support.
The SRE, HR Ops, Trust +Safety and Fundraising commands are critically important for additional support.
We have initiated the process for all units to assess the current goals and to make a focus on supporting that is very important for our mission.
There are many tasks for each of us, and we are just focused on the most significant projects.
The delay today does not mean negative impacts in the future.
We are not planned to work "to more to make the laid up" after the pandemic end.
You don't need to work with the top to keep the unrealised time for the present time.
We recognize the circumstances have changed, and we will work on the decision of new objectives and time as possible.
What's going on with APP (annual plans)?
To establish a new reality and expectation of the daily working time, we intend to correct the period of the implementation of our Year Plan for 2020-2021.
We intend to propose a period of time for our plan for 2019-2020, so providing more time for the formulation of the budget, allowing staff to give priority to the key work, self-sufficient support, and to all those who needs or who wants to work will be a close graph for the next few weeks.
This duration of time allows significantly to reduce the current planning and tension of all organizations.
On the next week, we will submit our proposal to the Council, to report to the representatives and to the teams of active information on the following steps immediately after receiving the relevant confirmation.
Thanks to the APP team for the leading role in such work.
Statute of offices, risks and removals
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues of San Francisco can be defended by the COVID-19 virus.
However, besides many precautionary measures, we took a command on anti-virus saving to define all surfaces in the office of San Francisco.
They used anti-virus decisions of the medical class to define all surfaces and for acquired and lift holes, through which we have access to our camp.
The building shall apply their own rules to keep carefulness using products to ensure the safety of their rentants.
We feel that the office will be good prepared for the period when we decide to come back.
Our office in Colombia (DC) is in the WeWork company network that has been shared with us and all of the staff in DC, its rules related to COVID-19.
Last week, our office in Colombia has fully moved to the removing work in accordance with the indications made in San Francisco.
As we know some of our colleagues from New York, we also discussed the issue of the location apartment in Brooklyn.
Those discussions continue, but they can be rejected.
Some of our colleagues first work removally.
Our old colleagues who work away know about the possibility of correcting the situation and would like to give you some advice:
It is recommended to limit the length of meetings until one hour.
For more long sessions, consider the possibility of disappearing them on a number of days.
Take the objective of the meetings, the agenda and the latest materials for awareness.
Use the default video connections to facilitate interaction and linking, such as Google Docs and Zoom.
In order to provide a coordinator, a person who will address the accession of issues in the chapter and control the list of pipelines, as well as the liability of notes (or joint consideration).
If appropriate garnizage needs, please provide electronic support services.
Use your privileges for Wellness Reimbursement in the winner.
Login to #remotions in Slack to talk to colleagues about the distributed work.
The HR Operations Team studies the management of the websites available to facilitate the effectiveness of the distributed work throughout the organization.
Last week, we requested all guests of the community to cancel the massive activities financed by Wikimedia, such as “editathons” until the WHO is not aware of the finition of the master.
We understand and report that our requests for such removals and other restrictions may impose the impossible to conduct agreed activities on grants, and no one will be detrimented for delays or changes of such objectives.
The next week we will follow actions with additional indications on William and other regional and thematic conferences of the community.
The global survey in the global community is not only a decrease in relation to work, but also some feelings of easy understanding and opportunity to focus on their own communitys, Wikimedia and not only.
With regard to the perspective, the CRT works on a page in Meta-Wiki, which provides space for the community to follow the impact and accommodation.
We remain on issues related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your calendar to the special personnel meeting that will be held on Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT.
This time we use the possibility of further shared information, responding to your questions and holding together time by connecting each other.
We are together in such a situation and are ready to help everyone than you can.
You can continue to receive information from this electronic list and other important information on COVID-19 from the Wiki Office.
CRT will update these pages and all information will be collected in one place.
We also work on supporting regular communications with staff living in countries where the current situation has been significantly implemented.
In the case of travel questions, activities, key work streams, information-making issues or other assistance, please assess CRT.
We are ready to support and to ensure the needed link.
If there are problems relating to confidentiality, please visit from E-mail to Brian Judan (Bryan Judan) – Director HR International Global Operations.
No such changes should be considered as refusal of our work and our obligations.
Quickly, this is the recognition of the current need for the new adaptation of our work and obligation.
We believe that such steps are necessary to support each other and to ensure the opportunity to continue in order to support our movement and the world with the needed service.
Our planned work will be waiting for relevant time.
Today the time is to support each other and to create a space for an important work in the future weeks and may months.
In order to happen, we need help from each of you, and we need you to take care of yourself and your families, as well as to work with a maximum payment as it is just a need.
Now, please, help your hands and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, Tony S), and other teams of Leader Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensiine preventing ферm 2 (ACE2) is a farmer dedicated to an external surface (kleomethogen) cells in light, arteria, heart, pitches and kitchen.
ACE2 is contrary to the activeness of the relevant angiotensian prevention farmer (ACE), reducing the content of angiotensin-II and increased anang (1-7), making its multiprofit decisions for the treatment of heart-substitute diseases. AC2 also serves the point of entry into cell for some corroneрусs.
Human version of the farmer is often mentioned as hACE2.
Angiotensin preventing ферm 2 is a cycle of metallopherment situated on the surface of indonestal and other cells.
ACE2 is contained by the N-finde petrol domain M2 and the S-finced transport domain of the acetonic electricity collector.
ACE2 represents a single metabolic white of type I, and its active domain falls on the surface of light and other tissues.
The extracted domain ACE2 is disappeared from the transmised domain by another farmer known as a jacket, and the produced white is rescued in the blood and is finally equipped with the smoke.
ACE2 presents the majority of organs: ACE2 is assisted to the most of the election electional alveolar clocks of the II-type, the weighting kernel exteriors, the arterial and noble endonetic cells and the smooth arrays of most organs.
The biosynthesis ACE2 and RNC is also found in the core of the main brain, the stomach, the hypotalymy and the creature of the brain.
The main function of ACE2 is to address as ACE opposite.
ACE raises the hormone of angiotensin I in the sovereign angiotensin II.
ACE2, on its basis, detects the carboxil concept of phenylalanin from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolizes it in a gun-distributoral angiotin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 may also disappear a number of other petrols, including [des-Arg9] bradkins, aspirin, neutrotensin, Dinorfin A and Grelin.
ACE2 also regulates the metabolic transporter of neutral ammunicinaslot SLC6A19 and presents in the disease of Hartnapa.
As a transmised white, ACE2 serves the main entrance point of cells for some coronevirus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (radio called SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus COVID-19).
The S1 sleeve associated with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 with the farming house ACE2 on the surface of the cell provides the endocytosis and translation of virus and the farmers in anдоosis located within the cells.
The entrance process also requires the removal of the S black of the TMPRSS2 carrier, the inhibitation of which is currently studied as a potential therapeutical means.
Nevertheless, many professional communities and regulatory bodies are recommended to continue the standard therapy of APF and BRA engineers.
According to the systematic review and meta-analysis issued on 11 July 2012, “the use of AFF inhibitors was related to significant decrease of an 34 per cent of the control group”.
Furthermore, “laughter pressure was also declined to patients receiving APF injuries, which were undertaken to higher risks, suffering to an insufficient, particularly patients with insufficience and heartlessness.
The use of APF inhibitors was also associated with the decrease of mortality from immunity, although the results were less reliable than in patients with a general risk of pitmunity.”
A recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) is a new recombinant ACE2 (rhACE2) in therapy in the smoke of easy damage and, seed, improves easy geodynamics and oxygen seeds with the syndrome of the disability of the lipopolosis syndrome.
rhACE2 was about 10 hours, and the start of action is 30 minutes, except the continual effect in 24 hours.
Some data show that rhACE2 may become a multi-profit instrument for people with non-translated classic gin-angiogenecino system (API) or in diseases that have increased cycling anti-angiotensina II. rhACE2 was assessed in clinical testings in the treatment of the axis disaster repressive dissaster.
The COVID-19 annex represents the programmes for mobile phones designed to assist epidemiological investigation in the conditions of the coronium of 2019 to 2020, which are in the identification of persons (contacts) that could contact the individual in the case.
Some regions have been developed or proposed a number of Annexes to officially supported authorities.
A number of applications was developed to see contact.
This has generated a debate on confidentiality, particularly on the systems based on the geographical location of the users of the annex.
More lacking options in this respect include Bluetooth signals to register the user close to other mobile phones.
Google and Apple reported on 10 April 2020 that they would engage its efforts to integrate such applications directly based on the Bluetooth operational systems in their Android and iOS operational systems.
In China, the Government has been renewed together with Alipay's application that allows citizens to verify whether they have been communicated with COVID-19.
It is used more than 200 Chinese cities. Singapore uses a application named TraceTogether.
The application was developed by local IT-Companys, has a source code and will be transmitted to the Government. The North Macedonia has launched the StopKorona application, which is working on Bluetooth, helping contacts with potentially vulnerable people and a operational connection with health bodies.
The application was developed jointly by the Ministry of Links and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As at 14 April 2020, the recording of Google Play Store and Apple App Store was expected to be recorded in Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government stated that a contact-related application was at the final stage of development and would be available for the deployment during several weeks. The similar applications are planned to start in Ireland and France (StopCovid).
Australia and New Zealand consider the possibility of use of applications based on the Singapore Application TraceTogether and the BlueTrace Protocol. Russia intends to use the application of geoонization functions, which is the aim to follow patients with COVID-19 diagnosis in Moscow.
Ross Andersson, the security professor, the Cambridge University, describes a number of potential practical problems that can address the annexes, including false working and potential uneffectiveness in the use of the application only a small part of the population.
In view of concern to the dissemination of the income income of the “coronavirus” applications, Apple limited the list of types of organizations that could propose their applications related to the corevirus in App Store, including only “official” or other reliable organizations.
Google and Amazon also introduced similar limits.
The participants of the confidentiality campaign expressed concern about the effects of the massacre supervisory of the population through the applications related to the coronaurus; in particular the question of whether the monitoring infrastructure was demonstrated to combat the coronaurus mastery when threat was disappeared.
The International Amnesty Organization and more than 100 other organizations have published a statement calling for a limited overseas.
The Organization has announced eight terms of public projects:
The observation must be “legal, necessary and comprehensive”;
Enhancement of monitoring and monitoring should be conducted by reservations on the limitation of the period of action;
Data use should be limited to the goals of combating COVID-19;
Safety and anonymity of data must be protected and have to be provided evidence of such protection;
The digital observation should be excluded by the disposal of discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties must be defined at the level of legislation;
Protects should be guaranteed from abuse, as well as the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter without Grenzen) (RSF) also published their list of conditions.
Google and Apple propose their joint plan to address the problem of permanent monitoring, which is to remove the relief mechanism from their operational systems, only if it is necessary.
In some countries, there is a net location-detection in places to exclude the need to load the application and to avoid heavyness.
The network relief was approved in Israel.
The network decisions that have access to the source of location are also potentially confidential.
However, not all systems with central servers should have access to staff data on the location; a number of systems have been developed to maintain confidentiality that only use central servers for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a system has been used to disclose contacts which does not use the application as a basis.
Instead of using the special application, the system has collected information on discretion from different sources, including mobile devices and card transactions, and then assembled them to create notifications in the form of text messages that have been able to inform individuals.
The Government did not only use this information to prevent citizens of potential contacts with informated persons, but also made information on the location of a general access to which it was possible because of existing changes in the legislation on the protection of the information provided after the MERS in this country.
Access to such information can be obtained through a number of applications and websites, including Germany, with a view to the possibility of use of both centralized systems and systems that keep confidentiality.
The details on 6 April 2020 have not yet been renewed.
The survey of contacts that remain confidentiality is the concept of the research literature that is given as a minimum of 2013. For more than ten expert groups worked on decisions that guarantee confidentiality, such as the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to register users close to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a product of coordination efforts included as a centralised and decentralized approach, and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized transmission with confidentiality (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, fka Contact Events, CEN), protocols to ensure confidentiality, mobile contacts (PACT) and others.
These protocols are responsible for the identification of personal data never left the device, and all comparisons were made on it.
The Privacy Group, MIT Media Lab is working on the development of SafePaths, platforms that provide confidentiality in collecting and use of location or movement to the COVID-19 distribution.
The work of this platform is based on research contained in the “Apps Gone Rogue” document: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic: how to maintain confidentiality during the epidemic”, published in March 2020. The second similar project is the SafeTrace platform developed by Enigma MPC, the company developed by confidentiality technology, which was also primarily founded by MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses reliable approximate technologies that allow users to exchange confidential data on location and health with other users and officials, without risking the confidentiality of these data.
5 April 2020, groups divided the same approach and similar protocols were based on the global TCN coalition, the aim of which is to reduce the fragmentation and to ensure the global compatibility of applications for detection and advertising, which is the key factor of their wide distribution.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore declared that it was opened the source code of BlueTrace used in the work of its official application.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, a company that controls the work of mobile platforms Android and iOS have announced the contact initiative that, as they stated, will provide confidentiality, and in the basis of which Bluetooth technology combines Low Energy and criteria that allows the confidentiality.
They also published the technical characteristics of the main technologies used in the system.
According to the Apple and Google, the system must be released into three stages:
Deployment of tools allowing Governments to establish official applications to reveal the movement of individuals and to maintain data confidentiality
Integrating this function is directly in iOS and Android, Google and Apple planned to address the problems with permanent monitoring, starting a system by updating the operational system and then remove it in the same way after the disappearing of threats.
Reposition of the medicine (only known to reprofile, renew, changes, or therapy re-reproduction) is the reprofilation of the approved medicines in order to treat disease or medical condition, different from the disease, which is significantly intended in the development.
This is one of the aims of scientific research that is currently used to develop secure and effective COVID-19 treatment methods.
Other research aims include the development of vaccines from COVID-19 and the transmission of the reintegrated plasma. SARS-CoV-2 contains approximately 66 balls affecting medicines, each of which has a number of ligued ligades.
The analysis of these related participants is a approach to the development of an effective anti-virus transport against the COVID-19 balls.
The most important mixture balls for SARS-CoV-2, a similar protease, RNK-Polymerase, helidica, S and ADF-ribosofaptase.
The Hosines AA and the co-auteurs in their vocational research studie studied several candidates that were then optimized and analyzed their surroundings in the structure with the most appreciated claims to accelerate the development of a high-effective portrait against SARS-CoV-2, which would be recommended for clinical research.
Clorrochin is an anti-amaralyric treatment, which is also used in treatment of some air-employment diseases.
18 March, the WHO declared that the chlorochines and its associated hydroxrochines have entered into the number of four patients investigated under the clinical test “Solidarity”.
The New York Gubernator announced that the tests of chlororochine and hydroxrochine would start in New York on 24 March. 28 March FDA allowed the use of hydroxlorochine sulphate and chlorochine phosphate in accordance with the extensive solution for application (EUA).
The treatment scheme was not approved during the clinical test process and was allowed in accordance with the EUA only as an experimental treatment for immediate assistance to hospitalized patients but could not get treatment on clinical tests.
The CDC stated that the use, drug or long-term acceptance of hydroxropochine for prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 was not yet set.
The teachers say they use the patent when there is no other exit.
The Turkish Research Group in Istanbul conducts a small study on the use of chlorochine compared with the cycle and vitamines A, C and D.
Researchs are conducted at the University of Duke and the University of Oxford.
The Medicine School of New York in Langoon studies the security and effectiveness of hydroxicloroxican hydrochnoxicine.
Chinese clinical tests in Ugana and Shanking showed that the Fabric “unique Effectivity” was a specialist.
35 patients in Shanking who accepted the claim were a negative result in average four days, while 45 patients who had not received therapy were 11 days.
In Owen, 240 patients were observed with a summer, a half of which had received a specialist, and the second half is the ammifeener.
The Italian formatic status recalled that the results of the effectiveness of the portrait should not be considered to be final.
On 2 April, Germany announced that for the completion of its stocks it would be purchased in Japan, and for its admission to university hospitals where the patient was used to treat COVID-19, military resources would be used.
As reported by South China Morning Post, Syndzo Abed reported the Trump Administration on the opportunity of purchase of the portrait. The prepatriate may be less effective in the cases laid down.
It may be dangerous for pregnant patients or patients trying to protect.
On the results of a study contained by the combination of anti-virusrapies “lopinauir” and “ritonauir” (Callétra), it was concluded that the effectiveness of the treatment of therapports was not found.
The portraits were developed to reduce HIV reproduction through proteasing.
The group of researchers from the University of Colordo is trying to modify medicines to find connecting to the protease SARS-CoV-2. The scientific community is critical to reprofile medicines that have been developed specially for HIV and HIV treatment.
WHO included the combination of lopinavir and ritonavir in the international test of the Solidarity.
Remindevier was created and developed in Gilead Sciences for the treatment of the virus of Ebola and Marbourg virus infections. Following the Gilead Sciences, he found that the removal had an anti-virus activity in vitro regarding the multi-Filmics, Pamics and Coronavires.
One of the problems related to anti-virus treatment is the development of identity through museums that can lead to more serious diseases and transfers.
Some previous studies show that the genetic bacterian may have a high genetic barrier to the residentity. There are now several clinical tests, including two university clinics, Kelland, one is conducted in patients with dead diseases and the other, in patients with a harder form of their patients.
Three clinical tests are currently conducted for internal visa C, who have been hospitalized with serious COVID-19 forms: two platebo controller studies (China, Canada) and one without the use of platebo (Italy).
On 24 March 2020, New York has started testing Asian antibiotic antibiotics.

Umifeener: Umifeener was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 in accordance with the 7th publication of the Chinese recommendations.
Some antibiotics that were potentially recognized for use as COVID-19 treatment:
Tocilisumab (receptator anti-IL-6): approved in China.
The tests also were tested in Italy and China, see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is the hypertentic vaccine against the coronavirus of 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has occurred clinical tests, many attempts to develop such vaccines continue to be undertaken.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that the vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2 will be able to get previously than 18 months later.
In April, five candidates for the vaccine had been studied by phase I.
The COVID-19 virus was discovered in December 2019.
In 2020, the major impact of this disease has been expanded to the world, which has resulted in significant investments in the development of vaccine and research activities in its connection.
Many organizations to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 use publicational genes.
As stated in April, the key tasks of the CEPI development initiative to vaccine are to ensure the necessary speed, production powers, maximising and global access.
In April, the CEPI scientists reported that, at the beginning of 2020, there were 10 different technical platforms to create effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Some main objectives of platforms included in the security study of phase I:
0 kg oxygen (DNK and RNC) (Capa I stage processing and the vaccination preventor: Moderna, and RNK-1273)
Virus vector (the I stage processer and the vaccinate preventor: CanSino Biologics, anovirus vector type 5)
As reported by the CEPI scientists in April, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of them are used in approved active projects (79 under the Milecan Institute), otherwise 37 vaccines, but there are little information available in the planning or development statistics.
I-II is conducted in preliminary testing on security and immunity, as usually, a pre-determined, controlled, and a number of parts with the one-time definition of more accurate and effective loans.
The phase III of tests usually covers more parties, including the control group; at this stage, the performance of the prevention of diseases is tested and the damage effects in optimism.
From 79 candides in the active development (approved at the beginning of April 2020), 74 still have not been tested on person (all still are on the toklinic research statistics).

10 March 2020 Emergent Biosolutions announced that he had been partners with Newvax Inc.
for the development and production of the vaccine.
Parts also announced the plans for ad clinical tests and climate testing phase I to July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Indian Health Minister stated that they were studying 11 eligible patients, and that even in an accelerated system for the development of the vaccine was needed at least half two years.
12 March 2020, the Mededigo, Quebek, reported that, partly funded by the Canadian Institute of Health Researchs, a part of the co-ronvirus was created.
The Potencial vaccine is conducted in laboratory studies and the testing on people was planned on July or August 2020.
The Guardian reported that the President of the United States of Donald Trump proposed CureVac the larger money amounts for explicit access to the Covid-19 vaccine, against which his protestant expressed the Government of Germany.
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmacist company Pfizer announced the conclusion of partnership with the German BioNTech firm for the joint development of vaccine based on and RNC.

On 19 March 2020, France announced the investment of $4,9 million to the development of the COVID-19 vaccine from the Institute of Pastor, the Thems of Bioscience (Wuan, Australia) and the University of Pittsburg. Common investments of the CEPI in the development of COVID-19 are 29 million dollars.
Other investment partners of the CEPI in the development of vaccines from COVID-19 are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Newvax, Hong Kong, Oxford and Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian officials have declared that scientists started testing six different candidates on the vaccine of animals.
The Imperial College studiers, London, announced the 20 March 2020, that they develop the COVID-19 self-amplicin.
In 14 days after receiving follow-up from China, the vaccination prevention was developed.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced $275 million to finance 96 research projects on medical counterparts against COVID-19, including the development of numerous candidates to vaccine in Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medidgo and the University of Saskachewan.
At the same time, the Canadian Government announced that 192 million canadian dollars were specially designed to develop vaccines against COVID-19, as well as the establishment of a national vaccine bathroom, where several new vaccines could be used in the case of a new coronium spine.
On 2 April 2020, researchers from the University of Petersburg reported the PTTCoVAC testing possible vaccination against COVID-19 to the mouse that “MNA introduced joint vaccines SARS-CoV-2 S1 by investigating strong anti-expert anti-experts [in museum], which appeared within 2 weeks after immunization.”
On 16 April 2020, the Canadian Federal School of the University of Vaterloo announced the development of potential vaccine based on the DNA, which might be exempt in the form of nominal oppression.
With the DNA bacteophags, the human battery will be multiplied and formed immediate virus parts that can stimulate an immune system to develop anti-virus against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, industry and three United States universities assembled IBM supercomputer resources in comparison with local Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have geneological effects, also called intolerable effects.
This means that they may have other benefits, except those properties to prevent diseases.
Another early simulated study in Australia covers 4170 health workers.
The vaccines developed may be in danger or ineffective.
The previous study on the evaluation of the efficiency of animal models for which COVID-19 is characterised, such as ACE2-trainsgenous mouses, other animal labs and lower posts, indicate the need for infection of 3 bio safety in the processing of live virus and international coordination for standardized security procedures.
The vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested on animal models.
In 2020, there are no medicine or vaccine treatment for SARS treatment that would be safe and effective for people.
According to the research work published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of the therapy was priority for Governments and public health institutions throughout the world.
When the MERS began to spread, it was considered that SARS study at that time could become a standard for the development of vaccines and terrorists against the MERS-CoV infection.
As at March 2020, one (based on DNA) was the MERS vaccine, which past the I clinical testing phase on people, and three vaccines, all of which were vaccines on the basis of a virus indicator and were developed in the development process, two-benovirus (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one – MVA-MERS-S).
In social networks, a defence theory has been distributed, claiming that the COVID-19 virus is not over the whole new and that the vaccine already exists.
The publications in social networks cited some patients who claimed the existence of patents on the genetic follow-up of other coroniums, such as the SARS cornevirus, and the vaccination of these sexes.
Coronavirus is a disease identified in 2019 (COVID-19), which is an infectional disease caused by the hard island of the reproaching coronium 2 (SARS-CoV-2) symptom.
The most widespread symptoms include disappearance, chacal and disappearance.
Other symptoms can include the feelings of stability, muscle pain, diaster, pain in the garden, loss of disappearance and pain in animals.
It is usually about five days from the first demonstration of symptoms to the drink of the disease but may also be reduced from two to fourteen days.
The majority of cases is to demonstrate light symptoms, but in some cases, the disease is disastered in virus prensumes and polyorgan inadequateness.
By 17 April 2020, more than 2,24 million cases of abus in 210 countries and regions were registered, more than 153,000 were lost from this disease.
More than 568,000 persons have disappeared, the virus is mainly distributed in close contacts with one another, frequently through microscopic caps that are distributed in the air at the cockle, injury or talking.
Although these caps are formed during the extent, they usually represent threats falling on the earth or on the surface but are not moved through the air to great distances.
People are also angry about polluted surface, and then their eye, nest or wheat.
The virus can live within 72 hours.
It is the most present during the first three days after the appearance of symptoms, although it may be possible before the symptoms and the later stages. The standard method of diagnosis is a polymic reaction with a back transcription in real time (RT-PCP) on the image, which takes place as a grain out of the narrow.
The use of medical mass is recommended to patients with suspicion on disease and those who are after them.
The recommendations for the use of medical mass are different: some states are recommended not to use them, some recommend their use and others need it.
There are no vaccine or special treatment of COVID-19.
Local dissemination was registered in most countries in all six of the WHO regions.
Infected persons may not have symptoms, or have symptoms of the playpa, such as the heat, the chalet, the stability and the clash.
External symptoms include a weak breast, a permanent pain or awareness in the breast, awareness, difficulties of the survivor, injury or speech; if there is a higher reported symptoms, medicine should be immediately addressed.
Really, the symptoms of the diseases of upper disciplines can be observed, such as crystal, naked or pain in the garden.
Also, in different percentages, iron and kiss symptoms are observed, such as tonnette, robust and diare.
Some cases of diseases registered in China have resulted, namely, only by feelings of lowness in the breast and a pleasant heart.
In some cases, sickness can be progressed by enhanced polyorgane disasters, and in the end there is death.
It is called an injury period.
The COVID-19 Innoviation period usually consists of five-six days, but can be reduced from two to 14 days.
In the 97.5% of the people start the symptoms during 11.5 days after an abuse.
The role of such unsymptomized carriers in the transmission of diseases still noticed, but preliminary data show that they can help infection dissemination.
The process of insufficient diseases is not known during the present time, but only being studied; the core centres for control and prevention (KCDC) reported that 20 per cent of all confirmed cases and hospitalizations had been unsimpically identified during the disease.
The National Health Commission of China began to include unsemptable cases from 1 April; from 166 the victims registered in this day, 130 (78%) were rejected insensitive at the moment of testing.
And the monochrot, and the slide can have a great concentration of virus.
In the voice of the air, there is more capal than the normal voice.
The investigation conducted in Singapore showed that the capsule open could be spread to a distance of 4,5 meters (15 metres).
The virus, as usually, was not transferred to airways, but the National Science Academy suggested that the transmission of the bio-related virus was still possible and the testing of air-related air collectors situated in the coredors outside the rooms of the people.
Some medical procedures such as involution and heartly-licentic response (PPL) can lead to the distribution of products and, therefore, to spread virus into the air.
There are also dangers that virus can be spread through the philosoly, however, that risk is low, and the virus is the most contraignant when people have a symptom; the spread of virus may also be spread before symptoms, but the risk is small.
The European Centre for Prevention and Improvement Control (ECDC) claims that as far as a wholely clear virus is spread, yet it is known that one of the diseases usually affects 2 to 3 other persons, and the virus is able to survive from a few hours to a few days.
In particular, it was discovered that the virus was able to live during one day, on the plastic surface (Plypropylene) and on the heating (AISI 304) to three days and 99 per cent of medical surfaces — to 4 hours.
However, these indicators are dependent on property and temperature.
Full and mixture in the right use of their use have a quite useful effect in the fighting fraud: weapon destroys the green-protect of the virus, deactivating it in this way, and may be able to remove it from the surfaces of the bones and other surfaces.
Other plants, such as Benzolkoychlorid and chlorexin gluconid (kirurgic deficiency), less effectively against this virus. During the studies conducted in Hong Kong, the slugs have been brought in average two days after hospitalization.
Five of the six patients the first test showed the highest concentration of virus in blood, and the sixth patients had the highest blood containment was discovered on the second day of testing.
The wide island of the reproaching coroniovirus syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the new hard island of the coronvirus reproprioral syndrome, found in three persons with an invention of the group with island reproaching diseases registered in Uhana.
All the signs of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are also met in the nature of coronavirus.
In the outside of the human body, the virus is destroyed by a flower weapon that covers his protected neck.
Lighte is the body that is the most vulnerable effect of COVID-19 because the virus is through anhyotensina preventing farmer 2 (ACE2) which is most widely distributed in the alveollar cells of the II.
The virus is connected to ACE2 and passed in the farm cell with a characteristic surface process – “cipa” (peparam).
12 per cent of the infected persons in the hospital in Uhana have been diagnosed by the drug of the mixture, which is often meeting a hard form of disease.
Often, heart-sociated symptoms are high because of the system-related response and violations of the immun system observed during the progress of disease, but the reduction of the microcard may also be linked to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 Recipients are in the heart of large numbers, as they are involved in the work of this body.
The high frequency of tromboses (31 per cent) and the generous trimbolembia (25 per cent) was observed in patients in the OIT from COVID-19 and could be witnessed of unrelated prognosis. The COVID-19 otopsy of patients died by diphosose alveollar frequency (DAD) and limphosytoxital infringers in light.
Although SARS-COV-2 has the tropical of the ACE2-expressive epising cells, patients with severe COVID-19 are observed symptoms of system hypersufficiency symptoms.
In particular, it was discovered that the ploted GM-CF T-Ctels were corrected with the recruitment of the IL-6 monocycles and the hard pathology of light patients with COVID-19.
The cover was also discovered by the limphosy infiltrates.
The WHO also published several test protocols on this disease.
The polymemal reaction in real time (DT-PC) is the standard test method.
The test is usually conducted on recruitment screens obtained by a narrow cloth, but may also be used to be a mass of narrow or motors.
The results usually are ready for a number of hours to two days.
They can also take blood analysis, but they need two blood tests covered by interval for two weeks and their results are not directly significant.
Chinese scientists have been able to select the sixth coronium and to publish his genetic follow-up so that scientists in the Laboratory world could self-developed tests by the polymic reaction method for identifying this virus.
As at 4 April 2020, the tests of anti-persons that could find infection at the present time and the fact that the possible damage in the past was in the development stage but have not yet received a wide spread.
The Chinese experience of the test results showed that their accuracy was 60 to 70 per cent.
On 21 March 2020, the Office for the Control of Watchtowers and Medicinal Medicine (FDA) approved the first test for diagnosis at the end of this month. In the indications of the diagnostic hospital of the United States of Hungary University, the methods of identifying infection based on clinical characteristics and epideological risks were identified.
Double multi-played supports for the type of “math steel” of Perifer, asymmetric and apotheric distribution are partly symptoms shown at the previous stage of disease.
Exploitation, the symptom of the bulletin (forward reimbursement with a variable alternative) and consolidation are developed in the progress of disease.
The microscope of the COVID-19 he has few data.
The main results of the pathological research carried out at the closure:
Macroscope: pilgrim, periclorite, abolition and acknowledge of light
You can observe four types of virus gravity:
A simple form of pneumatics: along with light, hypersyplusion of pneummoscies, large ethical hynopsistics, interestistic resistance of limphocycle infinance and the education of multi-gener hygientic clusters
The hard form of petroleum: the diaphose aluminium damage (DAD) with the diphosis alveolar extract.
DAD is the cause of the island reproaching dissolution (ORDS) and the hard hypoximy.
Related pennamps: the organization of the exempts in alveolar police and the League Inter-Intellectual Physis.
Blood: Diphosis Inter-Subsistic decline (DVS-sidron); Leco-Agency Reaction
Preventionary measures to reduce the possibility of offence include homes, disappearance of human places, often mixture hands and water during less than 20 seconds, respect the rules of disgusting hygiene, and avoiding constraints to eye, narrow or gun hands.
The CDC recommends to open the mouths and the bottle of the sackcloth in the chain or in the kitchen, or, if there is no salbs, open the mouth and beam of the inner side of the milk of the hands.
It is recommended that the quality of hygienic proceedings for hands should be conducted.
The CCDC ' s control and prevention of disease recommends to be used in the public, particularly in order to restrict the transmission of infection by persons with unsensitive diseases. The social disability strategy is aimed to reduce contacts with major people ' s groups; the school and enterprise have been closed, limited to movement of nationals and renewed major public activities.
Recommendations on detection also understood that people should be at least 6 feet (1.8 m) each other.
There is no confirmation of COVID-19 efficiency. Since the completion of the vaccine is expected not previously 2021, the main part of measures against the distribution of COVID-19 is declined to the decrease of the epidemic known as “pays”.
The CDC also recommends that wears hands with mixture and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after visits of tunate, or with strong pollution of hands, and before food and after smoking, chalet or kitchen.
The CDC is also recommended to use the defining deficiencies (containment of the carrier — less than 60 per cent) of the hand processing, but only when weight and water is not available, and the regions where such desinifting resources are sold, the WHO provides two receptores for local production.
These components are used by stainless or propanol containing anti-microbic activity.
The hydrocarbon is used to solve battery disputes in the middle and is not an appropriate means for the anti-septic processing.
The glyceral is added as a owner.
The patients showed supporting therapy, which can include infusion therapy, oxygen support and support other vital bodies.
The CDC recommends those who suspect that the virus is infected by the usual medical mass.
The extra-corporate membranation (EECM) was used to address the issue of disappointment uncertainty, but its benefits are still studied.
In order to strengthen immunity, the compliance of personal hygiene, healthy life and diathe is recommended.
The supporting therapy methods may be shown to patients with an easy symptomic at early stages. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for patients who had been hospitalized with COVID-19.
In the United States, the doctors of intensive therapy and pulmonologists have discussed therapy recommendations of different resource institutions — IBCC.
There was no special treatment for COVID-19 at April 2020.
For the treatment of symptoms as a primary line, some medical workers recommend the choice of paracetalo (acetomnofen) in comparison with ibuffin.
In the implementation of procedures that may happen air-couple emissions, such as incommunation or brain sake, the precaution should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transfer, particularly in medical institutions.
The CDC recommends that the medicine employees who have been listed for people from COVID-19, to place in the air-co-co-co-active driver (AIIR) — additional measures, notably standard contact and air precaution measures.
Recommended individual protection resources: protected chalet, recruiter or medical mass, eye protection and medical primary. Of the above resources, more precisely use therapeutics and not medical mass.
The N95 recorders were approved for the use of industrial conditions, but FDA allowed the use of these recorders in accordance with the extreme solution for use (EUA).
They are designed to protect from part in the air, such as powder, but not by the use of the efficiency in the field of protection against the special biological agent.
If medical mass is not available, CDC recommends to use protected personal screens or, at least, to produce the mass in home conditions.
In most cases, COVID-19 shapes are inadequate to require the artificial ventilation of light or alternatives, but there is a percentage of cases when necessary.
The type of recruitment support for hospitalized patients with dissatisfactory related to COVID-19 is currently studied, and there are some evidence that intuition can be avoided by the use of a narrow hydrocarbon with intensive air stream or a two-year positive pressure in discrepanciation routes.
Uncognized if there is any of these two ways for patients in critical state as effective as IHL.
Some doctors choose the invasive mechanical ventilation of lights if it is available, since this method is significantly limited to the spread of parts in the air compared to a narrow canal with intensive air stream, and the risk of a grave form of disease for elderly people (these who are aged 60, and especially those older 80 years) far above.
In many developed countries there are no hospital cokes on the soul of the population, and resources for health systems are too limited to rare growth in cases of COVID-19 damage in difficult forms of hospitalization.
Following a study conducted in China, 5 per cent of patients were hospitalized in intensive therapy office, 2,3 per cent needed mechanical support for easy ventilations and 1,4 per cent.
In China approximately 30 per cent of COVID-19 hospitalized persons are finally involving.
The duty of arts of easy ventilation is complicated because the neighbourhood of the synthesis (ARDS), developed at COVID-19, and the assessment is still more problems.
The HIV, with support of the pressure and the CDP, is required for the maximum oxygen quantity of easy and for the minimum reduction of the ventilation, which can be developed by the Pneemotorx.
In the previous models, high-PDDH could not be available.
Research of potential treatment methods started in January 2020, and at this time there are several climate tests at the moment.
The most prospective is remedial.
The development of new medicines may be extended to 2021, but some of the therapies have already been approved for other purposes or have been found at the latest stages.
Pro-virus portraits can be tested on patients with hard forms of disease.
Volunteers recommended that FDA should take part in the testing of the potential treatment methods and provide timely solution to the use of a comprehensive plateis as an experimental treatment when human life threatens serious or direct danger.
Its use was not undertaken by clinical studies that should be conducted to prove security and effective treatment methods.
In February 2020, China provided a mobile application for combating disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number for the login.
The application may find a “profit contact” through monitoring data and, therefore, to determine the potential risk of an offence.
Each user may also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is discovered, the annex is not only recommended to self-issuing, but also sends the notification to local health bodies. The analysis of the larger data collected with mobile phones, personal recognition technologies, telephones and artificial intelligents are used to assess individuals and persons with which they contacted in South Korea, Thai and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Government of Israel had allowed the security bodies to disclose the data of the mobile phones that were preferably depressed by the coronium.
It was taken measures to ensure cortanine and protection for persons who could enter into contact with the informed citizens.
In March 2020, the Federal State Institute of Germany and the Roberta Coha has also provided information on the place of hundred indigenous persons.
In Russia, individual recognition technologies were introduced in the Russia to identify breathtakings.
The regional health-care complementary of Italian Julio Gallera said that the centurial network operators report that “40 per cent of people are still moved on the territory”.
The Government of Germany has conducted the 48-time programmement maratron, with more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kerste Calulaid, also called for creative decisions against the spread of the coronaurus.
People may try to stress in terms of carniture, restraints, damage effects of treatment or fear of infection.
BBC quotes the words of Rory O'Konnora: “Asseted Social Isolation, Unity, Health, Stress and Economic Oversight — ideal conditions to affect psychic health and well-being of people”.
The disease may be easy with uncertain or absence symptoms recalling other diseases of high-disciplinary paths, such as normal study.
The patients with a easy form of disease are usually enhanced in two weeks while the treatment of patients with hard or critical forms may need from three to six weeks.
Women may be higher risk of receiving hard COVID-19, based on other viruses such as SARS and MERS, although there is no COVID-19 data.
In persons with the most heavy disease of COVID-19, it can rapidly be progressed in the neighbourhood of the reproacher disaster (ARDS), which causes discipline, septic chain or polyorgan inability.
The COVID-19 summary includes the seminary, anonymbolization, and the problems of heart, noise and jealousy.
The trimbodial analysis, particularly increased protrombian time, was described in 6 per cent of patients who were in the hospital from COVID-19, while 4 per cent of the group was observed.
Approximately 20 to 30 per cent of patients from COVID-19 are increased by the bundy farmers (trainsanasis).
According to the same report, the average time between symptoms and death was 10 days, of which five patients were in hospitalization.
However, the average time between hospitalization and death in patients transferred to intensive therapy has been seven days.
According to the study of cases of disease at the early stage, the average time from the demonstration of initial symptoms until the day of death was 14 days with full range from six to 41 days.
According to research by China National Health Commission (NHC) was 2.8 per cent of men and 1.7 per cent of women.
The hysopathological studies of the death of light species have shown the diphossic alveollar restraints with cell fibrimoxyid extracts in both lights.
In the pitmosts, virus cycle changes had been observed.
The outer species of the easy recruitment of the island of Sister (ORDS).
In 11.8 per cent of the death registered by the National Health Commission of China, the heart-related problems was to increase the level of the tropopone or the ceiling of heart.
According to the data provided by the United States in March, 89 per cent of hospitalized patients had previous health problems, and access to health resources and social and economic situation in the region could also affect mortality.
The estimates of mortality dependent on the situation are dependent on such regional differences, as well as on methodological difficulties.
Inadequately effective account of cases in an easy form may lead to the rising level of mortality.
Nevertheless, the fact that death is due to the result of the diseases caused in the past may mean that the current level of mortality is inadequate.
The COVID-19 smoke symptoms were most frequently developed at 1,4 times, and these patients often needed intensive therapy or died in comparison with non-cuts.
The administration of one of the Hong Kong clinics discovered that some patients who were healthy from this disease have reduced the amount of lightly 20 to 30 per cent and their scanning had discovered damages.
After healing, it may also lead to the “Intensive Therapy” syndrome.
In March 2020, it was unknown whether an immunity resisted from the virus of patients had been made against him.
The Court of Other Coronavirus was considered to be positive, but also reported on cases when the COVID-19 tests were still positive.
It seems that there was a severe situation during the disease, not a reply of an offence.
It seems that virus is natural, animal origin and is infectional disease.
The fact that the virus was not known, but to December 2019, the spread of infection was almost completely accused of her transfer from humans.
Research of the first 41 cases of COVID-19 confirmed in January 2020 in The Lancet is called the first date of the first disease.
According to the official data published by the WHO, this date was 8 December 2019.
A number of methods is usually used for the quantity of mortality.
All figures are dependent on the region and the period of the distribution of disease, they also affect testing, quality of health systems used by treatment, time since the starting of disease and population options, such as age, sex and general health status.
At the end of 2019, the WHO had caused the disease of the code of non-interest assistance on MKB-10: U07.1 for the death of the saRS-CoV-2 and U07.2 for the death of clinically or epidemiological diagnosed COVID-19 without the revealing of the SaRS-CoV-2 deaths and accidents, the number of deaths of diagnosed cases in the period of time.
According to the Statistics University of Johns Hopkins, the global number of deaths and accidents of victims is 6,9 per cent (153 822/2 240 191).
This figure is dependent on the region, some other methods include the definition of the mortality rate in the result of the disease (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed patients concluded by disease, and the definition of the mortality rate as a result of the translated infection (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected patients (as diagnosed and undividuated cases) that have been concluded in the result of the disease.
These statistics are not linked to a specific time and reflected the indicators of a certain population from the time of an offence to the end of disease.
Despite the fact that the anti-persons are not all patients transferred infection, they can understand how many people were informed.
In Italy, Castaron d'Adda, a small village with 4600 people, 80 people, (1.7 per cent) is not already living.
In the town of the Gospel of disease, young people were disappeared in the feast and not all cases of death from COVID-19 could be officially classified as such.
In addition, Germany has not been overloaded.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3 per cent of the population may have anti-persons from donor blood indicators.
COVID-19 — Official reason for 69 deaths (0.004 per cent of the population).
The elimination of domination and the level of mortality different for men and women.
According to research conducted in China and Italy, the level of mortality above men.
The largest risk group is men aged over 50 years; disasters in men and women are only 90 years old.
In China, 2.8 per cent of men and 1.7 per cent of women was 2.8 per cent.
The following reasons of this disappearance are unknown but may be a genetic and conductive factors.
Gender immunological differences, smaller speed of fuming among men (e.g. hypertaining men in younger age) may be a higher cause for men's mortality.
In Europe, 57 per cent of men were organized, and 72 per cent of the death of COVID-19 were men.
As at April 2020, the United States Government does not conduct gender statistics on COVID-19.
Science studies showed that virus diseases such as Ebola, HIV, Hup and ORIV have different gender statistics.
Most health workers, especially medical personnel, are women, respectively, have more chances.
On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization announced the official name of this disease - COVID-19.
Head of the WHO, Mr. Tedros Adánn Geberisus, explains: "CO" means "corone", "VI", "virus", "D" – "sackness" and "disease", 19 – when the first time was found: 31 December 2019.
This name was chosen to avoid transfers to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), the species of animals or groups of people, as required by international nomination recommendations for the prevention of gravity. The virus, which is called COVID-19, is a crucial coronviral recruitment syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In public communications, WHO is further using the COVID-19 virus and the virus responsible for COVID-19.
And the disease and the virus are usually called “coronavirus”.
During the initial spring in Ugana, China, virus and disease usually called the Coronavirus and the Audical Coronavirus.
In January 2020, in accordance with the recommendations of 2015 on the use of geographical places in names of disease and virus, the WHO recommended to use the terms of “respective disease 2019-nCov” and “2019-nCoV” as temporary names of virus and disease.
Official names were published on 11 February 2020 – “COVID-19” and “SARS-CoV-2”.
Since the limits of standard chains, some digital services producers are printing medical materials, such as customs to take census from the narrow, as well as IHL apparates details.
In one of these cases, the Italian climate was urgently needed in a ventilation clamp, and the supplier could not add it to the necessary time, then one of the local productions was reprofiled and had been able to print the necessary 100 keys at night.
Following the first expansion of COVID-19, the Internet has become high speed to spread the various terms of the reservation, desinformation and physical information concerning virus origin, levels, preventions, treatment and other aspects.
It is likely that people may hurt the virus of other animals.
The results of research have not confirmed the spread of virus among sugars, stocks and cipples.
There is no valid vaccine from virus or medicine for his treatment.
At present, government organizations, academic groups and sector researchers are conducted by various international studies of vaccine and medicines from COVID-19.
In March, the SOLIDARITY Trial SOLIDY (SOLIDARITY trial testing), which is the aim of assess the effective effect of four existing connections that have been considered most effectively today.
The Hto vaccine is not yet present, but various organizations are actively developed to the vaccine.
As SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 is in human cells using ACE2 Receptor, the results of previous research conducted by SARS-CoV are used in scientific developments.
There are three vaccination strategys.
First, researchers are trying to create a bironic vaccine.
The use of such virus, whether an inactive or dead form, is aimed at calling the rapid immunity response to the new COVID-19 infection.
The second strategy, the creation of a joint vaccine, aimed at establishing a vaccine that increases the sense of an immun system to a certain virus unit.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such studies are designed to disappear S-sip-visual white, which helps virus to proceed to the ACE2 farmer.
Third strategy is the development of the vaccine based on hydroxics (DNA or RNC-waccines, the new method of creating vaccine).
Experimental vaccines developed under any of these policies should be checked on security and efficiency. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical test of the vaccine on four volunteers has started.
The vaccine contains a direct genetic code copied from virus that causes disease. Anti-social rehabilitation was defined as one of the potential problems in developing a vaccine from SARS-COV-2, but this proposal has a dispute character.
By April 2020, more than 300 active clinical tests have been conducted.
The portraits approved for malaria treatment were assessed during seven tests, four of these studies were of hydroxicloroxixin or chloroxin.
Reprofiling anti-virus preventions is a major part of Chinese research, and at the end of April, nine studies were carried out by the III phase on the medicine.
As at April 2020, the dynamic review of the clinical development of the vaccine and candidats for the treatment of COVID-19 was carried out in the same purpose. A number of other existing anti-virus treatments for the treatment of COVID-19, including rhedivesir, chlorochin and hydroxlorochines, lopinavir / ritonauir, as well as lopinavir / ritonauire in accordance with the interferon beta.
At March 2020, preliminary data on the effectiveness of the remedial use are included.
The climate improvement has been observed in patients receiving medicines as exception.
The phase III of the clinical tests have already been held in the United States, China and Italy. The application of the Clorochines previously used for malaria treatment was reviewed in China in February 2020 and had previous results.
However, there is need for expert research assessment.
Core health organizations and China recommend the use of chorochines.
The UK Institute recommends that the soft thickness in one gram, but it notes that the duplication of this decree is very dangerous and could lead to a agency.
28 March 2020, FDA authorized hydroxlorochine and chlorochine to consider medical patients from COVID-19. In the Chinese publications, the interferon, fisheries or amphinner also indicated as resources against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that the high fishery cells required for the invasion of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazossanid was recommended for detailed study in life by demonstrating the destruction of SARS-CoV-2 in low concentrations. Researchs showed that, for the processing of SARS-CoV-2, the ACE2 receptor was required to acquire the transmittered proteasis system 2 (TMPRSS2).
Clorochin and hydrochlorids with acidomycin or without it have serious restrictions that do not allow medical community to use these methods of treatment without more detailed study, and Ozelamivir does not destroy SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and its role in COVID-19 treatment is invalid.
Hypercytoknics may result as a complication in later stages of a hard COVID-19 form.
There are reaffirms of the fact that hydroxicolorokins could be hypersittic properties and that a small study conducted by the National Health Commission of China was included in the recommendations for the treatment of the coroniovirus.
The first stage of unwanted test that is carried out at the national level in Italy after the positive results of its use in patients with a severe form of disease.
Compared with the phertin’s sanitation analysis, it is designed to resist those factors that have been caused death in some patients.
In 2017, FDA was approved antagonist of the Interlakin-6 receptor based on retrospective thematic studies for the treatment of the syndrome of the liberation of steroid flood cytoxicans issued by another reason of the CAR-CAR therapy.
There are no early-displayed and control evidence that toxizumab is an effective means of treatment of the syndrome of liberation of civilians.
Transmission of clean and concentrated anti-concentration anti-related patients produced by COVID-19, people who need to be currently considered as an inactive passenger immunization method.
This strategy has been tried in the treatment of patients from SARS, but its results were not convinced.
The non-traliation of virus is an expected effect with which the passive anti-virus therapy can protect SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms, such as the anti-clothic cycle and/or fagocytose, may be used.
Other forms of passive anti-viral therapy, for example, with the use of monochical anti-produced anti-anthrops, are on the development stages.
It may be increased by the use of the re-consolidated blood sequence, which consists of a close part of the blood of healthy patients and contains anti-virus.
Coronaviral diseases, syndrome group with high similarity
Li Venezuela, a doctor of the Oakana Central Clinic, who later deployed and died from COVID-19 after he reported the virus.
