Triumph of the right peoples in Austria, 29 percent in total
According to the preliminary results, the previous parliamentary elections in Austria have made a significant deployment of both parties with the current coalition of the current coalition, as well as the notorial strengthening of the population parties.
The Austrian People Party (EVP), where the position of the active President Wilhelm Molterer was seriously threatened, suffered particularly important losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the future of Austria (BZZZ), the Governor Carinthie Jörg Haider, prepare a triomphal on the political scene at national level.
According to the preliminary results, the Socialists (SPAU) remained 29.8 percent of the votes, the first political force of the country, however, compared with the 2006 elections, lost 5,5 percent of the votes.
The EVP, which was 25.6 percent lost near nine percent of the voices, was still worse.
It is worse results of the two large parts of the following war, including the popular party, which has explained the previous elections, the result is literally catastrophic.
At the beginning of July, when the EVP left the coalition, the popular party had a significant progress on the SPU.
However, the elections made them visiblely punishment to have left the government to be grounded.
From the first reactions towards the results, specializations concerning the possible release of the Chief of the Party and the current Vice-Seacher Wilhelm Molter were declared.
The observers believe that this could happen since Monday, in the extraordinary Council of the Party's direction.
This would facilitate the way towards the extension of the election result that remains the most likely, namely the renewing of the large SPU and EVP coalition.
Nevertheless, in view of the strengthening of the two human parties of the right - free (FPAU) would have obtained 18 percent and BZÜ one percent of the voices - socialists expressed the fear of a repair of 1999, when the popular party agreed with the peoples (the FPU was still unified in 2005) on a common government, which is even sanctions from the European Union.
Haider, which has already stated that he was ready to cooperate with any party and that he had proposed the return to Vienna, on the national political scene, apparently put on this evolution.
The last party to have access to the parliament as the Verts, but they have slightly lost and retained, among the Austrian political parties, from the third in the fifth position.
Of course, no other party has the limit of four percent and not access to the parliament.
Blackenberg: Relations with India are likely to refresh
If the problem of the Czech researchers in India was not able to address the problem of the accused Czech investigators, it would continue, according to the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Karel Blackenberg, a certain refreshment of the Czech Relations.
The Minister explains it today in New York, after having met his homologgue India Pranab Mukherjee.
"If the problem was not resolved, then yes, a certain refreshment would happen," he noted after the meeting, carried out at a Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said that executive power could difficultly intervene in judicial matters.
However, he pointed out that in the case of Petr Úvácha, which was laid down from the accusation and punishment of a amendment, the Central Government could negotiate with the local government of Darjeling, the case under the jurisdiction of that person.
"Your problem could be resolved," said the minister.
According to Mukherjee, the best solution for Emil Kučera, condemned to three years of prison, would be calling to a higher instance.
It could therefore request liberation and wait for the trial in liberality, as explicitly.
Blackenberg confirms that his partner is expressed in the same sense also during the talkings.
"He advises to call for a high court, after what he might be grateful," said the Chief Chair of the diplomacy.
The only way in which the Czech can intervene in this case is to provide the convicts "A competent legal support", referred to in the India Minister.
He also said that such a help was already provided from India.
"We want to keep everything with India the best relations, which have a tradition continued over many years.
The Indians also recognize it," indicate Blackenberg.
At the same time, as he said to 周TK, he emphasized its partner that the Czech Republic had given much importance to the problem of the Czech enthusiasms.
"We consider the incarceration and accusation of these Czech researchers as a great frustration," said he.
The Minister issues the question whether he has obtained from India the promise to take care of the matter.
"I've already got enough much promises," he just revealed.
A Czech arbits the fight for the sea fund
It is close to an electronic card, on which Australia has been represented and the adjacent marine areas.
But it is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the ocean blue.
"The island belongs to Australia, as well as the sea fund.
This area is even large as the continent itself," said the Italian jurisdict Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of the team of the thirty members of the United Nations division for the Ocean Affairs and the Law of Sea.
His Chief, the Director of the Division, the Tschech jurisdict Václav Mikulka, follows the presentation and the full time.
The burner to work and enthusiasm characterizes the dominant atmosphere.
The sea fund hides a little known world until now, rich in natural resources.
There can be petrole, mines and other mineral resources, but also living bodies for the immediate unknown, which may contain the key for the development of a medicine against cancer.
A larger fund than the ground closer
The Lithuanian States have started our days to explore the new submarines.
According to a United Nations Convention, they serve their rights and agreed in 1982 to Montego Bay in Jamaica.
This is especially the area of the continental self, which is often extended to a number of hundreds of kilometres from the coast of the country.
This should, according to the Convention, provide exclusively all resources of the continental self.
"To simplify, it is considered as continental the part of the sea fund and its subsole, which is a natural length of continent under the sea.
It is extended beyond the limits of the Lithuanian Sea, often over two hundreds of thousands of sea, representing the exclusive economic yon", explains Mikulka.
The request that the country concerned presents to the Commission for the establishment of the Continental Café, should be supported by a widely wide scientific and technical documentation based on a large cost-based perspective and metric.
It is the result of several years of preparatory work.
" One of our roles is to give the Commission a legal and scientific and technical assistance.
To date, the Commission took five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
For the moment it has not been aware of the success that the three recent countries mentioned," added Mikulka.
Australia's success, which is the first to extend its under-marines owners, has recently known a global retention.
New Zealand also gained the territory - the extension of the marine fund, which has assigned the Commission last week, corresponds to 1,6 million square kilometres, which represents the extension of the country multiplied by six.
The two countries have invested millions of dollars in the perspectives.
The benefit they will go to the future of the marine fund operation will be, as they are designed.
In progress, other countries will submit their request at their tour.
They can do it within a period of ten years after ratified the "Monego Bay Convention".
There, where the continental self ends, starts the ocean foundation, proclaimed by the "Common Patrimony of humanity".
There no State plays a exclusive position there.
Extraction right in this area is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
"Nevertheless, don't we stumble there, the sea fund is not a Klondike," he said, exaggering the Director Mikulka, expressing that "these areas are exactly clearly defined and their regimes entered into a contract."
Cheques in the Pacific
A part of the marine Fund today also belongs to the Czech Republic.
She shares it with other States of the former block of the East countries in the framework of the Joint Interceanmetal Organization.
In 1991, in accordance with the Convention, as well as investors of some other States, the status of the person called a pionnier investor.
She has the right to extract in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean, situated between Mexico, the Hawaï and the Kiribati.
The planned area by the investor is slightly exceeding the surface of the former Tschecoslovakia.
The foundation is moved, it's a kind of sub-marriage of the Tastras.
"It is possible to extrace on a extended surface with a total surface of 75,000 square kilometres.
The area represents a rich jacket in polymetallic conceits containing nickel, kitchen, cobalt and manganese," includes Ind Pakshi Rajan, another jurisdiction.
Rober Sandev, a Macedonian employee of the division, provides an example of such a consequence.
She remembers a small landscape, or well, with a little imagination, the mythical shoem, who, according to the lection, encouraged the Golem.
The German special forces were on place for the liberation of housings.
The Egyptian Government asked for Germany's assistance for the Otage crisis - experts came.
When the situation has become serious, special units were ready but never passed to action.
More details on the circumstances of liberation of our European tourists entered in Egypt are revealed.
According to the indications of the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Defence, the German Special Forces also participated in directly in salvation operation.
Thus, as specialists of the Federal Army, as officials of the GSG 9, the federal police office and the Federal Office of Criminal Police, as well as experts in logistics of the Technical Hilfwerk were on the place of release.
As the ministry of the ministry of the ministry, the German forces were finally not required, the prisoners who released their prisoners and have escaped when they recognized the imminentness of liberation by force.
The Egyptian Government would accept the aid offered by Germany to integrate it on the basis of support force.
"There isn't unfortunately coming until there," said a Federal Interior-Parliament Minister.
Aggressioners had taken the group of five Germans, five Italians, a red, and eight Egyptian fellows.
Following them to the wilderness in the south of Egypt, the otages were transferred into the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Tchad.
The identity of eye prenses is left until now, as well as the details of release or possible ransom payments.
Those who have been saved have arrived with healthy and besides the Caire.
Steinmeier said that the hosts were protected by Germany's Ambassade.
He has not declared anything on the details of release.
In Berlin, no information has been given on the date of return to Germany.
According to the "Picture" magazine, the five vacants and special forces should have been deployed by a air bus from the air army and arrived in Tuesday.
The Chamber of Representatives of the United States refuses the saving plan
The first United States Congress room has decreased the financial saving plan of lower $700 billion.
The Dow Jones was degringling in the island.
With 227 votes against 206, the United States Chamber rejected the Government ' s saving plan for financial markets.
Despite all calls by the President of the United States George W. Bush and political men in the head of the two parties, the programme that had to play the chaos of financial markets did not obtain the majority.
In a dramatic manager, the parties had desperately tried to convive the opposers of the good based on this hard plan of $700 billion.
Barney Frank, one of the Democratic Representatives during the debate, had called deputy representatives to a well-being vote that the plan was impopulated.
"There is difficult to have political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened," he conceived.
During the vote, Dow Jones was lower of more than 6 per cent or 600 points.
The reason was the concern of the investors that the state saving plan could overcome.
It is a little time before the end of the vote, and then after the announcement of the echo, it will again be hurry.
The experts are now developing new serious turbulences on international financial markets.
In order to enter into force the program, the approval and the room of Deputy and Senate are necessary.
Organists report a growing number of reservations
This should be a good hiver for German travel agencies:
Reservations for the next months according to a study, the number of cases has highlighted in comparison with the previous year - for the hiver season, even more than 30 percent.
Despite the weak conjonctural perspectives, the driving soil of Germans remains insufficient according to this study.
With regard to the reservations for the hiver season, the travel agencies recorded a number of cases more than 31 per cent compared to the previous period, as it was trusted in Berlin Monday the German Federation of the Vegas Agency (DRV).
According to the investigation of the GfK Mariti Research Institute, the growing numbers of reserves are already managed by the autumn months.
Thus, the sales number would have shot more than 11 per cent in comparison with 2007, trusted DRV.
The sources of these results are the numbers of the GfK, which annually analyses the booking data of 1200 travel agents and makes estimates for the global market.
The travel reservations carried out since the end of August 2008 would be registered.
As a result of the low rate of the dollars, the travels to the United States would be particularly requested, it would declare DRV.
There, the increase of reservations would be raising around an animal.
On the other hand, Spain, Turkey and Greece would be particularly searched by the Germans.
The specially organized travels are very requested, explained the President of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of the increased energy prices and food products, the costs would be "for easier calculable for the customer than for a individual travel."
Consumers can economicize money among others with the reductions of previous reservations or All Included offers, explained Laepple.
The months of age have also been very retained, although an increase in sales figures will be recorded again in comparison to the previous year - although in another study, the number of Germans who have undertaken a travel has been lowered in comparison with the previous year.
My first time at the Beast's feast
Ballermann's hits or Apres-Ski continued, from the beverage in the litter's skin and celebration in tyrolyn costums to design.
An event at the drink feast.
Suzanne Kronzucker and I, we don't actually have a big-chose in common.
She is blocking, television animator and brings a tired tyrolian cost on measure.
I've got the hair, I'm a student, and my roof is a chance.
But one thing takes us: at least three minutes at the Beer's feast, and already photographs throw on us and fill their memory card - very flat, and this is my first visit at the Beer's feast.
So we're doing friends.
The costume of the good market seems to achieve its goal.
As a tourist of the Beer festival and normally lived in the north of the ecu of the Whitewurst, my feelings of well-being in the traditional costume was until now limited.
But once on the place Thèse, all is less worse.
Everyone or almost takes a tyrolyn costume or kitchen screen; nobody has a black air or darkened — it's completely normal.
Only the table of my tyrolien costume recognizes a few cracks of weird eggs at the stand of the banans-choco.
A bavariant makes me notice that I would missed my table: "To the left, he wants to say free, in the middle of youth, right, at the back of the widow."
Discretely, I tripat my back bottle to the left.
"It's better," she said to me.
Others do not be so bad for these technical flower substels and bring simple fires, on which it is written "Too drunk to be dressed!" and we express their nucleous backtrain without being invited.
The young man at the exhibitionist attitude called Bob, comes from England and comes for the first at the Beer's feast.
He finds this "good," with a "oooo" allonged.
He tells me all this after he was emphasized by the hape that he had done before.
Directly next to this burning mouth that everyone thinks to be a poubelle.
Bob is therefore one of those "while painters" tristely famous.
Others do not have the opportunity to escape the alcohol in this way.
At eight hours of the evening, the rescue of helpers run on the place of the feast and have to take care of poor buffets.
The sicknesses are in place - always by four, they're driving their clothing burden with tendens.
This is so functioning for most of the visitors of the Beer party: we're empty, we're getting full of it.
Those who are resting in the scene of the bottle are not visible.
"They are those who can't appreciate nothing more," cried one of the helpers in answer to my question and then disappear in the mood.
Independent rate identified by the police
A 63-year-old pith, died in hospital after heated by a vehicle, was identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chemsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the event of Friday after sud, in town, on Shenfield Road.
She was transferred to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but then died there.
Following the accident, a 51-year-old was arrested because suspicion of dangerous behaviour.
He has been released since, under precaution.
Turkey extends its diplomatic horizons.
Although Turkey was not thinking to join the European Union, the European forces had tried to enter into its back-pays.
On the coat is the Bosphore, to 20 steps in Asia, there may be one of the most ends of his imperial ambition.
The Hidarpasha garage was designed in a neo-reissance style, by two German architects, Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu.
That's at least what the leaders tell us.
The monument is cavaled at the base of platforms, wages of observation to each of its Englishs, such as some German provincial masters.
The stones are sold.
The whole building is desolate.
But once inside the balance, we have no doubt about the size of the company, which represents a transition to the west.
In August 1908, a German association was inaugurated by an Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, retaining to the game of imperalism, wished to realize its Mediterranean domination ambitions through the railway that comes to Damascus, Bagdad and the most known land in the name of Saudi Arabia.
But the German impaired ambitions have been evolved during the 1st World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
The island on its region's surfaces, generated by the green borders of the Froide War, is completed.
The Britishs and the forces of the Implementation have also arrived with Egypt and have pushed the towers and their German allegeds outside Palestinian and Syria.
But there were also bad news for Hyderpasha race.
In 1917, a train of explosive munitions destroying its sub-style.
Turkish sources say that this is a sabotage.
Since, she fell slowly in destruction, entered into the mechaners of the story.
But today, the railway transition to Anatolia and all the orientated points, at least symbolically, to emphasize the expanding of the diplomatic horizons in Turkey.
The AKP party of Justice and Development has created a new foreign policy for the country.
The Isolement on its region in the Foreigns, generated by the green borders of the Froide War
Now it's a new commitment policy.
The Turkish Government has noticed relations with Israel and Syria, the Palestinian fractions of Hamas and Fatah, Iran and Iraq, and certainly certainly with the European Union and the United States.
To judge the parameters of this new foreign policy, I was embraced on a wagon-lit directed to the Turkish capital, Ankara, to visit MP AKP Turc Suât Kiniklioglu, one of the experts in foreign policy.
The next morning, after a journey of 10 hours and half, shocked on brushing railways whose cardence remembered the old world of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I finally arrived in the Turkish capital presented as a new city of a new secular state, turning the dose to his German past.
But the AKP with its well-known islamist racines, represents an example of change in Turkish consensus.
He soups the West, particularly in Washington.
A taxi joined me to the AKP General, a modern structure, explicitly built in stones and axes, in a development area, which was encountered by a half-building commercial centres and by a lot of pastures in which the midddle managers in coast-kravate and men and women are meeting for early business.
The Kiniklioglu Suat could be a right-right centre policy of any other party in Europe.
Costume, kit, and he's even a Black Berry.
"The goal of this foreign policy is to reintegrate Turkey now in its immediate neighbourhood.
The frod war was an ambition," he said.
Turkey was cut off from his back country.
Now she must look at the eastern and west at the same time.
It wasn't the one and the other.
She had to do both.
"But this is that at a certain time," I asked if "The Turkey shouldn't choose?".
"The Turkey," said he, "not wants to choose between the two."
He then emphasized a aspect that almost all with whom I could speak, replied me by heart: Turkish iron path is not only going to the Middle East but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, therefore, as a benefit for Europe and the United States as well as Turkey itself.
With the integration of Turkey, the message seems to disappear an Europe traveling metabolicly on the rails toward Asia and the Middle East.
Return to the Hidarpasha season, after another night without sleep, I returned to these two Germans, Mr Ritter and Mr Conu, who followed the construction of this building there are 100 years.
They would have been surprised to see that European ambitions in the Middle East could, in large part, be found in Turkey's hands.
While I was waiting for the terminal, the ferry to pass through Bosphore, I remembered the period in which Turkey was named "the sickness of Europe".
At least there is no doubt about the continent that could prevail that fascinating country.
Meisters of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown wrote: Musical Director at Guildford since 1962, Vermon "Tod" Handley (december 11th September) was responsible for Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and Choir.
As already gone from his musical project for the city, he founded the next year, the crowd of young people, Proteus.
The crowd should include less than 21 years, but before Proteus could not sing his last song in 1979, many of us who had more than 20 years, refused to leave the crowd.
The name "Proteus" (which changed in form according to mythology) represented the will and ability of the crowd to manage any kind of music to be madrigal or Messian.
The musical versatility produced by a such young cold was often impressionant, always exciting, and this is through the inspiration of one man, and its enthusiasm for music, which remains constantly at the end of the years.
Remember how much death we had rehearned to "leave the music speaking for her itself."
He would say, "The composer knows what he wants"
Everything's in the music.
So sing!"
His bagage technique was absolutely clear, precise, even though never dictatoral or apparence.
Something is the musical standard, he was higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If a leader had to be called a horse, it's good Vernon Handley.
I well known him during the decades of 1962 to 1982, when he led the Philharmonic Guildford.
The last 40 years, I've revealed more than one hundred of his concerts, and I can be honor to say that no one of them has never disappeared me, and, sometimes, they have even inspired me.
Handley's death had so rarely this combination of personal size and moderation.
He denied the conductors who, according to him, "not focus on some persons."
He'll lose many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
Your necrology of William Woodruff (deceived on 25 September) said that "in 1946, he re-earned its studies in economic history in Oxford and became a member of Houblon-Norma research, while he made a BSc, a MA and a PhD".
This is what is written by the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953, he was a professor in economic history at the University of Nottingham, and then ended a PhD thèse on the British Plastic Industrie, under supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers; then published in 1958 under the title of The British Rubber Industry.
In the 50 and 51 years, he studied the Houblon Norman, and the age of 1952, the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham for Illinois.
The reason for which Woodruff has chosen to dissume this part of its past remains unknown.

"I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino " Flamenco and life " because his photographs in black and white, a documentary style, are fantastic.
They focused on the fact of their simplicity and strength that they transmit, and because they always treat protagonists with a lot of respect.
An exhibition that translates many feelings.

Second seat for Honda's super sales
In November, Honda will begin the marketing of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If his predecessor had already a good room, this new monovolum has a further example of internal space.
A number of raffined mechanicals, which increase the comfort of behaviour and make it possible to economicise more.
An evolution faces a revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although the new Honda Jazz is very similar to the previous model, the changes introduced in this monovolume are many.
Among them there is a new design, a new platform, larger sizes and new motors.
However, before considering the new model, this new Honda Jazz has been six years after the launching of the first generation market.
Firstly, it is noted that Honda has renewed this model in a shorter time than the other manufacturers.
Although in Europe, Honda Jazz is less known, this model is a sale phenomenon on other markets.
This is the case of Japan, where Honda Jazz was the most commercialized car in 2002 and also in 2008.
Precisely in Japan, nearly a million of Honda Jazz were sold since his launch.
The Old Continent, with more or less than one million car sold in six years, represents the second place.
However, Honda claims that this new Jazz will allow him to increase its sales in Europe.
In 2007, while the Japanese brand was marketed 83.000 Honda Jazz in 2009, it was thinking to sell $100,000, which would represent a 17% growth of sales on the European market.
On the Spanish market, Honda was marketed 8.000 Jazz since 2002, which represents 6.7% of Honda sales in Spain.
The responsibility of Spanish filial hopes to sell 2.000 Jazz in a year.
This is precisely the exit of the new Jazz, which will allow Honda to largely harvest sales in Spain.
Indeed, the trade officers hope to end the year with a sale of 22.000 cars is to say 4.000 cars less than in 2007, or a decrease of 16% sales.
With this increase of sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain, reaching a market share of 1,8 per cent, reporting to 1,6 per cent last year.
The Japanese brand also hopes to obtain a 2% market share in 2010.
Honda hopes to get this market piece when the new model goes out.
This is Insight, a hybride by five gates and a compact size - 4,37 metres long - on which the nippone company hopes to market about 200,000 cars every year.
In accordance with the markets and in accordance with the estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the insight sales will be made to the United States, while the other remaining half will be divided between the Vieux Container and Japan.
Insight's trade launch is planned during the first three months of the next year, after submission to the public in January in Valencia.
As regards the first generation, the new Jazz increases its sizes.
His length reaches 3,90 meters (5 centimeters in more), its width of 1,69 meters (two centimeters in more) and the distance between its axes is 2.50 meters, which represents an increase of five centimeters.
In addition, the height does not change up to 1.52 metres.
The dimensions are also increased and the internal space.
This gain, on the one side, was required to introduce a new platform and, on the other, to the introduction of a seasons reserve in a central position, also adopted solution for Honda Jazz.
In the same way, the capabilities of coffee - which has a double fund system – can contain up to 399 litres, 19 litres of capacity in more than the cover of the first generation.
It must be reported that these sizes are the version with a engine 1.4L, as the capability of the Honda Jazz 1.2L is 379 litres.
The other innovation - in addition to outdoor elements such as back fires or panoramic tube - is improving access to back places.
The doors that give access to the back seats have an opening corner of 80 degrees, part of the back doors of the first Jazz, which had a 67 degrees.
The engines are also new on this second generation of Jazz.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model will be equipped with two inventories of 1,2 and 1.4 litres.
The two motors have an i-VTEC technology that reduces the seasons consumption and CO2 emission, which makes the most powerful motor and increases the engine system.
The first engine 1,2 litres develops a power of 90 horses to 6.000 tr/min and 114 Nm of couple to 4.900 tr/min.
This propulsor - which was on the previous Jazz at 78 horses - presents a extinction consumption of 5,3 liters at 100 km and CO2 emissions.
With regard to the previous propulseur, which on the previous generation was 83 horses, now reached 100 horses.
This Honda Jazz 1.4L of 100 horses has a combined consumption of 5,4 litres at 100 km and CO2 emissions of 128 grams.
"Abeille food" which prevents collections
In order to develop technologies for prevention of accidents, Nissan has inspired, this time, from the nature, in particular the bishops.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, as a result of the flight of the beefs, prevents accidents.
It is called Bio-Mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, and represents the first steps to collections prevent technologies.
Ingenieurs of the Centre Technical Advanced by Nissan Motor Co. In collaboration with the Centre for Sciences and Technology Advanced from the Tokyo University in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, the Director-General for Public Relations for the Technology and Research and Development of the Market Management, the BR23C represents the introduction of the Nissan Security Builder.
This robot will allow vehicles from the brand to prevent collections.
During its flight, each abeille created its own personal space of an oil form that seems much to the Nissan Security Builder.
But the most important are the eyes of the abeille, capable of seeing in an angle of more than 300 degrees and in all directions, which allows him to fly without interruption within his own personal space.
In order to recover this visual function, the engineers put on the point what the Laser Localisator is called (Laser Range Finder).
It detects the barriers in a distance of two metres and 180 degrees, calculates the distance to this object and sends a signal to the microprocessor immediately to avoid the object.
"When he detects a barrier, the small robot will follow the movements of an abeille and immediately will change direction by moving its 90 degrees or more to avoid the collection.
The largest difference in respect of any other existing system is that evasion manager is totally instinctive.
If this was the case, the robot would not be able to react fast enough to avoid the obstacles ", explains Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Movement Laboratory and main engineering of this project.
In contrast to an abeille, the robot can be turned up to top or downward or diagonal; it can be moving only in two dimensions and according to what his wheels allow him and not in infinite directions like abeilles.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, but also acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot could avoid barriers.
"Each second of this device shall only treat information and act according to these data.
It does not need to keep information and intuitive logics of pre-operative managers, so it can continue to work with only a few tens of memory KB.
This can surround, but we don't talk about giga-octets, nor even of megaoctets."
This represents the first result of development of new immediate collection technologies, a technology that will be introduced into series cars in a ten years following Nissan.
The robot walks with lithium-polymer battery, which are lighter and longer than the lithium-ions batteries.
The other possible application of this technology to the future could be the adaptation of this device on a satellite GPS navigation system to lead the driver to its destination by avoiding road obstacles.
They fear to be hypothesed
We must recognize that the U.S. Treasury, besides the fact that we have a lot of liquid to make plans, is not deprived of gentlemen.
The crisis, and to avoid that the Americans fly into hypothetics at the solvibility banks, they created a game to learn to do not fail: 'Back Credit Hotel'.
It's say 'l'Hotel of Bad Credits' ... or history.
The luxury aspect of this accommodation and specially from the Hotel Master leads us to think about if it is a good time to ask for a ready.
And, especially where to do it.
It's sure that this game gives useful information but little detailed.
It's more a adolescent game.
What if the game ends?
Because a dreamroom appears within the hotel.
It's better than nothing, because it's impossible to buy a house
Morgan Stanley opens its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the entry to its Metsubishi Finance Group (MUFG), the first bank of Japan, which will deploy nine billion to take 21% of its capital, a new welcome by a strong decline of its Bourse course.
One week after the outcome of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of the ordinary Morgan Stanley costs at $25.25 or a total amount of three billion dollars.
The lower price is lower than 19% of the accounting value of the title value at 31 August.
MUFG will invest six billion additional dollars in the acquisition of conversional titles, provided for a 10% performance of $31.25 conversion prices.

After MUFG's investment, Morgan Stanley should show a solution ratio of animal One approximately 15%, one of the best sectors.
Morgan expressed that he had "nightly" aligned its balance since the end of August.
The last weeks were tested for the group, which had seen his half-term Busse course, while the insurance costs against a standard risk of debt was flood.
This cost refluxed Monday but remained at a high level, about 12 per cent.

Letters - The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes the lacks and occupates this electoral campaign.
That's better.
But a sector of our cultural life remains always forgotten.
Who will rise to denial the amounts of miserableness that are granted to small museums, archives, archeological flags or national historical places that result in hunger?
What politics will it remind the Federal Government that he refuses his monuments and heritage buildings?
What about Quebec, as in Canada, we do not have true laws to keep our ownership effectively?
Do you know that the French government will devote three million euros to restore the only castle of China in the Loire Valley?
In our neighbors, it is written in the Constitution of their country that the protection of heritage is part of the culture of the Americans and that this heritage must be protected by all citizens, all the electors and all government departments, and that in concertation.
In Quebec, the History Federation of Québec, at least 40,000 well-beings gathered in 211 stories, landscapes, archives and genealogy, are concerned about closing the history, keeping with three under private currencies of archives and keeping archeological clothes.
These are often the dogs of our heritage, who protest with the power of disappearance when promoters and decisions lay their bulldoers against our old stones and our cemetery forgotten.
When, a tribe for history and heritage?
The Benelux Governments nationalize a part of the Fortis Bank
The Benelux states are assisting the Belgian bank, as the first European banking institutions in the disappearance situation, following the blackness of the neck effect of the credit market crisis in the United States, partly nationalising. The three countries support a sum of 11.2 billion euros, this financial institution and insurance that also possesss interests in Hungary.
This weekend, the Belgian, Luxembourg and Holland governments agreed, at the highest level, in this case, by calling for the European Central Bank and the European Commission's competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the framework of the international financial crisis which has been simplified for more than one year, is for the Fortis bank. For one point of view, decisions that will be taken in the case of this bank will be previously served.
In accordance with the decision taken in the Sunday night, the three states will be acquired by half ( 49%) of the bank capital in each of the countries.
The bank will, uncertainly, sell a part of its participations, between which, firstly, the activities, mainly insurance, has acquired the last year of the Hollandese Authority ABN Amro.
Last week, the Fortis actions started a spectrum. In the second half of the week, serious crisis signs have already been revealed at the bank.
The analysis agree that by its 85.000 employees, the bank is too large to leave her to the fatality.
On Friday, the company's actions shot up by 12 percent to reach its lower level of 14 years ago.
Since January, actions have been thrown up more than two thirds of their value.
In view of the current value of actions, the total value of the group's capital turns around 14 billion euros, which, according to the leaders of the society, is not realistic.
The company's direction appeals the uncertainty of out-Atlantic, in line with the adoption of the US Saving Plan of $700 billion, to be originating the struggle of Fortis Actions.
Lundi, the papers have already benefited from a light increase.
Friday, Philp Dierckx was appointed to the bank head, as a new Director-General.
The financial body also was looking for private acquirers, but has not yet received a proposal on the fund.
Previously, the Belgian government announced that investors should not be concerned, but they would not lose their money.
No panick was found in the bank client cycle and no agency has been taken immediately.
In Hungary, Fortis poses independent agencies and has also earned leasing companies.
A rand in the poulaler
In America, health insurance and enterprises are often refused to sign a insurance contract with a candidate on the basis of information on their medicine purchases.
Information protection experts fear that the data market is not controlable.
"There are data protection programmes related to the use of information on medicine requirements, in any case, in the agreement of the person concerned.
This kind of program must be found between independent hands, otherwise it will be confided to his pool to a relaxation" - recalled Richard Dicket, the program Creator used to manage medicine requirements in Washington Post.
The insurance companys depende on the insurance premium and capital assured in the case of damage, the state of the customer's health that is present and if they feel that the risk is too large, they are not even providing it.
In the past, they sent candidates to a medical review, and they did not sign the insurance contract with them only after having taken the results.
Since ten years, Dick has found a much less damage procedure: from an identification number, it is easily providing data on the acquisition of person's medicines in the eighteen months. In this regard, the program itself decides, of which disease the person suffers and what is the health status.
For example, if this person regularly purchases strong doses of choleral reductor, it refers to a extremely high fat rate in the blood, which makes it soon in a higher category of risk.
A number of versions of this program are in circulation. Some are also defining a risk coefficient, so there is no great thing to do to the survey from the paper. However, minor problems can still appear.
For example, some mixtures may be used against migration or warming bottles, but may also be effective against depression.
This is considered by the surrenders as a huge risk factor, while others, not.
Societies have been developed in the research and analysis of the data. They must request the authorisation to the patient before collecting information necessary to the pharmacie.
In addition, they are contrary to the authorities, even though they have not been sanctified for their lack in the past.
Since a few years, some companies are also treating the results of laboratory analysis and relating to the data relating to medicine consumption, so they are able to provide a more precise portrait of the status of patients’ health.
More and more companies have access to data, and the use control is parallelly more difficult.
There is a different law on the protection of medical data, but his action field is only extended to practicants and insurance.
The Congress is currently before the Congress.
Dick Richard recognizes that this is not enough and that is why he has developed more before his program, which would constitute the transmission of data to the exclusive agreement of the person concerned.
It is another question to know if the person concerned is really free to grant its agreement or not, as it refuses, the insurances do not sign a insurance contract with it.
Thus and finally, the pools depend on the welfare of the refrigerator.
The Marsil global menu
The European Union and India have multiplied both trade trade.
Since the European Union and India are very important trade partners for each other, this topic also dominates the agenda of the ninth summit, in addition to the other problems, mostly globally.
Today, there will also be a Summit France-Inde where it will be an important question of nuclear energy cooperation.
The European Union recognized that India is an emerging democratic power to which it should be given a larger word right in international affairs, but Member States have not yet been able to agree on their support to New Delhi for its candidate as a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.
They were not too attracted on this issue, yesterday, at this 9th Summit organized in Marseille.
The French President, Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as the current President of the Union, as the President of the Commission José Manuel Barroso, and the Chief of diplomacy, Javier Solana, welcomed the Prime Minister India, Manmohan Singh, with which they had falled in agreement in five years, would have increased by two trade trade exchanges, which means an increase of a good hundred billion euros.
Bearing in mind that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods has passed from 25 billion to 55 billion, this appears not to be a too ambitious goal.
In this sense, they have harmonized legally the 26 bilateral conventions with India on civil flights. In this way, air exchange can also take their experts to the future.
India would like to sign a free trade agreement with the Union after the end of 2009.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate negotiations.
The goal is to balance the situation on one side, the India who is the first trade partner of the EU, and otherwise, New Delhi, which is only the ninth place between EU partners.
The Summit focused on global affairs.
The situation of Afghan and Pakistan has been strongly condemned, and all forms of terrorism, and the emergency of holding a United Nations conference on this subject has been made.
The completion of the Doha trade cycle was also asked, although both had a large part in the current scene.
The EU confirmed that it remains faithful in the energy and climate programme, including that it would like to reduce at least 20% of its toxic material waste until 2020.
Inde was also agreed on this point, as well as with the fact that a global market should be passed at the conference on the next year, and reduce the emission of serre gas effects from 50 per cent to 2050.
They also like to prevent the increase of food goods prices and supported the convocation of a international working meeting to consider the financial crisis.
The Indian State Chief is today in the French capital where, in a bilateral meeting, it is prepared to sign a peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that French companies will receive orders for a value of 20 billion euros for the construction of Indian atomic reactors.
According to the press office information, the agreement would be 15 years old.

He found Steve Fossett airport, the billion was disappeared a year ago.
The aircraft of Steve Fosset was found on 3 September 2007 when he fled on the wilderness of Nevada.
The cracks were found on a 3000 meters of height, in the Sierra Nevada de Mammonth Lakes area, the border between California and Nevada.
Nevertheless, there is no human rest within the air.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, discovered the doubts that remained: "The airport was localized, we sent a team, and now we have confirmed that it's a good thing on which Steve Fosset was traveling on the day where he lost" he said at a press conference.
The Sheriff therefore indicated that no other human remaining has been found or found on the air or in the streets.
In February, the billion of 63 years was deceived .
The American Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) noted that a series of hours after the reproach of the epave, an investigator team sent to the places, identified the device: Bellanca 8kcab, disappeared on 3 September 2007, when the Folot was disappeared from Yerington in Nevada for a flight of three hours.
Here, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fosset have been found by a couple in the area of Mammoth Lakes’s room.
It is two documents on the name of Fosset, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, the species of money and a box.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billion was gained a place in the story through a long series of records.
At the sixth attempt, he became in 2002, the first man to complement the world tour on a aircraft balloon: two weeks of aircraft.
Three years later, he had made the world tour in a aircraft and without escape.
Among all these records, also that has flown to 15,445 meters of height, on the Andes, but with a copolet.
Glk, the publicity you don't wait.
A 4x4 out of a original and well-defined design, on the marked lines, on the surfaces and net corners.
This is, in synthesis, Glk, the last birth of the "compact" offs of the star house, with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a new wind in this sector.
Just by its contents outside standards, unexpected and non-conventional communication will be the launching of the 4x4 Glk, available in Mercedes-Benz showroom from 17 October next.
The public bathroom that will be accompanied by the start of the new car will give place to an inadequate communication modality through a future 3D display campaign, used for the first time in Italy by a car brand.
A maxi display project, entriesed in three different phases, which will manage the heart of the milandais shopping, Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first stage of this new type of communication provides the presentation of the car in stereoscopic visious, and through special lunchs distributed to Corso Como, it will be possible to see the new 4x4 in almost real and tridimensional size.
Indeed, it will be the impression that, looking at the image, the car sorts of the appearance.
Then, through the use of innovative Technology remove8, the new Glk will be lighted according to spots, in all its details, then added to a unique image.
It is obvious that, with this publication, Mercedes is trying to introduce something again in the stéréotype area of motor communication.
Will it resume with this formula to sustain the interest of futures achieved? We will see well.
Here are the Italian Hooligans.
The Triveneto, they risk the Derpo.
But who are these 150-200 young guys and girls whose Italy has now hont? They're going to the group" Utras Italy" who followed the Italian national team for years, which, until now, never had created great problems.
He never was hungry with opposite tips.
The extraction of the group is right.
Promotors come from Triveneto.
From Vréon, Padou, Trieste, and Udine.
In Sofia, small groups (really) were added from Campania and Poppes.
They had three-color drapeaux on which their city of origin was: Saturday night, they were all taken to not be identified.
They inspire English tifosis.
In Bulgaria, they found a real nazist tifour of the Levski.
The Figc had provided Italian tips, 144 bills for the part: all nominatives, and therefore easily controlable.
And the Viminal had actually all controlled: among those who were left to Sofia, no one had a Derpo on the course, no one had been prohibited to frequenciate a stage.
Four Italian tiffs who had antagonists of the Crime Crime, had no right to the bill, and they couldn't move.
Now, the Viminal is expected to read the acts that will come from the Bulgarian police and will then take measures: in this case, it may be that the prosecutors arrested or identified in disorders purified a Derpo for at least five years .
A International Discount that prohibites the Italian, but also European stages.
Until, our hooligans willn't take foot in the stage.
Good luck.
But now it's time of emulation: it's that others are risking to add to the ones of fifty first.
"We must evaporate this fire immediately, and not legitimate that is like this", supports the Viminal.
So, "Give your eyes well open, especially in view of the match of the national mercredi team at Lecce"
In the Puglias there is actually a small backing of Utras Italian supporters.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meeting, on Tuesday, the Casms, who can even account on a section of the Asylum, is to say secret services, which are just concerned with stage problems.
"The Hooks Duce-Duce, and the arm holded during Mameli's himne? In Bulgaria, it is not a crime"
This is the opinion (expressed in a way not pleasant) from Domenico Mazzilli, the Director of the Viminal Observatory (He took the position of Francesco Tagliente and then from Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli was previously prefixed in Trieste where an Ultras Group supporter was founded in 2002.
It is true, as says Mazilli, that, in Bulgaria, Mussolini is not a crime, but it is certain that the behaviour of these 150-200 certificates has been confused.
"I am not a sociologue - add No. 1 of the Observatory - crimes must be admitted in the Netherlands where it happens.
Today, this group was left in the rules, now we will see what happened and we will assess for the future.
But let's also talk about Mameli's hymne: these are not the crimes, but if you allow me, they are not police..."
