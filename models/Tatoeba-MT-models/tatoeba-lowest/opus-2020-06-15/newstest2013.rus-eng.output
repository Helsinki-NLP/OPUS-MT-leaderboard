Republical Strategy for Resistance to the Reelection of Obama
Deputy leaders justifyed their policies to combat philosophy in elections.
However, in the Centre of Brendan, the last mith stated that the cases of specialization for the elections in the United States are more than the death of prayer.
In addition, the lawyers of the Republics were read only 300 cases of elektrical specialization in the United States for ten years.
On the other hand, these new trends will have a negative impact on the view of the electoral.
In this mean, such actions are partly discriminating the system of American democracy.
In other cases from Canada, federal elections are responsible for the organization of the United States.
For this reason, most States Governments from 2009 adopt laws that compact the registration or vote process.
This appearance was received new times after elections in November 2010, which brought to the Republics 675 new places in 26 States.
Since one 2011, 180 draft laws restricting the right of vote in 41 State were adopted.
New election laws require the elector to proclaim the personality of the photograph and evidence of the available of the American nationality.
Furthermore, these laws reduce the period of anticipate vote, impose the right to registration of the elector on the day of complaint and take the right of vote to citizens who have justice.
Until 2006, no American State had to grant the electoral to approve the personality of the photograph.
India became the first state, which introduced such requirements.
The United States Supreme Court confirmed the constitution of the law adopted in India.
Republican authorities have sought to extend this practice and to other States.
During the past two years, they initiated law-projects that are obligation to assure the personality of the photography in 34 States.
It is important to note that, in different cases from Quebek, American citizens have no universal reliance of personality as a card of medical insurance.
In fact, 11 per cent of the American citizens are 21 million who have reached the need for the vote of the age have not been relied with the photographs given by the Government of their State.
Furthermore, five million new electors in 2012 have no similar document.
The cost of receipt the needed trust of personality is often exceeding $100.
New dispensation limits affect youth, minority and people with low income.
In fact, 25 per cent of the African Americans, 15 per cent of those paying less than 350,000 dollars, 18 per cent of citizens older than 65 years and 20 per cent of the electoral from 18 to 29 years have no need of reliance with photography.
But it's not yet.
In several states, the electoral persons who are considered to vote for democracy candidates are not allowed to approve the personality of their training.
In addition, these States allow members of fishery and well-being clubs that are on the basis of the Republics to vote the confidence issued by those clubs.
Until 2004 no State requested evidence of the United States to vote.
The first requirement was entered in Arzon.
Since 2011, more than 10 States have adopted laws required by electors to demonstrate that they are United States citizens.
These, obviously, are designed to limit the vote of outcome from Latin America.
Two third Latin American electoral votes for the Democratic Party.
Furthermore, the Republician laws initiated laws in 2011 that imposed the registration of the electors on the date of vote in eight states.
They also limited the right of individual persons or groups to provide assistance to those who wished to register.
This is not a limit without the effect.
For example, during 2004 elections, the electoral campaigns helped the list of approximately 10 million citizens.
At the same time, measures taken from 2009 have resulted at 17 per cent of the registration of new electors in 2010 compared to 2006.
In addition, the Republical lawyers had adopted in five other States laws aimed at reducing the period of vote.
Thus, during the 2008 global elections, 33 per cent of the electoral in Floride, Africans were only 13 per cent of the total of the State electoral.
The same occurred with the outcomes from Latin America.
Only 11 per cent of the electoral were 24 per cent of citizens who voted before.
Apart from white, which, in the form of 76 per cent of the electoral, was only 46 per cent of the voters.
Of course, democratic lawyers and their parties are actively acting against the adoption of laws restricting the registration of electors.
A number of draft laws had been granted by Democratic Governors.
The most recent laws have been suspended by the United States General Prosecutor.
This allowed partly to limit negative consequences.
Thus, for example, only 16 of the 34 States have accepted laws required to confidence with the photograph.
Nevertheless, the new rules in force are of course difficult for the implementation of the electoral right to the election elections of 2012.
Critics from democrates condemn the prejudice of laws adopted in view of a clear direction to take into account the results of the 2012 elections in key states.
The report of the Centre of Brendan of 2011 shows that the states adopted by these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required in the electoral collection to gain the presidential elections.
It is too early to appreciate that these legislative changes at the electoral system will have significant impact on the results of the Presidential elections in 2012.
It is unfortunately that these new provisions will have a negative impact on the appearance of the electoral.
In this mean, such actions are partly discriminating the system of American democracy.
Scanning the rain of the proper iron: passing the test or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes provides wrong results, lie, and sometimes and false positions that lead to an unutil medical interaction.
There are more doubts to men and who are so unrelated to disappearance.
You're going through the test or not?
We asked two specialists.
In the research conducted in the United States, many cases of abuses among the investigated groups have been observed, therefore, the data received difficult to interpret and difficult to make clear recommendations.
Another research, at this time, found a different degree of death in the patients who have passed the scening and those who have not passed.
The study also showed, after the 12-year observation, that the probability of metastase to 30-40 per cent above those who had not been scanning.
So, I would recommend that the test starting from 50 years, or that from 40 if one of the direct parents had a currency cancer.
Women of African origin are also enhanced.
The key point is to take the right decision only when cancer is discovered.
The rack may be as aggressive, as well as a winter.
The patient needs to explain the risk of his cancer disease, proposing possible options, without an obligation to be treated by the simple cancer, which does not constitute a long-term life risk, and selecting, in these cases, an active monitoring of diseases.
Today, many men with cancers will not take the course of treatment, since their cancer is not aggression and is not a threat to life.
We will propose an active monitoring and if the disease begins progress, we will begin treatment.
We are more accurately defining criteria to decide on whoever should or not take the course of treatment.
So, I would recommend that all of the test is gone.
But it is important that you should also consult your doctor to determine whether it is necessary to be tested.
In cooperation with the International Orologic Association, Mumbabber created a tool to assess all of the tests for and against the origin of the PSA.

Prevent disease
Unfortunately, there is no wonder to prevent cancer.
Despite the progress of scientific research, the healthy form of life remains the best way to reduce the risk of disease.
It seems that if all people were well eating and moved enough, 30 per cent of the cancer could be prevented.
"If no more smoke, this figure would grow as a minimum to 50 per cent," said Andrea Bolee, the secretariat of the Canada Cock Association.
However, 10 per cent of the cancer was made by heritage.
A number of types of cancer remain completely clear.
The Canadiens Association is still a priority, despite the reduction of the number of fuels.
The currency is 85% of the light cancer.
And it is a factor of risk for many others.
It offers a colonial damage for people.
"And today, in Quebek, 1,5 million fuels are 1,5 million," says the President Andrew Boll.
The fact that findings: 10 years after the disappearance of fuming risk to die from the cancer.
Other
According to the CAR, weight and feed also contributes to disease.
They increase the risk of the cable of milk iron, straight and direct powder, powder, iron iron and max.
"The investigation shows that regular physical activity during the whole life is protected from the cancer of dry kitchen," adds to the Association.
Question
The Association also recommends limited the use of red meat.
In too large numbers, it increases the risk of the cable of the tank cell.
It should also be cut off of coal objects.
Conservation of meat by copying, sack or salt may lead to the education of container substances.
"The latest can hurt the organism cells and bring the cancer development," explains the Association.
Vitamins
In recent years, many scientists had been studied on the impact of wintamin addendums to the cancer development.
But at this time the results of these research can't be called one-defined.
The SCC considers that the visa E tests are contrary to results.
If one of them has shown the reduction of the risk of the net cancer, the other was an opposite result.
There is no complete clarity in the assessment of the impact on the development of the gap of visa D.
However, Mr. Bolai emphasized that his concerns and family anamnesis is important to discuss the doctor.
"It's not a cancer analysis."
Bozón Higgs in Details
Last year, it was reported that scientists may have been discovered by the hygs Bozson, the actual aeroplane, and not without reason.
It seems that this boston explains the mass of all parts of the World, not many of them.
Furthermore, this is the last part of the existence of which was proposed under the standard model, our best, or, in any case, 'not perfect' of the nature and the behaviour of the mater, but that has not been unable to find a experienced way.
But the physics are not yet sure that it's about the Higgs Boys.
We know, without any doubt that we have a case with a real new part and that it is strongly reminding the hygs-based standard model.
Furthermore, the new data presented at one major physical congress in Kyoto appears that it would be reaffirmed, although there is not yet any data available for complete assurance.
But we imagine what's about the Higgs Boss, as the chances of mistakes are likely to be minimum, and let's see what that means.
There is, in this world, one law is completely unremovable, saying that two things cannot be seen in the same place at the same time.
Including this rule, you don’t have any opportunity, even not to try too hard, otherwise harm yourself.
But though the physical elementary parts is quite strangely, it is shown that there is also one law of similar character: the principle of exclusion of Paul, which stresses that two parts cannot take the same space in the same time and the same time when they remain in the same "want state" is the "status" in common elements, in some of their characteristics.
The physics are divided by two categories.
In one angle, we are a well-developed citizens called farmers who are well underlined by Pauli’s principle.
Otherwise, the boons, the smooth anarchist bands that have no respect at least at that principle, meaning that they can prejudice to the same place at the same time.
As the site reports (the site is completely uninterprettable) Particle Adventure Laboratory of Berkle, these boundaries are divided in the two groups: the memons we don't speak here and the "participation of forces" by which the main nature forces are distributed and some kinds of hygs concerning some kind.
These bowls should be stressed, not all the exotics that could be thinked.
Actually, if you can read this chronic, it's through one unbelievable ballon bozon: a photo or a part of the light, which is an electromagnetic force.
In fact, when one part has an electric warning is accelerated or changed, it's "laid" the electromagnetic field in this particular place, such as the stone packed in the pool.
From this "freshment" is an electromagnetic weapon (while or infraroid election, or ульtraphiolate, etc.) and this concern is nothing else than the photograph and, therefore, one of the booms of the "transcriptors".
Better stability field
And the same thing happens with the Higgs' boss, with the only difference that this bozzon should be "agained" the other field, the Higgs field.
However, the Higgs field of a greater, more powerful powerful, and to build it, we need to reach very high and very high energy, as if it were talking about the weakest vessel, the surface of which would only have been a very large stone.
This is why we need a huge accelerator of parts, such as the operating in the NDC, the Great Adron Collegader, who is a diameter of 27 km! - to reach such great energy.
The analogy with the electro-magnetic field is also useful to explain the relationship between the Higs and the Mass.
In fact, not all parts and not all the materials are involved with the electromagnetic polar.
Some, like magnetics, are involved, others are not: papers, for example, will never keep the collar.
That's the same, not all parts are involved with the Higs pool: those who are involved have a mass, while others (as photos, kernels) do not have it.
So what's what you can bring all these studies, Mrs. Plamondon?
In science, they are used to check the correctness of the Standard Moded (SM), and it also allows physics to discover the results of monitoring and prognosis.
In addition, some of them wish to find such a disappearance, i.e. the smallest incompatibility can open the door for the new physics and clos some of the providers of Moded.
The last, it is necessary to say that there are still substantial lacks, without proposing any explication for gravitation or dark material that forms approximately 80% of the University.
But until there were not such disappearances in CER.
Consequences
The use of these studies for the daily life of a mediatoral person would provide more difficult, but it would be a mistake to imagine that it is not.
See: At the beginning of the 60th year, the Laser Research pioneers could not even be proposed what revolution would be called for their work.
They provided their applications in science, but not more.
Actually, he has already been quiet, William Boyle, who worked in Laboratory of Bella, where he was discovered the Laser in 1960, and he himself developed a first uninterrupt lazer (precedented) in 1962, said that the first Laser was considered as a "laboratorial gajat".
Enter...
In addition, the application can be found for the tool conducting research.
For example, the same William Boyle during his optical research in 1969 has developed a small light teller.
The Deputy, although it was not all his initial appointment, now served the "Golish" for all the digital photographs of the world and served the Nobel Premium on Physis 2009.
This, of course, does not mean the work of the Great Adron Collegant will necessarily change our life, but it only shows that it can be.
Policial assistance is the best way to die...
The Commission for a decent death in Quebek recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
Debates must soon be renewed and it is prepared for a draft law.
Nevertheless, there is much to do in this important area.
"Drag" tried to look closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living in Montergey apartment.
He gave him a deterioration for two years.
"I've been giving five years, I've lived seven." He said, between life and death, he was in bed in the receiving flat of Victor-Gaba in White where I arrived.
"But it's always a shock that can't be prepared," he said.
The weak work is an unbelievable weakness that does not self - turtle and even food.
Sitting at the table where the appetite dinner stands, it is agreed to help him take food.
He is troubled, even swearing, talking to the unmarried people around him, bringing him medical, leading him into the bathroom.
Mankind before normal death.
"My greatest desire to get me out of the diagram, it's low," he recognised.
Several hours later, the doctor has found this disease.
"In the life we learn that a man must stand up," says Peter Bradler, the psychologist in Victor-Godboa's arrival.
Resolution to the status of the child - for some inadequate decline.
"All depends on human ability." He claims.
As many persons who are engaged in a pestial decrease, important events are also in the most disruption of this accident.
The patients who walk in the polyactive invitation Victor-Gadba are all sick in a cancer.
Prognostics have a maximum of three months of life.
At this stage, the team of doctors and sisters does not provide any more aid called "effective".
Mrs. A., 89 years, most fears to die "in awareness of the air."
But the sickness allowed me to know my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I don't want anything more in life," she said, "and before I allow her to put her a mask easy.
It is still waiting for the nearest days of the last visit of his son coming from Italy.
The Victor-Gadboa assists the Voluntary groups for the body and food assistance.
That's a poly-active fall that remains when nothing can't do anymore.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebek, each 11.700 inhabitants have a place in the Political Aid institutions.
This is very little, considering that we're all gonna die early or later.
This life is continued in the best conditions as possible to explain, Dr. Christian Martel, one of the hospital's doctors.
If you have a competition of physical, emotional or soul.
We will agree to grant the mouths from the bottle or the peeps, although he will ask.
The diabetes are no longer able to control the level of the swaker.
And death is part of daily daily.
We brought a drink by Mr. X, who died tonight.
His son drunk this drink in his feet.
"We help the patients as well as the patients," Natali Savar tells the Heating Director.
There is no day like Victor Gadba in the audience.
A 93-year-old meeting with his last family in the palace in his air during his pit in his honor is tragicly died by a young man, 36-year-old, around parents, wife and two little children, and try to survive.
"In the last half of three to five cokes, it is always an adult in age of 45," said Dr. Christian Martel.
53 per cent of patients accepted in Victor-Gadba are home and 47 per cent of the hospitals.
Peace-related access problem
It seems that 77 per cent of the candidates have no access to the pestician outcome, there is a path to facilitate the suffering of patients who are in the final stage of their life, or home, or hospital or hospital.
Some institutions, such as Victor-Hadba, and the Great Montreal District, are specialised more or less exclusively on the career of patients.
This large space in Quebek health system has been deployed by many doctors of the polyality specialists to risk the adoption of the law of evaporation and self-assassination.
Since October, he circled a mainfect that was signed by pillar's lights, Dr. Balfuror Mantom, and Dr. Bernard Luppoant, and testifying their non-compliance with such initiatives.
According to Dr. Christian Martel, the health system of Quebek is not sufficient to ensure the right to the vollitive entertainment of high quality before the transition to the euttanazy is allowed.
Recently, she said, I saw a patient who had held 14 days in a quick help office, in fear of pains, and no one took the necessary measures to facilitate them.
I'm afraid the patients want to die only because they don't get an adequate fall.
At the same time, many icologics are trying to save patients, despite the psychistic prognosis.
The hope of surviving Elen Richard was already at least when she stopped the damage of the chemotherapiece.
When I told my ecology that I stop the treatment, she answered me that I'm sorry I stop the fight, she told me.
That's why she told me that my days are compliant!
There is no forced entry
Dr. Martel believes that 90 per cent of the patients who ask for death thanks to the doctor for their request, since their pains have not been requested.
However, it should be noted that the poly-active income is not absolutely powerful to combat pain.
According to Elsy Monro, the Director of the Policium Introduction to the Grand Monreal House was not affected by patients in 8 per cent of cases.
At the end of life, the doctors are often run to a folliative settlement in which the patient sleeps before his death or time from time or constantly.
You can't make it more that we don't know about these sufferings.
The more frequently and more often diseases that are not able to facilitate pain will have access to pillar sediment.
Those who suffer from pain always speak the same thing: "I want to die."
But it's not obviously mean, "I want to make me an evacuation," that means "I want me to make it easier."
The establishment of this report was possible by the journalist Institute of Health Researchs from the Canada Institute.
Cross-scandals with unmount in Quebek
The needed persons responsible for the construction of roads, construction boards, the collection of the political parties and the specialists on the Italian mafia day after the day they tell what they know about the colonial " cycle", the construction industry, public officers, politicians, professionals and mafia.
"Industria" which was very precious to the Quebek wanders, particularly in 1990 and 2000.
"I am sure that system has been dismissed after all the funds have been laid down, Chuck Dushno, the deputy and the former police of Montreal."
His thanks to him in 2011 had been deployed as a huge result of investigation of official crimes related to road-building contracts in Quebek, on which the Prime Minister of Lebers, Jean Sharah agreed very unfortunately.
Dushno report established direct link between industrial, secret financing of political parties and corruption.
"At the beginning of investigation in 2010, he emphasized only the Ministry of Transport would save a million dollars for contracts," if some have kept their institutions to take the pay.
The Commission of Sharbonno, "There was two masters," adds, hoped that it would be "detected by specific personalities".
Permanent Unit to combat corruption established in 2011
The Permanent Unit on Criminal Committed in 2011, which was the broad state of government hearers, followers and analysis.
Furthermore, the Special Unit "Moлот" officials who formed the "Stand Cartel" Montreal to stop the cost of contracts.
During the past weeks, there was a series of dealers, and some municipal officers, particularly France Zampino and Rishur Marcott, a small city, were denied to merely and corruption.
Siil Wayakut, recently distant from Mr. Laval, the third to the majority of the province of Quebek.
It is suspected in the reception of the land in the location of State orders.
Furthermore, the accused was presented to a number of officers for the communication of Montreal and the construction of the Italian origin, including Tony Ackurso and Lino Zambaito.
The latest formulation of this bomb, conducted the result of the "siste" of the receipt of State contracts.
For several years, Zambyto provided 3 per cent from the value of contracts arrested in Montreal, some mediator related to the mafia, which, at its time, translated the money of Mr. Jerald Trumpe Party "United Monreal".
In the year 2000, Zambyto paid the money on the right and left. He counted more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (only 68,000 euros) to the various province partys, principally to the releases that were then in the authorities.
In addition, he recognized that he had illegally collected resources for the former Vice-Premier-President of the Liberal Party of Nathan Normando.
Canalization contracts in which prices were increased
In Montreal, the "Siste" of Corruption worked indirectly.
Surpriprisan, the former civil construction engineer, described it in detail before the Commission: for ten years he received from the building prices that were invited to travel to the gulf tour, restaurant, chocolate and cooking in a general complex for $736,000 for the exchange of canalized contracts.
Other officials responsible for the construction of the road recognized that there was a 30-40 per cent account with false supplements.
Afterward, one organisator of the partner, Martha Dumon, accused Mr. Tromble that he had intentionally closed its eyes to the existence of a parallal budget which filled the party chains of dangerous money.
After these discovery, Mr. Tromble left the rescue at the beginning of November, mounting Montreal into a deep crisis.
Shantal Rulo was one of the first deputys in Montreal who killed concern.
Mr. River-de-Preri on the eastern island, it is contrary to the sale of a municipal party buying $5 million and transferred to $1,6 million to builders in the building bum.
70% weak money in pre-selected campaigns
She says that in the investigation which finally will begin will be "payed for a thing that allows to understand the functioning of the system that kiss muscles to stop green and to determine the faults."
This process is characterised as "looking, but positive."
We are in the purity process, but Montreal will need a own group and observer to avoid the return of sustainable practices.
How we go home.
Regularly.
He notes that the employers had overlooked hundreds of millions of dollars, but he particularly concerned the role of the ' chosen officials knowing this scheme' but not participating in machines.
In view of the fact that the amount of huge money in the financing of the electoral campaign in Quebek reaches 70 per cent, he said, "I said that it was just a low reflection of reality."
The Government of Quebek proposes to limit $100 of the donation to the parties, but it would not change the situation: "For the time we will not be able to limit the election expenditure, the policy will be threatened."
It requires a full restructuring system of providing public contracts and financing: "We can't leave below; we are courageous, we can build a house on a more solid foundation, with the best control and law."
If this story and throws the shadows on the international middle of Quebeka and Montreal, Mr. Dushono calls for those who laugh to look in his own palace ...
"PSJ - not FC Barslon."
In this seminar you have reached an unsuccessable disaster.
How do you explain that growth?
This may be explained by individual awareness, but may be the new dimension of the GDP.
There's been big players.
I'll grow every day with them.
The technical staff has also been added to many.
These factors have me to arise daily levels of my game.
And during the mother, it's easy.
It's all going to be very fast.
But I don't disappear.
From the beginning in the preliminary preparation centre in the IOF in Clerphonet and before I came to Saint Ethen, I've always gone forward.
So you'll benefit from the competition established by Carlo Anchelotty.
The completement of this year is not in the news to play a very high level.
They also know that each trial is very important.
This leads to a player like I want to be at the level and to be at the maximum level.
Furthermore, Carlo Anchelotty provides support for my position.
He helps the Employers like Claude McLee, who played the same position as me.
Anchotics - Masters of the provisions?
Sure.
Anchotics have respect for all technical staff.
Today he is not equal to the first, and he enters into the number of the best trainers of Europe.
He has broad experience, and he won a lot of titules with high-cost clubs.
He worked with big players.
I think he'll bring the new titles to Paris.
In January, I had a discovery conversation with him.
Then I left the whole grass series.
The confidence that he showed me also explains my achievements.
What do you think of the first part of the PSJ segment?
The first Ligue Leon took us a leader place.
But we're still ready.
One of our main objectives is Liga Champions: we were effectively qualified in one eighth figure.
What's the goal of the club in this tour?
We're trying to go as far as possible.
Everything can be now.
We can say our word to face with the very good European teams.
We first want to end the first ones in our group, before Porto, to have the possibility of accepting an answering mack at the eighth penal.
Can PSJ become a primary European club in a short-term perspective?
He's already got a budget for that...
In order to become a large European club, Paris must play titles and strengthen a long-term perspective.
It's not like this today.
Financely, the PSJ has resources to make this project real.
Don't take the title in the First Liga, as in the past session, will it be a big space?
Of course, it would be a huge disappointment.
In this year, we really want to take this cinema title.
In the past season, we were close to this.
In May, there was disappointment because we had everything to come to the first end.
It was a very lucky season.
We've finished him with 79 cells.
79 points are usually expected to call the kipyone.
But the second team, Monrovia, played more fantastic season.
This year, I think it's gonna be okay.
Despite that the title's enforced commands such as Marcel, Lion and Bordo, I think we have a force to win.
Do you not think that the SMEs are waiting too much from the SPY?
It's okay that we're waiting for a lot, considering how much we have been inserted and what games we have.
We're fully ready to that.
On the other hand, when we get out of the 4-0 home against the Treas, and we still find what to declare, of course, it's a little bit of disappearing.
We're asking a question what the first time people wait from us.
We're never able to play every exit account 4-0.
We're not FC Barslone!
We're trying to introduce a game project.
The team is formed with time.
We proved at Ligue Champions that we can respond to the modern calls.
Look at Manchester Yenaide, who hasn't already been able to go to a eighth penal, although they're also lost the huge money!
In view of the sums, we have presented you at 15 points before the winter break.
It would be a denial to our opponents and to France's cheps.
Lion and Marcel, who were not in the past season, were "agained" to this new PGI.
It shows how the Prime League is inclined.
I hope we could smile and say to us that, despite all difficulties, we won.
PSJ seems to be fully depending on Saltan Ibrahimovich movements.
Well, what if you say there's some "Slatan's independence".
This only means that Abraham's very successful and that he's killing a lot of heads.
He came to this, and he shows that he's the star of the First Lingue.
Everywhere he played, he showed that he was a great player and a star of the world scale.
In the group we respect him as a man and as a player.
He also respects people around him.
What he did is really exclusively.
It stimules others to improve their game.
The Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also motives all to move forward.
How did you survive Euro-2012 with France's collection?
Like disappearance.
I wanted to learn about that Euro.
Unfortunately, my grass couldn't have a bit of play time.
I saw many things there, and I went out of there.
Today, I'm gonna play a good kitchen.
That's what I hoped from my repentance in the Sink.
We've taken the lessons from what happened in Ukraine, and now we have to be educated.
What do you think about the first months of the Deshma's head of the Sons?
They're resulting for him.
He has a good position in the selective group to the peak of the world.
He's a hard trainer, he's close to players and inspired to gain.
What was Loran Blan?
But I wouldn't want to compare it.
He's low to reach his goal, and he's qualified us in Europe.
I hope Didy Dash will bring the sons to Brazil.
The well-service (1-1), held on 16 October, is the foundation of the mother?
This mother gave us faith in himself.
Everyone fighted for all.
Before it was a shot in Spain, my carrier had no similar mothers.
Pay and sale without bank assistance from Bitcoin
It is fully contrary to the current money exchange based on center transcripts that have been estimated between the parties received by the c Commissioner collections on their processing.
In addition to these technologies, it is clearly a political vision: the current currency system of banking monopolies leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, the Nakamoto Nakamoto, is a virtual currency (or converted to $1, euros) and a protective protocol for the BitTorrent type exchange, which allows the exchange of files between the participating in one level.
It has already been registered from 15,000 computers on the network.
A number of thousand sites are battle for the implementation of the gifts or as a payment.
Kurs battle, reached a maximum of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, five months later caught to $2 before returning about ten dollars today (countries specified on the Bitcoincharts.com site).
Nothing is particularly compared to the exchange of real money or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECE) has been interested in its report on the virtual balance issued in October.
He describes the battle as the most successful virtue, the "concurrent with the dollar or euro" and the "function for normal monates".
Bitkoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, such as "Credits" used to move video games that are launched in the game process or that can buy (and sometimes and exchange).
The Facebook Social Network has also developed a similar system.
However, exchange operations are always monitored and processed by any central body.
In the Bithano, all network hosts are the only time ' s book holders, audients, monasters, buyers and sales.
How does this network function?
Each discussion between two users actually happens between two electronic addresses, such as an e-mail.
Only for each new payment, the user can choose another address by ensuring anonymity.
The collection of information related to this case is signed by e-mail using the encryption system with a double key.
The network can also verify the compliance of the matter.
Thanks to the maintained file, you may verify that the battle used in the workshop really exists in the public account book designed throughout the network.
The key stage is the registration of a new transaction in this book.
It goes through the decision of the mathematic task planned by computers which decided, as a temporary central bank, receives privileges to add this new line.
It's about the cache of the file, it's the transformation of a large file to a digital signature, short and unique.
The computers take a new transaction and add it a number before sharing it all together.
The goal is to find the number that will give the unique digital signature (the great number at the beginning).
Once that number was found, other guests easily check that it's right.
Thus, the transaction is indirectly linked to all other transactions; any modalization will change the digital signature.
If the user would like to pay two times to the same money, only one of these two transactions would be confirmed by the network, and the other would remain unconfirmed, as they have different electronic signatures.
The computer decided to get 50 battery.
In order to avoid inflation, regular rewards are probably distributed to the pillars until the end of 2012.
The number of batteries is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are diames to one hundred million, which leaves another reservation...
The difficulty of the task is also increased with an increase in estimated power.
The life of the network has already been overlooked and falled.
Sites provided by Bitcoin services have been attacked and battle were abolished from reservations.
"The used deficit does not relate to the same protocol," said Peter Noaza, who recently launched the Phoutum company with real money using Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reported on the possibility of delaying money through this anonymic service.
But the money also has this lack.
Fair players, such as Wikipedia, refuse to accept the gifts of such a kind.
Others, such as WordPress blog platform, are allowed.
Recently, Adei Shamir and Dori Ron from the Institute of Vasman in Israel, analyzed the account book and discovered that almost 80 per cent of the fighters were not in defence.
"Gigantic Sales" were announced in November.
" Thirty-seven thousand dollars have been exchanged," John Hallkwist welcomed the worker in Coinabul, which is working for the conversion of battleons in gold.
Peter Noaza, another author of the Guategory, is strongly believed in the capacity of this technology as a operational network.
Its system, Paytuania, is an equivalent of the credit card (in the present dollar) or an independent payment through the mobile phone, but it uses Bitcoin to check transactions that is so far.
The apparatuur is better monitoring its personal data and may thus be anonymous.
The system is just implementing for enterprises who do not need to install new devices or software security.
It's just enough to tell the address you can "food and recognize" by the phone, Peter Nuaza states, and make sure he's already got thousands of users.
There is a general trend of the review of theirrical systems for more horizontal use.
"Before Bitcoin is approved, it will take some time, but 2013 may become a turn point," he said.
In its report, the ECB provides, finally, a review of different risks that have been considered today higher in the case of success of this system.
We went out of Afghanistan.
What's going on?
The French troops left their region of responsibility in Afghanistan (Cabrita and Soviet).
NATO and Americans should follow them at the end of 2014.
For the Afghan army, it was time to re-enforce the territory, and the Afghans to choose their future, not only hoped to us.
We have suffered from a major Afghan baptism that we considered as terrorists.
And we, with 88 murdered soldiers and slain.
Taliban consists of foreign extremists who are former commanders covered in Pakistan but often from baptisms that reject the presence of an foreign army, as it was by the CSR.
They want to protect their traditions, old and architectural, even don't be joined to them djahadists, Pakistants, the Arbitres, the balls, the Tajiks.
They are suffering, sometimes helping local stations, but they will not be the only time western will be more disappointed.
The entrance of the French troops from the Nigebra base, which I observed from the height of the holocausts set by the French credits, was fine.
Guests and bunkers were reached to Kahula without attacked.
It will not be from the end of 2014 to the Tauwa in Kabul.
The situation has changed from their unforeseen movement periods from 1994 to 1996.
During that time, Kaboul was empty, the country was in fire and blood because of the fight between different groups.
The removal of the country was then recognized as their kind of liberty, return to security.
The Afghan women have paid for the drugs of those baptisms in which Al-Qaida had overlooked, but their situation has not been improved in our days.
The former models, the Afghan Government and the present platforms of units in their wish to hold women under the substantive situation.
The main persons of the Anti-Isoviet War returned to the authorities in 2001.
They turned into the State Defenders to transfer them to the repatriates returning from Iran and Pakistan, using the large American sub-contrat contracts.
They were discredited, most of them were not even warned.
People, as I heard in the rural place, want the Government who would not be out of the bulls.
Many young people want to go out how to get those who are aware of the American generosity: the capital decline is mean.
Young people rise from war and her ideas.
They lived in a world of time during the expulsion in Iran or Pakistan, and estimated its privileges.
A 65 per cent of the population is aged to 25 years; there are now five million people in Kabul, one fifth general population.
State schools in cities are filled as well as girls.
We need to ensure the workplaces of these young people who do not wish to return to the old party or to the corruption of some leaders.

There's a army now.
The authorities that will be commanded will be considered legitimate?
Old teams leading to anti-State fight are already taking steps to restore province women that would not be subject to central authorities.
Afghanistan, the mountain country, with strong local differences, should be a certain degree of decentralized, in the form of Western countries, but the United States wished to transform it into a centralized State with a strong presidential authority, with the appointment of the Prime Minister from the Constitution of 1964.
The President of Karzay does not wish to monitor for foreign control, particularly the elections issued by April 2014.
But his country, starting from the 50s and even previously, depends on foreign assistance.
Industry has not been put on feet, no flesh is operated, no regulation system has been re-relimited.
Everything is imported; nothing will be produced except fruit and fruit.
The priority is given to the private initiative.
In the country destroyed thirty-year-old war, public infrastructure control would be required.
There were heard that Afghanistan had great mineral riches.
It has only increased the feeling that western countries were present there only to gain them.
No energy for the processing of iron road or meat on the place, without vehicles to export them through the mountains, there is no profit of useful iscopyers.
The Chineses have already left the place of the media, Mess Aiking, left international architecology (Finated by the World Bank) to raise the largest Buddhist complex and remain the largest of province workers.

Since 2009, the “saving of hearts and minds” at the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), endorsed in 2012 with a small French public organization, has contributed many public work and activities aimed at renewing rural farm in 10 mountain sessions.
These work, with intensive attraction of the local work force, could help to stop the resurrection: absorption, drunk water, restoration of forests, fruit trees, the protection of the soil and increased the surface of the petrol lands.
What are we gonna keep memory of us, losing two billion euros for military expenditure?
A more moderate budget would have increased the living conditions of the local population, very serious in these valleys, at the higher level of over 2.000 meters above the sea level.
The office received tens of written requests for the implementation of small agricultural work from local communities in the Chamber Province.
In order to escape the resorts of the foreign groups, what they want the farmers as they said to me, they need to provide them a small unlimited support that would well be controlled and directly done to them.
Large sorts of the Constitution of the Egyptian Constitution
This is a new risked step by President Mohammed Muruss.
While Egypt is divided more than ever, on the issue of the Constitutional Declaration, which is currently given to him an emergency power, he decided to play on the bathroom.
In turn to all the evil, he declared in the middle that the Federal Meeting would vote on the final text on the next day.
Four weeks ago, the Head of the State provided the Assembly for two additional months to complete work.
Nearly two years later, as Egypt has been covered by a preliminary text in which several times have been amended to reduce institutional stability and leads to legal contradictions.
This new initiative has only increased the dividement of the country.
In view of his opposers, the Chairman continues to be "authcratic burden" and "pour the right."
In his camp, his follow-ups are sure that this is the way to end the institutional and political crisis, the transition process.
Referenm should be held for 15 days.
It is a very short time for the Brazilians to refuse to explain to the Egyptians of the article.
For the President, this is also a way to restore public and democratic legitimacy, while unlawfulness is over all the country.
Muhammed Morcy seems to be convinced that Egyptians are positively declared as he stated in one interview to the American diary of Time.
In addition to the call for an urgent vote, the Egyptian people goes to: "If you vote for my text, or I leave my own emergency powers," which, as expected, must be completed after the adoption of the Constitution.
In this country atmosphere, 85 members of the Governing Meeting, most of the islamics, voted yesterday for the text.
The majority of the Liberals did not respond to calls.
In mid November, shortly before the Constitutional Declaration, they slaughtered by the door, feeling that they were not able to put their opinion.
Representatives of human rights protectors, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to achieve the necessary currency, 11 persons, reserved parties were successfully added tomorrow.
Some are very close to the Brothers-Musulmans.
There is no wonder that most of the articles have been voted unless.
The commentary, finally, argued the fact that one of the few different days had occurred around... time for prayer, since some members of the Committee believed that the time of the Federal Meeting was wrong set.
The text in which the vote was still awaited yesterday contained in 234 articles.
The object of global attention, article 2 finally remained an identical article from the Constitution of 1971 that “the principles of the Baleata are the principal source of law”.
The Salifist parties, for which the Islamic Right is one of the main requirements, hoped to replace "principes" by "right" that would give them a shorter use.
For the islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is a witness of their good will and respect for other Egyptians.
"Literature," they answer liberals that only see a pilar.
Because it is considered that the Constitution's immigration is happening through other articles.
They particularly indicated article 220, which provides the University of Al-Ashar a consultative role, in particular in the verification of the compatibility of the Baltic law.
According to the Specialist of the Egyptian Sophi Pomje, it is concerned that “the people who are invited to take decisions, are not chosen and have no democratic legitimacy”.
We can observe the damage of the theocracy."
Many libraries, además of the fact that the next director of the University appears to be less dead than the present.
" There is no specific religious interference at present.
From this Constitution, we remain in civil law.
Most of the lawyers who work on this text are not sensitive, but people with university education, some have been studied in the French system -- he endorses Alex Bloe, who prepares the dissertation on Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he recognizes that "in the environment of article 220, along with the terms used in it, which are deemed to be religious.
This refers particularly to "ficks" [islamic jurisdiction, appendix.]
And in the future, there may be a question of how many civil judges are responsible to make decisions on this."
In addition to its religious aspects, the text adopted yesterday is critical because it gives the wide power of the President of the Republic.
The Brothers-Musulman claim that they have significantly reduced compared to those in the old regime.
Another point of dispute: the power of the army.
In accordance with the desires of military, the defence budget will not be held in the Parliament but in the National Defence Council.
Also, the court of civilians in military courts will not be prohibited, despite the requests of human rights associations.
The latter was also concerned about the text they believed as a government for freedom.
The responsibilities of divine abuse and now the offence has been prohibited that might have serious consequences for the freedom of the word, particularly for the freedom of press.
Furthermore, no one of the articles mentioned on the protection of women, emphasized by Heba Moraoth, the Himan Raits Web.
Accordingly, the only positive moment is prohibited by torture in article 36.
The word that was not shown in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to be speaked yesterday on television, the administrative planned today at the second half of the day.
The Head of the State, on their basis, will go out on the streets on the Sabbath.

"Large and powerful" to Moscow will learn: migrants choose money in the language
Until deputys and defenders have been disputed that the law on the obligatory language of testing, the country has already appeared a complaint to the certificate.
Any year, in Moscow, Peterburg and other Russian cities, 13 million guests have arrived.
Most of this is the Middle Asian citizen: Usbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkey.
Their only purpose is to pay money for the family remaining.
Since 1 December, the law entered into force, in accordance with each employee, to replace the Russian Language.
As long as this rule does only those who intend to work in the field of services, housing and communications, beta and disagreement trade.
However, with time, they promise to the FIF, tests will be obligation to all arrivals.
In addition, it will be not only a language, but also a Russian history and a legislative basis.
The language knowledge will be reaffirmed for the receipt and for extending authorisation to work.
Exclusion is only implemented for the citizens of the countries where Russian is a State language.
The law and persons who have been able to obtain athletes and diagramms on education to the SPSP dispute in 1991.
Poland, jurisdiction and protection
The network of exchange items will work under the Egyptian Institute of the Russian Institute named Pushina, the University of the Amitiates of the People, AIDS and other Russian hosts.
The tests of migrants will be able to be in all cities; now more than 160 centers have been opened in Russia.
The testing initiative supported and deputates of the Hosдум and the FIF.
And these are the rights defenders before the law has entered into force, many times have tried to ask the press question: what is that own?
What will change the obligation of the language and of the Russians and the ones of them?
First of all, the representatives of the migration service are allowed to reduce the number of people suffering from "favory slavery".
Many speaking now about the protection of the rights of the workers, explains the leader of the representative of the FMS Russia in Tajikistan Victor Sebelv.
The protection of their rights should be started before their departure.
Only the organized set system allows 90 per cent to address foreign workers problems.
The problems are occurred in migrants without professionals, education without languages of medical testing.
Without an understanding of the language, Sebelovs, the future migrant has been treated with unleavened people who will be removed by him in a slightly dark bacch, where he and the tens of such months will be taken without food and documents in 12-14 hours.
We're getting a lot of mistakes from our migrants.
"Their family promises one, and at the arrival they deceive, take passengers, don't pay the promised payment," said the Chief of the Chief of Working Migration MS Tadikistan Tolib Sharp.
Don't be disappointed, the sister!
Nevertheless, as many civilians of the Middle Asian Republics are recognized that not only know the language of the country in which they wish but also write to their own work.
It is obvious that it is not so much of their wine, how many damage are: a few of the tunnels, tickets, tabaks may allow themselves to get a precise primary education.
In fact, their families have nothing to even borrow children, don’t speak about clothing, and clotheing at school.
The age to adolescents are first possible to work.
It's hard if it's bad to know the language, they're recognized.
"You'll make yourself desolate and incomprehensive."
Actually, the law on law-law defenders notes one important point.
The testing will be carried out only for migrants who have legal status.
If there is no status, there will be no exchange nor subsequent official work.
Nevertheless, most guests still live unlawfully in Russia.
"Let to be grateful, or the Special Income is rejected"
Many of the arrivals claim that it is not easy to obtain official status in our country.
The reason is in the British suggestions and all of the same language difficulties.
Furthermore, the equity costs from 12 to 16,000 rubbers.
And this is the false registration can be done fast and over half of the thousands.
The Russian police officers know that we have mainly false documents, there is no registration, from here and from the cases of demand.
"Our hundred, two on the sigarette, the Tea," he shared with the civilists of Tajikistan Womed Hushhadam.
"Nee, don't buy it, buy a lifetime."
On the first day of the language entry into force, it was explained that the false migrants would be not only an registration document.
Several "lip" certificates for language testing have already been equipped by the CFF staff.
Different papers are printed on a usual colour printer.
The new owners were surely unemployed: each of the migrants hoped to facilitate the task of testing, payed for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is two-wise less than the case of official testing procedures: it is a work migrant in three thousands.
That the main task of the nearest time is to protect the system from corruption, so that the "corns" could not just be buyed, gathered and representatives of authorities and defenders.
As long as the authorities can promise the hosts who do not have successfully trial from the first time, the time to study the basic language course.
Furthermore, the inconsistent of the Russian will be proposed for work in areas without an active conversation with people.
MDGs do not take the legal weapons market in the shipment
Dependment of crimes with legal weapons is extremely small
IAD Russia proposes that the law on civil arms is enforced.
This is the response of the authorities to recent incidents: the slaughter of the marriage when there was no victims, and the fight made by the Moscwer Dmitriam Vinograde, which was the result of being killed by seven persons.
Police wishes to prohibite the grant of harms in public places and to increase the age of the licensy for weapons from 18 to 21 years.
The idea supported the Head of the Peace Committee on Security and the Resistance of the Iranian Corruption and promised that the amendment of the Arms Law would be brought to Hospital in a rapid future.
Not all of the lowly reason that Russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by the "tracking gack".
The open letter was found in the network, whose representatives of different public organizations need to be rejected from "beconsistent abound".
The U.S. Arms Registered minimum arms demonstrated the Russian Office of the BB-Bi-si Surminalist of Vasilium.
According to MDD statistics, for six months 2012, 142 crimes have been committed with the use of the fire-speaking weapons registered in internal affairs, while 1168,000 crimes were completed during the same period.
The open letter authors are sure that the legislation in the field of civil weapons does not allow the offender to go to the market.
Now, in Moscow, we can find any weapon on a high price.
At the same time, ICB states that the situation with the proliferation of illegal weapons is controlled.
Assistants: from charges to officers
The arms market is filled in several channels.
The main channels of these five, tells the captain in the resort of Victor Burnik, the 10-year-old of the Ministry of Education and Geneste.
The site script to accept weapons orders
The first " Army or military follow-up" is the weapons that were abolished during the war against the Café.
"The bulls and the Russian officers, and the co-ordinates," says Barantic.
The next kind of "arms" is a hazardous crime in the force structure representatives.
The bacterian explains that the police units are entered and engaged in the law enforcement officers.
The unlawful "trusts" are sold from military compounds.
Many military compositions often have occurred explosives.
"There are proved versions that part of the guards were made specially - to cover lack," said the former military.
The arms producers have their lips, according to the Barantic.
"Actually, private weapons are produced that do not hold competition on the international market and select weapons from the neck market, including Moscow," says the expert.
Another market source is the contrabando.
In particular, weapons and cars from poor countries, such as Kirghiz.
"There are its production, sometimes a cooler, and a mafia that organized a stream," explains the former military.
Where's the weapons?
The experts estimated what is the proper share of each source of illegal weapons to the "child" market.
This report was prepared in 2011, the Centre for Analyzing and Public Management Project.
Specialists analyzed the report of IWD and Rossstation, critical literature and open data of ports on weapons thematics.
The former part of the illegal weapons, recording researchers, conducted from the army and the forced states.
The average of all weapons on the black market was found there, "for the guilty of officials whose work is related to weapons," said the report.
As a result of researchers, 17 per cent of the cases are armed conflicts, 14 per cent of the cases are disappeared at the weapon production phase, 5 per cent of the 'archology'.
The consultor of one of the armed stores requested to call his name, believes that weapon found by black copies is no longer buying is too old.
Of all, as he says, for the new party sales go to the military composition.
A man's prosecutor buys a single, such as TT pitch.
He's described, translated through the carrier.
"He's going to bring it into the city, and he'll sell it to 900 euros for a thing with two stores," he says.
"Subsection, police in all cases, therefore, periodically when the crime discovery plan is planned, is conducting a controlling purchase of unlawful traders," adds a consultant.
"Come in a smooth store."
The buyer and buyer are most often found by the knowledgeful ones.
I looked at the site, in the blog, until I refused the company who proposed to come to the God's platform, where the person who's going to take me into the thumb, where we're gonna be traded.
The price of the creature I just learned there
Military Deputy Victor Brank
I need a well-known one who's going out, tells the vendor-consector.
There's the sales on the market, but there's also need to come in, "The Ivan's son who asked to advise that the son of the winter fell out."
I'm just a couple of catshots through a person who's sure.
He's also putting them to me, because he knows I'm not going to get him.
The news are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Baranik tried himself in the role of an illegal weapon buyer in the middle of the 1990s when he prepared a article on this.
Sehams haven't changed according to his words.
He gave a album with the photos where it was "all what he wants."
"I felt like in a smooth store," remembers the military.
The buyer, according to Barnak, does not offer cott in the middle - it's possible to try.
I, the potential client, I don't just buy -- we're going to the forest, we're standing the museum there.
"I can shoot, and when I'm sure weapon is good, we're going to be traded," describes the expert process.
Magazine on a garden
Internet searchers are on sites and groups in "Contact" where they propose to buy weapons for "for different purposes".
There are no documents or personal meetings to this end.
"You have a certain amount of money," they write in the advertising chapter on the "Coping Bottle or Auto" page.
The users leave their claims and ask questions.

According to the official statistics, compared to January-Office 2011, the number of such crimes in Russia has reduced to 7 per cent and 22.9.000, and the number of facts identified by disappearance and explosive weapons, warming, explosive substances and explosive devices reduced to 7.8 per cent.

Following the Makdonalds Cass on the fourth of all American ages
During the last days in America, Protestist acts were discovered against low wanderings in the Walmart Corporation and restaurants of the popular fast food networks such as Makdonalds, Burger King, "So white", "Ondys" and "Cantucquefried China".
Until no one is going to predict whether this trouble is turned to the ninth Valet, or it is convicted in the early stages.
Actions support the Professional and several of the leaders of the public organizations.
In addition to increased moderate wages that receive several workers of Walmart and fast food systems, the purpose of protest operators is the establishment of professional organizations.
Until that sector of economy is almost not covered by prosecutive movement.
46 cents per year?
The acts began last week after the day of thanks, called the "First Saturday", when the oracle of delays was discovered by millions of employers and sometimes had been shoted.
Today, some employees of the Walmart Corporation, in which in the world work 2.2 million people, have left their workplaces and have piked together with the prosecutors and the lower-activists of the corporation, whose goods are calculated for people of humble and medium-sized allocation.
Walmart is driving all the light, from the pillars, the rocks and the car bacteria to the powder, the ice and the milk.
Products in its stores are averaged from 8 per cent to 27 per cent than in large supermarkets.
Thus, many low-payed workers of Walmart are only refusing to work.
Availability and equipment of goods made Walmart one of the largest companys of America.
According to criticisms, Walmart may allow himself to sell goods for the part because it's a little payment to his employees.
Recently, the difficult working conditions, such as the lack of car loaders or manual scanners.
Participants requested the Saturday Friday to enhance the payment and settle the cost of medical insurance provided by the corporation has increased from 30 to 100 dollars per month.
They said the typical worker of Walmart's $9.5 for the time, this expenditure was not in the carman.
Scientists from the California University in Berlin demonstrate that Walmart will increase the average payment to $12 per hour, that would be under the corporation of $3,2 billion.
This is approximately 1,1% more than it'll pay for the payment now.
If Walmart's goal over the growth of the store's savings, every one's coming to the store will be a road of 46 prices.
For year, they'll pay for $12.39 more than now.
The Walmart Parties notes quite aware that protests activities have been made in nine States and have not brought corporations or damage.
"The Saturday" continued in her shops from 8:00 a.m. in Thursday until half the next day, and Walmart sold about 5000 goods in second.
In general, its cassa apartments have been made at the World Saturday, nearly 100 million transits.
The representative of the Society Dan Foggelman said to the left website of Huffington Post that the workplaces left in the total "Minst Five" staff of Walmart, and that the protestist's activity was all the "while Pirate Bay" organised by the prosecutor.
"Found Cass!"
The protesters continued this week in New York where their object was not degraded by Walmart (which in this advanced city, and therefore they were not yet here), and the "Makdonaldas" and other lowest restaurants.
McDonalds says he's sold milliards of portions, and then he doesn't even give you a hospital and don't pay you for a good job!
Jamine Williams, New York Guarantee member
At this time, the minimum wage paid, in accordance with federal and New York legislation, is $7.25 per hour.
Quick food reserves with time, but it is inconsistent, and in the middle of their number of employees receive 8,90 dollars per hour.
It's less they're in this way that no one's bought.
How you can exist in New York for such money, I'm inconsistent.
Sometimes the McDonalds had been less than four American adolescents who had been prepared after the school, living in the parents.
Many who saw the basic source of investigation or planned to stay there for a long time.
But now, I'm constantly engaged on the interview with the McDonalds' workers who are angry that they should live on this payment and sometimes even get kids on it.
On the other hand, the Wall Street Journal works comments, which the author notes that it is directly putting children, if you don't know what you're going to cut them.
The Protestist acts started on Tuesday 6,30, at the Thursday, at the 40th street, and in the Medison Aven, requested that the Cassador and the speed food system would be paid at least $15, so it is more than their current minimum labor.
They also requested that the rapid food should be created in the area of professional organizations.
The American law prohibites the administrative to prevent and punish the assets of psychiatric trafficking and disappearance.
On the other hand, the Administration will easily facilitate their lives.
Nevertheless, to cover fast food is difficult for objective reasons.
One of the main is an unsatisfactory current of the staff.
Insufficient
Protestants were present in this day and in a number of other decades of Manhattan restaurants.
It was a middle of the Mitling Day at the McDonalds close to the Times-Squever, in which several local democratic policies had been made, particularly a member of the Jamine Williams Hospital, said, "Makdonalds is selling millions of ports, and then he don't even give you a hospital and don't pay you for a fair work."
Demonstrants have supported and other species of New York Democratics, for example, a candidate for the City of Bill De Blazio, who stated that we should take care of the rapid food workers in support of the rapid food workers in order to achieve a fair and economic welfare that each newborn served!".
As the New York Times has earned, it was the greatest action of such a kind in the history of the American speed food.
However, only a few hundred people were involved, and there were no longer all of them in the speed-group workers in which in New York were decades of thousands of people.
As far as it is not clear that this extensive flow of the mass movement will be generated.
"What to lie the brain is a middle of the brain."
A popular among the modern technologies of complemented reality has been adopted as a result of the emphasis of special issues.
At the beginning of its annual conference, the current model of Google showed, and then it was known that the applicant had made the subject to the relevant patent and Microsoft.
However, from the discussion with the manager of the interactive 3D technology technological group of Microsoft Sharam Izady, a past stage for scientists of the eye.
They are managed to manufacture virtual objects in the air by head hands, creating virtual open spaces.
- Tell me what your research group is doing?
- We're engaged in man's interaction with the cars, but we're trying to develop the border of this interaction.
Since the mass of humanity had worked with pixels on the screen, sometimes touching their finger.
We want to look at 5-10 years before and predict cordial changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox attachment and the Kinect Sensors is a step forward, and almost no Xbox today without Kinect is sold, because it's all interesting for hard management.
- What else are we waiting for?
- Although Kinect has translated the interaction at physical level, a lot is still happening on the screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input has been improved (style receives more data), and the output is not very much.
We are trying to change it, working on real three-dimensional systems on the basis of different technologies, including projections.
We need to get the computer peace in our physical, to make it more appreciated.
However, it is necessary to recognize not only the user but also the space around it.
Then we can fill the real world with virtual objects in a much better form.
And first - these dreams of virtual reality!
- What do you think about the voice management?
Populary thing, but isn't it overlooked?
- It is certainly unable to call her masters - a question of privacy, because it is not always wishing to speak about their actions and intentions.
Actually, all kinds of interaction with computers are good, but each in the lowest.
For example, for the management of the devices in public places, we had a project that we thought about hard but not on disasters, but on the shortest.
In this way, the steel was removed not from the camera, but by the handy browser, which fixed bones movements and mouses.
As long as he's great, but theoritely it can reduce to the size of the handtimes.
But it will be the future for a ridiculous manager, for example, a Steel+Right.
- How's that?
- For example, how do you ask me to transmit you this gasing bank?
You're saying and you'll just show it.
- I'm usually talking.
- Oh, it'll be very hard to understand.
- So you want to make users to adapt what might or can't the car at the moment?
- It's not necessary, but it's a mutual closer.
I think we should mainly work on the development of new sensors types that will be able to determine precisely human reactions.
Those may be, for example, the lacte sensors, they give a bad solution on the deep license, it is very important.
- If you're talking about your work with the Xbox Kinect senators, what's your claim to the modern cameras?
Didn't there be permissions, deeps or something else?
- This is the principle of the present generation that is how we can resolve our work over three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, it would be good to get 8 megapixel with the speed of 1000 c/s.
But the case is not the megapixels, but as a matrix and a density.
From the latest point of view, all the current technologies are not good for us, it adds the work of the algoritm projectors.
So you should remember not only the solution on X and Y as well as Z.
It's also important to speed, the number of staff per second.
Management is quite dynamic, and the present 30 c/s is clearly little, particularly for irons.
The Stewin Betish of our Redmond Laboratory made a senator of the regulated delay - between 1 and 100 metres, and the modern series are closer to the second (60-100) indicator.
Not all understand how it affects human and car interaction.
I'd like to be very profitable in my work, the equivalent of such devices, not only required to be greater for staff in second.
- You don't need the number of cameras to increase?
In Kinect, there are now three cameras, one of which actually is a infraroad, and the second is the receipt signal.
And here's the third camera, this is the own, usual senser of the visible range.
It is not applicable to define the depth of the object.
Pontiously more cameras could solve the problem...
Or to enhance it by increased calculations.
It would be difficult to create a huge Kinect analog, to play from a critical camera location and to see how it would help in a three-dimensional definition of the provision.
- I remember that Microsoft, differently from Google, didn't present his eyes.
You don't think that it's one of the most prospective platforms in the daily use of the technological complementary reality?
- Of course, all the time to spread, holding the smartphone in the hands, it's not very good, but I think that the most beautiful option would be "translated" a comprehensive reality when you could be able to move out of the smartphone, the proceeding screen and the overall.
The eye is a very personal device, that is their strength (the private things you see only) and the weakness is a single deficiency, on the basis of the points, you don't allow you to work on virtual objects together with other people.
- For a minute, manufacturing virtual goografic objects in the air is available not only to Tony's Stark of the Life Man, but also to the simple death.
There is a problem that often shows the criteria of such ideas: there is no tactical answer!
The hands don't feel anything!
What's your group's answers will be ready to this call?
- In my audiences I often say that complemented reality is the seventh account of breakdown in human and car interaction.
I think the eightth total may be added to tactical feelings.
Until one of the interesting tricks is using the second hands as a custom container for the image.
It's greatly registering the hope!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed to add these "cartons in the air" - for example, the conference of several secondary experiences in a certain point where the finger is, gives feelings, but it's very weak -- as if you've been in the students.
There are also breastplates that affect nervous ends in fingerprints as well.
- You tried to lie the brain?
Let him think he feels like it's supposed to feel at the time he's seeing something?
- That's a good idea, we've never tried to do that.
There is another task on which it is to be fighted for still a long time - that it is physically located in a very limited space, to believe that it goes through open, practically unendly, and the concepts of run roads (no such as in clubs), the platforms and the huge balls.
As long as we lie the brain is average, work is worked for many years.
This is what is working on the virtual reality of such an attractive for the researcher, many things are absolutely strict.
Cultural - Rosbalt.ru
The Pitterburg Avangard's project continues to be on the mountains that are going forward in the Avangard of culture and art.
In this pump list, the Greek children of the Attorney Peterburg have already disappeared, whose achievement is out of the town, often found acknowledgement in Europe, the minimum universal knowledge.
The new "Rosbalta" hero is the Epathetic Artist Kiril Miller.
The whole city knows Kiril Miller, a warm man who was dressed in all the red, with the Russian museum, the garden of Lithuania, on the shadows and the rocks.
Cards of Kiril Miller are always gathering the thresholds where they wouldn't be set.
Kiril Miller is one of the Pyterburgan social and philosophics who created new microology.
Kiril Miller is a black man of the Peerburg Avangard's end of the 80th beginning of the 1990s.
Furthermore, he is a man of the city who has his views on the streets who calls the laughing in the guests.
He recently took a ballman and became a petrolbourg ballman, since he found all his divine existence, Philosophia and myjam for this complex role.
- Kirill, and why are you still walking through the city in all red, not in a wheel or a kiss, for example?
- I chose a red color as a modeler.
The red color in this world is a compromise between artist, myjiker and society.
Although in society is not agress and aggression of unfavourable property.
But my training is aimed at starting a conversation.
All the story of my educational actions is an invitation to the discussion.
- And when did you understand what the artist must be?
- In the DCD, where my work had been made.
I understood that's my way.
Then the concern of the old non-official artists, and the new, free types of me were uncertain.
I became a wife with the new artists, with a postgazone who brought the Powish-10, and there was no more concern.
I'm going to the theatre, clothes, music, every woman, except words.
And all this was connected to your Art-Click... I was important to feel in Peterburg's center of culture where all the best creative forces should be gathered.
In 1995, I took the Territory at Powish-10, and there, until there was a remonte, there was a musical-arthist club, a divine club, a Petterburg divine house.
Many of them were born: NOMs, Tekila Jaaz, I remember that Shanera brought the "Oho Van Gog".
Shenner and his friends pitched under the factor of the light songs, and they were in the throwing trick, among them it was a modeler today.
When the group's winning lived, she became "Lingrade".
Threstenberg was conducted by many programmes to the hali-vailable time.
We gave them the Tricktenberg, and we sent him a great carrier, and the basic education and education he received us.
D 137 Gallery, Greboeds' club is a vote from Art-Clicks.
The workers and the officers have gone.
I'm the hero of the last century when culture means something.
In the year 2000, the press was "The people of our town".
I was named in the Nomination of the Birth Year, and my culmination ended.
In new times on old rules, I am a person of truth, honestity and culture of the past century.
In our years, it is easy to become popular, but culture and popularity can be popular, but not very cultural.
- Your work is a recognized manager.
- Many of my pictures are white, they're ridiculous, and they're ridiculous.
I'll have a program exhibition, the Ross Museum in Lows.
Clubs are an interim category.
I was first social, now that is painful and fearful.
But in the bulls, it's all smoking, tragisme is smooth.
I love the griss, I have great ideas.
For example, salvation of peace by tactical switching in a prescribed order.
Now they're looking at clothes, focusing on an external mechanical, not on an internal man.
Maybe he's not able to put his hand on the rock.
And the fault will be disappeared with the help of revealing.
We've seen you in the city City City City Royal City City should have such hero.
Whoever, like I don't have, are they.
- Maybe the commercial art can be beautiful?
- Now commercial art must be acquarent, tactical and sweet.
Cultural integration goes.
The former people came into the stage, the divine loved one, just another.
But now the microsociation is now, it's hard to be all.
I'm not a worthy bottle to like everyone.
Now you need to think who you'll like.
Now, every host of 100 adorators is an erection.
- And at Stace Michal, there are some thousands of them!
- He's got a kitchen, there's the sex-sexual social field.
And to the cultural season 300 people will come, and 10 weeks won't come, and less manage, money, all hurts.
I have worshipers, they don't lie, they're not exporting the vital.
I've written these pictures that they've been on one collectioner around the wall with Falk and Larion.
I started with the pictures they usually end.
Now they're often smoothing the idea.
They say that the culture of spiritual, the culture of consumption.
No culture in the consumption, it's from the other operation.
I am a man of the culture of yesterday day, growing on the examples of artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, rejected money for images.
I'm for this culture.
- Kiril, what's wrong with Peterburg?
- Good cultural experts.
There is a idea: a leader of the culture.
But not each of them can be cultural.
When the kings were right, the kings may not really understand in culture, but they understood that they needed to keep the right experts.
Here are good advisers in Moscow now.
We have people in Peterburg who could be experts, but they are endorsed, since they need higher experts that are correctly evaluating these experts and give them the way.
Now it's a dream.
But Eritta, but they reflect that they say honestly that not all the timely arts we take, there are artists who need to look for other museums.
- What's with you, Peterburg?
- Peterburg is not a cultural capital, in Moscow's culture, there's a lot more.
And on our stones of art it is difficult to grow.
We need cultural seed, and we have writers now more than readers is wrong.
This is a lot of people interesting in Europe.
We've got this point.
We have to do model art as it was in the beginning of the last century.
Project implemented on the S.P.P.T.B.
Draw in the Space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or closing with asteroid murder.
Space boats with land boats are sent to the search for a reservation planet.
In order to maintain humanity, is the main question how to continue its kind in the insatisfactory or at the same planet?
I think it's a little choice.
In fact, only two of the present are planned that could be hypothetic.
This is Venner and Mars, considered a senior scientific staff of the National Astronomic Institute named P.K. Sheternberg (GAIS) Regimine Serdin.
But if the conditions are more likely to live in Mars, the Venary surface is 500 degrees of temperature.
You can live only in a large height or in the warrant... in the cosmost.
It is on reproduction issues in the cosmose starting from the flower.
Another half ago, the experiments on the plants were carried out.
The four generations of the rabbit on the orbited mountains were different from their earthly furnitures.
Then it is an orbited wine-drozophile of the best fruit muscles.
In 1979, an egg was sent to the Space to check how the embryon was developed in the inconsatisfactory conditions.
We're getting the completely normal penny.
And this is going to begin the problem.
"The work associated with the fact that the applicant must find an appeal, he must stand up on his foot and start movement," explains the reporting Laboratory of the Medical-Body Problems (IIBP) GRON Forum Sichev Institute.
Not founding the career, the pents were crashed in order.
After 10 hours in the newborn, the full atrophie of institutes has occurred.
The tanks did not react to light and sound.
And there was a bad thing that they just died through the fourth floors.
"It's two times we've pulled pennys, then we refused, because it's just unable to work with them."
The last 16 years ago, with animals, the biological Mineral Mineral flights.
Other 2013 experiments continue.
However, on the Bioprotect Bioton will only be one-time individuals.
It was an expert with crises sent to the cosmose with fruit.
In principle, there was nothing over nature found.
"It's how it was on the biosponsors, but again it's an unique experiment and such research needs to be conducted."
After the landing in the outer crises, there was seed.
But to address the problem of multiplication directly in the cosmose until it is received.
It's not easy to do this.
Life, defeat, natural living environment can't just be able to realize their sex instinct.
Another person, different from the animal, may, in principle.
Homo wise has an abstract thought and is able to create a similar emotional background.
The same experts are not conducted according to the ethical views.
But women in the cosmos are 50 years old.
The largest risk was in the Athensian.
And the most precious thing in humanity is the female body.
Our Cheque came away, and no one could say to the earth: "If he keeps after the field into the cosmost."
She's supposed to be a child after that field.
"No one's answering this question," said the Veteran Rail-Cosmic Sea Whagang Vacada.
In July 1964, every year after the field to the cosmost, the first woman-Cosmonat of Valentin Tempty was born a daughter.
The father of the child Andrew Nigeo was also a cosmovour.
In 1988, the second woman-Cosmonauta S.S.S.C., was born two times to an orbit and even an open cosmost.
However, the risk remains.
We have little, the units are ready to the cosmouths, which are after long-term fields, and grows up a healthy generation.
"And if more, it's a dangerous even at the orbital flights,"-- it's the end of the aircraft-Cosmonaut, Hery of the Council Union, Gery Russia's Valley Police.
Yet, mankind needs to search for some new ways in biotechnology, protection against radiation, creating artificial civilization.
The ICT hydrography is an assumptive phase for the field.
Here, in the terms of the necessity of the cosmost work in open space.
The water's impressed insecurity.
For adult waters, let it be comfortable, but even for a strange environment, the children's breasts are birds.
The small ititlanders likewise reaffirm that life on the neighbour has gone out of the ocean.
There is a link between the smaller ones about 9 months in the mom in the sweet juice, it's easier to touch the waters.
This is logically because from the date of birth, from that first purchase, it is about two weeks.
"It's very little to forget something," said Marina Axeon's indicator.
In the words, if the ingratizity of the child is more natural, women needed a gravity and gravity.
It is so quite quite uncertainty that the mouse of the animal can be shot, and that it has the ability to enclose the fruit.
All right, let's get it, and it's, trusting the smoke of the family's work.
You can, of course, in a special camera to go to the kind, she'll get it out.
"And what more?" - Proposes the non-thirdly issues of the Varry Police.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Indeed, organism does not form the cell and the museum system.
The new on orbit is impossible, as a adult, to cover a special loading cotton for triggers.
He'll just be lost that he'll need lifely.
"And this experiment we're going with you, allowing a child in a foreign environment, will bring us to the ground of disabilities, fully deaffected man,"-- Head of the Bioethics Committee on WHO.
As long as children are born in the cosmost, the question of the theory.
However, after time, it will be a reality when the landscape is moved to a far planet that will become home for their seeds born in the cosme.
The Headquarter of the Control Control Control: The testing of the Square Systems has disappeared on the wine of policies.
In the sectors of the State purchases, Chekia provides good control bodies and, despite the existence of quality legislation, it remains in its application.
This is the statement of the Peaceful Cola, Vice-President of the Supreme Control Control Management, from the Internet of Updaten月.cz website.
"The end will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly what, in my view, we have no lack," said the current situation of Kal.
Such conclusions provide a joint inspection of Chess and German control bodies.
As an example of false practices, Peter’s approach is often called a sharp steel.
Recently, the Minister stated that HDP (Grand Democratic Party) would not be concerned by enterprises of verification - would it be prohibited or allowed?
"The end should be established in any way and, if anyway prohibites, the Prime Minister cannot resist to the work of institutions that are amended to verify and enforce the fulfilment of the obligations," confirms the Chale.
At the audit Committee meeting, you have discussed a joint project between the Tschech and German parties, in which a State purchase legislation was provided by both countries.
What's the matter specifically?
It's a parallal verification we've probably started two years ago.
In addition, it is said that the European legislation claims how public purchases should be conducted, further national legislation and then apply to practices.
All information was collected, and even when it was yet illegal, it was found interesting differences -- it was easier to say, the legislation may be "took and uncertain," but in practice we have entered Germany on some parameters.
This should therefore be inadequate to create more and more clarified rules, focused on the application of the law itself.
How can the project help you what it means for you?
This joint control may contribute to the efforts to stop clarification of laws, reduction and improvement of restrictions, as it does not lead to positive results.
Economy means obtaining the relevant things for a reasonable (or not always low) price to avoid detrimentation and, perhaps, criminal behaviour.
But not the fact that we reach it, reducing the limitation of orders.
This system may be filled with "booms" so that those who want to find the lake in this system will be far easier than if the limits are not declined.
You are talking about internal problems of practical application of public buying legislation.
How does the control system operate in Germany?
Is there an organization such as our COP (Chron-revisional Management) or is it worked otherwise?
With regard to the institutions, the Federal Recruitment Court, which has been established under our principle, also exists a colleague working a little different, but on the basis of both institutions are working similarly.
Furthermore, the powers to a certain degree appear, but since Germany has federal structure, there are an audio unit and the federal land level, their system is a few different from us.
The BRH can be managed only by federal money, we have public resources.
Common Funds in our regions and municipalities are monitored at the federal accounting level.
What about local legislation, is it easier than we have?
Actually, I wouldn't want to compare without specific data, but in some regards Germany can't take a formal, but it cannot be clearly say that it is better in all.
That's so because they're better doing control?
Often no, but I repeat that such comparisons are not liked.
But it should be said that even educational countries are faced with many problems.
Otherwise, they would not receive any benefit from cooperation with our office, right?
If he speaks of domestic legislation, how did your amendments to the State buying law have been reflected in some way?
In view of that the legal force of these amendments is quite short, it has not yet been shown in our control work.
Since we have controled the fact, we need to take into account some delay.
We take this in mind only in the preparation of future verifications -- we started using our new tool for discovering the inconsistent risk, through which we have scattered almost 14,000 public contracts, and we have analyzed them, and of course, these changes will be changed, change the conditions of some trend types and so far.
How do you think that the approval of this law will benefit or provide additional loading to the browser system?
I think that this law is, of course, a step in the right direction, and I hope it will be confirmed.
The problem that can arise is that the rules "abortion" and they will not be observed.
In the functioning of previous rules, the undertakings are linked to the provider (e.g. regional operational programmes with the Regional Council) that any non-compliance with the State Budget Act means violation of the budget discipline.
Does such a case to deal with the law in such a way?
I think it's not that way.
The system should exclude those who want to hide and abuse but not to punish those who commit formal errors that do not affect the decision.
This system is just creating a more pressure on the browser.
And when to get out of this situation?
Let's know that this way will not bring anywhere.
Recently, the Prime Minister stated that GDP would not worry about the verification of the so-called square systems.
"Syss" is prohibited or allowed?
The law should be established in any way and, if anyway prohibites, the Prime Minister may not resist the work of the bodies that are required to verify and attain to the fulfilment of the obligations.
You may say, "We will change this law and let it go," but we cannot say that we will be made as if nothing happens.
The State buying law contains quite a set of rules, such as formally, and it is correct, which protects public purchases.
But on the other hand, it is tragic when the candidate with the best proposal is disabilized only because of formal lacks.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly what we do not have.
The roads in places are slightly, but mainly passed.
In some places, Chechia are depressive and locked ways.
Overall, they're gone, but sometimes with greater care.
Carlovarian region
Tomorrow in the Carlovard, the roads were over, but sometimes were weak and locked.
The temperature falls from five to ten degrees below zero, but during the day the temperature must be warm.
The snowfall in the region has stopped, just a small low level.
However, there are about 30 centimeters of snow on the road mountains.
The information received from the areas of road workers was known that the places were lowly visible from the tunnel.
The Cross R6 and the ways of the first class in the region are now unlimited.
However, pretty needs, for example, on the brass where the surface may be immense and square.
All roads referring to the second and third class, including mount traces.
But some of their parts are still laid by the rest of the snow and the places of the insured snow.
Special attention must be on the ways of upgrading.
Portuguese and Crodian region
The management of the roads and the machines of the Checa on its pages in the Internet provides that some ways of the East Chess has a black, and on the mountains and roads of upgrade may be deared.
The areas of road workers warn the hole that can be particularly higher than the Portuguese Border.
The Holoud may be near Lanschrouna, Usti-Orlici, Police, Svitabia or Visoka-Myoto, especially on the second and third class.
Rooms I/43 and I/34, which are processed by chemicals.
The snow is particularly located on the ways of Krconoche and Orletic mountains.
The displaced snow is on the roads situated in Richnova-11-Kenignoa and Trinno.
In East Czechya today, a changed area without assets.
The temperature is usually turned within the borders from the threshold of three to more than one weight of the Goals, a light wind.
Palestinian border
The roads in the Poland are this morning, but the places must be careful and access to the weather.
On the morning, the temperature is of three to nine degrees below zero.
Following the snowpad and the follow-up in some places, it may be nearly.
The places of waterers can be closed to the tank, but the visibility will be gradually improved.
Information was provided for areas of road work.
The D5 Chamber is now without limited, however, the road manager recommends that the care of 80 to 131 kilometers.
The majority of the first class has a sweet and smooth surface.
In the south of Pless and Tahawa, the most immense parts may fall.
The roads of the second and third class are powerful, and in this case also acts warning in the possibility of a number of participants.
The vessels must be careful, especially in small ways used in the Shoma region.
Olympic Term
The managers on the top of the Olomoutic border today must take into account the black cock on the road.
It remained after the use of chemicals in the Red York Seat and the road towards the Vital Cross.
On the night, the snow was to go to road workers, according to the information from the road management, Shamperk had gone out about three centimeters of the snow.
In other areas, the side of the road is usually passed without limited.
"Sumperk's uppers are laid on the left of the snow.
The managers who governed to the side of Ezekian must have a black chain in the Red Year Seal, today reported the CHAN (China of the News Agency) Disecretary of the River Management by ways.
The night of the road was sent and their colleagues from Hezekiah, they believed that the roads to rise after the processing of chemicals remained heads and mockets.
In Olomouth, roads are without limited, but drivers should be attracted in forests where the power still remains.
Upper border, Liberian border
Tomorrow work from North God’s morning reports that a few difficult past places remained.
According to the Database of the police, not only a number of places with a collapse or a black snow, closed the moon way to participate from Thelcin to the Claire in the Star Street.
The temperature also remains negative in lows, so the snow and milk are stolen in the street, particularly south-orient from the Czech Middle East, at all, there are no problems, the paths in the main soil.
The complications on the road are not yet reported.
Training work reports the presentation of the Hololed in the streets of Steti.
According to the meteorologists, the night for his education was created perfect conditions - the whole day the rain went, the snow was cleared, the night the sky began smoke.
It is reported on the undangered conditions on main chains and on the traces I/13 on the border of the United States and Liberia.
Because of fires under the ground of the snow snow trees on the same road, they were forced to close the way to the Theater in the book.
Shimon Ornest: We want to catch positive energy on the concepts
What do you think about that less than a month after the end of the light?
That's one of the many worried news we, people, are so easy to fall.
However, with the The Tap Tap group, we are continually on this topic and say that we are the only group in the world that can gather sufficiently positive energy to deteriorate or prevent the end of the world.
Moreover, in December, you're going to give absolutely ones three concepts against the end of the world.
Would you like to tell the readers about this?
This is a general action on the collection of funds that we are planned for for two years.
We decided to use the marketing capacity that has the Maya calendar at the end of which 21 December to 11:10 has been declared.
On the day before this happens, the 20th December, at 21:00 parallelly, start three concerts in Prague, Bruno and Ostrave.
They're finished, a huge say, at the time that the Kiribati island in the Pacific, the timely declaration which is 12 hours before us will be completed by the Mai calendar.
Who did this idea come into the head?
This was my idea, and then we were all invented together with our Artist of Hong Kong.
Besides that we want to cut enough positive energy and prevent the end of the world, we also want to think about how this world is once before our children.
In the event of the Maya calendar, we have created a unique collection of objects from both blue, footballs, baskets and original keys against the end of the light.
The Tap Tap, together with other musicians, also fulfilled the gemin against the end of the world, called "The Son of the world is abolished."
Will you like you to listen to YouTube genin at these Beneficial Concerts?
Of course, in the end, if everything is done and the end of the light won't happen.
It's all executives in all the concepts at one time.
The winters are also named in the direct television ephars.
The words to this song wrote and played the role of Jesus in Town Hank, also in execution of Xindl X....
How did you start to cooperate with them?
We also cooperate with other persons of the Czech cultural life, since we conduct many well-beings and concepts.
We're trying to engage them actively to this project.
Many like us to work, they're interested.
What's going on to go from the concert against the end of the world?
In order to buy equipment for the SSTUDEO educational centre, we have been working in the sixth year with the civilian Tap Uniform in the Edlica Institute.
The students regularly visit students of the Edley Institute and take fun and interesting activities with them.
The same students have no means to get to teachers, and we try to give them this opportunity.
In the framework of the draft additional construction of the Edlica Institute, the future will be the building in which we move with this project.
A number of musical groups and executives will be held at each concept.
What was the selection criteria?
We've tried to prepare a program that interests all generations, including children.
For example, China, supporting Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bart, The Tap Tap, Mariyan Bango and Irje Suhi.
Besides all the details, you can find the www.kpks.cz website.
Are you planing some such "gredding activities" in the future?
I'll first speak to the Federal Prevention Guinea and we will, of course, prepare a interesting program with interesting guests.
In the next year, we would enjoy the presentation in the Czech National House in New York, and I personally, if we are in the United States, I would very like to speak in Washington and Chicago.
The report of the banners with serious plans, you have already spoken in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap Group is a group of people with limited opportunities.
How are you doing from the point of view of organization and logistics?
It's not so fearful as it seems to the first view.
We have five parts in the electric disabilities, their kitchens must travel to the pool office, more than the large number of goods and boards with tools.
However, until there was no problem, the Cheese aircraft and British Airways have always been prepared for us that I was surprised how many times.
Even in Moscow, since we've been back recently, all happened without problems.
Thanks to disasters, you can compare different countries with a view to accession, public relations to persons with disabilities and so far.
Why did you look at this moment?
After Mauritius, Luxembourg, London and other countries, where we all work better than us, we have become witnesses in Russia that the east is still at the base level.
As compared to Prago in Moscow, there is still a man’s self - movement to the electricity currency in the center of the city.
Not even in the course of a bathroom, how to take the road of persons with disabilities in the lift.
With happiness, public organizations are already endeavoured to address people with limited opportunities.
What, at all, should we continue to bring up the front countries?
There are very many things that are being implemented far behind.
But it is important to explain that improvement and improvement of the situation is always depending on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, people with a hard form of disabilities can go to the street, to the museum, to wherever...
There is no longer proliferation that the large number of people with limited opportunities take active participation in public life, so we're a little dealing with The Tap Tap!
The respect of public or unfairness is one thing, but at the time the known sports, artists, actors, policies or legals are to be changed.
As long as these are the only cases, people with strong will.
The Tap Tap Group is now very popular, but will we return for two years ago, which has made you to organise it in 1998?
I've done to the Edleyki Institute as a student, there's a lot of young people around me who wanted to take anything.
And since I am musicist and playing, including the scatter, the colleague organized the interesting musical circles together.
Well, with the time, as our leading Lady of angels says, it's a little bit out of control.
Popularity has come only in the last years, or do I get something?
This is true, we helped us to join the signed brain and work on the group ' s propaganda.
We came to find that no one can assess as if there was no one.
Thanks to the European Union, we can allow us to qualified teachers, equipment and otherwise.
Did you have been so good to spread the Tap Tap?
From the beginning I felt their ability to do something inevitable.
In Shaw-biz will make a full of things affected by one another.
This is logically, everything new is taken with care, and it's long.
There's very little rare things, but I'm sorry to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us of course is naturally...
But this misfortunateness is completely outstanding, because people with limited opportunities are not some suffering and all deprived personalities we have to laugh.
They are people who can live the full life and have, of course, only in the condition that they have the necessary resources.
I'm saying that if people with disability get something, it's not only a move for them, but also for the whole society.
Did you succeed with success that you are a hard manager that you are thinking of many?
If we want to work qualitatively, we must be in many things uncomfortable and keep a certain dissolution.
But I think it's okay.
Some people come to us with a romantic presentation and flight into clouds, and when they know that two times a week they should go to repair, visit preparatory courses and take a long time on the road, they are very fast losing entusiasm.
But this happens in any group that wants to work and to achieve something.
The Tap Tap Tap is currently in the group.
How many were they in the beginning of 1998?
Only one Lady of angels.
We're open a group, people come and go, it's impossible to prevent.
For those who have the desire and power of the will, our doors are always open.
It will be on day until the expected end of the light, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00.
The concert will go to Prague at Incheba Station, Bruno club Fleda and Ostrave, in the Plynojem centre with the 12-groups and other Tschech musicians.
To the end of the concept, all three cities are connected to the sterost at the time of implementing the Team Tap "The Lake of the light is abolished."
The objective of this project is to collect financial resources at 25 million krones for the acquisition of multifunctional free equipment for the STUDEO training centre at the Edelika Institute in Prague.
It's 400 kilometres for kids to 12 years.
Polar and cosmos.
Last week, at the ministers of the European Space Agency of Poland, it was adopted by the twentieth member of the European Space Agency as a second country of the Eastlock country (as Tchèa, which became a full member of EEC 12 September 2008).
Poland started close cooperation with ECA in 1994, and in the next years, a number of projects of agencies had participated actively.
But the path to the Poland Space started a lot before.
Before the Second World War of Police Enthusiasts were operated in the cosmost, but it did not always understand.
Remind, for example, about the lection A. Shernfold, which was represented on 6 December 1933 to the Warshaw Astronomic Observatory of the ideas of its newspaper "Introduction in the Kosovo".
The ideas of the young engineer (1905) have left the audio, after several years Shernfeld recorded that only Dr. Yan Gad was interested in his work.
In 1934, Sternfeld won the primary of Robert Esno-Peltri and Andrew Luis Hirsh for "Introduction to the Cosmonauta."
Dr. Yan Hadumian (1899 - 1966), which was mentioned above, then became a large propaganist of astronomy and cosmonautics.
He published a hundreds of articles in the Police magazines and wrote a number of books related to these scientific disiplines.
The Gadamia became a well-known world-level promotionist, and his contribution was appreciated, including the fact that one of the banks on the back side of Luna was named in his honor.
In 1925, a railway engine was already built in Poland.
Unfortunately, the author of this idea was not known as the details of the project.
It was not even clear, for the disappearance or for the carrier, the radiation should be used.
The information on this disaster is known only from the press of that epoca.
Since 1933, the Police artillery began to think about railing arrows.
Research had been carried out by the Arms Technology Section, in collaboration with Professionari Mechwald Wolfka and Gustav Mokjikhi.
The materials contained show that studies have been conducted to the statistics of practical testing.
But with the arrival of German work forces, it was stopped.
In 1937, the idea of the electronic electrical electrical electrical electric railway, proposed by the Russian engineer, and the next year was the work of the Watch Tower Railway and the Aviation Aviation Railway Railway and the Bomb's Aviation Railway.
Both projects were developed for the military use of railway engineers.
Before the war, all projects of military military use of the Racial Technology were taken by the Temporary Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Commissioner Doradczo-Naukowy), which coordinated all the work.
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years his work was completed since the beginning of war.
The next scientific work involved in the cosmocracy was appeared in the polar press after war by the Polish Astronautic Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first of the Society is mentioned in the 1954 magazine of the Employment magazine, in which four astronautic articles are published.
In one of them, the professor Mr. Saturdaykel proposed to organize a society that would be undertaken by the cosmocratics.
At the same time, trafficking projects of artificial partners had already been collected, and it was clear that space research was an prospective sector.
From the beginning of 1956, the Political Astronovic Astronovic Society (POA) had tried to enter into the international Federation of Astronautics (based in 1951) and had already been an active member of the OPA.
In the next year, the first Chairman of the POA Cazimej Zarkavich (1902 - 1959) became Vice-President of the International Astronovic Federation.
In 1959, he remained before his death.
Since 1956, POA has contributed a significant contribution to the development of a very successful meteorological radiation of RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which was the first Russian Railway, which had implemented scientific research.
The first type RM-1 was completed in 1957, and the first start was 10 October 1958.
The raketa, able to overlook the distance of 1800 metres, was about 80 cm long and its weight was at least 5 kg.
A improved version of RM-1A was later built, and 1959 in the Bloed wilderness was tested by the twoth RM-2 radiation.
This radiation was about 1.4 m, and its weight was about 11.5 km.
The next version of the racial was already in the state of the current scientific work of RM-34, which could over 14.5 km, and its observation was observed by the high wind.
However, further development was stopped in 1962.
The first RM Radius of the type of RM became a Meteor-1 radiation designed between 1962 and 1965.
The rocket was considered as a twice, its total length was 510 sm, and the initial weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types have been developed (used as Meteor-1A, -1V and -1C), which were different from the size of the cameras for scientific equipment.
The rocket Meteor-1A was distributed by 0.4 l, Meteor-1B - 0.34 l, and Meteor-1C - 0.62l.
The maximum length of the field of all three types was 37 km.
During the 1965-1968 Aviation Institute, the Meteor-2 electricity was developed and its first annual tests started in October 1970.
The rocket Meteor-2 was able to bring the useful carrier to about 60 km height.
The version of Meteor-2N and Meteor-3 was then built.
It should also be mentioned of the entry into Poland in COPAR (Space Research Commission) in 1960 and of the establishment of the National COPAR Committee two years later.
Furthermore, in the Intercosmos programme, Poland participated in the research of the Spacespace on the advice-arrests, and in 1978, the Pool Pirate Bay Peel Peel was the second intercosmonauta after the Rumic Remac.
Acknowledge the public work law is not solving the problems.
The Constitutional Court has changed the law on public work last week.
The establishment has been made out of a survival discussion in the society.
It is unfortunately interested to consider this issue with a broader point of view.
Free-oriented European economic systems, as well as in a global world, are based on the principle of a multi-related economic competition unreglemented principle.
In fact, this means that individual economic units, national economic systems are in constant conflict with each other.
This is related to the principle of free trade and free, not limited the movement of a private capital, together with unrecovered financial spare.
As a result of significant difference in the cost of the labour force (payment) is a cost-limitation.
This idea should be understood when the producer is trying to be in the economic competitiveness of the "competitive" value to take a large part of the market and therefore to increase their own income.
In the mass, this means the majority of enterprises, or the transport of landscapes, or decrease, or disappearance, and the unemployment is increased in countries where the value of the work force, compared to others, is high.
Since the private capital has no social responsibilities, including the unemployment of the unemployment, increases the inevitable costs of States to social needs.
In general, the situation strengthens the desires of businessers to pay taxes and therefore compensate public economic and social damage to them in the gain.
The situation is so well known that it is not necessary to provide specific statistics.
The observer methods of private capital are created at the level of the economy of individual States where the Governments are encouraging to competitive one another to reduce the social level of their population in order to join foreign capital country.
In other words, the Governments give their own population to a private capital, despite social attacks.
This is its reflection, above all, in the changes of existing legislation.
The aim is to make its people to undertake a destruction of the private capital, especially in the area of payment.
This acts as an economic consequence system in the case of long unemployment, and is also a tool for abolishing the rights of workers in the field of labour legislation.
The level of poverty is increased, together with the difference between the poor and the rich.
A number of years have been public distribution of poor products that have not been able to pursue their own work.
The number of people are already close to millions.
In the context of enhanced competitiveness of the German economy, there are cases when employees receive such wages that the State should pay them to receive a living minimum.
The similar scandal became aware of public and in the case of additional employees of Buddhist.
Economic measures are practically in all southern EU States, unfortunately, the same state in which people who are under the pressure of the social status have been deployed or immigrated, as it was in the 19th century, or there are a poor payment in the detriment of society, in hope that any time in the country will come a private investment capital.
But it's wondering where he's going to get?
If Capital comes from other EU countries, poverty is moved from one country to another, or it will not come, since the Chinese, Indian, the Brazilian, the Turkish, the Markocket, the Egyptian, the African is still working on the duty of the European wage payment.
This is about the whole Latin America.
Library theory and media of the media say that the State cannot participate in the capital of the own farm that the management economy leads to the economic catastrophe.
The Partial Capital insists on the fact that the State should not be managed by actions in the economy.
Should it further answer the question, does not the private capital now, practically manager policies and the most important State, in their own self-employment?
The unrecognised answer - yes.
The indication is the existence of the practical and lucky lobby in all States.
As a result, we have an inconsistent situation in corruption to ensure mutual benefits in the legislation where the punishment is almost not a crime.
In the FDG, the situation is that the Government Ministers, because of the lack of financial resources, are responsible for the development of the laws of private legal firms that are paid on the industry.
Afterward, these draft laws are stated by Bondestha.
The whole authority is not from the people, as stated by the Constitution of the Western Art, but from the financial and potential groups who prefer their own interests.
Apparently, the liberal-oriented democracy is now quickly provided in such a situation as Apiyan has been described in the “Crisis of the Roman Imperiation in the days of Cezaro and Pompe”: “The Justice is already disappeared, and the states are acting with violence.
The lands, illegally obtaining mercy through stones and swords.
The pursuit and corruption have proclaimed without any prohibition, and the people went to election with the recent voice "... the ordinary people have actually not been balanced on the office of the Governor, at the end of the State a few months without a consensus.". "There is to say that the only salvation in this terrible situation is self-detention and the need of the election of energy man." Apipeian thought that it would be Pompy but they became the Zeazar, which had finally changed the democratic in self-democracy.
Like the oldness, the modern society does not have their own uncertain interests without taking into account public interests.
The private capital is no longer intended for public use.
The current result is not different from the past: an unlike accident of elit without any effort to make more deepest reforms.
This means the reason that we have to find for the 19 and 20th century uncertain liberalization of the economic systems.
Today, the absence of these regimes and the existence of the democracy of the Liberal Type can be considered as a certain pouze after which the next tour is expected.
First of all, it is tragic that the current elit is completely ignored in hundreds of thousands of victims in the future, humanitarian and social catastrophes that we are now observed in the case of crimes against humanity, as we know from the old and new history.
The cancellation of the public work law is not a decision or at least not forever.
In the pressure of competition and at international and national and European levels, the Government of the Czech Republic will continue to search for further decrease of the social level.
This trend is therefore a system-wide character.
The decision is the objectives of political and social reforms that allow States to strengthen the commitment of the participation in the economy, strengthen the role of citizens in the management of the State and enhance the situation of a private capital in the society for the State.
Israel: Chaos Laboratory.
"Nothing goes out of violence, and never can't get out" Sting, the "Hropkie" song, where the main rocks are words: "We don't forget what we are shot."
"If my sons wouldn't want to war, they wouldn't have been." The dead Guell Shanper, Mary's wife Amshall Rotshild.
The latest concern of violence between Israel and Gaza sector, as always, has resulted in the multitudes of calls.
Some speak for Israel, argueing his position that he has the right to self-born, and the Palestinian people act in the role of terrorists, others support Palestinians, arguing that racism by Israel's nation, the genocide committed over the Palestinian Arabs, and the State of Israel is a role of terrorist State.
I don't want to think of the one who was born at the time of the current political situation, and no witnesses have been sentenced by the victim at the end of the Israeli citizens today, including self-organized territories.
My goal is to propose the readers to look for an appreciation, to look at who mostly served for 95 years of tension (as ready from the Balfura Declaration in November 1917) at the small part of the country of the Middle East.
Some of my discussions are understood by historical facts, some of them are based on my own understanding of someone or what group of people is the main movement engineer of the current history.
The history of humanity is mainly the story of power.
In each episode, we can find the same Alexander the Great or Napoleon.
What is not so clear - always whether these people have fully undertaken their steps in self-employed or someone who has been on their road who sent their action to the recent goals.
It should be possible that we live during the period when the world riches are concentrated in several persons, and that that money concentration and proven authority could not result in life of one generation.
In the middle of the astronomicly rich families, one could be considered as a head of a pit (I don't know whether someone is worth over them, but it is not excluded) Rotshilden.
They don't write many of them.
Sure.
The first news agency (Ritters) has bought already in the 1990s of the 19th century to stop listening to their name with criminal actions in the summits of which they had been, and who have always made to strengthen their authority, to increase riches or to the other and to the other.
They have large stakeholders in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries whose central banks they have not paid their wages, they lead or prepare war (for the invasion in Afghanistan had been over 7 countries, after the invasion to Iraq five countries, after the exit of Caddafia was only four, but then the Russian Government took the central bank in their country.)
Every one who tried to resist this family died.
Abraham Lincoln refused to keep the status of the Central Bank for the Russian Bank, during civil war, he began to leaving their own (prison government) money and was killed in 1865.
John F. Kenndy began to leaving their own money and wanted to cancel FED (Feed Reserve System), killed in 1963. The Deputy Lucis McFadden was compared in 1936 after he wanted to put the EDF for the license of the Great Economic Crime in 1929.
Their desire of the world power during the period from 1859 to 1871 had led to develop a plan of three world wars created by the large-scale mass of Albert Paek.
The first war was the destruction of the monarch States in Europe, the second should be destroyed by the colonial domination, particularly the British, and the third should lead to the reduction of the world population by about 0.5-1 billion (the number of slaves would be sufficient to ensure their competitiveness and rocks, and they will not need many resources), the creation of a unique universal religion (ecuminomy cannot be otherwise, except the suggestion for this project) and the endless defensive authority.
The method for which the group of the most rich families in the head with Rotshild is a crises and a follow-end proposal of decisions (ordination from Chao from Chao).
But these decisions are false and always lead to the situation (see the EDF, which should be prevented the recurrence of the crisis called them in 1907).
Thus, after they had been released the first world war by the murder of the Gabsburg heritage of the Astro-Wind throne of Ferdinand in Sarab, they destroyed the King Russia, starting a majorist revolution.
The first world war ended with an extraordinary, unforeseen in military and economic relations to the capital of Germany (although there was no need for war to destroy the King Russia) and, as a result, the development of the Central European Power, Australia and England.
In order to facilitate the second world war of bankers and policies, a close conflict situation was created by Germany, large military repairs, which had created a reference to the radialization of the emerging mass, then it was only to throw to the Germans achieving sufficiently strong, clear and proposed solution of the Worought, further creating a multinational Czechlovakia with strong German minorities, which had to play and actually play the function of the Fifth Colonel, in the light of the fire of war.
At the end of the 19th century, Rotshildi has been facilitated the basis of the synonistic movement, a flood whose wishes to create a Jewish State, a historic Jewish country with Jerusalem as a capital (reverting to Zion).
The Balfura Declaration referred to as a proposal for the Mass immigration of Jewish Jews in Palestinia, which was the first composition with the local Arab population.
Terrorist attacks occurred both sides.
The Second World War has succeeded, and it was difficult to assess whether Hitler was disappeared from the camps in which the bankers, or what he did, had been planned, in any case of the suffering of European Jewish in the concentratory camps, had made provisions for recognition of the Jewish State of the world.
Israel was officially founded in 1948 and, as Germany has been delivered by military repairs for the 2th World War, the State of Israel was promulgated to create the end of the third war.
If the international banker will be able to detach it, the Jewish people, such as in the Second World War, will become the victim of wars at the front, now, with the Arab or, more easily, the Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is a similar hygnist laboratory, a source of distortion and хаos not only within the country but also at international level (as only a strict separation of people to parties and counters of Israel).
Who is the victim of the Palestinian and Israeli conflict, where both in an endless chapter of violence, if all started with the desire of individuals and their efforts to the world authority?
This is the need to distinguish the ordinary people of Israel from their leaders, because, as we also have, international bankers are subject to people to vote in the elections of exclusively own candidates.
The New Minister of Israel, Nethanyahu, is the typical example of the Fashistic, Local International Banker, which makes it all to start war with Iran, which, thanks to the membership of Iran in Shanghai cooperation (India, Russia, Pakistan) will be threatening the convertement in a peaceful conflict, and taking into account the control of Iran on the Ormic Foundation, 20 per cent of all world-weapon stocks (World Cordor is only 2 million broad), and also leads to the destruction of the world economy.
In which light, the words of David Rockleler are now spoken in 1994: "All we need is a common crises, and people bring a new world order."
The new world order in their presentation is the peace of masters and slaves.
The world where the remaining part of human population is served by the warm financial warming of the competitor.
The world where each body is born at the birth is implanted by kips with which it becomes a substance under exact control.
" And puts all the small and great, rich and poor, free and slaves to be on the right hand or on the lie, so that a person who doesn't mark the name of the beast, or the number of his name could not buy nor sell.
This is how wisdom is: everyone who has understanding can calculate the number of animals.
For it corresponds to the name of the human, and the number is six hundred sixty six.
"Argo" Phillip, "Argo" and "Hollwood"
In November 1979, the ticket of the islamismist students in Teheran was detained and took 52 diplomates.
They had to be freed from exchange to the deployed Mohammad Rez Peelva, who fled after the revolution to the United States, which had been the coverer of his regime for decades.
For the Administration of the United States, the positive source of the situation was not intended - it could not allow himself to throw the ship, because it was in the corn to enhance the confidence of alliant in other countries.
However, to achieve liberalty of complaints in Iran, where the revolution has brought to establish a theocratic regime, it was not in state.
This was the pressure of the United States, which later has been strengthened by an unreasonable attempt to release force-based persons.
The final diplomates were finally released after 444 days after negotiations in the middle Government of Algeria.
Their jurisdiction had been caused for the concern of solidarity and anti-Standards.
The attack in Iran had significantly contributed to the attack of Jim Carter in the 1980 presidential elections completed by Ronald Reygan.

For a long time before the occupation of six employees was able to escape.
After comprehensive personalities, they ended their way in the province of Canada.
WHO in cooperation with the Canadian authorities had been able to remove them from Iran, so it helped the extracting legend of covering, according to which they went to Canadian Passports as a member of the Society Group engaged in the country for the country ' s scope of the scientific andфанist epiпеa.
Gender Compatibility
The plan that found a expert on the Evacuation of Tony Mendes required the cooperation of Hollywood.
In order to secure the legend, specialized newspapers were written on the project of the film, the pre-conference was attended and the industrial company had a real office.
The details of the operations have long been held in a secret, film based on Tony Mendesa's memorandums.
Aphlek film is a special combination of several genre.
On one side, the real political trilller, called "film-kinoopus", the story of the successful foretize, the farmers may be a number of films of friends of Oushan.
The film is constantly changed, from one side, documented walls from Tegeran (in tips the marked historic photos of events, and how the same situation has been demonstrated in the film is no major differences).
On the other hand, the black greenings on the irony and the dead exhibition.
And then there are more walls from the CBC Chamber and other coasts - men's situations on the tables of negotiations, forests, on the telephone ...
Benu Aflek's wonderfully able to make a carrier revolution.
The exchange actor became a respectful relaxer, and his game stopped to be a dream object.
The Argo operation of its third full-mile film after the dark detective, child, forgiver (2007) and the "Godd" (10).
At the same time, this is the first film of Aflek, which does not come into the family city of the Register Boston.
The atmosphere of the place is thus related to the qualitys that have increased the early film on the Holilwood Standard.
And Aphlek shows it in the Argo, where Tegeran plays Canada.
The best walls are on the streets, with the reconstruction of real events - the incoming walls of the low-level roads are a clearness that also transmits the emotions of paths and disagreements when sometimes changes the story.
The effect of Aflek and its colleagues is reached in the walls of the arts (social head on the EthiopianEran Base).
Too many processes in many places.
The Regimeer was to have a matter that aviation does not impose a variety of censy-minded walls.
It is quite successful to work with this, sometimes sometimes thinks -- it's not so electrically (the wine where the phone call in America prevents the airport of the Teheran airport and the aircraft appears quite nervous).
The Orgo is inadequately delayed with the need to show too many events in many places.
Alan Arkin and John Gudman in the Holiday colleagues are really aware of, but their personalists would serve more space and they are not the only one.
The film of Aflek does not have a little dramatic film, which is a film that can be seen with a dead interest, assessing the order and retro-style that is called the thirty-seventh trills.
But it's busy with work.
However, this is enough for reminder of one, still in a well-known meaning of a living story, as well as for witnessing how extensive the presentation of all powers and experts.
Rules of air pollution, baths and cycle
The port of www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which has announced an annual investigation of the most absurd bank collections, has now decided to announce the "the same absurd determination or project from the EU".
"It has been moved to this last event in which the EU plans to take the 40-procent cotton for women in the administration of large European companies," said Patrick Nager.
The recent decision of the European Court of Aboriginal Industry for Gender and Women's insurance contributions has been made.
Women have had loans for life insurance, because they are attractively undertakings.
"The most unbelievable ideas from the European Union can move to the competition until the end of this year.
The vote will be held to the end of February 2013," said Nager.
The EU's sports are, for example, and the obligatory addendum of biocampondents to fuel, which results in the nature and the prohibition of the use of confidencies only because they contained relatively a small number of dangerous substances, or the road size of cells, as a result of the real trip in this year.
The critics also have been an effective prohibition for the use of the term "bum oil" or extract from the sale of classic lambs.
Facilities must be 14 centimeters long.
The Common European Apparate is often decided by the pressure of a trade or industrial lobby, which is usually protected by any State or group of the State (Thakia now has delayed the requirements of their banks).
Those interests were: for example, high-quality banks in Europe should have reached long in 14 cm and have not tried to demonstrate the "anamic crises".
The European Commission was thus justified that only harmonized existing national rules that complicated trade.
Despite the contradiction of some States, however, the standards relating to fruits and fruits have declined that existing directives will lead to the disappearance of products.
The survey candidate may become the EU's last year decision, in accordance with which the aircraft sells needed to be warned that children are not able to harm them without prejudice to adults.
The EU has focused on American studies, in accordance with which airballs at the game are a potential cause for children ' s death through aircraft.
Such limit is now extended to children to 14 years, which have been prohibited in an armour duke.
Individual ideas are also born home
It is sufficiently absurd and the rules concerning the same European officers: everyone who has any official office in the EU may not, taking into account the disability of the topic for Greece, use the name of Macedonia and should be spoken "BUNDM" (Bourced Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The Portal Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the Liberal Economics "Printip Ininterestance" (Lassez Faire), proposed for vote, notwith the number of objection regulations, for example, the EU for food stocks in the territory of the Member State.
The EU has set the maximum amount of food stocks that could be on the Territory of the Czech Republic a day of its entry to Europe.
Following the Chechia, for example, the fixed amounts of conservated players, because she had a huge gun.
The investigator also interested and idead to pay some countries because they have no sea, and the idea of the subvention of subventions.
But these ideas came to Prague, not to Brissel.
"We are in an unwanted situation, because we have no sea.
Requests the European Union on Compensation, said in May 2004, the Chairman of the Agriculture Minister of Yarovos Pauls (CPD).
As a argument, he pointed out that the country had a high grain, and the State had full stocks that had to be removed.
Since the Czechya is far from ports, the EU, according to the Palestinian, had to pay for us hundreds of million euros.
In the end, the European Commission went to meet the Czech Republic, organizing trends to buy grain from countries that do not get out of the sea.
Subsidiations for subsidiation have proposed the Ministry of Regional Development, by the Minister of the United Nations Minister Paul (USDUE), in particular such subsidies had to be made to a subsequent statement from Brussels.
EU: Provisions are exclusive
Although the decisions in Member States are easily being an object of critical, the EU's policy efforts and the more effective functioning and development of Europe have been advised to many experts.
The serious problem, considering experts, is the deterioration of EU data on projects that have not even noticed a common point with the deterioration of European integration, but which Member States have reached the budget at the discussion.
It is an emotion between Chechs and that as in other countries of Europe, the Czech Republic must fight in Brussels for the right to special identification of its traditional products, as it is not always playing in this connection.
Although after six years of battle with Germans and Australians, the name of the "Olomoutic rays" was stored, but the Tradition which was in our country in the 19th century, our producers had to be named to the Tusq.
Bearing a rhythm can only be produced from the throat disaline, not of the swaking shock.
In the official list of EU-registered products, along with the globally known "feta" and "googendzola" series, the Marcipan of the German Love or Parmic Flower, has already been discovered, for example, the carovar shoes, the gorgeous and the threshboin corps and the soft heat.
The EU’s commercial knowledge can also be bored by the pardobic pearl and hot tube.
People want me to resolve the Republic, but I'm the favorite, says Ocamor.
Mr. Senator, how does a man come to the head to be balanced at the president's post?
I don't think of being a Senator or a president.
If we had everything in the country, I'd be balanced anywhere.
But I can't see how the country's last 20 years disappearances, as people rise up in weaknesses and pension ages.
I had no ambitions to be politics.
But when I see something I don't like, I'm trying to find a decision how to change it.
And as I have been forty-year-old and I'm an independent man who is not about any party, I have no other opportunity to affect things except to be balanced on the seat or the president.
You've been in Senate, but you've just gone to the president's bar.
Do you not turn back to those who have chosen you so?
I always said that I will be included in the fight for the President's stock depending on the results of elections in Senate.
Then I explained that if I was elected by Senator, I'll be balancing in the president.
My goal is not a position, the position is the tool that I can do with my views.
That's why I need the greatest influence and wide powers.
But the difficulty is not only that we have a nation to be a bar or a television, but then it's ready to break every one who's trying to change something.
Attachments are added to the MSIs, who are entitled to the freedom of words with lies.
For example, they told me that I'm a journalist adviser, or that I was the Peruvak Council.
Let's go to your views.
The fight for the President ' s barrier, you have started with the physical and criminal responsibilities of policies and the divorced property declarations for the sum of over twenty million.
In order to implement this, it is necessary to change the law.
You do not have such powers as President, and only a whole seat can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this task?
When I was a civilian lebbled to make an excursion become free enterprises, it has been able to continue.
The problem is policy -- when someone comes with a good proposal to the left or to the right, he has a sensely prevented, and it holds citizens.
As an independent unparty man, I have a lot of great capacity to support all parliamentary parties.
My privilege is that I'm without a politics parliament, without a view to dogmates, I can take every party the best for our country and apply it.
Are you thinking to be a person more relating to the right or to the left?
I think people are taking me closely to the left.
It's not important to me, a little left or a little right.
For me, it's important we're going forward.
It's not that someone relates to the right, and someone to the left, I want to assemble people.
I'll always support any good decision for society, whether it would propose the CPM or GDP, and I'll be so against the bad idea.
You're fucking when someone says you're gonna let it.
But don't you show that what you said?
When you're creating business funds for the company, you've also got some ideal targets and views.
And you're trying to get close to this.
It can be pleasant, but all the proposals I speak are already operated in the world, or the experts are talking about them.
But without supporting the parliament, you will only have a lounge.
And that's what you're going to have in politics for a long time.
Or do you think that when you come out and talk with them, you will be able to realize criminal and material responsibility?
I don't have any other opportunity.
Only ensuring politicians, journalists and publics and try to move them on our side to get our own.
If I were elected by the President, it would not be a problem to organize the direct television transmission, in which I am elected to the Chairpersons of Parliamental Parliament Party parties with a call for lawful and criminal responsibility for politicians, public officials, judges and prosecutors.
And they, in the case of refusal, must tell why they don't want it.
If there is a strong personality that sounds malnutrition, the pressure can be made on a political scene.
Take the direct elections of the President, it was a happiness of pressure from the public.
I say directly, I'm not a genius and I'm not intelligent.
I'm trying to seek the unioners to resolve my confidence and views.
I'm just starting in politics, and I'm trying to support most.
I'm trying to move myself, and if it's not going to end, six years later and return to the private sector.
It's often sounds like as if Ocamor should save Checa.
I'm not a salvator.
I know I'm not going to do anything, so I've been talking about a number of known people with a proposal to balance in Seneter.
I went to the Rady Yanchere, he refused to work with a large amount of work.
Meanwhile, I also supported at least the leading investigation of the journalist of Yana Londrawn, which discovered murmuring with light fuel products.
I made my candidate because people are not satisfied, but now I feel about the weight.
Sixty per cent of people have not been elected, but most of those who were elected by the representatives of the design.
Only two of us are independent in Senate.
People chosen Senate so that changes would be done with work.
Despite this, I will fight for my views, for example, for the direct choices of managers and governance.
Do you think about the basis of your party?
I wasn't thinking about that because I have no time to check the cleanness of every one of the potential parties, and I don't have the money.
No money and the President campaign, only twenty thousand kilometres.
You don't have money?
You're talking about the proper declarations, and how will your own affairs be on this?
Personal property is estimated by approximately 60 million.
I have part in Prague about 25 million, apartment for 10 million. Another apartment for 8 million, collection of arts produced approximately 10 million, Atton Martyn at 3,5 million and Scoda Superb for millions, well, and more million.
But I've got my little dream because it was my little dream -- I always liked James Bond who went on the car was a hair with women, and at the same time he fighted against landlessness and iniquity.
You're going to Estland, you're possessing 60 million, and you don't have a campaign?
You're saying you want to change the Republic, but your own money is particularly in the way you don't want to add it.
It's not very sure.
I don't have 15 million in the campaign.
Do I have to go in the debt?
I've already put 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors is witnessing that my program is not so interesting.
And I don't have to pay for a pre-conceived campaign from my carman.
The campaign's expenditure will cover me by the senator payment.
But for these money, for example, I couldn't have paid a son for an English school that is 30 thousand every month.
If I'd just want to buy money, there's nothing that would be balled.
So, you're going to work on business so that you can live?
Didn't you say you wouldn't reduce this action?
But it's not depending on the size of the payment.
As I promised, I partly reduced my activities.
For example, the director of the Turkish Agency will be my Employer.
People would want me to be an unprofessional one who would keep the Republic.
But I need to live something.
How much, as a businessman, have you been able to get a month?
From two hundred to four hundred thousand, I'm going to get further.
And if I were President, my company would end.
A full interview will be found on the Sabbath release of the "Thank" paper.
MVRDV architects demonstrate that the present attacks are not only in the image - for example of the Spinice and its recently built book - 2 photographs
"My building seems to be glad, it looks foturistic, finally we can see something interesting again," says Lizette Hood, walking on the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, the IT specialist at the nearby the large enterprises, believes, "No, this is a really beautiful building."
But I ask myself why we have another library today?
All have the Internet, iPad and the electronic books.
Nobody's now freely walking into such old libraries, right?
The Scotneys, a small swimming city under Rotterdam, has an unnecessary record.
His population has the lowest level of education in the Netherlands.
In order to combat this landscape, a few years ago, it was decided to contribute to the general education and to build seven industrial camps reflected on euro bankings as a lively depressed miners from iron.
The success of this educational initiative was modest.
And then the people of the city understood that they had the only opportunity to overcome the statistics: to build a library here!
The wines of Maas from the MVRDV architectural Office, the master of humble tables and the author of astronomic, sometimes, even civilly, has been attained to its usual non-consolidity and appeared to the competitive audition in 2003 with five books under the mouse and the smoke of the face.
And until the jury had looked at and slained with the pillars, the dragon Maas was set out of his original gift of the pearls in size and completed the terms in the protection of his project by the following words: "Attention!"
It's my proposal, "Backy Mountain" in Spinice, who is called Bunkerberg!
After nine years, this mountain has increased 30 million euros.
It is part of the project of revisivization, which also includes a pooled gas, supermarchet, posts and several of them inhabitants and taunhauses in the general complexion of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Second Conkurs premium of the World Library of the Netherlands was marked in 2012.
The project is also involved in the 2012 Hungarian forest arms national competition.
Thus, the unfair reward that could not previously propose nothing, except the postmodernist zone and a wonderfully incredible account, the white plants that are in the sense of the molecing, became divine by one of the timely architectors.
But the most important, in Spinice, appeared first in the history of this city, the public building of cultural design.
Long Path to Book
First impression: book Eldoro's for sir.
There is only one lift that goes in the centre of the mountain mass, because the true architectors and readers are encouraged to investigate the place by the pig.
It is light and easily encountered from all sides of the accommodation and electrical forest backgroundrs make a sense of the public city area unfortunately.
The city environment is perfectly created.
In view of the skills, dogs, and players of little kids and girls are free.
And everywhere, books, books, books.
"The book lines are likely far from the grounds, and the middle of the dark hall, as usually unfortunate and unfortunate," says Viney Maas.
We set classical space configuration from the feet on the head and dragged the area for reading outwards.
Internal mountain space was used: offices, Internet library, skill club, environmental centre and technical locations are distributed in the centre of offices.
In particular, the black book lines served by the section of the wall are parapettes, and the wooden pills.
Their species, texture and shoes are inadequate.
Even trial architects and engineers are lost in gigageries, what is for an unknown material.
"We have tried to work with second materials," he explains, "the manager of the project representing the Speekis community, in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
And once at one aggressive enterprises in France, we met an approximate agricultural product.
For many years in the temperatures and fields in the Netherlands, an artificial cluster material is applied in a millimetre of tonnes.
It's a decade and economism time.
The tunnel textil serves one two sessions and then you can select it.
For the library, this is the first in such assets, it was exposed in the four-seventh panel.
Subsequently, the pressure and pressure called the Netherlands (KLP) becomes a dark, unique, slow material, which is a little recording new car and a little cycle.
We're going to be 105 degrees.
Those who overcome the road of almost 500 metres will be overcome in the literature coffee not only in the city, but also in the Dutch steps and tree fashion in the mountains.
They are worried about the atmosphere, and first of the right power of the air on a literature mountain.
Loading for New soul
"There is difficult to believe, but a building, despite the multitude of steel surfaces, represents a educational project in the ecological plan," said the Threeborst.
It is used for the fuel and hotness of the earth.
Although the book’s mountain stands under a steel roof, even in clear days the sun falls inside only a long time.
Several farmers from clothed trees that are placed by the stackal face, give the shadows and take a major part of the sun aligns.
The climate is very nice.
The rest of the protection provides completely automatic wheel corners.
Stefan Spermon, mentioned above the IT section, has already visited a new library.
He's already been here.
The traditional traditional Chinese medicine Synthia Gottard, who was named Bukeberg, "in the spirit of Spinnesis, which was not long enough."
The reason: For a few weeks before opening, each resident was invited to offer a book of his own congregation.
These books should have taken empty spaces on the pillars not yet completely composed of the library - at that moment there was 70,000 books.
The idea worked.
The bars are set up top.
"Nothing worse than the foolish library," says the architect Vinni Maas.
"I think that, thanks to our invitation now, every resident has somehow related to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
Even if she serves only for the deployment.
The MVRDV has thus been able to decide the queen task called the establishment of identity.
The Spinice wrote his literature history.
And let them be very young and invisible.
This is only the initial point to build identity.
Sabo: "The Germans must play a more important role."
Germany was delayed in the vote of Palestinian recognition.
The view of Stefan Sabo, the expert on links between the United States and Europe, which is thus balanced by Berlin on a diplomatic road.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had understood that it was voting against the claims of Palestinian to receive a observer status to the United Nations.
But then Berlin was held by vote.
Why?
Stephen Sabo: Germany does not support Israeli acts in Gaza.
Germany now needs to be careful in relation to her particular relations with Israel.
But at once, I believe that the American position is not also supported.
Germany wished to demonstrate its independence, in the case of Israel too critically.
During the resurrection in Libya in March 2011, Germany was also held in the vote of the prohibited field zone.
The proposal was finally made by the NATO.
Germany is difficult to take clear position on complex international issues?
Yeah, it's right.
It is the fact that it is in the process of transforming its external policy, that is from the policy which, in the meaning, managed to the United States to its German external policy.
In addition, the situation is complicated that Europeans have no agreed European policies.
Thus, the Germans are once again between two fronts.
They are expected to play more independent role, but they did not increase it.
I think that until they just strike their role, but they're on the way to the "level normal" external policy.
Such external policy has been conducted by France or Britain.
What do you mean specifically by the outdoor policy with the German point of view?
It is ready to take place in their national interests, not exceeding the position of the United States or European partners.
I believe that the German external policy depends on economic policies, it is exporting and linking to certain regions such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
The economic interests of Germany are significantly different from the interests of other large States, and therefore Germany must protect their interests.
Have these economic interests to the position in the Middle East and to vote in the United Nations?
First, Germany has great markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Persian Zealand States.
It is therefore necessary to demonstrate carefulness that it should not hurt the public and elליs in the Arab countries.
Anyway, it plays its role.
But I wouldn't give it too much, it's not a fully unilateral connection.
But anyway, it plays an important role in the German calculations.
Did Germany hurt its relations with the United States, taking important decisions, such as Palestinian vote?
I am sure that Europe and even in the United States makes the understanding of the German position.
So I don't think it was the same dramatic oversight as in the lion question.
Germany may even receive a certain respect in this way.
This signifies that it should be taken as a player in the international army and that its interests should be considered.
There are different views on the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
On the contrary, it was clear for the wine.
Is there a disappearance of views between the United States and many European States?
Such differences have always existed in the power of the American internal policy.
I believe that the Government of Obama has sufficient understanding of the European position.
But in relation to the local political situation, the Government, of course, cannot be open to such a position.
I believe that significant disappearances in views are not as significant as always seems.
If you consider the relationship between Obama and the Prime Minister of Nathaniahu, you will note that Obama is not far from the Nethanian policy.
Is it easy to compare their close relationships with Israel and the United States on one side and the most important partner in the EU?
I think that makes such a difficult situation for the Germans.
Of course, the Germans would be a few more easier if there would be a unique, not contrary to the European policy, but now it is not.
Thus, they could not speak in a broader approach and have been deployed in place of the situation only in its own vision.
That's what they do with the Euro.
I think in the future, Germany will take a leading role in the development of a common European position.
It is clear that Germany is not easily easy, although it would be a connection with Israel.
This topic was always amazing.
But I think the Germans are clear that they should play more independent role.
If Germany himself looks at the role of an important international player, would it not be a really important role?
Or is the leading role still hard to Germany?
Germany has not yet betrayed this, until now it has been unfortunate and, in some cases, it has always been hard to play a significant role.
Let's see, for example, the euro crisis - every time Germany takes a important role, the most different anti-German feelings.
The Germans don't just get to do this.
In fact, it's an old problem: you don't want to be around the vulnerable countries.
Since this point, Germany is much more difficult than the United States.
It should take into account the most different neighbours and opinions, and it is not easy.
The impact in the European policy is therefore constantly disappeared, but at the moment of the EU does not complement the wagon, who then remains?
The Germans will just play a more important role.
Even if you don't like it, it's inadequate, or it makes you a life like that!

"Break safeguard" in China: when Puma and Armani will become Chinese
Armani is a worldly known trademark, Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is completely officially registered in China's name, which has nothing to do with the firms whose names it is formed.
Nevertheless, it will be protected until the owners of the originary names are not described.
But then it is not clear if they will have their right to disappear.
"Instinents are all more difficult to defend their commercial characters in China," said Thomas Patloch, a lawyer of Taylor Wessing, specialized by violations of the rights of trade trade marks in the East.
On my table, every week there is a new case of such a kind.
It is sufficiently added to any couple of letters to get the right to register their trade characters.
So from Gucci is Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada, you can register Prada-Kny.
The same way is legally copyed by German enterprises, such as the producer of Puma sports products.
Pattlok opens the folder with the status of the registration of good characters in Pakene.
On 14 September 2010, the Chinese company registered the trade mark of Zegna DF Puma, the artistic name in which also was used the name of the model house Ermenegildo Zegna.
The fact that the Chineses are the chips of the world for copying and violation of the rights of intellectual property is known.
In large cities, there are many burdens sold almost exclusively.
But the cases of Pattolaha are not such, but it is contrary to the fact that Chinese enterprises are fully received from the status of registration of goods characters to use a name that is already protected by somewhere else.
The Chineses call it "Ban minpay," a brand-saver.
This word is associate with "Ban dog."
Thus calls women who are flowing for rich men.
Chinese authorities do not recognize the fault
"It's a loss of business, so it's necessary to fight." The Patloh's acknowledged.
"Thood mark is disappeared, the unique situation is lost, the immense suffers very much."
Finance losses and processed costs in losses are calculated by millions, especially in cases of road-copyed products.
According to the CLSA market investigation company, China is the third size of 15 billion euros in year and the fastest growing market of raw products is the market.
However, the removal of certain records in the trade mark record is difficult, and it is worthy.
The process may rise to nine years, with an uncertain end.
Pattolah tells the cases in which the court rejected the ones, since a long time-term name was “the real market”.
If it's not going to make it, he'll even have to pay the platform, as the damage of his trade mark in China, says Patlok.
Sometimes here goes the dungle law.
There are also significant cases on graphical elements.
In 2009, Daimler's company has lost judicial dispute with the construction machines producer Sany, which has been a short timely acquired a producer of the Potzmeister producer.
So the Chineses have the right to use the emblem like the Mercedes star.
The Volvo Volvo company first used a black white logotype that recalled the BMW; the process was successful, Geely had to change it.
The producer of model goods, Lacoste, played in China immigrants from Hong Kong and Singapore, which looked at the other side.
The Chinese authorities do not seem to be offended.
The registration of the CTMO trademarks in Beijing confirms that there was a lack of staff and equipment in 2010.
But in the past year, it was “to turn from the emergency of the situation to the working process”.
Yes, the number of unemployed cases was decreased by 22 per cent.
Approximately 57,000 cases were closed, 75 per cent of more than the past year.
However, at least 81,500 claims are still waiting for production in the state.
Being fighting this cost
As often in China, numbers are impressed.
Last year, CTMO has made more than 1.4 million trade mark protection statements, almost a third part than 2010.
This record and means that China has registered a list of new records throughout the world, reported the state in the tenth time.
In the same way, the total number of active trade marks is of 5,5 million.
In 2011, 1,8 billion of the Juany congregations were paid.
If easy, this means that each registration is in the average of 1280 July or 160 euros.
Protecting it is a lot of times more than the case of the German family שמחnberg.
During more than seven years of conception, the Chinese pioneer fights.
The Germans had been achieved that illicit production has been eliminated by individual car details.
However, the inittor strengthened the Chinese rights to the trade mark of joynberg.
This was the own release, since the names in Germany do not be protected, said Hanno Ventzler, President of the Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Minnesone.
And the registration of trade marks of CTMO was rejected by men's claim.
True, both of the next joynberg institutions gained, but the opposite side continues to fight until now.
We need to be what
The issue is now at the Supreme Court's consideration.
Winzler hopes to bring the case to a good completion and glorify the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says, "The process is extremely out of the road and takes a lot of time, money and nervous."
Inside the costs are deemed to be undertaken, the firm architecture had to be checked even the acts of the century long to provide evidence.
Five years ago, joynberg had proposed an opposite "the largest sixth value in euro" for regulation.
"It's clear about how we're worth it," said Vincentler.
The Danish East threatens even to move into Europe.
In that case, if the initors register the same for unprotected trade marks.
Yes, one Chinese producer in Germany wanted to register the names of the joynberg for ovens and objects from the kit.
The concert has stopped the production in these areas, but despite it, it was possible to prevent the registration.
"We need to be what," said Vincentler.
As he and the lawyer Patlok recommend the German enterprises to be very careful with China.
It is not sufficient to trust international provisions on the protection of goods, more foreigners should “all that in any way it must be protected and registered in China”, he said Venzler.
Anyway, it may be a lot of value than the registration.
Indeed, if joynberg is lost in the last act of his trade mark, it's supposed to pay the other side of the license collections for its own name, Ventsler explains.
Anyway, we're going to get out of the market in a sports segment.
World Day of AIDS: Put, Slay, Help
In Haidelberg, the Imbóngi crown and the Swaziland Swaziland AIDS are glad about this.
History of relations overlooked over 8733 km.
At the beginning, the pumps are divided: cow swimmings, bactebow clothes, damic clothes and male cards gathered so on the parking area and quickly find it.
Two-thirds.
Only after this slowly, the voice of the cancers - Alt, baths, tenor and swimming -- they're attacked, crying and following each other.
And Fite Hopph, a 29-year-old discipline, is less explicit of his mother-mattern tuffs when he leads them deep and expressive pain.
The weekend, in the musical hall of the medical psychology institution in Haidelberg, the Imbonian Chor replicate a new song.
The repreciation of fifty core participants came from 23 to 69, from human genetics to the palace specialists.
"Om" Obani -- an unfair thing, each voice of the horn has its text, and then an extra language: the Zuluvian, in which 11 million in South Africa, Botswana, Levoto, Malawi, Mozambique and some parts of Swaziland.
Help for self-sufficient
According to the evaluation of Unids, the United Nations Programme for Aids is about 34 million of HIV identified in the world.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
Swaziland lives 245,000 AIDS circles.
Consequently, more than 40 per cent of the population of HIV are placed.
For 180 AIDS-shirts in the village of Estonia, a Voices for Africa found a head in Germany.
70 of them are visiting schools prepared for further education.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can take a sixth.
It guarantees a child ' s money at school, school form and daily warrant food in Hoog-Center.
The isolations in the Ulusian language means a speaker or a divorce.
In this room, they don't say that he's fly on the bunker, but they know how to sleep.
Before ten years of chore, the songs of this foreign language and from time even bring them back to where they first appear: South Africa.
Along with the distance of 8733 km of Haidelberg, north-west Kingdom of Swaziland, is a village of Essidjan, depending on the voices of the German horror.
Infected forty per cent
There are approximately 2000 people, some of them in simple powders of skin and slopes, among many children.
More than 300 of them remained without parents who died from the virus of HIV.
In Ethiopia, Swaziland’s disease is reflected in the ministry: the highest level of HIV-indication, the lowest of the world's expectancy of life on UNICEF.
The combustion of the extreme flesh in men that has been demonstrated reduced by the risk of fraud, is almost not accepted.
More than forty per cent of the population, Swaziland has a virus of immunodeficit, death in the middle of the fourth - not ratio.
Hor opened this village in the joint flight of Africa in 2005, but before Imbusian participants saw many children in the streets that were not only a parent care, but only: food, clothes, education.
There are no chances for human education in the poor country.
At the beginning, this was a private obligation of individual participants for a few euros a year to send a child to school and to give him an opportunity for daily food.
But a year later, the Hor founded the "Voices for Africa" union, which has almost been careful of HIV sirups in Estonia.
Infections transferred by the sex
What are the most important diseases transmitted by the sex?
The bacteritic PIP contains the ciphilix, calamis and tripper (gonee).
The frequencies of the virus are HIV, human Popillum virus, genetic herpes and hepatitis.
Lobby pedious and four hundred are related to the IPC parasitarian.
What are the major attacked groups?
Siphilis and honor are mainly meetings of men who have sex with men.
The Robert Coha Institute is that at least four of each of the five cases of the synthesis registered in Germany, the transfer of the result of sexual contacts between men.
The adults of getrasexuals often meet the diseases transmitted by sex are cholamide infections, trihomonasis, candides (grebbles), honor and human pallet virus.
The proliferation of HIV among geterossexual adults is relatively low, but approximately 20 percent of new HIV attacks are at this group.
Young Chalemid Infections are more frequent than other population groups.
According to European data, three four of all infections affect young people from 15 to 25 years.
We also have a people's Popillam Virus among young people.
How does the number of cases change?
None of the diseases transferred by the sex shall be compulsory.
According to the Institute of Robert Koha, more than 1697 cases have been doubled in 2001 to 3698 cases in 2011.
The number of new HIV wounds since 2007 is decreased.
In 2011, there were about 2700 cases.
This is approximately a decade than the previous year.
What symptoms show the veterinary disease?
Infectional diseases may result in genetics, debts, elections, behaviour, beverage pains, or pumps or plastics.
Nevertheless, they are not coherent with pain and other symptoms and remain unemployed.
How can we protect?
Preservation is able to reduce the risk of anger, but they do not give a percentage protection.
The whole survivors can also be distributed through contact infection and close physical contact.
The experts therefore recommend regular investigation, particularly when sexual partners are frequently changed.
In the early diagnosis, the majority of IPC can be evaluated and avoided consequences.
Sheefty, sacrifices and not last honorors for the statement of the Hoor throughout Germany allows some of them to gather.
"We've all sent to Essentian about 200,000 euros," says Annette Lennorz, Chairman of the Union.
In the village of Germany, the Second Dutch, a conscious and active woman, has been distributed in the country of Germany.
It also is concerned that the burdens are well established, for example, in one of the grandfathers.
Goose, named by the old women, is an opposition of the village.
Some have received up to 14 syrups, give them a cry on their head and are concerned about children in form every day in schools.
Those who have not remained parents have come to Haïvita, the only woman who receives payment from the union, as well as two famines every day prepared for more than 200 hungry children.
Furthermore, the "Voices for Africa" was organized a swimming school, built two smoothers and jointly with the American Health Organization of PSI organized HIV analysis for many villages.
It is hard to imagine, but the disease that is so obvious in the whole country prefers to be deeply silent.
King with 14 Women
"SID is an absolute tab," says Annette Lennort, "for what is related to sexuality."
It is sufficient for the country where the king is officially 14 female.
The last absolute black monarchs of Africa, King Msty III, known by love to disappearance.
Polyglymy instead of democracy.
In particular, such a sanctified State is also a wine because the virus of HIV has been so fast spread over the past years.
But it also lies on workers that have a virus on the country.
The paid preservations are literally on each corner, Annette Lennartz said, "but they are not almost useful.
Another culture is the flesh's flesh."
In order to support the cultural exchange, the chron of Ibbica performs a two-third journey in South Africa and poets songs, full grass, warm spirit, trust and black self-consciousness, which many in the south of the black continent still know from the time of apartheid.
The bus, full white sung in the black language, is not only acknowledgement and gladness, but even the eyes of serious borders have been made.
The trip is always going to have a trip, where the cancers visit the underlying children.
Although a small village with work can be found on a card, the river of Escalveni is more than she has known.
"Come to Ethioking, there's the light," they say, "the funny people's.
And after 8733 kilometre back to Haidelberg, when the pumps return to the Bergaymer street, you can see that this light is also moving here.

Our views in the World: important telescopes
The telescope was probably recovered in 1608 by Hans Lippersgeam before Galilaeus had come to watch the stars.
From then on, the smoke of the optical telescopes became more and the accessible views of their space are more deep.
During 30 years, namely from 1947 to 1975, a telescope "Haal" in the Panama Observatory of San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
I've had a diameter of five meters.
In Arzone, the U.S., set the Big Blookular Telescope.
It allows to look at the cosmos with two samples, each diameter 8,4 metres.
"Gran Telescope Canarias" has a hygigantic internal device - just one diameter is 10.4 metres.
The "Free South African Telescope" in South Africa has been seemed to reduce prices.
However, in the diameter it reaches approximately ten metres.
Inadequate constructive execution, telescope is hardly established under the vertical angle, which limits its movement.
The "Hobby Eberley" telescope in Texas also has a fixed vertical angle.
His speciality: high light power.
It's reaching -- although it's just a small screen diameter -- the greatest world telescope parameters.
The researchers are listed to external signals in the context of Azerisbo (Purto Rico).
Radiolescope has 305 meters of diameter.
Participing in the External Intelligence Project (SETI) any computer owner can help provide its estimated power.
See the Watchtower of the European Astronomic Service (ESO) in the Chili Ande.

The ESO observer is also planned to establish the European 'Trey large telescope'.
Its main sample must be spread on a total of 42 metres, and it will be made of almost 1000 sample elements.
However, the photograph should not previously be expected in 2018.
Before 2007, the two telescope of the KK in the Guyana Wood Mauna Kea was considered the greatest in the world.
They have two cercles of diameter at 10 meters.
The "K" telescopes include the Mauan-Kea observatory, which also looks at the sky with the Sobar and IRTTF telescopes.
Furthermore, a new hygantic telescope in Mauan-Kea should be shown, with a diameter of thirty meters.
They can love the illustration here.
However, the most important species of the space telescope is the Hambble.
From 24 April 1990, it becomes the pictures of the world.
Since March 2009, the Space Clepper telescope is looking for planet outside the Sun system, especially those who can live.

Scientists guess that, in the south of Mercuria, there's a lady.
However, there is no reliable data on this, since the Messeenger is close to the north planet.
Radar estimates for decades indicated that the Mercury was a lady.
Thanks to the Massheer in 2004, which turns around Mercury, scientists are now sure.

The end point is Lerick.
The small city has thrown a too heavy architectural time, which does not harmone the living mountains.
The tourists from Europe are almost not coming here, the way from the Azerbaijan capital Book is too slow.
On 323 km is eight hours, since the way is all one space.

It's my dear, he's here 120 years old.
He was born another child in 136 years
But a sporting star of the museum is a ball of Shirley Muslum, which was 168 years old.
Nothing of birth witnesses, however.
In view of the fact that the older person who has been confirmed by documents, the Moscow has been extremely suspected by the age of 122.
"He was born in this area in 1805, died in 1973," explains the Fatuava.
The husband was three times married, and he had 23 kids, 136 years old as if he had a daughter.
So, did the Musluim push add a couple of ten years to his age?
Even Rembrandt Scholz, a age researcher from the Max Plank Institute in Rosko, heard of the long-term Asians.
“Only many people of pregnant age can also be met in some areas of China, Japan or the Hungary valley of Pakistan,” said Shawn, “Sardinia also lives extremely many very old people.”
However, it is impossible for the absence of scientific and age documents because there were no civil status records.

Propaganda is not often sounding in an old woman.
However, the scope created around the folk of the father of the nation, which does not know the border of the country as a disaster in Azerbaijan.
He was authorized until 2003, then the blows of the government took his son Illham.
Nevertheless, there is no poverty among the Azerbaijan seniors.
230 managers (e.g. the same amount of euro) receives a monthly pension for local conditions for life.
And perhaps the growing son of the peacekeeper may also be right: "Thes in our culture are deep respect."
They live in a large family, loved, surrounding and happy.
What does not cause to stay in life as far as possible
The word " human rights" does not exist in the Constitution
The Revolution returned to Cairo.
Constructive demonstrations in Cairo have been shown of the deep shape of the country.
The future constitution based on the ball has met an enlarged race.
The Egyptian President did not buy paphos.
We need to create transition.
"And his success is in my responsibilities before the people and God," he said to the public television.
His words were treated to all the people, but first towards Christian copies, liberals, dedicated muslims and nonreligious Egyptians.
Those who have been unforgivingly designed to disappeared opposition have been attempted by fear.
The fear of the religious State in Nile for the favor of the powerful Brother-Musulman.
Mohammed Mursis, if he had not been excused, said that he had temporarily dismissed the authority of the Constitutional Court and extended its power to "to save the revolution."
However, in fact, he wants to save the 61-year engineer who has a doctor of South California's University, not fully clear to Egypt and the world.
Should the shipment force be sent?
In fact, article 234 had been made to proceed in the night 15-time scene with obstacles to the islamic constitutional congregation of 100 participants, and it is partly concerned.
As also in previous constitutions, the project said that the proceedings are affected by "the Islamic Right Principles".
But what does the Principes mean?
This was the case of interpretation, and it could be dangerous that the islamists would use a growing formulation and resulting in the legal luft for a more stretch settlement of the Balina.
At least, one new article contains: all cases concerning Balina should be taken to the University of Al-Ashar, the most important islamic institutions of the country that enjoys the major authority in all the Slovakim.
This should not be, but may mean that the spirituality is overseeing the legislation that de facto would have a consequence of the restriction of judicial authority.
The draft constitution is the subject of interpretation.
Another problem: the condemnation of civilians to the military court must be maintained.
These courts during the Mubaraca authorities served for the decrease of the opposers.
After the detective, 11,000 civilians were arrested in military prison.
Even as said in the project, the State should protect the “truly true sovereignty of the Egyptian family” and “a support of marriage and value”.
This is legally unlikely formulated that public institutions will be able to control even the container of movie and literature.
This text opened does not mean what's different as the price.
There is no article that direct equality of men and women exists.
The other prohibited the blasphemy and the prophecy of Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an anxiety, and how it should be punished, it remains uncertain.
Of course, the formulation is also made that it is prohibited by “a hurt of humans”.
Will it be sufficient for the President or the shots about justice?
The question of the interpretation, as many in this project, which is proposed for signing and which, in his words, will be submitted to the Egyptians to the referendum.
"Revolution has returned"
There are already several weeks against the prevalence of the islamismists.
Decades of thousands of people were gathered in a usual single airquarters at the Tuchrier area of Cairo and swore to destroy this document before he could enter into force.
"Revolution came back and we win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, who takes the third place in the presidential elections.
The Nobel World Prime Laureat and the former Leader of the International Communities on Atomic Energy Mohammed El-Baradei stated that the draft constitution was "a slow history".
By the service of short news of Twitter, he accused Mursy's commitments to call "pocket against democracy."
"If he's going to go to his palace and cast it," said the oppositioner Jaser Said.
"We have not yet risen, the blood of our brothers has not yet been released," we cited Egyptian media of the opposition policy of Holade Ali.
Many judges also reported that they wouldn't want to watch the referendum that would be done inactive.
"Corran - our Constitution"
It was well organized by "Bratya-Musulmana" in their way, that was called to opposite demonstration, but not at Tahir, and after the mass prayer at the other river of Nila before the Caire University.
It took a large number of women under the covers and the salibrates who cried: "The people requires the use of God's law."
They needed to say, "Corran is our Constitution."
The fight against the symbolic area on which it has been started has been aggravated by the state of the practical civil war.
The followers of Mursy, clearly, didn't want to go to this risk.
Britain-Musulman stated that both opposers and parties to the draft constitution were high and clear.
It is now time to give the people to decide in the electional horn, which should go to the country.
The majority of the islamist project is considered to be decisive.
"The "Thanks of Human Rights" isn't mentioned at any time.
Hafiz Abu Saed, in an ironyrous process of the established constitutional process, which, of course, had to be extended to February with the participation of all public forces.
The 48-year lawyer on human rights and the President of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOPR) protected the Brett-Musulman Brativ-Musulman, when they were in Mubara, or were sent before the court.
Not because he divided their disappearance, but because human rights were weeks for him.
For this he was killed, sentenced, arrested.
Now, the words " human rights" aren't ever met in a new Constitution, he regrets the World on Sunday.
The extension of Murus's influence on all three branches in the State is deployed by a lawyer.
Those measures are significantly vulnerable to democracy regulations and will bring Egypt to a new disappearance.
"Instead of strengthening the civil State, the President of the fact hated it," regret Saeda.
Unless civil civil organizations, democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels that all have left him, even a international community, which looks at the ideal fight against Nile with a slight pregnancy and tension.
This may be a payment.
The demonstrant in the Tachrir area warns: "You're creating a monster which you can't control."
Norwegian cancer: the stuffest fish in the world?
In the five-life population of Norway, one of the highest levels of life is not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Maybe the secret success of this country has been linked to a local device to a extremely damaging fishery?
Take a few shocks of sierra.
Put them in a smooth and new sports clothes.
Leave them there for a week.
You're gonna get a disagreement of the craffy shoes, one of the most famous Norways.
I'll be in a small city named Fagernes, three hours from Oslo.
It's very nice, but it's incredible smoke in the air.
Racphysk is a foral that has a salt and flood in water before year, depending on what the soul's need to be.
As soon as the summers are ruined and desired, the Norwegians are gathered to a festival in Fagernesa dedicated to the same, we'll say that he's hidden cup.
"They are eating steel and driving a pool of acabaith, local powder water," explains Havard Hallvarsen, a local fuel on the profession and the "Carphic General", who is managed by the festival.
People are all around us eating a small fish cube and swallowing it with small portions of the pearl.
"Whatever more like await than a cancer," said Haward.
This drink will be able to push the dogs.
I'll try a couple of cows.
If you're gonna be able to get a pocket under a narrow, it's not so bad and bad -- it's less different from the portion of the suit that you've got into the bus for a long time.
Racphysk is a Norway product completely other times when, before the pregnancy of hungers, the fish was hidden in the germaticly hidden boats with soil water.
Then the deep winter when the fish had already been good and basicly lost, it was thrown out and pushed into alcohol and used to eat.
Another memory of the past generation was the fact that thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search for work and immigrate, mainly in the United States.
However, the population has grown in more than 13 per cent of the immigrants who are engaged here by workers, high payments and social security systems.
The inhabitants of Sweden (learn sovereignty, and not so long and more older neighbour) have come to work here.
Racphysis is considered as a very important, intime, sometimely bad element of the past Norway.
It's one of the most lovely local guards.
On the other hand, there's all the precious, small swimming powder or sandwich, you will be at 9 cents of starings ($14).
Norway is rarely shown in world news, and most of the inhabitants of the country looks like it.
Meanwhile, here are still unfortunately mentioned on the name of Andreas Brivick, Racist and Extremist of the right topic, the past year of a slaughter and killer of 77 males, women and children.
Not mentioned by his name, the term is called "levening 22 July".
The Norways are very difficult to believe that one of their confrontation has been able to such animals and murder.
On the basis of today ' s well-being of Norway is the growth (with the start of the seventy-year-old) of the world's largest Neptune sectors.
"Anna, our officer, who has different contributions with the detention of the chrophia, a woman with long hairs and an explicitly blue eyes, a narrow wellness.
We're such a people as you call it is a judge.
As most of the Norways, she's greatly talking in English.
We don't like to show, we're not weak.
Norway is very carefully referring to its necks, most of the income income of the Neptegosis sector is invested into a special fund established for future generations.
In the years prior to the global financial crisis, Norwegian was married by all the costs that they had not had.
"That long you can fall on the low winter and walk in the spring of the age, it's enough for happiness," said Anna.
"And it's crooked," she adds with an unemployed laugh.
I'm standing in the snow at the time for some food-krophys missing me.
Here's the hamburger with a low meat is exactly economic, solar meat.
But at evening, we're waiting for more fish that's with a smooth smoke.
My guests have a special dinner regarding the cancer, during which the visitors have defined the best, or may be the most aromatic fish.
The direct television shows the conductor in the top-bark, around the turtle with the Craphian.
It's like the song of the Euroviation Competition.
"Yes, Tor-Ourgen, what evaluation have you made for the best fish there in the mountains?"
"Yes, Haward, here's our review."...
Everyone's laughing and applauding.
Somebody falls out of the rock, perhaps takes the availability.
Or, maybe, just smoking the smoke of this fish.
The President of Mexico Enrike Penny Neto is not a difficult start of the carriers.
Until the reorganized President of Mexico Enric Minya Neto is ready to enter into the post, the Corporate BBC Will Grent invites us to consider the difficulties that it should be addressed, and the huge expectations of the population of his country.
The rare movement in Mexico is now in particular weeping.
This city was overloaded by transport and at the best time, and from the week-end, a number of key masters were transferred to the table and chaos was sent to the road.
However, it was not done to give people the benefits to work, but to avoid protests to the building of the parliament.
On Tuesday, the new chapter of Mexico Enrique Pneyo will hope the President ' s movement and accept the flags of the Government of the country.
It's not easy to be before him.
Mexico has reached good economic indicators in the Administration of Felipe Calderona, which now consists of its powers, but the country has threatened drugs in war for six years.
"My Government commends the people of Mexico about his ready to fight violence," reported Mr. Pneyo Neto to the President of the United States Barac Obama at the full office of the White House.
I am going to propose a new security strategy that allows us to achieve this goal.
To those statements, close to the President of the United States, Mr. Penny Neto has developed at the post of his parent State of Mexico.
In his family, in the population and wide state, the country’s capital was divided views on new leaders.
Rightly A person
In the ideal city of Wale-de-Bravo, for example, it's hot.
Inhabitants have been subjected to the livelihood of tourism, the development of a smooth area and the establishment of infrastructure.
The city can be reached by one of the new shoes built by Mr. Penny Néto, differently different from the road with the ovens and the thresholds that were previously on this place.
Tables with its name are available to the modern building of a sporting centre and to an interactive museum related to climate changes.
"We are bound with him in real and serious changes," said his friend and political Alliance Gabriel Alover Ernends, the Congress of the State of Minneso Néto of the institutional revolutional party (PRI).
We are waiting for the present and decisive changes that are so necessary to our country, first in the field of security and economic development.
After 81, the Party of the PRI was issued in 2000, Vice-Fox.
The Congressman Olvera recognizes that after its 12-year-old absence in the Lois-Pipo Party Party, there are great hopes to Enrike Pneyo.
Furthermore, he shall proclaim the accused of uncontaminated complaints to the new President ' s opposition.
He is very direct and is very dedicated to the vision of the future country.
This is a high public deputy and, above all, a person who can listen to.
But in the other part of the State, many people have a different presentation of the former governance.
The Nessaualcott, also known under the name of Saud Nas, is the most different conflict with the powerful Wale-de-Bravo streets.
In many meanings, he is the reward of himself by Mexico.
The problems in the municipality also have a serious character of this megapolism.
Earlier in this year, for the reconciliation of drugs in these areas, military forces were brought to military, and the violence against women is particularly awesome.
Only in the past two years, a number of tens of women killed were discovered in the slaughter.
More than thousands of women were killed in the State of Mexico during the Governance of Mina Neto, that is significantly higher than the similar indicator in the gravely glorious of the city of Saudd-Hoaras, whose name was a detrimental when the murder of innocent women was speaking.
Mr. Penny Neto said that in the best case, he was not aware of the problem of the murder of women.
In the worst case, his administration is accused in full ignorance of this problem.
The inhabitant of the Beton house, like most of the houses in this district, Ireland Bundy is hardly laughing by showing me the photos of her peaceful daughter Marina Luna.
According to the official version of the Marianne, the self-assassination was committed in 2010.
However, her family believes that she killed her companion.
"When I came to her house, it was like that her body was shot before it," remembers Mrs. Bundy.
There were signs of what she killed, and the body was already covered.
The mother of Mary revealed this story, and the portrait of the daughters looked at us from the wall where he stands close to the cross, which is a word: justice.
In that way, it was rejected by the family.
" The customs persons of the State turned me as a former bedroom, unlawful peace-in-law.
They want people to just accept everything they say, and they're depressed.
But it's wrong, that's not possible, in particular when so many violations and disappointments are around."
The President of the Presidency on the Sabbath, the President of Peter Neto will take an unlawful responsibility.
Over the past six years, thousand families in Mexico have dismissed crimes related to violence and the new President promised to address the problem of priority during its government.
"I hope he will be exactly the same President as the Governor," said Olvera, a Congress of Wale-de-Bravo from the PRI Party.
However, this is most dangerous of the victims in Saud Nas.
Bradley Maning had not denied the wrong treatment, he claimed a complaint.
The prosecutors are seeking to announce the statements of Bradley Manninga on the bad terms of detention.
In hearing, a great attention was given to manninga's stay in the military prison in Quentinko, the Virginia State.
The protection needs to be closed as a result of the fact that the conditions for the conclusion of Mannina were cruel.
A number of thousand secret documents are accurated by the United States.
In Friday, the accused tried to demonstrate that the series of Maning accused in the largest refuge of the United States's history had not been used to grant a complaint on the bad treatment that, in his words, he had to move in the military prison.
During the delay of the sentence at Fort-Midid, the State of Maryland, the military prosecutor, Major Asen Ferne, said that the record of the daily visits by the Maninana's Office of the prison for nine months of its content in Quentinko, the Virginia State did not contend bad treatment.
The overall request for the review of the protection request for the detention of the Maninage cases, based on the fact that the conditions of his arrest were cruel and their own punishments were conducted on the next day after Maning said that it was in detention, he was encouraging to commit self-assassination.
The military analysis of the information analysis arrested in June 2010 is accused of a number of thousand secret documents during Iraq's service.
These materials were later published on the WikiLeaks website.
The WikiLeaks resource not confirmed that the source of information was exactly Maning.
During hearing on Tuesday, procurator Fine had reviewed reports which have been completed after visits of the Many of the Administration during his stay in Quentyco prison, where he was under a short terms of arrest from July 2010 to April 2011.
During visits, the prison officers asked questions and recorded answers.
When the prosecutor Fine asked for reports on Friday, Maning recognized that he assess the treatment by the prison administrator as a "prosecutor" and the general terms of detention as "houldly organized".
The reviewed reports do not contend the complaints of bad treatment, despite the question of the conditions of containment, the Fine states.
Maning responded that he had expressed an oral concern on these problems and that his visitors were attended by the Administration had discussed these problems with him and said that they were concerned but did not express this in writing.
"They were recorded "there are unprofit" (for the discussion of my complaints), but it doesn't mean that I have not understood this topic in the conversation," says Maning.
The military judge, head of Dening Lind, also asked Meninggo why he had not deemed to be wrong with him in January 2011 during the meeting of the Commission considered the society intentions he had expressed in writing for a few months before him.
Maning answered that at that meeting he wanted to take it to take the "made prevention" and to decline the conditions of decrease.
The representatives of the military manager explained that the limited detention regime at the below than the supervision regime to prevent self-assassination was introduced for the protection of the prisoner and for the security of others.
"I wanted to know of the administration that it's okay that they can disappoint the warning mode... to improve my life level in my view," said Maning.
In Thursday Mening revealed his arrest to Iraq and its translation to Kuwait, where it contained almost two months before they were transferred to military and marine base to Quentyko, Virginia, July 2010.
He reported that the thoughts of self-assassination occurred in Kuwait, and that once he lost awareness because of a huge burden.
He explained that psychological is very hard when you don't know how your participation is decided, and what happens in the outer world.
"My peace was laid to Camp-Arifgin's base, to my prison size," said Maning in Thursday.
I thought I'd die in this cell."
In Kentucky, Maning, on his words, conducted a large part of time in a small room at least 21 hours, and even more than 23 hours in the shot, in full singleness.
Maning tells him that he's allowed only to leave the mats, clothes, skins, some clothes and eyes.
He says he tried to move, as he was sleeping or even lie to daily time forbidden rules.
According to Maninga, while sleeping in his eyes, he continued to sleeve the light of the cameras.
If the defenders hadn't seen his face when he turned into his bed by night, they had built him and put him back to his back.
In January 2011, the Representative of Maning made an official statement on non-related treatment.
In April 2011, Mannua was transferred to military prison to Fort Lewivenworth, Canada.
Furthermore, in Tuesday, the court asked of Manina on the declaration he made during the presentation of shows in Thursday that after one night, after the night he had made his bed in his camera in Quentinko, he had forced his heads to stand before the defenders and other prisoners in the morning verification.
Maning said that he had no possibility of covering a board during the verification.
In response to the questions of the judge at Friday, Maning said that he had understood the order of the defenceer that he had to put off the clothes that could be covered, but he recognized that no one had directly commanded him to cast it.
In Thursday, Maning said that the previous night he had put his head to sleep because of his attempt to show the officer that he does not represent danger for himself.
Maning reported that the officer said that it could use a rock or a pillar record to make herself, but didn't do it.
The night, according to Maninga, his lower beachs, the skins and the eye were taken out of the cameras.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will learn what he was to overcome during the detention and will significantly reduce the time of the detention, if Manting would be recognized by a military court that should start the examination of his case at the beginning of the next year.
The defence stated that it was planned to propose Meningua to recognize less serious crimes, and other accused to be frauded as a cross-term.
Renewing hearing was planned for those outcomes, it is expected that the accused party would argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
Pentagon claims that Maning had been contained in Quentinco in accordance with the rules regulating the contents of arrested with the maximum stretch mode.
Among the accuses issued by Maninage, the comparison of the adversary, the illegal promotion of the internet, the transmission of information concerning national defence and the prevention of public property or documents.
If he shall be condemned in all paragraphs of the accused Act, he may condemnate a condemnation.
My crisis of national self-determination is the narration of the American of Mexico's origin.
The author considered that many Mexicons were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunity to make themselves.
The Mexicons are obliged to accuse those who have gone because they remember the inhabitants of the country of the complicated time.
Robin Navarett believes that the Mexicon of American origin was divided between two cultures.
During the recent trip to Mexico, I went through the carrier for those who arrived, came close to the border control area.
The symbols showed two views: one for Mexico (Mexicans), second for Extranjeros (Ironians).
I stood a few seconds before them, I don't know where to go.
I grew up in Central California, and I was called a Mexican.
It's just a conditional name, such as my friends in Boston call themselves Irish, and the friends of New York believe themselves Italians.
Then I stopped at the comprehensive building of the American of Mexico's origin.
But here I was in Mexico.
There, in my family, there were no needs in terms or complex constructions.
I was just an American.
I speak in Spanish enough good to ask questions or answer them.
But my vocational store is poorer than he has a tongue, and I can't escape from the American accent.
That's why I got my American passport and became for Extranjeros.
I remembered this story a few days ago when the re-elected President of Mexico Andrike Penny visited the White House and met the President of Obama.
At the agenda, the Chairpersons of the Countries had been accepted: immigration, drugs and trade.
The President of Penny Neto welcomed the arrival of the Mexico economy, which now the Mexicanians will be able to stay in Mexico instead of movement to the United States.
He wished to conclude a partnership agreement with the United States and Canada and to create some northern American trade block like Europe.
Furthermore, President Penny Neto promised to continue the war against drug drugs in Mexico, but no specific proposals had been made.
The relationship with the United States is difficult and performed by the two cases.
The majority of the United States never thought that in 1848 the United States had entered to Mexico and under the duty of the proceedings made her leaders to reject the half of its territory.
But the Mexicans are thinking of the capitals, not minutes, and see the memories of these events in all.
Therefore, only a State Delegate of the United States should be put to the word of criticism in Mexico, the press and among the Elliots of the Mexico society here is a complaint of the complaints that the United States will join the neighbourhood.
And the seeds of Monteusm are predominant to military.
The most complex relationship of Mexico is with more than 35 million of the Mexicon American origin living in the United States.
Do you want to talk about the two?
They're enough.
There are in Mexico winners and losses who are in this country for themselves and those for whom there is no opportunity.
In Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denvere or San Antonio, so many people of the Mexican origin were just one reason: at some moment their family story, somebody or some of them had not been able to realise themselves to Mexico and had to go to the northern.
Of all these were mexicans of a certain kind of smoke, painted, out of poor baptism families.
We're their seeds, and we remember it.
In Mexico, it sees otherwise.
Today, our life is a dream of American dream, we learned in good schools and made a good work, but we don't forget that even this dream is American, not Mexico.
Our national self-determination is black and unwise, but we know what country we consider.
The United States.
We also know that most representatives of the Mexican Elliot and the legal class do not love us.
We answer them the same.
They look at us the memory of the decreased plague and relate to us as the second warming, like the hated mexicans.
We're not enough to talk in Spanish and our communications with Mexico are not strong.
Our existence has been explained by unfortunates.
If our fronts were going to Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
We wouldn’t have been sealed now, finding a seat life in the United States but lost spiritual connections.
My wife was born in Guvadahara and had legally moved to the United States, and it recalls me that between the present Mexico and the Mexicon Americans there are certain trials, which are mexicans clearly understand their national identity, and the Americans of the Mexican origin are both.
It is a citizen of the United States and believes that both of these countries are.
At the same time, many my known Americans of the Mexican origin are not aware of any of them.
We listen to the Mexican Group Los Tigres of the Norte, but we love Briss Springsten.
If you get the best of the two worlds, you're inevitably losing the corne.
In Mexico, we are Americans.
And in the United States, we are called mexicans.
But now, as I explained during my trip, as if our relations were not sufficient, some Mexico leaders and intellectual representatives want to resume the relationship with disappearance.
They wish that the Americans of Mexico's origin work their kind of Messengers and represent their interests in the United States.
We could tell our friends of the United States what this great country is and how well it could be visited and oversee political leaders to strengthen communication with Mexico.
Yeah, of course.
Nothing's going out.
Too many of them in the past.
In view of the dispute between the rich and the poor, the corruption and the drugs have spread, many of us do not consider that this country's pretty appreciation.
I'm sorry, but you're talking about it, myos.
And that's fair.
If a part of the Mexicons has not yet been able to forgive the United States how they had done with Mexico a half-eight years ago, they will be accepted and accepted that some American origin still in both for the fact that they have recently come to Mexico with their parents.
Oh, yeah.
Thank you, we've got more common than I thought.
Old battles in the New Middle East
Agreement on the ceasing of fire between Israel and the Hammas group may become a chrope foundation for further peace
Does a long-term peace between the Arabs and the Israelites in the Middle East?
The Mediterranean Radius of blood suggests that such hopes are self-determined.
It sounds that were pregnant and unconscious disputes about the first began; the multitudes of the buildings were converted into the destruction; over 140 Palestinians killed, most of which were civilians and six Israelites; first of the conflicts issued from the Gaza Sector, railways fell in the area of the capital of Israeli Tel Abiba and the sanctuary city of Jerusalem.
However, despite the fact that Israel and the Palestinians have been unfortunately bound in their outcoming conflict, changes have been changed in the Middle East.
This can be different, however, the “Arabic feed” events have been shot in a smooth smoke of the realition, and the Palestinians with the Israelites could not be able to stay in the middle of the ground, the huge region.
Their fight may be more bloody than before.
However, there are reasons that hopes to come out of this mortal tuppick.
Uncommon war without vinders
The first consideration of the situation does not affect optimism.
Even if the cease stop, which was signed on 21 November, would be fulfilled by both sides at this week, only strengthened the position of forces from both parties.
The leaders of the Islamismist movement of Hamas, which came to the Gaza sector in 2007, claim that they had tried to turn Israel, despite their losses.
Although some group leaders were destroyed, 1,7 million were blocked in one of the most huge and problems of our planet, Israel could not destroy Hamas.
Actually, Hamas has its popularity in the West River of Jordan, another Palestinian territory currently controlled by Fath's more dead movement.
Moreover, the Hamas leaders may fully find that the time is working on them.
As the impact of the islamismist movements in the Arab world in Hamas is a new influence and rich friends.
The returning regional leader of Turkey, which has ever been the closest Union of Israel among the Muslim countries, expressed the Hamas support; its example followed Katar, one of the rich and dynamic developing States of the Persian forest.
Thresholds of Hamas demonstrate that the establishment of the Israeli islamismist moon - from Lebanon to the north, which rules the Military Group of Hezbal, to Syria, where the Islamic stations are all disappeared by Bashara Asad, and further to Jordan, where the king's authorities threaten the Alliances of Hamass.
The most significant change of the balance of force in the southern borders of Israel has occurred in the Popular and important Arab country in Egypt, where Muhammad Murus has strengthened the impact of the movement of the brothers-Musulman.
Hosney Mubarak, who had a regulation by Egypt for 30 years and was deployed in 2011, was a light detective, without particular attention to the support of Hamas.
The brothers-Musulmans, oppositely, are organizations, in a lot similar to Hamas, and their leaders are slower to the populal.
In future diplomatic stations, Hamas may become a significant player whose voice will not be deployed even by Israel and America.
At the same time, parts of the "feat" line in Israel will come to opposite conclusions.
The military meaning of Hamas was denied.
The Israeli counter-radio system has justified expenditures for it and has successfully destroyed many of the lacked Hamas Rail.
Israeli armies may sleep quiet, at least some time.
With regard to diplomacy, the United States have remained faithful for their unchanged position, and many European countries also have caused guilty for the last round of violence in Hammas.
Another important factor is the Israel ' s economic prosperity, particularly with the Government of the Nice-Netanian Government, which has significantly ignored the peace process.
Although, since 2004, approximately 30 Israeli died from the ruling issued from the Gaza Sector, Israel had been able to address the minimum problem of terrorism, part of the wall on the West River region of Jordan, a significant part of the non-conscious Palestinian State, and has continued to expand, despite the illegality of such actions in terms of international legislation.
The position of the Minister of Nethanyahu, whose Party, Licud's preparation on 22 January, was more aggressively established by aggressive conservators under the Guideline of Abigador Liberman, is very pleasant.
What means to make Palestinians and give them a State own?
If they are given all authority in the West Bank, wouldn't they start launching railways from there on the side of Israel, how do their collection in the Gaza sector?
Better keeping them away from the street and hard to make any attempt to lift up their heads.
Parts may be gained, but their expenditures may be proclaimed by the Arab later.
In the fact that the islamists who come to Egypt and other countries are not the most warmest feelings to Israel, their tasks will be internal problems.
The share of the Israeli budget is more than all its Arab neighbours together.
The license of war with the regional super-staining authorities should help the Governments of Arab countries to strengthen their own economy.
The progress of the President of Egypt, Mursy, who, jointly with Barak Obama, worked on the cease of fire, is a good character and may be recognized as a beginning of change.
Israel, at least, should take into account the long-term consequences of its policy.
As democracy changes in the Arab countries, the absence of the Palestinian right to self-determination is the bomb of an interlocuted action which is early or later formed in the occupied Israeli territories, such as the bus set out in Tel-Avie this week.
Representation is already undermined by the basis of the democratic order in the Jewish State, and the demographical aspects of the growth of the Arab population only affects these problems.
For blood-proliferate operations each year in the Gaza Sector for the Hamas movement should be paid to the growing inadequate of the international community.
Both sides need for external impulses
The only decision to which the health representatives of both parties are not present, and the major part of the rest of the world and our newspaper: education of two States and income to Israel ' s Territory in exchange of security.
The hope remains, not too urgent in a short term, hope that the cease of fire allows other countries to be more effectively affected by conflict.
Egypt, which is long to decide to overcome weapons in the Gaza sector, as well as Turkey and Catar, has been encouraging to overlook Hamas to recognize the Jewish border, adopted from 1967, taking into account the exchange of territories and joint use of Jerusalem.
Other Arab countries should also bring efforts to reconcile Hamas and Fath movements.
This would be made more to create a Palestinian State than the current vote in the United Nations, which could be recognized by the virtual State of Palestinian.
His role in establishing Israel on the table of negotiations should also play the President of Obama.
During his first time, he did not present its own peace-making plan.
After returning to the White house, he continues to demonstrate the desire to address this problem.
It's a catastrophic position.
The United States are vitally interested in stability in the Middle East.
This may only be in the case of a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australia entered into force the law on the universalized packaging for cigarette.
The warning of smoke and images of hurted diseases of the body are contrary to the huge green boxes, the same for all cygarette marks.
The first in the world practices of Australian law on the unity of synthetics and tactical objects has entered into force by replaceing the legumes and the colour of different brands of the unique cow-cool with the smooth smooths of the body disease and the images of children that are healthful by their parents.
Besides the different images and signatures that warn the smoke, the only difference between the packages imposed to the same sabbath is the names of the brands contained by the unique small font.
It's the most serious circumstances in the world for the formulation of packaging topics.
The Federal Government of Australia states that the goal of this action is to keep youth from the smoke, abandoning the harmful behaviour of the model status.
As a result of this decision, research results shown that people who have not starting smoke up to 26 are in 99 cases from 100 and never become fuels.
" It appears that even in the age of young children understand the meaning that they are attempting to provide a secret company with the support of the drugs-formation Minister of Health of Tanya Pillibercas, referring to research that, for example, the coron is associated to children with prince ideas.
Australia is one of the least countries in the world, so that these changes will not be considered particularly on the arrival of transnational corporations, but the possibility of adopting such measures is already considered.
Representatives of the Town industry have intensely resisted the adoption of the law.
Tobacco firms claim that it will only increase the share of the black market that will be selled and available synergies.
"This law will lead to serious consequences, particularly from those who had thought of his initiatives," believes Scott Mankindr, representative of British American Tobacco company in Australia.
The producers of sub-products from China and Indonesia will make more of these goods to sale on Australia's streets.
For somebody, otherwise, new laws help to grow business.
Sanдра Ha from the small family company Zico Import Pty Ltd claims that the demand for portraits and the forces covering images on the drugs is sought to grow up from two months ago, such as British American Tobacco, Britain Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco had spent the case in the high court of Australia, where they had tried to appeal the law.
According to Sandrah Ha, Zico's company has already implemented six thousand objects to the optimum trade and expected a new party.
It's a good business for us.
The potential place for effectiveness of such measures is, according to the experts, the popularity of social networks between the part of the population to which these measures are aimed.
Following the adoption of a number of laws made by non-legal television advertisements, and support of their sports activities, as well as prohibiting producers to provide synagogues on a viewed place, the reports of the objects have been moved to the Internet.
The Government of Australia has forbidden local companies and websites to make a newspaper on the network, but it cannot be limited to this foreign sites.
"If you're driving tactic objects and you have just the little lake, the idea that you're going to move your good on the Internet will be very angry," explains Becky Friman who investigates public health issues at the University of Sidon.
Friman notes the growth of the number of trademarks recorded by persons as normal users, such as social networks, such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
There's a question -- is this really the case of a number of civilians that likes Marlboro's sygarettes so much that not missed force and time and made a video, or that's the cost of an advertising company?
The British American Tobacco company office claims that more employed adaptation to new rules than advertisement.
Representatives of the Town industry have even gone to actions such as the United Nations, the Honduras and the Dominican Republic for compliance with new rules: these States represent the claims within the World Trade Organization, noting that trade has been unjusticed, despite the fact that trade relations of all these countries with Australia are very important.
WTO decision is expected to mid- 2013.
According to Tani Plibercas, the Government discussed other countries the possibility of adopting similar liabilities.
In 2001, Canada was the first compulsory place of photographs which warned the damage of fuming.
This rule is now adopted in more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
The possibility of existing laws is considered in Britain, New Zealand, UNAAR and India.
Many fuels in Australia have not demonstrated new news.
These pictures don't do me.
I just don't look at it.
"It's just going to clothe the sigarette and put a patch into the carton," says Victor El Higg who buys sigarettes from the photos shot off the patch.
It's the only thing that can leave me is my little daughter.
Jams You, a store of the King of the Pack in the centre of Sidon, claims that the single package has complied with the task of settlement-up goods.
"I've got a new party load, and now it's four hours," he's crazy.
"The Master had to take and completely prohibite sigarettes, we would then say what to do, finely, we close the store," said he, slowing his hands up.
Increasing electronic networks and permanent connections in the world, it's not so bad and bad.
In that thanks Day, I was supposed to keep five hours in the airport because our aircraft had found mechanical disappearances and replaced the other aircraft that we were waiting for.
So I had enough time to think about the nature of the shock.
I won't lie you.
At the middle of the airport, it's really crazy, and there's no books or magazines, nor iPhone, nor even stores of free trade.
However, in recent time, more scientists and specialists of child development have been expressed in the use of shopping.
They say that in certain situations we and our children are not so bad and bad.
This has to do with the interesting topics that may help creativity.
And as we're all in the modern world, we're all constantly in front of some screen, the privileges of the shoes are over us.
Maybe we need to try to shot?
Yeah.
And not at the same time.
We'll be back to that.
Earlier, as many, I believed that the lack was the discovery about recent times when people appeared more free time.
This is not true, Peter Tui, professor of the Greek and Roman history of the Canada University of Calgary, author of the Lively History of the University of Culgary, 2011 (Boredom: A Lively History, Yale University Press).
"Actually the shock can hide very old story," he said.
In the walls of Pompies, Latin signs were found on the cup dated for the first century.
There is a open question of how we understand the scene.
The problem is, John D. Iwed, a professor of the University of York in Wintero, Canada, has often changed the understanding and vision of the sample.
As a study of research materials on the topic and asked the target group of 100 people, Professional Ivoire and his colleagues came to the following definition: the lack is when people "whove, but they can't take the pleasure to them."
The difference between the shock and the apathy, says, is that the miserable person does nothing what he wants to do.
It doesn't want to do anything in the attraction.
The main part of the survivor, he said, is “unlawing attention and related to this disappearance and feeling that time is sudden.”
The depression may appear very similar to depression.
However, professor Ivoire claims that, despite the possible link between these situations, people suffering the causes of problems in the world and circumstances, people who survive depression see problems.
Sometimes we think we're lucky when we actually have to be easy to focus something.
In its research, "Uncomfortable understanding: definition of the scope of attention," published in the September of the Perspectives Journal on Psychological Science, Professional Unit with colleagues refers to the previous experts of which the participants heard the record of the vote reading magazine.
Some participants also heard the sound sounds not referring to the teleprogrammes included in the neighbour room, others heard the same sounds in the lower voice so that they could be disappeared, and the third group had only heard the voice without a straight sound.
The participants who heard the television with a lower voice level noted that they had harder, most of others, they were difficult to concentrate but they didn't know the reasons of that and recorded that.
When we are trying to concentrate the difficult or incentive task, the interruption can cause the test, says, Mark J. Feenke, the non-ourologist professor at the University of Guilfo, Vincent, and one of the authors of this research.
On the other hand, when we do something uninteressant, "for example, seeing a conveyant flow in the search for marriage, the music can help avoid the shock."
It seems that when people start to pending on the rock or to paint the cartels on the paper, they do it from the cup, but now we know that such actions are just helping not to disappear physically.
"The investigation showed that children who do not allow children to disappear and turn to learn better and remember more information than children who need to sit softly," says professor Phensica.
In some moment, we all tried to shot: when we stop the air (as in my case), hearing a monon talk by admonitioning an uninterest film.
However, different people demonstrate a different stage of disappearance to the clothes.
In the 1980s, the researchers have developed a special "country area to the sacks" for measurement of such individual characteristics.
For the definition of this scene assessment, the matters and approvals are used, for example, "Much of what I have to do, unlikely and monotone" or "I'm too interested, therefore, no time."
As a result, researchers identified that boys suffered more often girls, says Steve Woodhinik, professor of psychology at the West Floride University, particularly when there were different outdoor irritants.
However, adolescents are often suffering.
In 1991, Rid Larson, professor of personal and public development at the University of Illinos, conducted an expert during which he was connected with a piger by almost 400 percent and their parents 7-8 times a day.
He received the following results: 32 per cent stated that their home jobs were crazy at school and 23 per cent stated that they were challenging outside the school.
It was only 3 percent of the parents noted that they were sad.
Professional Larson notes that he had no information on what would be likely to be the sample now, 21 years later.
However, he knows that "in adolescent age is a pig of disappearance," mostly because children and adolescents are not allowed to decide what they are doing.
Return to my initial question: is the fault useful?
Sometimes there is no, because in extreme demonstrations it may show research people to absurd and dangerous physical actions, risk-related igrams or the use of certain substances in the trial to escape.
On the other hand, many philosophes and writers thought about the relationship between the shock and the creature, says the professor Wardonikch, who dedicated the problem to more than two decades.
"It's our brain tells us that we should take something else; that's a shot," says Herry Marcus, professor of psychological in the University of New York.
But this brain doesn't always know what it's better to do.
If you're crazy, and you'll send this energy to a hydrau or culiary experience, you'll be better.
But if you're gonna look at the television, you'll be better for some time, and soon it'll happen.
So if your kid misses and you give a iPad, he'll stop missing, but he's not going to learn to fight yourself or any other way to manage his time and occupation, is professor Fensica says.
"And such provisions of self-related regulation are carried out in the most different situations," he states.
Your child is learned not only to take yourself, but also to learn to self-control.
I don't think the fuck is to get somebody.
However, it's not important to consider something bad.
Quickly, it should be learned to feel comfortable even without an uninterrupted flow of action and technology.
Professional Yuzad is agreed with this.
"We're seeing it so that we need to make a saddle, when the cup is very unfortunate, uncertainly desire to take something sense," he says.
In fact, people are trying to disappear from permanent concerns and just to disappear.
"In the modern world, we've reached a constant extensive stimulation of sense organs," he says, "and when a quiet is, we lose and don't know what to do."
Unlike how the new law on the equilibration of marrious in the Colordo State will be applied
Antony Oscow, nine-year playing the Football Team and a public college student in the South-East State of Colordo is convicted in the offence that it would soon be lawful in all the State territory: the preservation of a small portion of marriage and tube in which he burned it.
Mr. Oscho says he was once in September with friends in Lamar and went to the press car over the border of Cansas when they stopped the police.
Following the police found in the marihuana car, Mr. Orosco has been sent to the court for drug retention and appointment for the use of drugs and small offences, for each of which a proceeding of $100, and the date of the judicial meeting was appointed.
"We're talking to the criminals," Mr. Orscock says.
But is he a criminal?
The uncertainty that continues a few weeks after the Colordo State voted for the legitimalization of the use of martyrs in small numbers of disappearance, the decision of hundreds of small cases depends on the law as much from the place of consideration.
The accused in small crimes related to the marihuana is already disappeared in hundreds of cases here and in Washington, which took an similar measure.
Police parties have already stopped the accused of persons aged 21 and the elderly for the preservation of small debts, which would be considered legally while only a couple of weeks will enter into force.
However, in more conservative neighbours of Colordo, the accused decided to consider existing cases related to the marijuana and continue to be responsible for the preservation of the drugs.
At the same time, in some towns from Denver to the Ocean Mountains, they are voting that they would not allow the appearance in their places of new licensed store states for sales.
"All this is so excited that I don't even know what's going on," said Daniel Ottens, the policeman in the city of Aurora east from Denver.
Representatives of control bodies in the State of Washington have also been respected by heads.
They need to create rules to define the order of enforcement, processing, dissemination and sales of martyrs, and all this should be done until 1 December 2013.
They say that Colordo is well or bad, the majority of other states in resolving the issue of marriage, firstly in medical purposes and now to disappear.
"In Colombia, they will serve a good example," explains Brian I. Smith, representative of the Council for Production and Alcohol production in Washington.
But now no one can do any more, recognizes Mr. Smith than some proposals to be made and hope that it's done.
"We have no real presidency on which we could orientate," he said.
The draft State of Washington, named I-502, will enter into force on 6 December and the whole year, in the state will be uncertainable when the State licensing system is not yet legal and the right of the marihua is already legal.
However, there are still non-related technical aspects that should be decided during this period, for example, how to find a balance between the “properly access” to the Licensed Marihuania, with an prohibition to trade it at 1000 feet from school, parks, games and child gardens.
"It will be very difficult to make the licensed trade of a marihuana, particularly in Site and its benefits," explain Ben Livingston, a representative of the recently established research team of the Center for Mariday Training.
On 21 November, the Chief of Police Outs from Aurora sent his submitting to the email that the procurement of the city will no longer be taken to those reaching 21 years of age, to the liability for the small number of martyrs, and that the police stops to distinguish people in the data of violations “the same from this moment”.
The officer of the police Outs reported that the police would follow the rule in the city of regulatory activities of marihuana for medical purposes and will pursue illegal traders and drug distributors.
Welld's surrounding prosecutor to North Colordo, Ken Back, represents a closer approach to this issue.
After the vote on the draft law, he stated that the procurement would continue to be responsible for the possession of a marihuana, mainly in order to encourage those using the persons of the treatment course.
At this time, 119 persons are convicted in the preservation of two and less of the guests, although many of them are accused in other violations.
"The responsibility of our institutions to pursue the actions that are considered by crimes at the time of their perfection," said Mr. Buck in his statement.
The response was not yet significant, even in areas such as the Middle Agriculture, where the vote parties rejected the proposal for the marginalization.
The Grend Jankshen police, the largest city in the area, has no longer been responsible for the small number of drugs.
The Surrounding Prosecutor Pete Hautcinger supported the decision, but also decided not to take the accused for open cases related to the preserve of marine.
"I think to ensure the compliance of the law until he's changed, our direct responsibility," he said.
Although 55 per cent of the people of the Colombian State participating in the vote, this decision supported the inclusion of marriage uses for public and legal developments would not be simple.
And the contrary reaction of residents in different places in the State has noticed the significance of local authorities to the expertise of the state with the marihuana.
"In the environment, there is a cultural barrier," explains Shan Makillester, the Danish lawyer, representing the interests of the condemnation of martyrs, and the local representative of the National Organization of Reforming Laws on Marokouan.
"They have persecuted people so long for that that now they can't confusion with that that's no crime," he says.
Colordo and Washington, the first states in which a small number of marine are related to the same as alcohol was dealt to become an experimental pool in the country to verify the same ideas of drug interpretation.
Participants and officials of the State plan to expand the territory of the legitimated trade, but at the same time they are waiting for indications from federal authorities that are still planned to consider sales and growth as federal crimes.
Moroccoliation Parties hope that the Office of Justice will address this issue.
Despite a few of the wide resonances of trade arrests and patients used by marijuana on medical indications, the Federal Government in most cases gave good for the trade of marijuana for medical purposes in Colombia, Washington and 16 other States.
Agents of the Office on Drugs will be infringed in the house to persuade a small package of martyn, but they would have to be able to close their eyes to the regulated authorities of the re-recreased marine, which are allowed by the new law, Kevin A. Sabeth, the former Adviser for Drugs In Oba Administration.
Some cities in Colombia have not been waiting for federal authorities.
Again, some local administrations were approved for the opening of new store store stores, which could not be opened before a year later.
The past week of Montrous, the town in the Western State, has made an approximation for the six months of a marihuana trade, which will appear to be approved for the next week.
"We don't want to show that we're led to someone, and then it solved serious problems at the federal level," says Bob Nikolason, a member of the city Council.
Our city voted against this amendment.
And now we are contrary to the results of the local vote and to what the State has voted.
There are still many uncertain issues.
Peterel Whitt: I lived from Oxford because I'm a conservator.
The investigation of university students has not started today.
How long I remember, I always dreamed to go to the University of Oxford.
My father and older brother were learned in Oxford and described it as a better educational training in the world, a modern analogy of anti-thetic symptom that sets two foundations for civilization, liberty and patience.
Yet, two weeks after the history of the U.S. School of the University of Oxford at the end of the eighteenth, I've gathered the kidneys and went out, which was the first scenal in my life.
My dad didn't hold up and cry.
Boths were fighted with a towel.
The Evening Standard said I had left the college because I didn't like my fellows' sex in the neighborhood room.
Dr. Norman Wilson shot me out because I had to drink out of the cups.
In fact, it wasn't so funny.
I fled.
Yeah, I fled because I've been systematicly grassed and destroyed.
Not all because of my name, or of what I learned at private school.
Only for one reason, and in this glorious colleague of dedication, this appeared to the actual rebellion and blind fatalism: my father, now quiet Wood Whitt, was known as Margaret Tetcher, and I was the part of the conservators.
You'll ask what to remember that now?
According to the last generation of students who hold the legal centreist views, the same generation is subject to the same generation.
This institutional and continuous hatred to students in Oxford is so strong that, last week, the group of students needed the same protection of their rights as those provided by persons with disabilities, sexual and ethnic minorities.
Conservators from the study club of Corpus Crist in Cambriji stated that their "timely actively deployed, attaining personal attacks and make feeling unwanted guests" because of their political views.
They wish to enter the Committee on Equality Rights of the Additional Representative to ensure the freedom of expressing their opinion.
Their situation was only aggravated recently at BBC 2 documentary film on the studying policy in the “Strana wonders: youth, smart and right” in which conservators represented experts and neonatics.
The film was shown by Joe Kuk, the former President of the Conservators of the University of Oxford, who was traveling to the Rolls Rolls Rolls Ross, was a silver bone and three with a silver balancer.
In other university students, they are deserved that they are "related for lessons in order to improve education payment".
Luke Bluck, 20 years old, Vice-President of the Association of the Notugues University, in an interview of one of the resurrect journals, said that "in the University's environment grows overcast in the left side of views.
Those who don't even know us are thinking of our deep and impressed children of rich parents."
Samuël Roberts, 21-year-old student of the history of the college of Corpus Cristy, which was requested for the promotion of the protection, called the "neuut" atmosphere, and Stefanie Churchil, 19-year-old President of the Conservators of the University of Oxford, said that the relationship of members of the Student Club to the Headquarters of Justice Research was significantly disappeared.
"There is a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion and just for the normal life of club members," she said.
The first weeks in Oxford I wasn't just in minority, I was alone.
I went there in September 1986, working and eighteen-year-old girls.
Oxford missed from hate to a conservative party.
For the year before the university, Margaret Tetcher, the former student of the U.S., has granted its consideration to the reduction of budgetary subsidies to higher education.
In such an atmosphere, even a stater would be unfortunate.
In the first days of the first week, the first curseur, when students know each other and the teachers, I first felt that I was waiting for.
I didn't know yet that students had looked at their fingerprints on the grain of students, but also with pleasure to participate in it.
Political issues - the deployment of skitters, privatization and non-related Governments to apply sanctions against the Government of Apartheid in the UNAAR - have resulted on the widespread forests of the audio wall.
At my first seminar, I had to translate the French text of the eighth century to English, and I was not ready to follow it.
"Ms. Whitt, said the teacher, now quiet Harry Pete, please transfer the first paragraph."
I've been working, I've stopped.
Harry Pete was a very nice man with a face like a tower.
"Theshers don't learn French or they're just missing?" he asked.
Other students were drunk.
I have the laughings in my eyes.
"I would like you to take a few first French lessons in free time if you are, of course, not very busy, returning to society," she's professor Pete.
I came back to my room very unfortunate.
At that evening, I sat on a dinner, then somebody knocked me on the scene.
This was James, second course student of English Faculty, who was a member of the University Conservatory Association.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
- Unfortunately, the case shall be the following:
Every one who is suspected in the symptoms of the conservators will appear.
I'm not easy, and in your case they know that your dad's nigh to Margaret Tetcher, so you'll be harder.
The majority of the Conservators is made that they are lobbyists."
Then, in the local pope, I tried to smile.
I argued that I agreed not with all that Margaret Tetcher says.
It wasn't hurt.
The first factor of the philosophy philosophy, policies and economics that he had learned in Ethan, said: “You are the daughter of the Fashis Sown.
You're now."
Other students have revealed his words.
I was an emotional, crazy.
"What are the conservators doing sex?
- They knock each other, right?
I felt as if I should have feeled homosexualists before the cancellation of criminal persecution in the sixty-year-old years.
Can I ever live a normal life in Oxford?
Or do I have to meet the univers only under the cover of the night?
Should I be a lobby and hide my true conviction?
The next three years have become a breach of persecution and unity.
The only teachers in my college, not covering his conservative views, was Norman Stoun, professor of a timely history.
It was hated not only because it was a Conservator, but also because he was a Tetcher Adviser on external policy and one of its experts.
He didn't actually appear in college.
He presumed him for provinciality, minority and adherence to the marxismist view of history.
In 1997, he took a Professional office at the University of Billent in Ankara, Turkey.
"Where you're not happy," he said to me.
I began to travel to Oxford from the parent house to London, trying to find a survival between parents and unprecedented capital friends.
I said to his father I hated Oxford and explained the reason.
He didn't believe me.
During his training in the forty-year-old, all political views were taken.
"But it's the best university in the world," said he missedly.
- There's no possibility, just not in the city of driving shoes...
Even my friends, the communists always have made themselves low."
His own eyes were shot.
" Don't take successful decisions.
I'm sure they're just fucking.
You're going to make me a heart if you're going to leave university."
I was discovered by permanent travels to London and my emotional protection was weak.
My friend, also a conservator, did not have pressure and refused his convictions.
The next week, during the seminar, when the story teacher was very seriously called me "related people," I decided to do the same.
In my soul of shame, I was recognized that my parents were smoking the brain, and called them "learn ducks."
The shot was short.
The last thing in my carrier's card in Oxford was defended to kill my father.
At that time, he wrote on the two columns every week for the Rapert Merdok's publications.
My door was closed.
I didn't get out, and after five minutes my persecutors came away.
When they went, I gathered the kitchen and came to the first trip to London.
I didn't come back.
You can call me a penny and a ticket.
But in the eighteen years, no one should become an object of such malice and drugs in education.
The worse that it was Oxford, who had not only released the fourteen ministry of tourism, but at this time is covered by an unsatisfactory republication of university, which appreciated equality and freedom.
"Walentine prefers the luminosity of glory."
ABC speaks with Nati Abassil, Fissen-Bornemis and other known clients of the Italian designer
Conmerset-Haus, the former republic of the English Queen Elizabeth I, the only place in the British capital, worthy to accept a statement on Valentino Garbani.
The designer recognized this during the opening "Ventinno: Master Shitiya", a three-employment-retrospective exhibition that joined more than 130 high models created by his "dome" over the past 50 years.
"Good this palace," he said with his unrecovered Italian accent.
This exhibition is a final part of the story, the only person whose "synchron" is, but it could not be written without his named clients.
Valentine always felt a ransom and a world to know.
In the first room of this exhibition, open to 3 March, personal letters and photographs are signed by the most famous artistics, from the Princess of Salam Aga-Han to the Lord Snodoon, including Mari Shantal, Greece Princess, and Margaret, Britain Princess.
Valentine shows these personal memories as the trophes of its social support: from the humble port of the city of Wager to the north of Italy to the wage of the International Elliot.
Be loved in the Queen palace, there is nothing wrong.
"It wouldn't have the cars of his sigarettes on your great ship, as it's doing some wonderful stars of the pop-music stars," says the Barross Fiona Tissen-Bornemitic.
We lived both in Alpah in the 60s and 70s and were good friends.
Valentino is an unfair master and takes guests with emotion and elegance.
"We all liked to come to his hair to Gustaad," she explains the former "Haïni", Tissen, a close friend of forgotten beloved Marlemla Anelly or Niarhos' Evasion.
Valentine always prefered the ellipsis of glory.
Notwithstanding that, he's a star.
Valery of Mauritius, represented by Valentino
A Argentinan model, Varrya Maschia, recalls the characteristic model.
One day we went to serve his house, it was after showing a model on Spain in Rome, many years ago.
During the twentieth invited, Sheron Staun and John Kenndy were younger.
The Style of Valentino was presented in every detail of his apartment, in her election, in the house, in the music.
"Each of the guests of Valentino has made feeling important and loved," mentions the "pool-modell" work started with the model in 1995 during a high model week in Paris.
"He doesn't come out of the mode, because his skies are the real art event," she ends.
Consequences of Dearly
The life of Garbani is not a reception, but the love of all.
He loves people with good education and high titles, and they love him.
One of the Sommerset-Haus galeries was converted to a global rate of sixty meters long, which offers a roof change: the visitor takes the models and should define the event, the "grow" serving of the grass, which covers six degrees from Valentino, such as the plate chosen Jaklin Kenndy for his neighbouring with Aristo Siesis, the coast that had used the Monica Vitti in "Neochi", or the pool of the shirts and the kits that had belonged to the Imperium of Faar Deba.
In this publication, there are names such as Sibille Luxembourg, the Gloria ' s background of Turkn Taxis, Matte-Marith from Norway, Russia from Bulgaria or Sofia Gabsburg.
Nata Abacucil and modeler in 2006
Many of these clients say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "I can't forget."
I remember him great.
These were shots, robbery, tits, and shoots from the axis collection of 1971-1972.
"It was a gift that he did to me," said Nati Abacuc, one of the museum of the designer.
"I appreciate him for his marriage, for his great love to women, because he stresss our beauty," adds the formerherherogin of the Frya.
I like the colours he's used: they've got a lot of light and they're "speaking" to his face.
Ideal proportions.
The Princess and the Deputy Modern of Patricia shared Jovampoola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time when he was dressed in Valentino.
When I was aged and lived in Italy, I dreamed that I'd be aged and caused to hope one of his evening tunnels...
Finally, that time was at the end of the 1990s.
I bought my first bed from Valentino to trust him at the feast in my cousin's lock, Prince Edward de Line.
It's been a red bed, with shot with boxes, "sack" in a piece and uncovered.
"It was a dream that has become the appearance," said the widow of Rodrigo D"Arenberg.
"Walently equal to the mode, his suffering is an outer time," explains this Italian artist that lives between Paris, New York and Business.
The Princess d'Arrenberg keeps his daily payment from the model with the "maximum attention... because the payment is not just a payment, it's also the pleasure of memories that bring it. "
Krone Mode
The Great Facility Exhibition to Sommerset-Haus - Mari Chantal Miller for her marriage with Pauls from Greece in 1995.
It was about four months of work and 25 " boys" (as called the model of his swiss), to produce this card of the color of the low ox with the incorporation of the icean, the 12 species of different circles and shapes in four and half metres.
According to the journalist of Suzi Menks, the greatest authorisation of the specialized premium, the payment represents the eight of the end of the 20th century, "to turning clients from the highest world."
The "style of life" of many years, now Valentino himself is its best representative.
The Cavallier of the Great Baptist (although the highest early in Italy), the Chavaler of Labour, the commander of Arts and Dictionary, awarded by the Order of the Comprehensive Legion, assembled the same respects as any of his customers’ marriage.
"It has always been awaiting him, his peace, his acquare and unprecedented appearance," remembers the "Arrenberg".
The last time I saw him a month ago at the daily dinner in Musée Ors.
He sat in a table with Jaklin de Ribe, my great friend.
"He was unqualified, the time is not for him."
If it's telling a princess...
The hardest work in the world: the skills from Kavah-Idyan
Four Euros of Indonesian shoes risk life and health, with 70 kilometres of series on the top of the volcano on the rocky stone troop
There are people for whom their work is from, and others are literally working in the axis.
Among them, Anto Vigiya, one of the 400 skitters who operate for the life of a wink in Cavah-Iden, situated on the east of the Indonesian island of Job.
And every day Anto gets down to the dark cocktail, where a serniture gas rising out of the earth remains in contact with the air.
The huge seats of the grass, which may reach 70 kg, put them into two bombs, raising the cells on the pillar and leaving them on the top of the rocky road.
The Ulcan level of 2.386 metres is only 250 meters, but the powerful drivers are needed more than 40 minutes to reach the trailing step, with the work of the equality and attentively pressure ways to not come to and fall from the choice.
They know that one unnecessary step can cost them life, as it happened with one Turkish in France, who had crashed a few years ago from the Cavah-Ijyan Steel.
Café-Ijyan's skitters pay five euros for each kilogram of seeds that gets
In response to the top, they put their way between tourists that photographed them, as if they were mysters from the circles and, leaving the hard moves, walking three kilometres to the weight that the company has lowered at least 1,850 metres above.
This is the PT Candy Ngremibi, the company operating this volcano since 1960, and not better to say his employees that it pays 662 Indonesian rupes (5 euros) for each kilogram.
It sells it for 10,000 rubbers (83 euros) to non-technical production, since this mineral is distributed daily and used to produce pigs, phospheres, cosmetics, dynamics, and even to solve sahar.
"When the transfer of 70 kilograms is, we're selling about 46,000 roads (3,8 euros) for each road," explains an Anto, who usually performs three daily transfers.
He will take three hours to each of them and at the end it feels disappeared, but they allow him to cut 138.000 rocks (11.5 euros) to the end of the day.
Although this seems to be a mixer for such a non-human efforts, it's the third time that he's hired in the field.
" The average payment of the shotters is very high by the local measures where 15,000 coffee roads are paid for the collection of (1,2 Euro) per day and average monthly equality of two million roads (167 euros) - explains the carrier who previously worked a stone in the Tourist Island Bally.
Its payment was 75,000 euros (6,2 euros) on the day, and it was not so hard, but Anto returned to his family to Banuvanga, a city away from the Uganda, for the reception of the reason that in Indonesia was like a series: "I married a girl with Bally, where one of the Indians, and brought it to Iwawa, to take a mess."
Anto astm, he's driving with the work, constantly smelling, and he's smiling his eyes from the toxic gass.
In his 27-year-old, Anto was three years of risk in Cavah-Idden, whose sister was already starting to deal with the mass and special objects.
He's got astm, he's knocking with work, he's constantly hurrying, and he's smoking his eyes from the toxic gas that produces volcanos.
This is the price he must pay for the achievement of his dream.
"I work more than two years, because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French," he promises more than the acceptable English.
The dedicated life, the pleasant and wise young man could be a tourist, official or port, but instead of the work of the museum.
For a huge villa's hair with other nards, he rises every day in two hours of night, because the seed can't stop fly out at night when its natural bright color is converted into the blue and blown among the dream.
Anto's nice calls to the shadow, gets down into the bottle, putting himself the way to a small backgroundr connected to his ass, which he bought for his money.
A cut of 400 narrows clothes the trash with the swimming powders from the Ulcan
Despite high arrivals, the company has not mechanised exchange rates for the cost economy and does not provide any equipment to the carriers who work on their account and with such disappearances.
In fact, they don't even receive parts of 30,000 ropes (2.5 euros) of the photosmetic collection, which, along with a 15.000 ropes, will be accompanied from the turists who come to photograph the volcan and his people.
"It's a work for the animal, not for the people," said Bridgen, the cornean nabloor of 42 years, who held on Cavach-Idian three decades since he left the college.
The special expenditure to 110 kilograms, he believes it will suffer the work "such as he can" because he needs three children to educate their ages from 18 to 10 years.
I'm not going to pension, I'm gonna die here, because Walkan is all my life.
Although the smoke is smooth and waits for the eyes when the wind changes and throws the skills into the hot tables that come out of the volcano, they are so outlined that no one is in their hard diseases... is more seriously clear than their addictive problems with disappearance, artrosis, pains in tribes and guns that have been demonstrated under the severity of the corn.
The planning chain on the back, the Winter can only up 50 kilograms in its 53 years.
Every day, he and his company are 15 tonnes of volcano that are carrying three carriers to Tamenari, overlooking the distance of 18 kilometres to the troop between the adults.
"I'm not going to pension, I'll die here, because the volcan is my whole life," said the Weather, who opens the mouth that does not have a few dogs.
Of his five children, elderly, 30 years, also works a carrier.
The time is passed, but the poverty enlightens from the generation of one of the hardest business in the world: what is the human mulls of Capeyan.
Singapore seeks children to save the economy
Singapore accuses carriers, stresss and prices for housing and education in the absence of children.
"Singapur seat needs to grow."
I'm my husband of patriot, you're my marriage patriot, full of our civil debt and creating life!
It may be unbelievable that these lines are part of the logic leather's news, but despite this -- or maybe, this video has become a white video at YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
These expressions are part of the repatriation that uses local reservations like "Give a boo (boo) in the pool" to be deployed over the levels of growth in Singapore.
The advertised agency that has done this video, BBH, hopes that the advertisement will be able to take attention to the problem in a disappearable form.
His creative director, Duck Gamalton, says he wanted to use music power to make people 'to make their national debt'.
This thing is exclusive for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is a major problem in the country.
We're the worst in the world for the reproduction of ourselves, so we felt that it's the subject we're supposed to be stumbled.
We knew that the Government had tried to do a lot, for example, to execute spiritual launch with farmers or to organize faster knowledge partys (see).
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but have been unnecessarily working.
So we thought why we wouldn't do the most creative thing from the possibility to solve this problem, that's how to make the rep?
1.2 Children
Whoever does not take it so easy, this is the Government of Singapore.
It will pay $1,300 per year for a policy for civilians to be born a more number of children.
The State package for marriage parks and parents provides $15,000 for child, extends marriage and species and provides logistics.
But all this has low effectiveness.
Singapore is a rich and high-technology worth State in South-East Asia, also known by the conservation of its management and its close public control.
The growth level in Singapore, in accordance with its national population management, is currently at 1,2 children to women.
The last time he was below 2 - that was known as the percentage of accommodations - in 1976.
So why do the Singapurs not have more kids?
Tan Way Min, Director of the Conciliation Policy Office and the National Population Management Family, said that the reason for "verbised education" and "level larger gamma of shorter opportunities".
"There has allowed people to have a wide range of options in terms of living objectives and priorities, except marriage and family creation," explains.
These social standards have increased the number of choosings and the allocation of marriage and child birth, resulting in the reduction of growth in Singapore.
However, the immigration policy aimed at enhance immigration in opposing population reduction is the rise among the local population.
Singapore, there are web sites where there is little hidden xenophobia for many new immigrants, particularly Chineses who criticize that are low-level supporting and non-qualified integration.
The growth of immigration is also considered as one of the reasons that the Singaporian legal party has received a worse result in elections from the time of independence.
Following elections, it was tried to address the problem, helping cows and higher burdens for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While pregnancy falls affected the economic growth of nation, tax expenditure, immigration costs and immigration policy, such as Singapore also begins to have some unexpected effects.
The Government is endeavoured to make such a small housing.
For example, it began to affect the non-mobility sector.
City Development Guidelines have moved to control the number of small apartments known as a "while bottle" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These 46 square metres are very well sold.
Nevertheless, there is a view that they can help the sweet form of life and leave the style of furnitures that want to build a large family living.
But Lim Ю Suhn, the Headquarter of EL Developers, says that their "which bottles" are sell more fast than the spacious examples.
They are more popular, in the meaning that such apartments are rented for a few days, even weekly, faster than the larger apartment.
As a result, our money benefits are increased.
However, he recognizes that new standards are given clearer orientators for the buildingers that have previously been proposed if they wanted to propose too much small apartments in the project.
Deeply reappeared
Singapore is a city-gouvernance.
Although these new rules may be a step towards increased national growth, after discussion with synagogues working in the financial quarter of the centre, they seem to have no special effect.
"The people are very overwhelmed, a road habitation, as well as education, and because of that, many people do it," said the young manager.
Others may have children.
"But for me it's important to distribute my own money and time," says another young man 20 years.
Women and women remember their carriers, stress and prices for housing and education as reasons that prevent children.
Thus, as the Government was attempt to encourage his citizens to be born to children, the last word remains in the Singapore.
Personal in the offline - personal in the online
Confidentiality.
According to the Kingdom Academy of the Spanish language, it is the property of a private or “the field of personal life that have the right to protect from any interference”.
What is the personal for a ageless 16?
How does it apply this definition in his daily life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers that are undertaken in the Internet's discussions that would probably not be shared outside the Internet?
The Perudecus has interviewed five children from 10 to 15 years, parts of the network users.
In four cases, they associated terms with "really my" in personality and "Password and username" when applying it to social networks.
"I wouldn't have been loaded at the post," says the Horhah's decade when you're trying to explain the importance of the person on such sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has an account for two years.
"It's very secret secrets, my mom can know them, but not the whole world," he said.
I'm on the FB I'm loading beautiful pictures or pictures from the game.
I'm also divorced with my knowledge.
"I wouldn't have shared the photos which are not my, or someone who's going to be stupid," he said.
The child is aware of the bad publication of the unfair photographs of defended persons, crimes or write abusive or aggressive comments.
Horhah believes he knows 35 friends who got in the FB and nine of his footballs in Twitter.
Most of them.
Mother's at course, she has a password to one of the accounts.
I commanded Twitter to express myself and write interesting tickets.
"I don't know if they answer me, I'm just loading them," he adds.
"Society networks -- disappearing, I can talk to your relatives or with my friends in the winter," he says.
Without thought, it would never take a request from a strange person.
It wouldn't be considered to someone who would recommend him a stranger.
The case of the 14-year-old Hos is different.
This adolescent has open accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, and recently recognizes that he doesn't know 20 people added to his friends' list.
"It's not hurt me because we've got something common, music, for example," he shows.
According to the boy, no one had been in confidence with him and asked his home address or phone number.
"If they're going to give me to do or demand, I'll just remove them from my account," he's recognized.
The Hoses became followed Ask after reading the recommendations in Twitter.
The boy is not a strange experience of today known as cyberobbing.
One of my known friends had been loaded in a social network.
He was threatened and got money.
"He didn't know who it was," he promised.
The victim, according to Hose, did not remove the account.
"It has included confidentiality."
He then explains the follow-up of steps to set accounts securely.
Otherwise, this boy would have loaded photographs of knowledge in unfortunate or confusive situations.
Yeah, I would do this if a person doesn't like me or if I want it.
"What I know it's cyberobbing," he reaffirmes.
Key Questions
Mariusus Porras, English teachers and teachers, believes that, in order to manage children and adolescents, we need to understand that the goal of social networks should be informed.
"Internet appeared as a means of searching for information, but with the exhibition of these websites the rules of the game," she notes.
Pors shows that the Academic Mark Francis, the Pydagonic Master of the Yeel University and the author of the Circical orfanes and immigrants had found these terms to explain the Phoenomen.
Ciphers are children and young people who were born in the epothec.
"We're the digital immigrants that are to teach them while we're still teaching," she said.
It explains that this theme is difficult, "There we ask them to have a certain criteria that can't be spread, published or say, in the age, when we're not lacking it."
"As well as they were electoral, while most important for them to be popular, having thousands of friends without any consequence," adds.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to show that this is confidentiality to children and adolescents, to ask questions to be tackled.
"Don't let them do that, not useful," adds.
Then Pursa numbers some options: there's things that you wouldn't tell the stranger, so why are you doing this on the Internet?
Or, would you like you if you'd show you a photo of what you've published about your friend?
Do you know that others are publishing about you?
When you sign the party's photos, are you asking a call for other people to note them?
And another, do all need to know what you're doing at every moment?
Another paragraph is to give them understanding that they should be online as well as the Afglyns do.
Rules one and the same.
"A person on the Internet is being respected, responsibilities and other principles, and must be in social networks," said she.
Cleanliness
Asturdo Guardia, university teachers, Professor of primary education and educational adviser explains the need for heads of the family to read social network policies.
Taking into account each paragraph, they have a good basis for conversation with children on the opening of accounting on the Internet.
"Before age and what is allowed to disseminate or publicize," he said.
According to Guardia, the key question is to remind children ' s lessons ' not to speak with strangers'.
The UNASUR Summit is completed without the renovation of the Limic Declaration
The Vice-Chairman Summit of the South American Nations (INSUR) has been completed today in Peru without the renaissance of the Limic Declaration declarated by the previous and theory signed by the obligatory family.
Efe had recently tried to obtain access to the document signed by the Heads of States and Governments of the United Nations, however, the sources from the Office and the Administration of the President indicated that it would be transferred after the closement, but then confirmed that it would be published at the website of the Peruan Government at the same time.
On the matter of the text, they pointed out that the content was made by the President of Peru, Olynita Womala, during the short statements for the press.
The access of the journalists to Summits has always been limited.
It was only translated, in the press room, in the Chairman's video without a sound with the "Closed meeting, the sound has been prohibited."
The few information circled among the reporters was transmitted to some Governments of UNASUR attending the meeting, but not to the Peruan.
The only document distributed during the day was a list of participating Presidents that there were hundreds of journalists from the various national and international SMEs that requested more information.
Following the Administration of President Peru, he sent an E-mail to the SMEs with the "Final Declaration" of the Summit, however, the statement of Umalah and not the official document that the Summit had been completed.
In October last, the Summit of South American and Arab countries (ASA) was accepted in October III and, despite that the press was constantly requested, it was not also distributed that the Limic Declaration had previously declared.
On the Official ASA website, you can check that the document was published on the past Friday.
At both international meetings, the Peruan authorities had been forced to ensure the transfer system for all journalists, but have limited maximum information.
The Summit also concluded the joint decision of Chili and Peru to adopt the Hague Court of Justice, which regulates territorial disputes between both countries.
The President of Peru, Umala, and Chili, Sebastian Pinner, were gathered to the regional meeting and ratifyed that the decision of the International Court, which begins the hearing of both parties, in the case of the accused by Liam against Santiago.
"We will observe and implement the decision that will explain the diversity we are currently present in this international court," said Humala, close to his colleague.
"If there was a country respecting international law, peaceful solutions, packages and international tribunals," he added Pinner, and welcomed Umala's hands on the background of these two countries.
The confirmation by both Presidents of their subsequent to the International Court has occurred immediately after Colombia had proceeded at this week of the Democratic Covenant, in accordance with which she had recognized the jurisdiction of the international court after the decision of the Sea borders with Nicaragua, which she had constituted a mistake.
The Summit was in the absence of Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rossif; Venezuela, Ugo Chappie; Bolivia, Evo Morales; and Argentina, Cristina Cirshner.
Paraguawa, whose membership in UNASUR was held since 2011 after the implant of his former President Fernando Lugo was not attended.
The Chairman, Olienta Umala, was responsible for opening the discussions in the morning and for the closing of the semi-sound, a little later half of the Lime Time.
The Chapter of the State read the final document reporting that 16 agreements were adopted and approved by 31 projects between South American countries, the allocation of investments was $17 billion.
In the agreements he recalled that the UINSUR countries had “the important steps to the goal of South American nationality for which we expand the habitation agreement.”
He reported that actions were taken to improve cooperation against incertainty and organized transnational crime, actions to increase access to medical access, unfortunate access to the Internet in all areas of South America and to take into account the co-acquired and effective risks of natural catastrophes.
Since Europe's crisis, "Economic (Latin America) must not have a triumphatory basis, but should serve to expand our production basis and predict the best future for our cities," added Humala.
"We decided to give privileges to the group from 31 marked projects that will improve the links of South America, particularly in the forest and border zones... combining our countries and forming new economic schemes," said the Peruan President in the community ready.
He recalled that five are relating to Peru, and limited axes in its territory, from the campaign to Brazil, and two of them were in line with Ecuador, but he did not provide more details.
The final document also affected the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election process in this country will serve its repeated accession to the South American Union" of which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain in the region of welfare and peace would be joint, and had a good relationship between neighbourings was another subject stressed on the same.
In this sense, President of Columbia, Han Manuel Santos said, before the meeting of the regional meeting, he was hoped to meet his colleague of Nicaragua, Daniel Ortego, on the Sabbath, in Mexico, in order to negotiate a considerable form of marine dispute as a result of the road of the international court which was prepared by Godot.
"Slawster (satured Sabbath) may be to meet the President of Daniel orthodox," said Santox.
"We need to resolve all these ways, they are not mutually excluded, including the package with Nicaragua needs a discussion with Nicaragua," he said.
"When the President of the Orgue, I hope we can tell him that we are doing this mostly possible civilized and respectfully," added Santus.
The Sabbath and the Authority are meetings in Mexico, where they have an accession to the new President of the country, Enrike Penny Neto.
Also, within the Summit of the Ministers of Defence, the block was previously met in order to approve the Plan of Action for 2013, which aims to strengthen the dialogue and the unity on the protection of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chili, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay form UINSUR, although the recent participation of countries has been suspended.
Peru has a timely presidency in the regional block.
" South America should learn in Europe to integrate nationality: Raphael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Raphael Correa, stated today that the establishment of a general nationality is a goal in which the South America, in this case, must be learned in Europe.
Correa, who was attended in the VI presidential Society of the South American Nations (INSUR), conducted in Liam, said to the State Television of Peru that the Europeans had "vived one another during the Second World War" and others, "the same is now one disaster."
He protected, in this context, the draft establishment of South American nationality, which approve the UINSUR countries.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as it is already happening to the members of the Anti-Community, but there are even reactions sectors that want to return us to the past."
The Ecuador President also showed himself by the parties to the United Nations of the American States (OAG) in favour of reducing the impact of the English States and taking into account those signed by the Covenant San Hosa on Human Rights.
Those who read the audience will never take any obligations on themselves, and we, South America, are, in contrast, signing everything.
"We don't explain that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington and financed by the United States," said he, acknowledged on a political survival given by the WikiLeaks Foundation Foundation for the WikiLeaks Julian Assanje.
Core promised that it did not wish to decide, because he did not grant his principles, but he observed its “the deep value of democracy and human rights”.
He added that, at its time, there were certain suspicions that Assisance would be extracted into the third country and would not be respected.
In addition, the Swedish justice for the requirement to come to his territory for a request for a sexual offence, while "the Swedish legislation considers the possibility of implementing it through the video conference that would be made from Ecuador's office in London."
Core reaffirmed that there was a risk of the deterioration of physical and mental health of Assyria.
"I didn't talk to him since he came to our office, but the ambassador told me that he had a small liver problem, nothing seriously," said the ecuador's head.
What really is, this is the danger of the disappearance of his physical and mental health because of a small space without the possibility of proceedings in the air.
"It affects any person's health," added he.
Core indicated that the problem of the asylum delivered from June to the Ecuador office in London by providing guarantees of uncertainty that allowed him to go to Ecuador is in the hands of the Great Britain, Sweden and European judicial bodies and noted that negotiations were in London on the search for the problem of the end of the WhikiLeaks founder.
We do not negotiate on human rights, but we do not use in this case but have been permanent discussions.
"The solution of this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European Judicial bodies, as the lawyer Assistanh, Balthasar Harson, has conducted a number of processes in the various European institutions," he mentioned.
And he said, "If the Great Britain is tomorrow to provide a guarantee of unconsciousness, it will be completed."
And if Sweden, as she's pretty allowing her legislation and as she had already done in other cases, asks Mrs. Assanja in the office of Ecuador in London or asks him for Skype tomorrow, this problem will be solved.
Core was used to demonstrate himself as a defender of the freedom of printing and emphasized that it did not suffer “interface, disappearance and lies that seek the freedom of expression”.
"The main enemies of the freedom of printing this is not an expensive rebellion, but the bad journalists supporting lives, loads and savings," said he.
In this regard, he remained voluntarily that there were no newspapers, no bankers, nor bourgeois gymnas, are not dominant in Ecuador, and added that, being renewed, "the revolution has been enlarged to continue development in a faithful direction."
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto of Paraguay in UNASAR at least before the next elections, argued that the organization "abounds to be firm and not to suffer the opportivity and support of the transfers under its law," because it had actually "hasted the law of Paraguay Democracy."
The Ecuador Chairman also felt that his comprehensive desire of the Columbian colleague of Hanan Manuel Santossa had now been negotiated with Nicaragua on the Sea borders between two countries after the decision of the International Justice of Haag, which was made for the Nicaraguan Sea Sovereignty.
The decision is not to be respected at this time.
This is a problem between South American and Central American countries.
Conflicts are unremovable, but they must be encouraged by the desire to go together.
We need to discuss them in the community to continue and continue forward.
He also expressed the hope of a good termination of the controversy of the marine borders conducted in the same court of Peru and Chili, and said that "the right for Latin America to return to international institutions, if two countries are obliged to decide what hard it would be."
It is important to be a candidate for the present presidential elections in Ecuador to balance for a third period of time, he stated that it was an opportunity to consider "to be a great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very hard."
Core promised that if it was lost by elections in February 2013, it would be public.
At the personal level, I have never been interested in authority, but in the wrong situations such as Ecuador, the social and economic poverty can only be elected by political authorities.
"My political movement felt that I guaranteed this crucial gain, so that it should be recognized," said he.
In the case of gain, this would be my last time at the President's office and then we go out of public life.
If we lose, it's the same.
"It's a decision," he confirmed.
Core also mentioned the new course of the Viennasian President of Ogo Chaves in Cuba.
I just said to the Vice-President Nikis Madoro, who told me he went to the treatment that has already been planned and that he's expected he's going to leave a campaign to come back to Cuba.
"It does not mean the removal of the health of the President of Chaves," he explained.
The Chapter of the Ecuador State has participated today in Liam on the same Chairs of States and Governments of the South American United Nations (UNSAR), which has completed the calls for more regional integration to support progress, equality and security.
Mortality from AIDS today is the result of the late diagnostics
The factory was 21 years old when he declared that his AIDS analysis had a positive result.
"It's a little bit of anxiety," he remembers the harder, despite all the doctor, a moment.
The young man hided it from his family.
He decided to do with a sickness, he wanted to know how more it could be, and his efforts were justified, he already noted his 43th birthday.
Fabricity is one of the old HIV patients in Guadalajara HCG, where he was in 1994, a lot of obstacles.
He lives with the human immunodeficiency diagnosis, 22 years old, and it would be difficult to believe in the beginning of the 1990s, so little then there have been some treatment options, too little knowing about sickness, too much affected to sickness.
Yes, even the director of the Mixtonic Institute of Social Protection did not want to make it easy, "for he had a shot."
Otherwise, AIDS had been sentenced at that time.
Now, there may be a syndrome and do it, without an emotional quality of life.
Nevertheless, notwithstanding about their disease, many people have come when the virus has already been damaged, their immunity system and they are suffering from opportist infections.
After 31 years after the AIDSD in the world, at least after the first complaints, “the greatest achievement at the moment is that the survivor of a patient which starts timely and the general population in the exactness of the same”, said the Head of HCG HCG, Hayma Andréda Vilneyawa, which was signed in April that the information was confirmed in the original scientific publication of this year.
Infectionists and experts on HIV/AIDS explained that since 2008, the scientists found that HIV was not a conviction, however, the continuation and quality of life depends on an immunity system at the start of diagnosis, with the best expectancy of those who do not use drugs: to pay up to 30 years by the number of 200 CD4 and to 50 years when reported on 500 CD4.
Furthermore, the above means that the person who receives HIV diagnosis for 25-year-old, in accordance with these terms, “containing control can live without problems to 75 years”, he explained.
To assess this progress, it should be remembered that the duration of the life of the Mexico today is average of 76 years.
While mortality was significantly reduced in the last years, in Mexico, the number of people died from AIDS was decreased from 6.678 in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (early UNEAD report), as well as that 60 per cent of patients in the national database died.
Only 255 people died in 2011, and 187 deaths have already been registered for my year; however, it is stated that there is a common access to anti-retroviral treaties since 2005.
- Why are there a yearly outcome now?
- Personally, I think the problem is not accessing treatment.
So I'm presenting it myself, so we're going to make cases in our hospital.
As at least the last 12 years we had no lack of medicines, the problem is that patients come very late because they don't know about their in-depth state, it is in the later stages of disease.
He provided a blocking data: "Two patients come when they have some opportist infection; what you need to do to make more impact on the general mortality, that's a diagnosis at the early stage, and so we need to provide tests to discover the mass, for all those who ask it."
Its proposals include the view of specialists and officials of the State Council on the Prevention of AIDS in Calico (COESIDA), as well as of the patients, as well as the factors, which had turned to verification in the private laboratory, only attempt that it had been a friend and, despite his young age, he had already been at the AIDS stage and even suffered by the Sarco Kaposa, the cancer ophoul, which is one of the designs distributed.
Everything changes when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and nothing wants to know.
"I'm going to die, I'll get three times a week," they're saying, "but not in my case.
There are positive changes, I'm well concerned, do testing, accepting medicines.
Today, his parents just know that he had a cancer.
I live a normal life as any other.
"I work, I have a lot of jobs, I travel, lead an active sexual life, but with a binding responsibilities for myself and for another person," he renumbered a Fabric who agreed to share my personal life with MILENIO JALISCO to move my statements to those who now, in the context of the World Criminal Day, tries fear.
Let them check if there was an accident, let them know whether they are HIV-positive, so better, and if they have diagnosis already, let them know that they can live as any other person who is responsible.
This report resumes the theme against HIV in 2012.
Currency
Great health programmes and simple civilians have been made by Ricardo Salasar, a journalist of Guvadahara, who has been addressed with HIV.
And the largest is prevention.
In the places dedicated to this task, "There has actually increased the exhibition of the preservatives, we have given one or two, now we give packs for hundreds, and it's very good but it's seen that there's no access to preservation until now," he said.
The most vulnerable to new adolescents are among the most adolescents.
"Why are they to you?" This is a popular question, with emotion and conviction, from social employees, school consultors, attractors and health workers, who do not want to hear adults, have a propoganist.
I propose to change this uneffective allocation; that preservatives are not only for the loans and that hundreds of them are in the cars in public tunnels which are often visiting young people.
This is not the promotion of disarmament.
This is not about the payment of drinks and monsters, the Gouverneur Emilyo Honsles answered, when they asked whether the preserveds could be able to discharge at his leadership.
"It's not sexual, it's better to make available to those who already practice sexual activity," he said.
Key Data in Halisco
13.435 summed cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State takes the fourth place in the national recycling of new and summit cases of AIDS and 13th HIV.
92 per cent of victims relate to average path, 6 per cent through blood and 2 percent to перinal path.
It is estimated that 50,000 people can live with HIV, as one case registered is from 4 to 5 persons who do not know it.
In view of the ratification of the Appeal Court of the United States, the Decade of the Vitro Deal of the Vitro Group reached by the Concurrent Production in Mexico, the scenario sets a rock president for any national company with staff in the neighbouring country that has a problem of payability.
It seems that the procedures in support of the survival of firms allowed by Mexico are not operative in the Pool and star country, in contrary to international agreements.
In the practical area, the decision taken by Harlin Hail by the court of the north of Tahas, the decision of the decision made on 15 June, in the court of the northern district of the Texas, provides unprotected Mexico firms before the possibility of arresting their property on the side of Rio-Grand.
However, the decision opens the doors to the leading steel producer in Mexico to be treated to the United States High Court, which provides trial of non-compatibility.
As a proceedings, while the Court of Justice notes that creditors should be regulated by the United States Code on banking, the Appeal Court of the Fifth Survey located in New Orleans said that the main proceedings concerning the competitive production considered in Mexico.
The first paragraph understood the change of international judicial cooperation in cases of the operation of the transnational profile.
To that end, the United Nations Standard Act on the Unification of the Right of International Trade has been established, defining as a arbitrator of the American Institute of the Right.
Secondly, the version states that without interferred vote recognized in the critical mass of competitive debt production that had been made before the maternal company of Vitro would not be achieved by most of the necessary restructuring.
However, this opportunity recognizes Mexico's laws.
In fact, Vitro was not the first case when it was taken.
There are long-term examples, including Agremex and Mexico Trade, whose interference debts guaranteed the Federal Institute of Competitive Products.
It is also that, as the vote of the Philippians, or otherwise, Vitro creditors, who fighted against him in the United States courts, such as the Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited would not reach most.
The vote would be 45 per cent against 37.
The Appeal Court is issued.
On the other hand, he condemned Vitro in a complex situation with which it had been engaged since 2008 by the serious economic crisis reached by the United States of a country attack.
Since the company of the Honses Sadd family is encouraging the decision in the same appeal court to bring the vote to his complaint, there are five judges in view of the vote only three.
In the case of danger, there will be a request for prosecution, which requires a review of the process from the Supreme Court, in this case of the High Court of the United States.
Nevertheless, the court rejected the document addressed by the Government of Mexico in the role of a friend of the Cour, in which the process of Vitro should be described under the Comprehensive Proceeding Law, the signalising that he is free of compliance with the agreements signed by both countries to link it with article 15 of the United States Bank Safety Act.
Furthermore, it notes that the country has underlined the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, the rules established for cases of intergovernmental non-competence that guarantee the equality of debtors and creditors.
Carambol from two boats: they fight in Vitro and fight in the country.
General balance

Hector Heetin' Rays, "Basquetbol was my life."
He's the lodged Backetball traveler, Hector Heetin, was more than 60 years related to this sport and, thanks to him, he moved the whole world.
Many in Puerto Rico keeps a memory of a lot of basketball stories like Hector Heetin's.
In 2008, Reis was loaded in sport for more than 60 years, as a play of small categories, play of the High Bactebo League, compulsored and manager of BSN and Kamboby Bamón and President of the Federation of Bactebola.
"I have performed many roles in the bactizing duration of my life, including a few of the same time as when I was President of BSN, the Director-General of the National Team and the Federation President, in the 1990s, - recalled Reys during the Prime Hora's home to Baymon, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful marriage for more than 50 years.
"Basquetbol was my life."
Reis does not enlarge the approval.
His home, almost all of the photographs and the memory things gathered by his long way are witnessed.
Watching in the heart
With the greatest emotions, he keeps those recalling his path through Quebov, starting from the middle of the 50th year as a playing to 1982, when his 15-year-old statements were made in the role of agent or a contract agent.
"It was my best years I had more than all, because it had been the opportunity to be part of the eight kilometres of Quebeba from 1967, as a agent, sogent or manager.
There were many years of joy, including five kitchens past from 1971 to 1975.
And then I made one in 1981, the deputy of Jeremy Mensis in BSN.
From that moment and continued to manage the "Coco" Ortis who was the great manager," said Rachel.
I remember Jin Bart, who went here and was at the University of Alabama, Brindix, said to me, "I have a very strong player for you with 6'7 growing."
"What do you?"
And this was the start of Minsey, one of the best players in Puerto Rico.
The barts then recommended the Sniper Raymond Gauss, who received nationality and became one of our best bombards.
I remember that I said, if Minssy would bring the Baimon Chepension, Gauss would help you get another.
Cubbobs and Gauss have been distant, but have already been distant, because before 1988 was a leader of federalization.
Meanwhile, I prefered to enjoy his achievements and achievements in the national congregation.
Remember how we win first in the United States during the olympical qualification tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then it became a Chempatian of the world in 1990, on which we received a fourth place and that should be a brown, if not the Canadian Judge who made us to play the final game, Reis said.
And the Team of the World Championship of 1990 is the best collection you've ever seen?
It was among the best, as well as Dream Team in Olympian games in 2004.
But my loved was that with the Pan American game on Cuba in 1991, when we gained gold and divorced the United States collection that was quite similar to the brown of the world.
The team was not only played again by Minsey, Gauss, Ramon Rivas, Phyco Lopes and Piculina, but also young (Hawaier) 'Ponito' Colon and James Carter, the brothers of Leon (Francisco and Edgar) and Mary, who had not been able to participate in 90 years from the grain of the tribe.
The team that might not be the best of the personal composition but has made us a golden meal and great pleasure, was the team of the Olympician qualification tour in Neuka, Argentina.
With the roles of players like Cainito's Neavos, Paulo Alissa and the young Rolando Horreitner, we've won the golden oppression of all the prognosis.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
Uncertainly, this was Piculin Ortis.
His indicators on international tourists are impressed.
Nobody in Puerto Rico was threatened at this level as Piculin did.
And this is without account of his carriers in the different liggs in which he played.
Who was the best captain?
It's a very complex question.
We've had a very good young kid, including Colo Toro, Flor Meendena, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torresa.
From young people, I like Leo Arilla's job.
What do you think of your main achievement in the Federation?
Participation in the most glorious national collection between 1988 and 1995 and that BSN was until 17 teams in the session.
What have you left to do?
There were things I wanted to implement, for example, the regionalization of small categories.
For example, the boys from Ponce play only in their own area and only against the teams of other island parties.
The guys are moving and playing too much, and it's disappointed.
At least I see the fruits of compulsory certification and course for administrative, officials and judges.
That makes me fun.
What are you doing now?
Most of all I listen to music, looking at my music videos on YouTube, spring my fingers, and I'm going to bactebotic mothers.
And, of course, I appreciate my marriage, Isabel, who was always with me.
Larry Hamman's death attorney
Larry Hagman, born 21 September 1931 in Fort Urte (Thas), became a worldwide known by his main role as John Ross Yung, more known as J.R., in the "Dallas" television, where he worked business without principles, evil and manager.
Larry Hagman, whose role of the Neptop Magnate Majesty, Jay Ar Ying, in the TV Serial Dallas, became a symbol of desire in 1980, is dead.
He was 81.
He who returned in this year as J.R. in the new "Dallassa" Section died on Tuesday's summer because of the complicated cancers, in accordance with the statement of the family provided for The Asociated Press Company of Warner Bros.
"Larry returned again to his lovely relative city of Dallas again playing a marked role that he loved mostly," said his family.
The Larry family and the nearest friends were with him in Dallass at the honor of the Thanksgiving Day.
Linda Gray, playing the role of his marriage in original series and syndica, was close to Hagman when he died in Dallass hospital, said her representative Jeffrey Laine.
He gave joy to all those who knew him.
He was a creative, gentleman, fun, sweet and talentous, and I'm gonna suffer him very much.
"He was original and lived in full life," he confirmed Greey in a statement.
Hegman was diagnosed in 1992 and recognized that he had drunk for many years.
In 1995, he found a bad injury in the cup and transferred transplantation.
During the Dellass, Hagman obtained television awareness through the role of the ordinary type in the easy "I Dream of Jeannie", translated by the NBC channel from 1965 to 1970.
He played the captain of Tony Nelson, the Astronauth, whose life changes when he meets a nice girl who plays Barbar Iden, and starts to live with her under one crino.
He also was the chief person of two comites that were rarely appeared in the ephrase, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His work in the film included the roles accepted in the "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
However, his master interpretation of the J.R. had brought Hagman to the top of the glory.
The Dramatic CBS channel for Yings and other persons in its environment went to Efire from April 1978 to May 1991.
"Who has slaughtered in J.R.?", planned to create noise around episode, full emotions in which the Hegman person has little murdered, has increased international discussions and millions of dollars that have been risked in the bookmechanic containers.
It also helped to bring the record audio series at that time.
When the answer was made in the episode of November 1980, average 41 million televisors looked at it and converted the 'Dallas' second to the story review programme after the "MASH" figure in 1983.
It was a deputy of J.R., Christian, who had slapped him.
The J.R. had dismissed and then threatened her that she would accuse her in the prostitution if she was not removed from the city but others also had reasons to fall on it.
Hagman played Yung as an unfair corruptioner with a charismic delicately: an unfair undertaking and unfair man who wanted his neighbourhood of alcohol, Sue Elena (Lind Grey) to be treated.
"I know what's supposed to be on the pool of J.R.," said Hagman in 1988.
It must be said, "The fair civilian J.R. Yuning will surely hurt."
It's the only thing he's lost.
The Victory Principal, also the heroin of the original series, remembered the Tuesday of Hegman and someone "ogred, both on and outdoor screen."
He is forgotten and unchanged for millions of teachers throughout the world, and in the hearts of each of us who have been pleased to know and love him.
10 episodes of the new Dylassa emission have been shown a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
It was already completed five episodes of the second season and sixth was produced, reported a channel.
Warner or TNT have not yet made a statement with the series of Hamman after the departure.
Fort Wart, Texas, was a son of a actist and a peaky of Mary Martin, who was in classic events such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still adolescent when he was born in 1931 during his marriage lawyer Ben Hagman.
He requested happy at the theatre scenes of New York at the beginning of the 1950s and then served in England from 1952 to 1956.
He met the young Swiss artist Michael Akselson and married her.
There were two children, Stone and Haiti, and they lived for a long time in the Malibu city of California, where many signs live.
In 2001 he called his memoragers "Hello Darlin: Tall (and indeed True) Tales about My Life.
"I haven't included anything that could cause anybody to hurt or affect them in any way," said he the Princess Association at that time.
He began to promote the damage of bodies and work as a volunteer in the hospital to help patients attempting fear.
"I give them counsels, I give them to beat them, I will meet them when they go to the operations, and then," he said in 1996.
I'm trying to propose some comfort, as "Don't be afraid, it'll be a little bit in a short time, but you're gonna be okay."
He also acted actively against smoke and participated in several campaigns.
It begins a course that investigates the Son of the World.
Every week students are investigating attractive views such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and global warming.
In this seminar, when the professor of the religion of Stuart Sharma decided to read the course of the end of the world, he knew that he had spreaded an unnecessary complainant: the end of the "level revision" of the calendar of May, 21 December, for which many were hidden as a proof of the end of the world.
But Sharma had no idea that he was waiting for the next few months: the Catholic Uruguan Sandy, the financial crisis, which some called 'dolormaghedon', and the growing conflict where Israel is understood, the place where Christian theories finally believe that the Apocalysis would begin.
"I didn't understand that it would be the most opocalistic seminar of all," said Sharma in this week to students of the University of Rutgers-Kamden (New Jersey).
If we can analyse what happens in the world at this time, as if we have remained over 30 days, it was really a good period.
And remember that bad thing is good for those who have the opacity of thought.
And he is not the only professor who offers courses to the "the end of light" in this seminar, theotheratic last in the history.
In the Trup University, a professor Barry Vaker reads the course of the Mass Information, culture and the end of the light.
Every week students are studying opacity issues such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria, and global sustainment.
"We're analyzing why these ideas are timely disseminated," said he, and how the hyptotic scenario proposing certain human actions.
If nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, for example, the war may disappear.
In the month of the students studied films on the attractive topics and studied how they were related to examples of real life.
"I've tried to tell students that it might be likely and unable," said Waker.
The University of Pennsylva, professor of the history of Latin America, Meta Retal, and his colleague, Amara Slavery, a professor of art and anti-Patrology, was assembled to read the course just called "The Son of light".
"We don't add '2012' to always have an opportunity to read the course again, if the end of the world isn't going," said Rebecca.
Although it is possible, students should learn, prepare projects and make final exchange.
In Penn State's final exchange will be accepted in the canon of Apocalyps, which does not leave students another choice, except to work "for the same night in which the end of the light would be proposed," said Stall.
Kurses became quite popular.
"Messa is over two hours," Retal said about his course for students with a high average balloon recording 35 students.
We received e-mail messages over a many weeks before the seminar of people who asked whether there's still a place.
The students, on their basis, assure that this course is one of the most interesting.
"I like to see what people are doing to comfort myself," said Brid Robinson, the 23-year-year-old religious student of the Hoddonfield, New Jersey, Ruthers-Kamden.
And the opolytical image of thought, light or religious, is only the issue of comfort or absence of it.
Will Venez, a 25-year-old psychology and sister case student, said that he looked at all of the attractive films.
"I've never heard about the course that he would teach it," he said.
I like him.
But no one of the students was talking about the professor said he believed in the date of the end of the world on 21 December.
"Our first project was the Mai prophecy, and some kinds we discussed it," said Julie Zeglen, the last 21-year-old student in the Trup University of West Chaster.
My Maya never prevailed the end of the light; it's just a key moment in the calendar," said Retail.
But he noted that there was an atmospheric concern in the Western culture, which was a number of centurys where people react to change around himself, predicting the end of the world.
The Internet allowed the increase in these pipelulations.
"In other places people don't think about it," said he.
First in English.
Joseph Dogerti, professor of the religion of La Sal, who puts courses on Philips in this year, quickly answered whether he knows about some "the end of the light" there.
"Fillips don't take part in the end of the world," he wrote, not to be disposed of the upper institution.
We have a mistake from Daddy.
Retail noted that a long time ago was spoken of many days of the last court and said that if nothing happens on 21 December, the people were immediately starting to think about the next date " or filosofy that the 21 December was the beginning of the seven-year period, at the end of which the world ends.
Students and students are securely related to this date.
Some said they're going to go to the "the end of the light" party.
"I think I'll call some friends to laugh together," said Samara Ford, a 20-year-year-old Faculty team.
