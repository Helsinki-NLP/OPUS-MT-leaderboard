A Republical strategy to meet the election of Obama
The leaders of the Republics justify their policy with the need to fight the election penalty.
However, Brennan Center holds the latest for a mythos by confirming that the election penalty in the United States is more rare than the number of people killed by the Blitz.
The lawyers of the Republics have signed in the US only 300 cases of election abuse in 10 years.
One is sure that these new provisions will be negative to the election participation.
In this respect, these measures are partly understood the democratic system of the United States.
In contrast to Canada, the US States are responsible for the implementation of the elections in each Member States.
In this respect, the majority of the American governments has announced new laws since 2009 that have rejected the registration or transition procedure.
This phenomenon has been important after the elections from November 2010, with 675 new republic representatives in 26 States.
Accordingly, 180 law-projects were introduced only in 2011 to reduce the execution of the right of election in 41 States.
The new election laws require the electoral to provide a light image and a evidence of the US citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws will be denied by the periods of time for the previous stipulation that the right to be wrong to register as a elector day, and that the Members of State shall comply with the right of election for which a court act is proceeded.
The 2006 elections have not been requested by the electors to provide a light image test.
Indiana was the first Federal State who has reached such request.
In 2008, the Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of Indiana law.
The republic authorities urged that this practice was extended to other States.
During the past two years, they promoting legislation in 34 US states, with which the electors were designed to show a light picture.
It is important to note that US hosts, in contrast to Quebec, do not have a universal reference card such as the hospital insurance card.
In fact, 11% of the US citizens, t.e. 21 million electoral persons do not have an exhibition of light images from a government of their State.
In addition, five million newspapers in 2012 did not have such an indication.
However, we are often paying more than 100 dollars to get the necessary exhibition.
From the new restrictions, young people, minorities and people with low income are strongly affected.
In fact, 25% of the Afro Americans, 15% of the individuals with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of the citizens over 65 years and 20% of the electors between 18 and 29 years.
That's easy.
Students who are viewed as electors who admit their voice for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their light pictures from their institutions.
Otherwise, the same States allow Members of Angel or Jagd agreements to choose more stronger for the republic side to use by these United States cards for elections.
Since 2004, no Federal State has requested for the election a evidence of the State Republic.
Arizona was the first Federal State who introduced such request.
Since 2011, a twentieth States have adopted laws requesting the electoral to demonstrate their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Spanish voices.
Because it is on the hand that two of the three Spanish electors that prefer democratic partys.
Furthermore, the republic lawyer 2011 has promoted laws in eight states with which the registration of electors has been rejected on the day of election.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide those electoral helpers to register.
These restrictions are not without consequence.
For example, the campaigns have contributed to registration of approximately 10 million of State providers to the electoral registering of the 2004 elections.
Since the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of registration of new electors in comparison with 2006 to 17%.
In addition, the republic legislators have adopted laws in five additional States that are intended to decrease the period for the time of time-limitation.
For example, in the 2008 general elections in Florida 33% of the electors that had been elected before, although only 13% of the electors of the Federal State were produced.
The same is applicable to the Spanish population.
Last 11% of the electors, but 24% of the citizens who have previously chosen.
Nevertheless, the white people represented 76% of the electors only 46% of the electors that were elected before.
Of course, democratic lawyers and their attachers have confronted the adoption of laws which reduce the registration of the electors.
Multiple legislation projects were blocked by the Vetos of the Democratic Governance.
The Secretary-General of the United States has attacked to implement the most circumstanced laws.
They could partly limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 US States have adopted laws that require the preview of a light image.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will be unfortunately disappeared by the execution of the election law.
Democratic criticians argue the partial political nature of the adopted laws and see in them as a clear goal the impact of the results in the 2012 states.
A report of the Brennan Centers of 2011 shows that the States who have adopted these laws to address 171 of the 270 votes required in the election goals to gain the Presidency.
It is too early to confirm with awareness that these amendments of the legislation on the selection system will have significant impact on the results of the presidency elections in 2012.
But one is sure that these new provisions will be negative to the election participation.
In this respect, these measures are partly understood the democratic system of the United States.
Prostat recognition: the test should be done or not?
The PSA tests show in fact sometimes wrong results, with false negative or even false positive results that lead to unnecessary medical impacts.
This leads to increased deficiencies of the already decised men for the implementation of early recognition tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We have taken the opinion of two factors.
In the files carried out in the U.S., there are many factors between the control groups so it is difficult to interpret and give clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early recognition exists.
The study also showed that the probability of Metastasen education is up to 30 to 40% when no early recognition has been performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from a age of 50 and 40 years when you have a direct person who had been weak in prostatacreb.
An increased risk is also in men of African origin.
The most important is to take the right decision when a cancer disease was recognized.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others who are indocted.
The patients have to have a real understanding of the risk of cancer disease by showing the possible options in which prostatacreases can remain inadequate if he does not affect the quality of life in long term, and in these cases, it is more decided for an active monitoring of disease.
Today, among many men you have recognized cancers, there is no treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and no threats for their life.
They are proposing an active monitoring of them and provide them a treatment when the disease continues.
The criteria for a decision which should be treated and who not.
This is why I still recommend the implementation of the test.
But most importantly, it is to talk to his doctor to decide whether it should be done or not.
In cooperation with the International Urology Society, Movember has developed a tool with which it is possible to assess the advantages and benefits of the PSA.

Prevention of disease
Unfortunately, there are no wondering tools for prediction of cancer.
Despite the progress in research, the adoption of a healthy way of life remains the best way to reduce risks to him.
It is estimated that 30% of the cancer diseases could be prevented if all were good and would be sufficiently moved.
"If there were no raws anymore, this value would increase at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, the canadian cancer society.
However, there is some 10% of the cancer diseases that are caused by detrimentation.
More are also completely unrecognized.
For the Canadian cancer society, the fight against the tabak dependence remains a priority, notwithstanding the number of rawchers.
The wheel is responsible for 85% of the cases of Lungkreb.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It affects human health strongly.
"Today there are still in Quebec 1.5 million raucher," the speaker André Beaulieu is attracted.
Successful data: 10 years after the inspection on the cigarette, the risk of cancer is reduced around half.
The weight
According to the Canadian Kreb Society, the adoposite also promotes the breathtaking of diseases.
They seem to increase the risk for breast, grimmdarm, mastdarm, expertry, baths and powder breast crops.
"The research shows that a regular physical activity during the whole life against Grimmdarmkrebs" he adds.
Food
The organization also recommends limiting the saddle of red flesh.
In too much, it increases the risk to affect a grimm or mastdarm crystal.
Whirstwares should also be mixed.
The conservation of meats through rocks, trocks or salts can lead to the education of carcinogenes.
"Last the body cells can lead to the development of cancer," he said.
Vitamine
In recent years, several scientists have studied the relationship between vitamins and cancers.
Their investigations are now not deceptive.
After the Canadian Kreb Society, the studies on Vitamin E are contrary.
During a study, the reduction of the risk of prostatacreb was discovered, another increased.
The effect of Vitamin D on cancer has not yet been clearly evident.
Furthermore, Mr Beaulieu emphasizes how important it is to speak with his doctor about his concerns and his family prejudice.
"The implementation of a former recognition test does not lead to cancer."
The Higgs Buson Analysis
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs Buson has made a certain survey in the last summer, and this is a good reason.
You are believed in fact that this boson has nothing less involved in the mechanismism that is responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last part of which there is the standard model - our best or "le less false" declaration of the nature and the behaviour of the material, but it has not yet been empirically observed.
But for the physicics it's not completely sure it's actually about Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we have a real new part, and that it looks strongly like the standard Higgs Buson outlined by the model.
Furthermore, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented on a large Physical Congress in Kyoto, but it is still missing the data to be fully safe.
Let's even find out that it really is about Higgs, as it appears that there is only a small risk to tackle, and we look at what's going on.
In this world there is a widely unfair law that causes two objects to be not in the same place.
It's not possible to disappear against this rule - and you don't try to be too strong because you're hurt.
For even if the particips is a really rare world, it explains that it also applys a such law: the Pauli's exclusive principle, which means that two parts cannot take the same space at the same time when they are present in the same "condition" where this "status" is in the great and whole of some of their properties.
The physicians shall directly share the parts in two categories.
In an egg, the good citizens who are called as a career and obedient to the Pauli principle.
And in the other way, the bosons move, a normal band of anarchists, which is nothing holy - not at any time this principle, which means that they can be in fact at the same time.
These bowsons are in accordance with the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Labors (the other is absolutely amazing) in two groups: the Mess we're not being treated here and the "Capitates" which spread the great powers of the nature and with which the Higgs-Boson would be used anyway.
But here it must be pointed out that these bowsons are not all the sort of exotic creatures as you can.
If you are in the way to read this chronic, then only by a bosson of extraordinary banality: the photos or the "slight share," which is the "bote" of the electromagnetic force.
If parts of an electric load are accelerated or changed, the electromagnetic field will be exactly put on this place, such as a cell stone cast into a sample.
This "string" produces an electromagnetic bottle (like, infrarot or Ultraviolett square, etc.), and this waves is nothing else than a photo and therefore one of the bowls "Tragers of the force".
Stabile field
Likewise, the Higgs booson is applicable, with the difference that a other field, which Higgs fad, must be "covered" to show this bowson.
However, the Higgs fashion is much more stability than the electromagnetic field; the host must reach very high energy, comparable to a huge teeth, whose surface could only be disappeared by a very large stone.
This is why a larger part-inflammator is needed as the CERN - the lage Hadron Collider is a ring with an overall of 27 km! - to reach such energy.
Analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful to explain the relationship between Higgs and Mass.
In fact, they are not all parts and not all materials that interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some like magnetics do this, but others don't - for example, would never keep a paper from himself on the cow.
And in the same way, not all parts with the Higgs fashion: those who do it have a mass, while others (as other photos) don't have mass.
What can all these research now be "got," Mrs. Plamondon asks?
For science, they should be able to review the standard model (SM), and they also allow the physics to investigate exactly all disappearances between observations and previews of the SM.
There are otherwise many physicians who hope that such disappearances can be found, since the lowest difference could open a door to a "new physic" and stop some lies of the model.
It is necessary to say that the latter remains large, since there is no declaration for the weak force (ups!) and the dark material that forms about 80% of the material of the universe (earlier!).
However, in the CERN, such disruptions have not been found.
Effects
The effects of these research on general population are more difficult, but it would be wrong to accept that it would not be.
However, in the previous 60s, the Laser’s pioneers in the Bell Laboratory did not convive that their work would solve such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the destroyed Physiker Willard Boyle - who worked in the Bell Lab in which the Laser was discovered in the 1960s, and the 1962 itself developed the first long stickleser (the first) - said that the Laser was seen in the beginning of the Labor player.
Become...
In addition, applications can also be identified from all the instruments containing the research.
For example, Willard Boyle in 1969 has developed a small light sensor during his work in the optic.
Although it was not the original purpose, this Sensor served today all the digital rooms worldwide as an eye and introduced him the Nobel Price for Physics.
Of course, this does not mean that the LHC's activities are to change our life, but it means that you can't really know it...
Palliati - the best way to die... ◆ Le Devoir
Cebec, with its "slaw in Wurde" committee, discussed shortly the famous issue of life end.
The debate must be re-examined in shorts, although it is prepared by a legislative draft.
However, there is still much to do in this important area.
The Devoir has tried to look at this closer.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was alone in his apartment in Montergie.
The Prostatac acquired him had left him a period of two years.
"It gave me five years to live, I've done seven years," he said, "in his bed in the house of Pallitiv bottles Victor-Gadbois in Beloeil, where he was coming in the previous day.
"But it's always a shock that can't be prepared," he said.
The illness makes her work: an unrealised weak forces it to go alone to the toilette and even to eat.
On the table before a lower evening, he wishes to be sent to help at meat.
It is strong even to laugh and talk to the strangers who are occupied about him to bring him his medicine and offer him a bathroom.
The heart of the usual death.
"My greatest desire is to take my fall, because this is deeply," he shared.
A few hours later the team found a healing for this evil.
"In the course of our life, we learn that a man is painting in the star," said Peter Brodeur, the psychologist in the home of Victor Gadbois.
Return to the childhood phase for some persons is an unfortunate humidity.
"This depends on the ability of the person," a detrimenter, he states.
Since the view of several people working in the Palestinians, there are great events in the middle of this territory.
The patients who are invented in the house for Palliti balls Victor Gadbois are leading to cancer.
You have a maximum life expectation of three months.
In this stadium, they will overcome from the doctors and hospitals that are concerned about them, not more with such "hill" guns.
For Ms. A., 89, the worst fear, "conscious and by enlargement" is to die.
But by the disease, I really learned my children.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no desires more in life," she said before she accepts that you put a mask that helps her at the atmosphere.
In the next days, she is waiting for a recent visit of her son coming from Italy.
The home Victor-Gadbois offers a group of volunteers and aid for food.
The Palliat flow will then be used if there is no other possibilities.
To establish the death of the employees.
In Quebec, there are 11.700 inhabitants a bed for the Palliat.
That's very little when you understand that we're all gonna die one day.
This will continue life in best possible conditions, Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors of the house.
Even at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The death is given every time after the desire of a mouth with Brandy or Pepsi.
The diabetics should no longer control their blood suiker level.
And death is part of the day.
Yesterday, Mr X, we served a beer who died during the night.
Tomorrow his son will drink the beer at the feet of the perish.
"We help people and patients at the same time," reported the Pflege Director Nathalie Saard.
The home of Victor Gadbois is not a day like the other.
Besides an old man of 93 years, who enjoys the last family meeting in the Hof and is well seen of his heads, while you are inclined to his honor, a young man of 36 years dies who dies from his parents, his wife and his two little children, a tragic way after he tried to survive everything.
"Before six months three to five beds are always subject to cancer patients aged by less than 45 years," said Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients affected in the home Vim Victor Gadbois come from their accommodation, 47% from the hospital.
The problem of access to Palliatia
It is said that 77% of the Canadians do not have access to Palestinian feedings, i.e. to a feed that needs to suffer patients if the final stage has reached their life, both at home, in the hospital or in a feed home.
And several organizations such as the home Victor Gadbois and the society for household Palestinians in the larger area of Montreal are specialised more or less exclusively on the guns of cancer patients.
This great inconsistent in the health care of Quebecs ensures that several doctors specialized in the Palestinian eras of the adoption of a law on the regulation of death assistance and assisted suspicion with concerns.
Since October, a manifest has been signed by prominent personalities of the Palestinian plant such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointes in order to consider their responsibilities to such initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, the health system of Quebecs is not sufficient to ensure that all rights to high quality palliats have before accepting death assistance.
Before Kurzem, she says, I saw a patient who had 14 days with great pain in the need without having taken steps to their delivery.
I am afraid that patients want to die only because they do not receive adequate health care.
And at the same time, several uncoologists have banned their patients, despite the worst prognosis until the last day.
The survivals of Hellen Richard were already at least when she has broken a pregnant chemotherapiece.
When I shared my uncle that I'm gonna stop the treatment, she answered me that she's worried that I opened the fight, she told her.
However, she told me I was at the end!
No Populate Package
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of the patients who have requested to die, thanks to the staff that it has not occurred this desire after their pains have been affected by a team of the Pallitians.
However, it must be clear that Palliat cooking is not obvious in pain treatment.
After Elsie Monereau, the Chief of the Palliaty Communities of the household Palliaty of Montreal, 8% of the patients do not speak to a pain treatment.
So, at the end of life, the doctors often return to the terminal sediment that is outcoming to discover patients as sporad or sustainable until the time of his death.
We can't do so long as if we do not understand this side of suffering.
Patients without painliness will always have the opportunity to return to this terminal setting.
Patients whose pains are not tolerated say all the same words: "I want to die."
But that does not mean pregnantly, "I want you to apologize me," but "I want my pains to be disappointed."
The implementation of this report was possible by a periodism of canadian health research institutions.
Real estate real estate dimensions in Quebec
Managers of the road construction ambassador, the main building officers, the money managers of political parties and specialists of the Italian Mafia tell each day what they know about a great "System" in construction, officers, politicians, workers and mafiosos.
A "Industry", which was very slow for the tax payment of Quebecs, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
"It's wonderful how the system disappeared since it has taken drastic measures," uses James Duchesneau, Deputy Deputy in Quebec and the former leader of the police of Montreal.
The scandal was discovered by him based on an immediate investigation of the contracts relating to the road construction contracts in Quebec, which had only been voluntarily approved by the First Minister.
The "Dachesneau order" launched a direct connection between industry, secret financing of parties and officers.
"Now from the beginning of the investigation in 2010," he stressed, "the ministry of the transport is a billion dollars to the contracts," for some were instinct to receive their share!
The Charbonneau Committee "It has already been brought to case two citizens," he added, in the hope that it's available to you to "detect the tactics behind the individuals."
2011, constant anticorruption unit
In 2011, the permanent anti-corruption unit has also understood its troops with economic tests, foods and analysis of the government.
Furthermore, the policemen of the "Marteau-Truppe", which has revealed since 2009 that the "Canalization Card" from Montreal is back to the artistic explanation of the treaties...
In the past few weeks, she took carefully investigations and made accused against fraude and corruption against communical mandate partners such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, the citizen of a city, is a president.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has returned from his office as a citizen of Laval, the third larger city Quebecs.
He will be aware of being taken again in the exchange for public posts.
On the other hand, the road construction engineering of Montreal, and the Italian undertakings, such as Tony Accour and Lino Zfeld.
Lastly, he expressed the Commission the functionality of the system for the reception of public loans.
He even has even paid for a few years of the value of the contracts received in Montreal to one who has been connected to the Mafia, which override the money to the Union of Montreal, the party of the citizens of Garld Tremblay.
Mr Zfeld has lived over the year 2000 with more than $88,000 Canadians (ca. 68,000 euros) province parties, especially those that were in the power.
He also agreed to have organized a illegal resource provision for the former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts of canalization whose costs have been recently covered by him
In Montreal, the "System" of corruption worked without prejudice.
The former buildinger Gilles Surprenant described this before the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, accommodations to travel, golf touring, restaurants and Eishockey speeds, and $736,000 as a benefit for canalization contracts, whose costs he can usually assigned.
Other officers of the road construction ambassador have allowed them to smell by putting the accounts with false added performances around 30-40%.
Moreover, a member of the citizen's party, Martin Dumont, Mr Tremblay, accused that he had seen a sharp budget which had filled his cake with black money.
As a result of these enthusiasms, Mr Tremblay has come back to November, which Montreal has turned to a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first deputys of Montreal, who killed the alarm.
As a citizen of the city centre of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she was led to the sale of a community-based property from 2010 and sold for $5 million, and for $1,6 million to builders in the tree's real estate market.
70% black money in the election campaigns
From the investigation that is finally carried out, she says that it is "in a faden that allows it to understand the functional way of the system undermined by Amasians to stop the crime and to attack the fault."
It says that the procedure is "harry, but positive".
However, we are about to swear the wounds, we have only a certain unit for Montreal, and an oversee to prevent a return of the questionable practices.
How to make it clean.
Regularly.
James Duchesneau notes that "Awards have stolen several hundreds of million dollars", but especially thinks about the role of the "Mandats who are about the tactics in the image," if they were not developed in the drugs!
On the basis of a percentage of 70% black money in the financing of the election campaigns in Quebec, he said: "We have been said that this is just a weak delay of reality."
The Quebecs Government proposes to describe the Party Party on $100, which would not be changed according to the situation: "Of the time the election expenditures will be not closely limited, the black money will be within the policy. "
He recommends a complete review of the system for the delivery of public taxes and the financing of the parties: "We can't fall in deep; we can reconstruct the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws."
If this story causes the international view of Quebecs and that by Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau calls for those who laugh about to throw a look into their own home court...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
In this season you took a new size with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
You can explain it through a personal intention but also by the new size of the PSG.
Great players came.
Today, I have progressed on their pages.
The technical staff has also given me much.
These elements are combining me daily to improve my level of play.
And at one game, it's more easier.
On the football, it's very fast.
But I don't have to spread in my heart.
Since my efforts in the centre of the preparatory training of the INF Clairephantaine until my time of game in Saint-Etania, I have always made progress.
So you're doing the competitiveness introduced by Carlo Anceltti...
The uses of this summer are usually used to expand games very high levels.
You also know that every training unit is designed.
This means that a player like me needs to offer the stars and want to give his best.
Surely, Carlo Anceltti gives me a lot in relation to my play position.
He is supported by Co-Trainers like Claudia Makelelele, who played on the same position as I.
Is Alectos the right person for the task?
Sure.
Anceltti has all technological respect.
There is no comparable person currently in line 1 and it counts the best trainers of Europe.
He looks back to a real experience and has gained many titles with seen conventions.
He had contact with great players.
I think he'll win another title in Paris.
In January, I made an exciting conversation with him.
At the same time, I was just taking me from a series of disappearances.
The confidence he set in me is also a statement for my performance.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
Ligue 1 Lyon took us the place of the Spinner.
But we're laughing in the back.
One of our most important objectives is the Champions League: we have qualified in this way for the actelfinal.
What is the objective of the Union in this competition?
We will try to come as far as possible.
From now on, everything is possible.
However, we will have our words against the very good European managers.
First of all, we want to be the first one of our group before Porto, so that we can get the backing of the actelfinal as a home game.
Can the PSG become a large European agreement shortly?
He's already got the budget for...
In order to become a great European agreement, Paris has to win a title and take a name long-term time.
This is not the case today.
The PSG provides the funds to take concrete forms of this project.
Would it be a great success to win the title in line 1, as that was in the last time of the case?
Of course, this would be a great disappearance.
This year, we really are in the heart of the heart to disappear this title.
In the last time, we were closed.
In May, we were disappointed, since we were strong enough to get the victory.
We have completed the saison with a very strong performance.
We have completed 79 points.
Usually you should be with 79 points masters...
But another manager, that from Montpellier, has made a better saison.
I think this year's right.
Even though the big managers like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are about the title, I think we have the goal to gain him.
Do you think the media are too much waiting from the PSG?
In view of what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that many of us will be expected.
We accept this completely.
However, if we win at a home game against Troyes 4-0, and you still find something you can imagine, this is something fruiting with safety.
You're asking what people's waiting for.
We could never win every weekend with 4-0.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to create a game concept.
A mankind was built with time.
In the Champions League, we have proved strongness.
Consider Manchester City, a single of the two seasons has not been able to qualify themselves for the actelfinal, and who also has done huge expenditures!
With regard to the invested sums, you believed for playpause with 15 points of prejudice!
It shows that our gentlemen and the French mastership would be left without eye.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good in the last season, were made by this new PSG "boost".
This shows that the line 1 is slow.
I hope we will be the laughest winner in May and tell us that we have finally gained them in spite of all difficulties.
The PSG seems to be fully dependent on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
To better say of a "slatan independence".
This means that Ibrahimovic is a powerstake and a lot of tours.
That's why he came and proves that he's the star of the line 1.
In everywhere where he's played, he's shown that he's a great player and a world star.
Inside the mankind we respect both the players and the person.
He also respects those who kill him.
What he has done is really extraordinary.
This encourages the others to improve their level of game.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders worldwide, also allows all others to progress.
How did you experience EM 2012 with the French National Society?
Like a disappearance.
I was in my heart to participate with this EM.
Unfortunately, I've stopped my disgrace to make some time out of the game.
I've seen things I've been strengthened there.
Today, I'm going to achieve good games in the National Society.
This was my hope since my baptism with the Bleus.
From what has been achieved in Ukraine, we have led our teaching, and today we have to put an excellent behaviour on the day.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the top of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved a lot of expensive results.
We have a good position in the WM qualification group.
The National Trainer is crazy, the players stand close and go to the victory.
Like Laurent was white.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
White had reached his goal by qualified us for the EM.
I hope Didier Dechamps will lead the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Does this make an event play in Spain on 16 October (1:1)?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone used for the others.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never experienced a comparable game in my carrier.
With Bitcoin, pay and sales can be paid without bank
The contractor of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between the parties.
Furthermore, as often in these technologies, a political vision is clear: the convinced that the current currency system produced by bankmonopolies leads to financial crisis.
In fact, the Bitcoin found a virtual currency by Satoshi Nakamoto (a Pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (or in dollars, euros etc. converteable) as well as a protocol for secure exchanges such as BitTorrent that allows the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers on the network, some 200,000 transactions have already been made.
Some thousand websites accept Bitcoin as swing or as payment.
After the curs of Bitcoin in June 2011, he had reached a maximum of $30 (23, EUR), he fell on five months later to 2 dollars before he got at about ten dollars (the curses are brought on the Bitcoincardts.com website today).
Nothing particularly affected in comparison with the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown this report on virtual currency interest in October.
She describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success", "in competition with the dollar or euro" and "such as the original currencies".
Bitcoin distinguishes other types of virtual currencies such as the "Credits" that are used to get forward in a video game that can buy or buy through games (and sometimes also back).
The Facebook social network has also developed a such system.
However, trade is checked and processed every time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network notes are maintainers at the same time of the account book, tests, money emitteners and buyers and sales.
How does this network function?
Each transaction between two users will be found in reality between two e-mail addresses in form of an email.
With the difference that the user can choose another address for each payment.
A number of data related to this transaction is electrically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can check the transaction authenticity.
With the content of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the Bitcoins treated are available in the account book distributed throughout the network.
The decisive step is to put this new transaction into this book.
This is about a mathematical task that is launched on computers, whereby winners who are a sort of a proper central banker have the privilege to add these additional lines.
It is a cut of the file, i.e. the change of a big file into a short and clear electronic printing.
The computer 'Prepend' the new transaction and add a number before the whole "sharding".
The goal is to find the number that describes a special fingerprint (vially none at the beginning).
If this number was found, the other buttons can check whether it is the right.
Therefore, the transaction is permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and each amendment would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay two times very fast (more than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions will be valided from the network and the other remains without reference, since both different fingerprints have.
The computer who has removed the task will receive 50 bits.
In order to prevent inflation, this payment is regularly measured, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins found in the course are therefore limited to 21 million, but it is available to a hundred billion level, which allows a certain space of playing.
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement of the performance.
The life of the network has already been high and deep.
The sites prepared for Bitcoin services were attacked and stolen the Bitcoin installations.
"The used currency does not be the real protocol," says Peter Noizat, who just introduced the Phoutum, which is a company for the payment of real money and uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of the money stocks using this anonymous service.
Nevertheless, Bargeld also opens this manner.
Important actors like Wikipedia refused independence of this kind.
From others like the WordPress Word platform they are accepted.
Recently Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron by the Weizmann Institute in Israel have analyzed the account book and showed that almost 80% of Bitcoins are not in turn.
In November, a Mega key sale was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been decayed," Jon Holmquist rejoiced, working for the Coinabul company, the Bitcoins converted in gold.
Peter Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its system Paytuania corresponds to a credit card (for real money) or an uncontaminated payment with a mobile phone, but Bitcoin uses the validation of the transactions that are therefore more payable.
In addition, the owner manages its identity and may therefore remain anonym.
The system can easily be implemented in the guests and no new terminals or computer programs should be installed.
You just need to give an address that can be "fotoged and recognized" by a phone, Peter Noizat provides that he has a thousand users.
It is to draw up a general trend to overcome herarical systems for the most stronger horizontally designed systems.
"It will take some time until Bitcoin is carried out, but 2013 could be a wend point," he pronounced.
In its report, the ECB provides, however, to re-evaluate the different risks of this currency today as high in the case of a success of this currency.
We were departed from Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops left their responsibilities in Afganistan (Capisa and Surobi).
The NATO and the United States should follow the end of 2014.
It is time that the Afghan army returns the possession of their territory, and that the Afghan population decides to decide their future without waiting for everything from us.
In particular, we have anticipated the Afghan farmers by considering them as terrorists.
And himself soldiers killed us with our 88, as well as the last and teachers.
The Taliban consists of foreign extractors, former leaders who are laughing to Pakistan but often also from farmers that refuse an armed foreign presence, such as the Soviet time.
They want to defend their hundreds of age and archa traditions, even though they were closed to Dschihadists, Pakistan, Arabs, Usbeks and Taiwans.
Tolerates, sometimes, of the local prisoners, the latest will be not yet when the Western countries will be discriminated.
The waste of the French troops from the support point in Nijrab, which I observed by a planted hill planted with mandel trees which was financed with French credits, has been regularly followed.
The mounting cars and panzer convois have reached the box without attacks.
From the end of 2014 there will not be any more of the Taliban in Kabul.
Since 1994 to 1996, the conditions have been changed.
The same time, Kabul was empty and the country was overcome by the battle of the various opposite groups from the war.
Its exemption has been seen as a kind of release and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obskurantism of the farmers overlooked by the organization of Al-Qaida but have not improved their situation.
The former modshededdin, the Afghan government and the current Taliban have the common desire to keep women in a subordinated position.
The most important personalities of the anti-sowjetic war have returned to the power in 2001.
They turned into business masks by planning the government's principles to sell them as a Bauland for refugees from Iran and Pakistan and then benefits from the massive American delivery of contracts.
They have been called, and most of them were not even involved in the battles.
As I heard it in the campaigns, people want a government that doesn't come together from the servants.
Many young people want to leave the country, such as those who could make use of American uses: capital flight is significant.
Young people sat the war and his ideals.
During their exhibition in Iran or Pakistan, they have been contacting the modern world and have received their benefits.
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, the government schools are full of girls like boys.
These young people who do not want to return to the obskurantism of the other parties or to the corruption of certain leading forces are needed to be available for jobs.
All, even the armed parties, are visited by mobile telephones; the television with its Turkish Serbians that represent a modern world will be viewed everywhere.
A army is now present.
Will the authorities, under whose command manager, be considered legitimate?
The former commanders of the anti-sowjetic fight are already striving to recover the thousands in the province that are deprived by the power of the Central Government.
Afganistan, the country of the mountains with strong local identities, had to benefit from a certain part of thiscentralization, for example of the Western Nations, but through the abolition of the Office of the President of the Minister who had been found since the Constitution of 1964, the United States wanted to make a centralized State with a strong presidal manager.
The President of Karzai does not want foreign controls, particularly for the elections planned for April 2014.
Nevertheless, its country is depending on foreign aid since the 50 years and has already been prior to time.
Industry have not been reconstructed, functional steelworks are not available and important waterwater systems were not repared.
Everything is imported; from fruit and vegetables nothing is produced.
The private initiative will be adopted by the priority.
In a country that was designed by war for 30 years, a State control of infrastructure would be necessary.
The product was spread that Afganistan was immensely ground estimates.
This increases the impression that the Western countries were only placed to be able to be able.
Without energy to process iron or coffee on place, or without vehicles for a export on the mountains is not possible.
The Chineses have already left the coupfermine of Mas Aynak, the international archeologists (fined by the World Bank) in the large buddhist places of their exhibitions and remain the most important employers of the province.
One day, it will also be necessary that Afghanistan and Pakistan, depending on which far-time, are the imports and exports, re-enabled normal relations.
The waste of the French battle stripes was completed on 20 November.
The new Cooperation Treaty provides the continuation of traditional aids: girls and young girls, French Institute at the Universitys, French Institute, cooperation in military, legal, medical and agricultural area, support of the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a "civil military actions" service of the Ministry of Defence (Cmic) 2012 has been established, in the duty of mountain dörfers, many common work and actions for the healing of agricultural agricultural and implementing a small French non-governmental organization to try to gain the "hermen and spirits" and to achieve the unable task of the agreement of assistance and open actions.
These work needed for many local labour forces have been able to contribute to the oppression of the residues: skills, powders, drinking water, reforesting, fruits, ground protection and increased agricultural areas.
What subsequent will we return from two billion euros after military expenditure?
A more different budget will contribute to improving the local life conditions, which are often hard in more than 2000 meters.
In the message, the twentieth written requests of small agricultural projects were introduced by the municipalities of the province of Capisa.
In order to liberate the position taken by foreign groups, what is their own desire, it would need to continue to be smaller, well-controlled and directly concerned of civil assistance to their benefits.
A constitution with the greatest in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
During Egypt with regard to the constitutional declaration, which had previously granted him the unlimited fullness, more than ever remained, he decided to put it on a card.
To surprise all, he announced in middle, that the Constitutional Assembly will adopt its final appointment on the next day.
Against a week ago, the State Supreme had granted this plenary two additional months for the conclusion of his work.
Egypt has now been moved to a periodic, more than two years, in which the institutional stability disagrees and leads to a legal one another.
This new initiative has been provided for a further increase in the country.
For his gentlemen, the President urged in his "autocratic delirio" by continued "governing a word" and "the right with feet".
On the sides of his complaints, it is a way to complete the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible and to facilitate the transition process.
within 14 days a referendum should be stopped within.
A very short period that seeks the brothers to clarify their projects to the Egyptians to explain the text section for section.
For the President, it is also a way to reveal its public and democratic legitimacy while the trial kills the whole country.
After discussions in an interview with the American week view Time seems to be convinced that the Egyptians will agree well.
Instead to the Egyptian people with this optimised vote, it will be put on an ongoing vote: "If you are right for my draft or I have the unlimited fullness of the constitution, the last time after the adoption of the Constitution should be ended.
85 major islamist members of the constitutional congregation have adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals has not been requested.
Shortly before the Constitution declaration in mid November, they have rejected themselves because they thought that they were not able to bring their views to the use of them.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities or civil society have acted in the same way.
To achieve decision-making was added tomorrow in 11 persons, a comprehensive member.
Some are very close to the Moslembers.
It is not surprised that most of the articles have been adopted unlikely.
The commentaries remained firmly found that the only variety of views of the day... at the time of prayer had come to explanation, since some members of the group had thought that the penalty of the constitutional congregation did not have exactly gone.
The text that has been adopted last night consists of 234 articles.
Article 2 of all attention, finally, remains identical with the Constitution of 1971 and notes that "the principles of the Sheriya are the main source of the law."
The Salafist parties, for which the creation of the Islamic law is an important demand, had hope to replace "the principles" by the "norms" which would have made a more stretch application.
The Islamists is that this article has not been amended, a evidence for their good will and respect for the other members of the Egyptian society.
"Cleanliness" responds to the Liberals, who only look like this as a propaganda proposal.
Since they are due to the Islamization of the Constitution on other articles.
They have particularly recognized article 220 in the eye that the University of Al-Azhar has an advice function, particularly in relation to the examination of the compliance with the laws of the Scara.
In accordance with the Egyptian Specialist Sophie Pommier, it is inconsistent because "the persons who are requested to a opinion have not been selected and have no democratic legitimacy.
You can see this first sign of theocracy."
The fears of the Liberals will also be adjusted to the fact that the next recorder of this university had to be less measured than the present.
"There is not to recognize a concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution, we remain in the framework of the hostility State.
The majority of the jurisdictions working in this text are not the Ulema but the academics who have been made part in the French system," Alexis Bluet, who writes a doctor work on the Egyptian constitution transmission.
However, he said, "as in relation to Article 220 is a majority, since the words used are dismissed from the religious word.
In particular, the "Fiqh" [islamic legal talk, Anm. Red.]
And in the future, the question could be addressed by which civil directives are compliant to decide."
Besides his religious aspects, the adopted text yesterday is strongly criticised because of the rich powers he granted to the President of the Republic.
Moscreens argue that these are significantly reduced with the former regime.
Another struggle: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wish of the military, the examination of the defence budget shall not be submitted to the Parliament, but to a national defence Council.
There will also be no prohibition of civil proceedings in military proceedings, as it has requested the agreements to defend human rights.
Recently, their fears are also shared in terms of the text they are viewed as a threat to liberty.
The factful file of the blasphemy will be retained, and the claims are now prohibited, which could have severe consequences for the right to free view, particularly for the press.
Furthermore, there are no more articles concerning the protection of women, underlined Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
The only positive point of view is the prohibition of the consequent under Article 36.
This word was not contained in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian President had to express himself last night in the television, demonstrations are planned for afternoon.
The Members of the State Principal will begin on Saturday.
In Israel, the Ukrainian tourists were waiting for sanctuary places, the Nabel of the world and a sea from the Sun
The pleasant country is purified in itself by the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort and an inevitable nature.

Only mountains can reach the rains from their own power.
Everyone of the others brings a air seil trail to this historical gipfel.
In the north of the country, 1600 to 2040 meters high is the famous Ski area of Hermon, where it is in the wintermons unnumerable tourists.
From the foot of the mountain you get there with a shuttle bus.
The slides have a total length of 45 kilometres.
According to an elderly lies, it was likely mental gods lived on the mountain gap.
Visit only museum
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
Only one journey can't be considered all of them.
However, at least five of the most interested ones should be visited.
The Israel's museum is once beyond the Knesset (Parlament).
There are old cumbrants or writing roles from the dead sea found in the Jewish wilderness, retained by about 500 thousand archeological and anthropological exponents.

The dead sea is even warm and there is over the whole year.
In addition, this un normal sea is the most deepest sea of 417 meters under the sea level.
His species of water has a high salt content and has even unlikely difficult on the surface.
The surrounding countryside is unrecognisablely beautiful.
Visitors are here for treatments using Salzwater (natural Salzsole) and heat-slamm, as well as the treatment of hair networks, allergians, asthma, exempts, arthritis, bronchitis, sugar disease and the removal of radiated neurves.
The secrets of the age
This secrets bring the old city of Tel Aviv, which is the Jaffa city at the Mediterranean coast.
By this city, the famous seaway, Egypt, Syria, Anatoly and Mesopotamia has been connected together.
The city is mentioned in the old-grown and old Egyptian legends.

Theatre renovated carefully is being made up to this evening concerts and works.
Climbing for tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your bad English concepts: about 30% of Israel speak Russian.
The money on the travel is better to take in no euros but in dollars that can easily be changed in skills (date Wechsel curses: $1 to $3.8).
In the city, you will go before the bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a speed roadway and the only U-Bahn line in the country with six stations that bind the subtown with the high city.
It's also taken a sub-territory steel.
A travel inside the city costs independently of the vehicle 6 boards, which are sufficiently included for a travel from up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Saturday of the Sabbath will begin.
From Freitaining to sunset on Saturday, markets and business are closed, and public transport is quiet.
And on Sunday, the workday begins.
In many coffees, restaurants and guests, only cooking food is served, excluded in many coffee, restaurants and guests, which contained both milk and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between different courts with Hammel and River, Suppes and Deserts (prepared with cokosmilch), traditional Jewish Humus past, different summers, fried bottles of painted bottles and herbs (Falfel) and fruits and fruits.
There are no rigorous dogs in the streets of Israel.

You even see them sleeping in the darks of parking cars.
The cats likely live places and say no to Leckereien.
A rent car costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
In addition, the insurance costs $15 per day.
And bikeverleih costs 15 Schekels per day.

"The great and powerful" leads to Moscow: Migrants flower money for language
During discussions of Members and citizens on which uses the law on binding expenses for migrants, crimes have already been acted with qualified certificates
Annual year, 13 million busers come to Moscow, Sankt Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are the citizens of Central Asia: Usbekistan, Taiwan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to provide money for the maintenance of the families living in the house.
On 1 December, a law entered into force that, according to each employer, a test to the Russian language has to be assigned.
Today, this regulation shall apply only to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the common apartment economy and in the single trade.
However, the tests with the time of the Federal Migration Authority should be the future for all guest workers.
This is not only the most expensive, but also the tests in the Russian history and the basis of legislation.
Speakers need to be shown both for the content and extended employment permit.
Excepts are applicable only for citizens of countries in which Russian official language is.
In the case of this law, those who have received their training products and diploms before the accident of UdSSR in 1991.
Single, problemtics and protection of rights
The totality of the tests will be held under the Egide of the Poshkin Institute for the Russian language, the Russian University of the Federation, the Moscow State University, the Sankt Petersburger State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can get the tests in all cities, and now have been opened more than 160 relevant centers in Russia.
The testing initiative was supported by Members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Authority.
People's rights have before the entry into force of the law in the press several times the following question: What does the whole actually bring?
What changes do the requirement to demonstrate language knowledge, both for the Russians and for the guest workers?
In particular, deployed speakers of the Migration Authority are to reduce the number of workers.
"We are now talking about the protection of the rights of employees," said the Head of the representative of the Federal Migration Authority in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelew.
However, their rights have to be protected before their release.
Only an organised recruitment will arise to 90% the problems of foreign workers.
There are migrants without professional, education, language knowledge and medical care.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without timing knowledge will be aware of people with evil intentions that will steal him under the prefixion of help in a dark, firm baracke, where he will be harmed with thorns of his similar months without food and documents and 12 to 14 hours on the day.
We have reached many complaints of our migrants.
"In the house, it will be promised to you, and when you arrive, you will receive their pockets and not receive the promised wages," confirms the head of the main management of the Taiwan Migration Author, Tolib Schwaripow.
Don't fight, Chef!
However, many citizens of the Central Republics who want to gain their money in Russia to give them not only the language of the target country, but also express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much of their fault, but at least the wrong: few Turkmen, Usbuses and Taddiks can also be provided only for a successful basic education.
For in their families there are no more money to meet the children, to be able to buy their own clothes, shoes and schools.
As teenager, these children will then take the first opportunity for money service.
"It's difficult without speech," they add to.
"You feel awesome and less worthy."
People's rights notes the following important aspects.
The test only needs to take migrants with legal status.
If you do not have this status, there is no trial and so there is no official work.
The majority of guest workers continues to be illegal in Russia.
"Good Welcome" or "Submission for Unobliged"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to receive a official status in Russia.
The reason is to be Brazilian crowds and, of course, the matters of difficulties.
Furthermore, the legalization of money costs: 12 to 16 thousand Rubel.
A huge registration can be made fast and simply for one half thousand.
The workers of the Russian police know that our documents are most important and that we are not registered, and so there are cases of depression.
"You want one or two hundred rollers for cigarettes and tea," said the Tadschike Umed Hushkadamow against journalists.
"Don't make the costs for false papers"
Besides the day in which the law had entered into force, he stated that not only the registration documents of migrants could be fixed.
Some complaint certificates that appear to solve the most of the speed have already been taken by the Federal Migration Agency.
The painted papers were printed with a usual color printing.
Of course, the new owners did not use this: Each migrant who hoped to resolve the tests has paid for the document seven thousand rubles.
This is more than double than the costs for official testing: this costs a employer of three thousand rubbers.
In addition to the most important direct task of protecting the system from corruption so that certificates are not easily purchased, both officials and citizen rights are unique.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise that they receive time for a speech basis course at the first time.
In addition, new conditions will be offered without language-known offices in areas where no active understanding is necessary with people.
Ministry of Internal Weapon Ignored illegal weapons
Part of legal weapons on criminals is extremely lower
The Russian Internal Ministerium provides a reinforcement of the law for private weapons.
To this end, the authorities react to the recent events: Last in wedding shoes and seven dead in the Moskau Juriste Dmitri Winogradow Amok.
The police wants to deliver the tragedy of non-hour arms in the public and to overcome the age for the ownership of shopping weapons from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal has supported and promised the President of the Duma Committee for Security and Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, and the President of the Duma Committee, to submit the changes to the arms law in shorts of the Duma.
Not all are satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by the "aggregation of slaughters".
In the Internet, a open letter was published, whose representative, from the representative of various arms, requested by the authorities to take away from "reconsolided disappearances".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, expressed by the criminal lawyer, Watilij Lesnikow, the Russian BBC Service.
In accordance with the statistics of the Internal Ministerial Ministry, 142 crimes were investigated in the past of six months in 2012, while the total period was 1,168 thousand delicts.
The defenders of the open letter are convinced that a reinforcement of the law for private arms ' offence will not be stopped of acting on the black market.
At the same time you can find any possible weapon for a few money in Moscow.
However, the Ministry of Interior notes that the dissemination of illegal weapons is under control.
License: from the factors to the officer
The arms have reached several channels on the black market.
There are five of these main channels, telling a former Viktor Baranez Prime Minister of Education and the General Office.
Screenshot of a website that takes weapons orders
The first channel is the army or the military, so weapons that were stolen during the battles in the coffee.
"The weapons were stolen both from the Russian officers, as well as the caucuasians themselves," says Baranez.
On the second channel, illegal weapons will be stolen by the orders of crimes.
Baranez explains that weapons were numbered both from the police chambers as well as directly by employers of the criminal persecution authorities.
Another illegal weapons sold are from military arms.
Many military slaves were often explosives.
"There is evidence that it was acted in some cases about branding to decrease the lack of weapons," said the former military member.
In accordance with Baranez, a contribution to the black market is also provided to the arms producers.
"Today there are innumerable private plant factors that do not hold the international competitiveness and therefore the weapons under the black market, around Moscow, have been disappeared," reported the experts.
Another channel of the black market is the smoke.
In particular, many pistoles and petrols come from poor countries such as Kirgisia.
"There is a own, sometimes manual production, and a mafia organized by the smuggle", explains the former military member.
Where are the arms?
Experts calculated the share of each of the five channels in the delivery of the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was presented by the Centre for Problem Analysis and State Management.
The experts analyzed reports of the Internal Minister and of the Federal Service for State Statistics, Criminal Literature and Public Accessibility Data on Portals on the subject of weapons.
The overall part of the illicit weapons is by the enemy of the army and the law enforcement authorities.
The half of all weapons on the Black market are there by the "law of those who have been responsible to do in their work with weapons" is reported in the report.
The data of the researchers are 17% of the arms from conflict areas, 14% returns to the thresholds at the weapon production, and 5% of illegal exclusions.
A sellman who does not want to be called namely ensure that weapons found in illegal exhibitions have no longer bought since they are driving.
As a result, it is more often that the handlers care for the follow-up in a gun layer.
A weapon is bought over a powder, for example, a pizza of the TT type.
The weapon is exposed and transmitted through the wheel.
"The Handler brings the weapons into the city and sold them there for 900 euros per piece with two magazines," he says.
"The police is of course aware of decisions and therefore leads the plan to discovery crimes, through regular control purchases in the guests offering illegal weapons," adds the sales officer.
"Who in Luxus loading"
Purchasing and sales are most often known to acknowledged.
I had seen websites and blogs when someone had been attention to me and was pressed to come to the "Begowaja" station where a person would wait to wait for me at a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
The Price for the Waffen I found just there

"To ensure a weapon, I need a knower who has contacts," said the vendor. "I have so a recognized, but I don't trust him."
There are leaders on the markets, but there you have to go and spread with a code as "of Iwan Iwan Iwanowitsch, who allows the daughter to make a lack."
I'm currently coming to some lockings about a recognition that I trust.
He also gives me the guns for this reason because he knows I don't get him.
Neulins are looking for weapons in different ways.
The former military Victor Baranez tried to the middle of the 1990s as a buyer of illegal weapons when he wrote a article on this topic.
The schemes have not changed according to him.
He got a photograph in which he was "all-saving" was formed.
"I felt like in the Luxus load," the military members remembered.
The buyer receives not the cat in the sack, but can try everything.
I'm not just buying as potential customers, but walking with the buyer in the forest, and we put a target board there.
"I can look there, and if I am convinced that the weapons have a good shot, we're negotiating one another," the expert describes the progress.
Sale from Sofa
Internet search machines show search results in websites and groups in "Vower contacts", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
There will be no paper need nor personal meetings.
"You only need the appropriate sum of money," it says in the advertising notices on the site "Kampfistole or weapon."
There give users your orders and ask.
Will it also be sold for minors?
"On naturally without license", users asked "Iwan" (while citate).
"Back a TT. Moscow," said the Lake question of "Fedorenkow".
The Federal Security Service has dismissed unnumerable carriers, and buyers who want to acquire weapons are going to the service on a network.
People come like hungry fish in the plant and countries in Siberia and can watch cooking
Military Ventator and former Military Viktor Baranez
I have heard from the following scheme: The website is usually registered in the foreign country, and Russian laws do not find any application.
The respondents shall adopt the orders.
The buyer transmits the money on a bank vehicle.
"In response, he receives a photograph and a description of the hiding of the weapons", reports the Press speaker of the common organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitri Kislow.
Viktor Baranez notes that you can also go out empty to the end and get back lines when you put an application on a website.
The Federal Security Service has dismissed unnumerable carriers, and buyers who want to acquire weapons are going to the service on a network.
"The people come like hungry fish in the production and countries in the siric laborer and may cut cows," he says.
A machine for 100 US dollar
When buying illegal swap weapons, experts will be calculated according to prices from 100 to 900 US dollar.
According to Dmitri Kislow by the "Pravo na oryzhie" organization you can buy a pizza of the type Makarow for $100 to 300.
You need to wait for one half month.
The weapon is exposed in military arms campaigns of average roads.
According to the Official Statistics of the Internal Minister, the number of delicts with illegal weapons in all Russia during the period from January to October 2011 was 7 to 22,9 thousand, while the number of cases covered by the ground and the pressure in connection with weapons, munition, shops and packing facilities was 7,8%.
In the U.S. Strength Fast Food and Super market jobs
Each four US-American youth is sitting some time behind the scene of McDoald's
During the past days, it came to massive protesters from low leathers in the Philippines of Walmart and restaurants, like Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and King Fried Chickens.
Nobody can predict whether the proteins are still pushing up or whether they are soon out of the air.
Protesters are supported by trade unions and several linked organizations.
In addition to increased loans of simple Walmart and Fast Workers, the Protects' organizations continue the objective of establishing businesses.
Today, this industry of the economy is often operating in work.
46 cents per year?
The Protests began last week after thanksgiving, on the so-called Black Friday, in which the United States sales were carried out that millions of customers were blown, which were led to hand-employment.
Today, some Walmart workers, from which it is worldwide 2,2 million, have been paid and operated together with partners and left active palles of the kitt, whose target group is lower and average income.
Walmart sold all products, from winds on ice and car battery to powders, eggs and milks.
The product in the Walmart-Filialen is at the scene between 8 and 27% worse than in large superm markets.
This is why many of the available Walmart employees will only buy in their own workplace.
The prices and the property made Walmart to one of the largest companies in the United States.
According to criteria, Walmart can often only sell the product as well as the employees are badly paid.
Recently, the work conditions, for example lacking gabel stairs or handscanners.
The participants of the Proteste on the "Black Friday" requested loan increases and expressed their allegeds that the contribution for the operational health insurance was increased from 30 to 100 dollars in the month.
A typical Walmart worker, which provides 9,5 US dollar for the hour, could not be able to make this increase, said they.
Researchers from California University in Berkeley suggest that if the company increased the average loan at $12, it would cost Walmart $3,2 billion.
These are approximately 1,1% more than they are now depending on the loan.
Whether Walmart was completely on the customers, each purchase costed it only 46 cent more.
This would be for them in comparison to today more expenditures of only $12,39.
Walmart's responsibilities are satisfied that it was only in nine US states and that they have not protected any losses to the company.
The Black Friday continued to load from 8:00 from Thursday to midnight on the next day, and in this period Walmart sold about 5000 articles per second.
Overall, the Walmart chains led to "Black Friday" nearly 100 million transactions.
The company's speaker, Dan Fogelman, said in an interview on the left site of the Huffington Post that the total "more than five" Walmart workers had been working and the protestation was only "a further PR Trick" of the Protect was organized.
"Free Cass!"
The Protestes continued this week in New York, however, where your goal was not Walmart-Filialen (which weren't in this continuing city and so there are already available), but McDonald's and other favorite restaurants.
McDonald's says that the company sold billion portions, and yet you have no hospital days, and you will not pay for your honorable work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New Yorker City Councils
Currently, the minimum wage is at 7,25 dollars for hour according to federal and New York legislation.
In Fast Food Restorors, the minimum loan will be increased, but not too strong, and in average they will receive their simple employees in New York 8,90 USDollars the hour.
It's less than they won nobody in this dark city.
As soon as it is possible to get out of a little money in New York, I'm incredible.
There was a time in which almost a quarter of all American young people after the school at McDonald's behind the theke, however, the young people still lived with their parents.
Another of them saw the main income or planned to stay there longer.
Now I'm interviews with McDonald's constant people who accused that they're going to get out of this wage and sometimes have to adhere to their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the Wall Street Journal Forum, which has noticed the deputy to be responsible to get children if you don't know how to meet them.
The participants of the Proteste who began on Thursday at 6.30 p.m. before McDonald's in the 40th Street, and in the Madison Avenue, invited the Cassiers and Coach of Fast Faod Retainers to get a minimum loan of 15 USDollars, which corresponds to more than a deployment of the ministry.
They continued requesting the education of workers in the Fast Food Branch.
The U.S. Act allows the management of the company to stand on this goal and to denial or solve members of the company.
On the other hand, the company is not easy to make them.
The creation of companies in the Fast Food Branch is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high personal flowing.
Unfriended
Lautstarke Proteste was also found in this day before many other Fast Food Resorts in Manhattan.
The high point of the Proteste was a meeting on midday before the McDonald's Times Square, in which some local democrates said, including the City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said: "McDonald's say that it's sold thousands of portions, and yet you're not provided any diseases, and you're not gonna pay for your honorable work!"
The demonstrators were also supported by other prominent democrates in New York, for example, the citizenskandidat Bill De Blasio, who said that "by jointly the Fast Food Workers should receive a right wage and can achieve the economic welfare that every New York has won!".
According to New York Times, this was the greatest action of their kind in the history of the US Fast Industry.
Nevertheless, some hundreds of people were in place, of which at Weitem not all are working in the Fast Fast Faod Brand, in which they work in New York ten thousands.
Still is not to see whether the function of these proteins is mobilizing the whole mass.
"The brain is only able to overcome so far."
The theme of expanded reality in the complementers of modern technologies is usually accepted by the lines of a specific brief.
Google was first present at its annual conference at the summer, and in November, it was recognized that Microsoft had also reported a corresponding patent.
In conversation with the leader of the group of interactive 3D technology in the Microsoft Labor in Cambridge Shahram Izadi, it will be clear that the Brille for the company scientists was only a transition station.
It travels to manipulate virtual objects in the air with blue hands and creating virtual spaces.
- Please describe which research is involved in your group.
We are engaged in the interaction of man and machines, but we want to extend the borders of this interaction.
Today, the humanity remained largely steady in the phase, working with flash screens, which sometimes are also touched.
However, we want to predict the radical changes of this interaction for 5-10 years and to predict the changes of this interaction.
For example, the Xbox Consoles and the Kinect Sensors are an progress, and today no Xbox is sold without kicket, since all are interested for movement control.
- What are we waiting for in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction on a physical level, many still plays on the flash screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of the information (the system required for more data) could be improved, which outputs have not yet decided.
We are trying to change this, working to real three-dimensional performance systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to leave the computer world in our physical world and make them more fassable.
However, it is necessary that not only the user but also its environment will be recognized.
Then we could add the real world a lot more easier through virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get off this protected Virtual Reality Helm!
- What are you thinking about the speech control?
She's loved, but isn't she overlooked?
- It is sure that it is not the all-week solution because she has issued questions on private, because it is not always wanting to inform all the circumstances of its actions and intents.
In fact, every kind of interaction with computers is good, however, every one in its particular nices.
For example, we worked in the field of control of objects on public places at a project where we were taking short and shortly experienced, instead of downloaded guests.
The sentences were not recorded by the object room but by a armband registered by the movements of the bones and muscles.
However, it is relatively large, but theory could be reduced to the size of a armbander.
However, the future is totally the mixed control types, such as getics and languages.
- How's that?
- For example, would we ask you to make you a rich of this sprude dose?
You're saying it and talking at the same time.
- Usually, I'm just saying it.
- Oh, it would be very hard to recognize.
- Do you say that you want the user to adjust what a machine can make for any time and what not?
- Not at all, but it's about a mutual approach.
I think that in the next time we need to work especially in the development of new disasters that can understand more accuracy reactions of people.
This may, for example, be laser sensors, because they offer a good solution that is very important.
- What answers do you offer from your work with the Xbox Kinect Sensors to modern cameras?
Is there no solution, deep or something else?
- The present generation is, on the basis, a good starting point for our work in the threedimensional conception.
Of course, 8 megapixel with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main boxes are not the megapixel itself, but the quality of the matrix and the deep.
So all current technologies are not well enough for us because the developers of the algoritms have more work.
It must be taken into account not only from the resolution by the X- and Y, but also by the end of the Z axis.
The speed and the number of images per second are important.
People's movements are extremely dynamic and open, the current 30 fps are too little for senses.
Stephen Betishes developed in our Labor in Redmond, a conductor with a regular processing duration between 1 to 100 billion, with the current commercial sensors near the second value (60 to 100).
Not all understand how much the interaction of man and machine affects.
For my work, I needed exactly a preparation, only without control and with more images per second.
- Doesn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect is currently working with three "cameras", one of them is an infrarot and the second is an recipient for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a normal RGB camera.
It does not need to calculate the objective.
More cameras may be able to solve the problem...
Or strengthen the problem as more calculations would be necessary.
It would be a flexible, kinect-style system where we could play with different camera relations to determine how it helps us at the three-dimensional delivery of a position.
- If I just remember, Microsoft was in contrast to Google's brick of publicity.
Do you not think that in terms of application of the technology of extensive reality every day the Brille has the best views?
- Of course, it is not accepted to keep a smartphone in the hand high, but I think that the most amazing variable would be an "change" reality where we can turn over a cloud from the bride on the smartphone,
The Brille is a personal Gadget and it is their strength (privates can only see), but at the same time also their weakness, because a extended reality by Brille prevents you working together with other virtual objects.
- Let's take a long time before that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is not only Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also available to normal death.
There is a problem to show the criteria of this idea often: there is no feeling reaction!
The hands don't make anything!
What answers are your group to give to this invoice?
I'm often talking about the extension of reality shows the seventh interaction between man and machines.
I think the eightth breaking could be integrated through the tangible acceptation.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as an unrealised projection design.
She takes an emotional pressure!
There are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "pictures in the air" some hands, for example, the interference of some Ultrash roads produces in a certain point where the finger is, a feeling that is now weak, but it is still so weak, as someone pushed over the arms.
There are also flowers for the rockets that affect the neurventions in the fingers, and this is a potential direction.
- Are you trying to overcome the brain?
It's going to think it's going to make what it's supposed to happen when it's just looking for something?
- That's a good idea, so we've never tried.
This is prohibited by another task that we have to be fighted for a long time, which is a person who is physically located in a closed room to believe he has been held in an open, practical unendly room; here we work on concerts with travel countries (other than in Fitzy Studies), travel platforms and large cubes.
Today, the brain can only overcome slowly, and there are still many years of work before us.
This makes the work in the area of virtual reality for a researcher: we are at the beginning at many topics.

Rosbalt continues the "Petersburger Avantgarde" project, the city inhabitants who form the Avantgarde of Art and culture.
On the list of the country's reading list already high-range representatives of the Petersburg Art centre, whose success is going out of the town borders and finds the recognition often in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, who are clothed in Rot, which is sometimes at the Russian Museum, sometimes at the summer garden, sometimes at the scene triffs or on Vernissances.
Whereever the images of Kirill Miller are also exposed, they have great human mass.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburger social-philosophic artists that create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a light personality of the Petersburger Avantgarde end of the 80st or beginning of the 1990s.
He is also a man of the city and seed by his presence on the road of his friends a laugh in his face and guarantees for good lamentation.
Before Kurzem, he dreamed a drehorg and became a pioneer to Petersburger, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in the terms of his artist, his philosophia and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not for example in Gelb or Turkish in the city?
I chose the red colour as a modedesigner that sets itself with the optic and the image together.
In this world, it is a red of the compromise between artists, image officers and society.
Society calls for everything that reflects from the graunorm, aggressions and evil behaviour.
But I want to speak through my provokations with the people.
Each of my past provokations was an invitation to speak.
- When did you know you'd have to be a massive?
- In an exhibition in the cultural palast Newskij, where my work were made.
I guess I have to go this way.
Then the time of the old was free, but not officially recognized times at the end, and new and free times as I were unwise.
I welcomed the masters of the new generation, so with the representatives of the "Gazonwschina"; so Pushkinskaja 10, and then it was the first end.
I'm going to theatre, to mode, to music, actually, without literature.
And all this was in your kind of clinic, I was important to stand in the middle of Petersburg culture where the best artists should gather together.
In 1995, I was located a room in Pushkinskaja 10, and there was a musical-artist club for the Boheme, the house of Petersburg Boheme.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzzz, and I remember how sharing came there with his "Ucho Van Goga" project.
Snur and his friends sang easy songs to playback, brought close tricots, and were also gehört to them today's composite Igor Wdowin.
When the group began to play alive, her "Leingrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great carriers, but he learned the foundations with us.
The Galerie "D 137" or the "Griboedov" gallery also have their origin in Art clinic.
Therethin went our employees and tribes.
I am a hero of the past century as a culture means yet.
In the year 2000, there was a survey in the press where it was the name of our city.
I got in the "Category of the Year" category, and so I was encountered at the high point.
It is not easy to work in new times after old rules; I am a man of truth, honor and culture of the past century.
Today, it is easy to be glorified, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be glorified in order to provide cultural contributions.
- Your jobs have an unrecognisable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pillars and clearly bring the currentness and hardness of the thoughts to express.
I'll have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are without time.
I was social, but now I'm worried about it and I'm ready to be so.
In a clown, it loses all and loses his tragic.
I love the Greteke, and I have great ideas.
For example, we call the world by specifying that everyone has full clothes.
Now everyone looks at the clothing and focuses on the outside and not on the inner man.
But perhaps you can not give a person the hand, but should smile him in his face.
The smoke disappears through clothes.
We saw you in the role of the star of the drehorte dry player.
Who if I don't?
- Can the commercial artist also be beautiful?
- Today, commercial art must be careful, careful and smokeful.
We're seeing the trial of the cultures.
The people formed great groups: Bohemians loved the one and the simple people.
Now there are micro communitys, and it's difficult to enjoy everyone.
I'm not a hundred dollar not that everybody likes.
Now you have to talk about who you'll like.
Now everyone has approximately 100 addicts.
- To the attacks of Stas Michailow, but several thousands are coming!
- There the sex-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people and not 10 thousand, so there are less management, money, and everything is going to be found.
I have attachers, and the most important is not to worry and not to destroy it.
In my youth, I made such pictures that have even turned into a series with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with images that usually come to the end of the carrier.
Today, there are many misunderstandings.
It is called spiritual culture and consumption.
The consumer has no culture, this is something else.
I am a man of the past culture and grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty, and don't have money to be able.
That's the culture I'm afraid.
- Kirill, what's wrong with Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say, the servants of the culture.
However, not everyone of them can take place with culture.
For the real race, it was different because the races might not understand a lot of culture, but they understood that the right experts were necessary.
There are currently good advisers in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have some who could be experts, but they will be locked the way, as it needs more higher experts that appreciate the first ones and free their way.
Now it's just about your own shit.
The same is applicable for the Erarta, however, with the difference that they are honestly saying that they do not accept all timely arts and have to seek some of them for other museums.
- What's with you Petersburg?
- Petersburg is not the culture capital; in Moscow there are many more cultures and a corresponding narboes.
On our stones, artists can only grow hard.
We need a cultural nerbodies, for for example, we have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many new people visiting exhibitions or concerts.
It's much less.
Art must be again modern, as at the beginning of the previous century.
The project is funded by subsidies of the city of Sankt Petersburg
Heritage in the World
Earth in danger.
Enhancement or cohesion with kilerasteroid.
Karavanians of space ships with land inhabitants on the board are looking for a replacement planet.
To save humanity, is the important question of how can we continue in weakness or on the replacement plan?
Many choices have no idea.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least live hypothetics.
"Today Mars and Venus," said the scientific employer of the Astronomic Sternberg Institute Wladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on the Mars are comparablely friendly, a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus is a temperature.
Life would only be in greater height or in the overflow of Venus, so in all, possible.
The question of the continued planning was first addressed by the researchers in the field of Flora.
A half - century ago, plants were performed experimentally.
The fourth generation of the heritage of the orbited herds is not less different than the earthic species.
It followed the density of insectes, more precisely of mixed fruits (Drosophila), in the Orbit.
In 1979, the Wathelier was sent to the world to investigate how the weakness of Embryos results in the development of the world.
It developed a very normal kitchen.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the kit needs to find the stop; it must be able to be on his legs and start to move," said the Laboratory of the Institute for Medical Biological Problems RAN, Wladimir Sychew.
Without fixed basis, the kitchens are white.
10 hours later, the institutions of the new birth were completely disappeared.
The kitchens did not respond to light and light.
Four days later they died simply.
"Twee times we left the kitchen and put the whole, because it is easy unable to work there with them," said Wladimir Sychew to the unnecessed experiment with the kitchen in all.
The last bridge with animals fled in the Orbit 16 years ago.
In spring 2013, the experiments are continued.
However, on the "Bion" is only equal specifications.
There was an expert with Rats who have already been sent in all.
It was not particularly determined in this principle.
"This was just with the biostats, but it was only a single experiment, and the research needs to be continued," notes Wladimir Sychew.
Following the landscape, the spaces of the world were followed.
The problem of continued planning could not be solved in the world until now.
The task is difficult.
The animals that are removed from their natural life room can't easily follow their planting train.
In contrast to animals, humans could be the principle.
The Homo wise is able to abstract thoughts and can generate a similar emotional background.
Such experts are not carried out from ethnic talks.
But women are flowing for 50 years in all.
The largest risk was in Tereskowa.
The most valuable mankind is the female organisation.
Our dogs fled from it, and no one could answer the following questions: Are they over the world's space?
Will she bring a child to the world after that flight?
"No one answers this question," says the Space Travel Watchnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after its world-level flight, was born the first female cosmonautin, Valentina Tereskowa, a daughter.
The father of the child, Andrian Nicolajew, was also Kosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in Swetlana Sawizkaja was born two times in the orbit and even worked outside the space vehicle, a son.
However, there is a risk.
We only have a few cosmonautes, with which they were good after a long flower and got healthy follow-up.
"Just more, it's more dangerous at flights in the Orbit," concluded Kosmonaut Waleri Poljakow, herd of the Sowjetunion and the Russian Federation.
And yet, the humanity must seek new ways in biotechnology, rail protection and the product of artificial gravitation.
The hydrowork in the preparation centre of the cosmonautes is a binding station during the air preparing.
Here, in a sweet state, the cosmonautes Routine for the work in the open world.
The water makes the weakness of the water.
Even if adult water is accepted as accepted, it is a strange environment; but the water accepted as a natural element.
It is like the small iotyander witness that life has grown in the ocean country.
There is a relationship between the fact that a child is located about 9 months in the building of the mother's fruit water and that it can easier to water.
The principle is the logical, since from the birth to the first females just two weeks.
"That's too little time to forget something," says the baby's teacher Marina Aksenowa.
Thus, during a newborn child the weakness is a lot of natural state, the woman is not without weakness.
In the state of disasterness, the Bauch and Becure muscle is very fast back and therefore the ability to express the child.
Well, let's get this through birth-in-laws.
For example, the birth could take place in a special room to express the child.
"But what's happening then?", the unresolved question of Waleri Poljakow.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial strength.
Without feeling of concern, organism cannot form the skelett and the muscles.
A newborn child cannot be in the Orbit as an adult to teach in a charge rate.
Ihm will just miss what is important for his life of elementary.
"Igor Pestow, Irgor Psestow, is the head of the Bioethic Commission of the Institute for Medical Biological Problems."
Today, the birth of children in the world is blown theory.
However, it will be reality when the land in their space ships falls on a far planet that will be the house for their births in all.
NKU code: the control of the black system is dismissed by the debts of the policy
Tskchy has a provision on good control institutions and appropriate laws, however, in their application.
In the conversation of updates.cz, the Vice-President of the Most Control Ambassades (Nejvyší controlní ùaad, NKU), Miloslav Kala.
"An law is never complete, but it has to be applied correctly - and this is not my mind at us," comments Kala the current situation.
A similar result appears also a common control through twice and German tests.
As a negative practical game, he sets the preference of Prime Minister Petr Nečas.
In a long time, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not argue the undertakings with controls - is the system therefore prohibited or allowed?
"A law must have its integrity, and if something is legally prohibited, then it can't just come to the Government Chair, and the supervisor whose competence is now once the control of the respect of the law, defends in its activity," said Kala.
At the meeting of the Board of Consequents of the Chamber, you spoke about a common Czech-developed project in which the laws of both countries have been compared with public engagements.
Why did you go to the concert?
It is a parallel test that we have started about two years ago.
Simplifiedly, it is that the European legislation determines how to manage public allocations, which will build national legislation, and finally there is still the actual practical application.
We have all compared all this, and even though the trial has not yet been completed, we could set out extremely interesting differences, generally, the laws are even something more "stream and perfect", but the real application in Germany is better in some parameters.
In this way, it is not enough to implement more new and more rules, and it is also necessary to take into account the actual application of the law.
How can this project be helpful to you? What does you get from this project?
An such common control could help us to stop constantly to endeavouring the laws and the reduction and extension of weak values, if it is not particularly positive.
Economy means that a thing to a comprehensive price (that is not always the lower price) is to acquire and exclude unfair areas or even criminal actions.
But the reduction of weak values for delays does not ensure that we achieve this goal.
Maybe it's even that we're just increasing the system with an extraordinary "papierm" screen and those who are looking for the lame in the system have significantly easier to use the system than if the weak values remained higher.
They are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Tschechic provision law.
How does the control system operate in Germany?
Is there a similar authority here, like our NCA, or does the system differently function?
With regard to the authorities, the German Pendant is the NKU, which is built similar to us and has a colleague, which is only another thing.
The competences are also comparable to a certain measure, however, Germany is a Federal State, that these accounting taxes also exist in each of the US countries, which distinguishes the German system of our country.
The BRH can only control the federal resources according to our government resources.
Public resources that are managed by the authorities and communities are subject to the controls of the country accounting offices.
What about the German legislation is easier than ours?
In general, I would like to compare this without concrete information only inevitably, but it will not be clearly better to Germany in a certain view, but it is not possible to say that Germany is in fact better.
Maybe it's like that the testers are better there?
This does not mean, but as said, I don't like this comparison particularly.
It is still noted that the countries who are a form of fighting for us are also with problems.
Otherwise they had nothing of cooperation with our authority, right?
What about the Tsks legislation, which was the importance of your authority to the advertising of the provision law, are you already affected?
In view of the fact that this novel is in force first a short time, it is not yet operating in our tests.
As our controls are to take place at night, you need to be calculated here with a certain delay.
The new control tool "Detection of risks of ineconomicity" has been introduced and tested and analyzed in the future phase of preparatory controls - so we have introduced the new control instrument "Emerging risks" and has been examined and analyzed at this nearly 14.000 public expenditures - the changes will be effected, since the weak values have changed, the conditions for certain types of descriptions have been amended, etc.
See the adoption of this law is more positive, or will the system be charged with another officekration?
I think that this law decides a step in the right direction and hopes that this adoption is confirmed.
However, the problem can arise that the rules are "streamed" and that no longer can be maintained.
In accordance with the previous rules, the persons undertaken a review against the treasurer (such as, in the case of an operational programme of regional policy, the Regional Council) are a comprehensive obligation that any non-compliance with the prosecutor's law shall be equal to the presumption of the budgetary disciplinary.
But is it reasonable to make the law still more stretching?
I don't worry about this way.
The system must exclude those who want to adopt and misuse the system and not affect those who have started a formal error that does not act on the real decision-making.
A such system only sets the offices to be greater pressure.
Where's the way?
Let's first tell us what way is not targeted.
The Prime Minister said that the ODS would not help the enterprises with the so-called controls. The black system - what does that mean exactly?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
A law must, however, have its integrity, and if something is legally prohibited, then it cannot simply come to the Government Chair, and the control of which it is obliged now once the control of the respect of the law to disappear in his activity.
He can say, "We change the law and allow the thing," but he can't say that we do so as if nothing would be.
The provision law contains relatively strict rules on formal implementation of certain actions, and this is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other side, it is also tragic if the bier is excluded with the best offer only because of formal errors.
The law will never be complete, but it has to be applied correctly - and that is what I think is missing.
On the streets, along the streets, they are drunk.
On the streets of Tschechian, it is partly snow and ice flats.
However, the roads are well dangerous, including increased precaution.
Karlsbad
In the middle of Karlsbad, the roads today were well dangerous, collected snow and iron snow.
The temperatures appear to -5 to -10 °C, the tags should be warmer.
In the region, it is no longer, and in the deep levels, there is only a dark snoweek.
However, there is about 30 cm snow.
In accordance with the details of the circle street, the limited view was not limited because of Nebels.
The rapid railways R6 and the trailways of the first road class in the region are now uncertainly.
Nevertheless, for example, attention is commanded on browsings where the carriers are required and glass.
In the same case, all roads of the second and third type of road are dangerous, including the mountain roads.
However, on these roads, the best snow remained separately required or exclusively.
In particular in the higher situation, there is therefore an increased attention.
Bezirke Pardubice and Hradec Králové
On some streets, the eastern buses are dangerous about railways, higher situations and mountains, with a outstanding snow snow snow story, shares the road and car direction on their internet sites.
The roadsters warn the drivers before ice boards, which can particularly arise in higher situations in the area of Pardubice.
In particular, it is possible to come on the movement of the second and third road class in the Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is particularly located on the streets in the river and in the mountain Orlické Hory.
A outstanding snow snow snow snow is in high places on the streets of the round Rychnov nad Kn月nou and Trutnov.
In Easterns, it is sore or sore today, and it remains far lowerly low.
The temperatures move between -3 and +1 °C, the weak wind.
Beach Pilsen
The roads in the surround Pils are well dangerous today, but locally has been higher attention, and the vehicle is adapted to the weather.
This is cold in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees under the flight point.
As it was explored before and the temperatures fell afterwards, it can come to the streets of iron.
In addition, the view is to be calculated with nebel, but it is improved in the daily course.
This information shall be made from the board officers.
The D5 Autobahn is practically unrestrictable, increased attention recommends the roadsters between 80 and 131. kilometres.
The railways of the first road class are overwhelming, but overwhelmed.
Nevertheless, in the south of the around pils and tachov, it can result in ice plates.
The road trains of the second and third class of roads are short and therefore apply to the reference to possible sections.
The drivers should mainly be careful on the least frequent roads in the Böhmerwald area.
Olomouc Description
With snow, you need to calculate today drivers who are in the direction of the high levels in the Olomouc beach.
Following the use of stripe vehicles, snowematsch remains on the pass ◆ervenohorské sedlo and on the road towards Videlsý kííí.
Nocturn snow moved the road masters to use, which fell in the area of the road management about 3 cm news.
In the remaining areas of the surrounding roads are most unlimitable.
"Im Kreis Šumperk remains in the heights and the snowest.
On the past ◆ervenohorské Sallo, the drivers should be set in the direction of Jeseník with snowmeats," said one of the road management managers today in the face of the Agency ◆TK.
Their colleagues in Jesenik also had to leave in the night, according to their information, the roads are to the heights after chemical treatment and nass.
In the Olomouc environment, the roads are unrestrictable, but the drivers have to go carefully in the forest sections because the trains are still missed here.
Ústí Nade Labo, Bezirk Liberec
In the Northern Business, the road officers also report several badly dangerous road averages.
Besides several places with snow or ice plates, the mountainstraße of Telnice to Kniniice in the Ustí round is closed in the details of the transport policy.
The temperatures also remain in deep positions under black, so that snow and ice will be kept on the streets. From the levels, especially in the south of the Middle East, there are no problems reported, and the roads are generally driving there.
Until there are no transport storms notified.
Eisplate is reported in particular from the surrounding of ◆tí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions in the night, daily rain and milk snow, in the night of snowful sky and fruit.
From the main streets and from the road I/13 at the border of the Ústí no.L. and Liberec are reported bad transport conditions.
The locking of the road between Telnice and Kninice was necessary because of the most ecologists that were pressed from the snow to the train.
†imon Ornest: on our concepts we want to collect positive energy
What do you think that in less than one month of the world's entertainment will be done?
This is one of those catastrophes that we would like to touch people so.
With our band The Tap Tap, we make us more pleasant about and say that we are the only band of the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the world's transition.
In December, you will also realise a unique project with three concerts against the world's exchange.
Can you present our readers closer the project?
It is a wide country benefit event that we plan for two years.
For this we want to use the branding potential of the Maya calendar, which is the end of the December 21 to 11:10 tomorrow.
On the day before, h. on 20 December, three concerts will be held at the same time at 21:00 a.m. in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concert will be about the time at which the Pacific Kiribati is at 12 hours before us, the Maya Chamber.
Who's this idea?
Originally, I'm sure, then we've expanded the idea together with our graphicer Honza Augusta.
This is how we want to collect not only sufficient positive energy to prevent the world's transition, but also to think together with the public in which state we transmit this world once to our children.
By the end of the Maya calendar, we also have developed a unique collection of shoes, T-Shirts, Taches and key addicts to the world's end, with which buy through www.e-tap.cz can also support people.
The band The Tap Tap has also included the hymne against the world's transition with the title "World exit".
Today, the Hymne is very loved on YouTube. Does it also becoming on the Benefit Concerts?
Surely, and although it is completely concluded that everything is quiet and does not happen to the world's exchange....
The hymne should be sing of all interpretations at all three concerts at the same time.
Furthermore, the hymns will be translated in a direct maintenance of the Czech TV.
The text of the Hymne consists of Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main figure of Jesus in the videoclip, also Xindl X sounds with...
How did you come to cooperation with both?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Tskchych culture centre, so that we realize many benefit events and concerts...
We strive to join these people intensely in our projects.
This has been shown that most of us are interested in cooperation with us and have been glad about it.
What purpose is the resolution of the concerts against the world's exchange?
For the establishment of the free education centre of Studeo, we worked six years with the Verun Tap in Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly involved by lectors who help them in different free time activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the resources to visit the lectors, we want to help them in this way.
Within the preparation of the Jedlička Institute, it will be a own building that we enter with this project.
There are several groups and interpretations at each conzert.
After what criteria have you visited this?
We wanted to prepare a programme that applies to all generations, including children.
In Prague, China, support for Lesbyans, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jihí Search.
All further learn on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are the similar "growd events" planned for the future?
In May, we start the first time to Prager Frühling, and we also prepare a interesting program with interesting guests.
The next year, we also like to come to the Czech house in New York, and I'm personally -- if we're in the United States, it would also like to connect with attacks in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not just small until you have come to Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, the Tap Tap is a group that combines persons with disabilities.
How do you want these travels logistics and organism?
It's not so bad as it appears to the first look.
Five of our members are roll steel drivers, i.e. the roll boxs need to be promoted in the cart. Of course, we need many instrument offers and other packages...
There is no doubt that it has always been tolerated without problems, ◆SA and British Airways have always been very well prepared on us that I sometimes have been surprised at some time.
Even in Moscow, where we were not long, there were no problems.
By your foreign journeys, you have a comparison, as it appears in the individual countries with barrier liberty, how it is about with disappeared people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities in which everything is better than us, we were just witnesses in Russia who know that in the east there are still all in his events.
About Prag, Moscow is absolutely unfair. There is still unrealistic if someone is underway in the city centre alone.
There is not even a sense that there is an example of a roulant steel driver in the surrounding.
Successfully, there are Vereens trying to demonstrate people’s problems with disabilities.
And in what respect should we address against the further developed countries?
There's still a lot of things in which we're taking back...
However, it is noted that an improvement of the situation is still depending on the efforts of the concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely usually that people with severe disabilities can also be moved in the public room, in the museum, toilettes, etc.
But it is not just usually that there is a larger group of dismissed people actively involved in social events, where we're a little past with the band The Tap Tap to the West!
Respects in public and barrier freedom is a thing, but only when our series of important sports, artists, players, politicians or lawyers will really begin to change.
By the time, these are only individual cases of particularly desired personalities.
The Tap Tap is currently very popular. But if we return a couple of years, what have you motived to create a band in 1998?
At the same time, I began as a manager in the Jedlička Institute where I met many young people who were interested to work with something intense.
And since I'm musicer, and that's the Saxofon, I founded a music AG together with a colleague.
Well, and with the time, this is how our Moderator, Lá月a Angelovič, is to say something without control.
The band was known but only in the last years, or do I miss me?
It is true that we have helped cooperating with acknowledged scene, and we have also started actively to combat us.
We have been aware of that if you do something and do not see this outside, the performance in any sense does not exist.
Thanks to the EU supporters, we can make good lectors, high quality devices, etc.
Was your goal to bring it so far with The Tap?
From the beginning, I shot the potential that things can happen differently.
In the showbusiness, one of the others is often copyed today.
This is logical in his manner, as everything is looking at new and it is accepted after a long time.
There are only few really unique things, and I'm going to say that the Tap Tap is listening to it.
The first impression that the superviser has most is of course compassion; that is only of course...
But this fellowship is absolutely overfit because people with disabilities are not unique and left ways that we need to suffer.
They are people who can live a full life and develop themselves unless they have the necessary resources.
I'm always saying that if people with disabilities do something that is not only a progress for themselves but for the whole society.
Was it also helpful for this success that you were a closer head, how to hear of many people?
If you want to do something good, you can't get compromises in many things and must also require a certain discipline.
This is my fear but it's completely normal.
Some are coming to us with romantic ideas, and then they find that they have two times the week trials, they need to solve the preparation phases and take a lot of time on the concerts, then the mystery is soon removed.
This is how to work overall, in every band, which is seriously working and wants to achieve something.
The Tap Tap has twenty members.
How many of them were from the beginning, that has been since 1998?
Only one one: there is Angelovič.
We're a open group, people's coming and go, you can't prevent it.
He who has the will and the pleasure in the middle is welcomed with us always.
It will be placed on the day before the world's pronounced Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21.00 p.m.
Events are: Incheba-Arena/Prag, Fleda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Tschechic bands and other musicists
All three events will be connected to the end by Live Scanning, and there is a common interpretation of the Hymne "Wolear transition runs" of the Band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the Conzert is to establish the resources for the disposal of a multifunctional disabilities centre of education, under the name of STUDEO in Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost of cost: 25 million CZK
The entrance costs 400 CZK, children free to 12 years, cards are available in the pre- sale of Bohemiticket.
Poland and the world area.
Last week, Poland was adopted at a Ministerial Council Council of the Member States of the European World Space Organization ESA as a member of this world area Authority. It was therefore the second member country from the former Eastlock (Czech, which was a member of the ESA on 12 November 2008).
In 1994, Poland started close cooperation with the ESA and participated in several ESA projects in the next years.
The path of Poland in the world was freely started a lot of early.
Today before the Second World War, the Polynian cosmosts worked with the space journey, and they did not always understand.
For example, I recall the proposal of A. §ternfeld of 6 December 1933 in Warschauer Observatorium, in which the author had proposed thoughts from his pioneer work "Income to the cosmonautic".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (No. 1905) have left the audiences calm, and after years it was remembered by †ternfeld that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had been interested in his work.
◆ternfeld in 1934, for "Eingang to the cosmonautic" was won by Robert Esnault Platerie and André Louis Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) was later an important attendant of the astronomic and the space journey.
In Poland magazines, he published hundreds of articles and wrote several books to these scientific disciplines.
Gadomskis’s worldly recognised contribution to the development of the roomway, as well as that one of the branches on the earthquake of the moon has been called after him.
In 1925, it was built in Poland a railway drain which was planned for a racket derivative.
Unfortunately, the author of the project and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even surprised whether the wheels should be used to start or to the brems of the Draisine.
The information should be provided exclusively from the temporary press.
In 1933, the Poland Infantery began to take place with racked operations.
Research work led the Comórka Techniki Usbrochenia in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokzyckiegi.
From the translated documents it appears that the research has been predicted in the Stadium of practical tests.
The research was then freely interrupted by the mark of the German Weather.
In 1937, in the Fachpresse of Ing Rohozićski was the project of an electrical jagdrate, and in the next year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietomba lotnicza" of the Author Leliwa-Crzywoblocky.
Both projects are based on the military use of the Rakete Resident.
In short years before the war, all projects for military use of rakete technology were coordinated by the previous scientific advice Committee (Tymczasowy Commissioner Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was established in 1937, but after two years of work, its work was completed by the beginning of war.
Another articles on the space journey appeared after the war, thanks to the work of the Poolskie Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne) in the Polish press.
The first mention of this company has been carried out in 1954 in the publication of the magazine problem, in the four main articles of the space travel.
The article of Prof. Mr. Subtotowiz contains the proposal for the establishment of a local carrier society.
At the time, there were the first projects for satellite technology, and it was to find out that the research of the world's future would have.
In 1956, the PTA Political space carriage company was encouraged to join the 1951 International Federation for Room Travel Series, and in fact the PTA was already ordinary member in the Herbst of 1956.
In the next year the first PTA chairman, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), the representative of the International Federation Federation.
This office was in 1959 to his death.
Since 1956, the PTA participated in the development of the extremely successful meteorological rakete (Rakieta Meteorologicalzna), the first Political Rakett for Science Research.
The first type of RM-1 was completed in 1957, first started on 10 October 1958.
The rakee with a maximum air height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and didn't have more than 5 kg.
In 1959, a improved version built by RM-1A, and started in the B ה'dów wind tests with the second-known RM-2.
The rakete was 1,4 meters long and was about 11.5 kg.
Another development level should already be able to provide real scientific work - the Rakete RM-34 should reach a flight height of up to 14.5 km and to observe high winds.
However, in 1962, further development was introduced.
Following the first race of the type of RM was developed in 1962 to 1965.
The rakete was designed as a two-five wheel, its total length was 510 cm and the start weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types have been developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), different from each other in the size of the transport area for scientific instruments.
The meteor-1A-Racte has a transport space with 0.4 liters, meteor-1B over 0.34 Liters and meteor-1C over 0.62 liters.
The maximum highness of the airport was at all 37 km types.
In 1965 to 1968, the Meteor-2-Rakte was developed in the airway Institute, whose first flight tests started in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a start weight of 380 kg and was able to provide a 10 kg use load in a height of approximately 60 km.
The versions of Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 have been built.
In 1960, two years later the accession of Poland to the COSPAR (Commission for Space Research) is also followed by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland participated in the interkosmos programme also in the world's research with sowjetic satellites, and in 1978 the Political pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became after the Czech Vladimír Remek second intercosmonaut.
There is no solution to the suspension of the law on common work.
In the past week, the Constitution ordered the Law on Common Works.
This decision made a vital discussion in the public.
It is determined interesting to consider the problems of a wide perspective.
The liberal orientated economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of the unreguled economic competition.
Finally, this means that individual economies are in a permanent conflict.
For this reason, the principle of free trade and the free, unlimited movement of the private capital, which is in hand with unnecessary financial speculation.
Based on the major differences of the value of work (laughter) it comes to prices.
In this context, it is to understand the state where the producer is trying to exist by importing goods that are in the economic competition by calling on the competitiveness, in order to travel a greater market share and increase its profit.
In the large measure table, this means the majority of the enterprises to provide or sell their market in the foreign country, but to pay its business, and the result is a high unemployment in countries with comparable high employment costs.
Since the private capital has no social responsibility, and so there is no responsibility for the unemployment caused by him, the State expenditures needed to be increased.
This situation is still enhanced that the undertakings are absolutely voluntary to pay their taxes and therefore to replace all economic and social damages caused by them.
This situation is generally known that concrete statistics are overflowing in this place.
The unbelievable practice of the private capital is a situation in the individual economy in which the Governments are encouraged to enter into competition to decline the social level of their own population and to lodge foreign capital into the country.
In other words, the Governments provide their own population without a view to the social consequences of the private capital.
This is particularly explained in the changes of the laws.
The goal of these measures is to enhance the own population to accept the discate of the private capital, particularly in the loans.
This happens to a long-term unemployment, otherwise by circumcising the rights of workers.
The result is growing poverty, and always larger differences between arm and riches.
In Germany, for several years, public food allocations are available for arms that are not yet able to approach themselves through their own work.
The number of concerned is already in the millions.
In order to increase the competitiveness of the German economy, it is regularly to cases in which workers receive a very little loan that the State must retain their income to the minimum.
An such scandal was also discovered in the case of aid forces employed in the Federal Day.
Practicely, all EU SMEs will be unfortunately outstanding the same state where people are forced to immigrate their social level (such as it was in the 19th century), or to demonstrate a famine loan on the border of the society and to hope that any time private investment capital will be concluded in the country.
This is naturally the question where this capital comes?
If it comes from another EU country, the poverty of a country is only in other part; or the capital remains equal, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt or in most of all Africa, the employees of the European leather work for a wealth.
This concerns the whole Latin America.
Free theories and media say that the State is not allowed to participate in their own population economy, and that economic catastrophe planning.
The Private Capital is strongly concerned in its position that the State is not able to enter into the economy.
However, you must ask whether the capital is not the policy and that the whole State affects or impresses in its own egoist sense.
This is the clear answer: Yes.
The evidence of this is the existence of a practical powerful lobby in all States.
The result is a disappointed situation in the field of corruption, mutual provision, legislation, where everything is practical, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is so that a government ministry of private finances is subject to legal corporations that are closely affected by the industry with the preparation of law-related crimes.
These laws shall be adopted afternoon on the Federal Day.
Then all violence is not more from the people, as it proclaims the Western Constitutions, but from strong financial groups that provide their own interests.
Of course, the liberal democrats currently quickly described in a situation as Appian's work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Cäsars and Pompeius: "The State has been arrested for a long period of time, and the people were forced.
Various payments, by illegal detection of advantages or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew unemployed, and the people had already been bought to choose."... "Mans with characters were not warranted for people, so that the State had no consultation for this decrease for eight months" ..."Man has already started to speak about that the only medicine in this serious situation is a general government, and that a strong man must be chosen"... Appian thought at Pompeius, but then the strong man was finally Cäsar, who was the Democracy, who was the democracy in this serious situation.
As shown, the present society is based on the noise preference of its own advantage, without to assess social interests.
The private capital is already in a position to recognize and implement the benefits of the whole society.
The result, as today, is an inadequate decade of the elits, which are not at the lowest of reforms.
We must therefore seek the reason for the income of Fascism and Communism in the 19th and 20th century without liberalization of economic systems.
From the present state, the extension of these regimes in favour of liberal democrats may be considered as some of the suspension of the next round.
In particular, catastrophe is the fact that today Elits are the possible losses of hundreds of thousands of lives, human and social catastrophes, whose witnesses are now, and the crimes against humanity, as we know them from the elderly and new story, are in full ignorance.
The removal of the law on common work is not a solution, at least not a duration.
The pressure of the global and European economic competition will be encouraged by Tsjisha to continue to seek ways in order to press the social level of the population below.
This trend is therefore a system binding.
The only solution is targeted political-social reforms that increase the capital participation of the State in the economy, increase the impact of the citizens to the government and decrease the monopolicization of private capital in the society in favour of the State.
Israel: Chaos Labor.
"... that nothing happens from violence or can never understand" means Sting in the song of Fragile, whose most important verse in the refreshment, "...and we don't forget how we are dispersed."
"When my sons wouldn't want wars, don't give it," said the dead good snaper, marriage of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849
After the last wages of violence between Israel and Gaza, there were a number of reactions.
The ones are behind Israel and argue their right to self-defence, while they describe Palestinians as terrorists; others again support Palestinians, argument with the Racism of the Israeli State, the murder of the Palestinian Arabs and describe the State of Israel as terrorist.
I don't want to write to this place any of the victims of the murderer and who are victims, at last, today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-administration areas in the current political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence itself.
I am about to open the teacher's view behind the skills to look at what the 95 years of Spanning (released from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small flying country in the Middle East.
My thoughts are partly supporting accessible historical facts, others are deleted from this and are going out of my own understanding who or what group of people affects the events of modern story.
The history of mankind is first a story of the fight about power.
In each epoca, we can make a Alexander to the Great or Napoleon.
What is less obviously, is the question whether it was always these personalities itself, which were their self-determined steps, or whether someone stood after their throne, who puts their deeds to a predefinite goal.
We must find out that we live in a time in which the richness of the world focuses less individuals, and that this concentration of the money and the outcoming power has not been disappeared within the living margins of a generation.
Besides these astronomic rich families, it is a special example that could be described as a head of the rock (I don't know whether someone is over them, but I didn't leave it) - the roth shields.
Many are not written about her.
Surely.
The first press agency (Reuters) has been bought by the Rothschilds in the 1990s of the 19th century to underline their name with high-criminal works, in which it is always the foundation of their power, the improving their own or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks of the world, and against the countries in which they are not involved in the Central Banks, they lead wars to them (for the case of Afganistan were 7 countries after the case of Iraq, five countries have remained after the tour of Ghaddafis only four, where Russia undertake his central bank from the Russian government in the meantime).
Whoever has always tried to meet this family had to pay life for this.
Abraham Lincoln decided to renew the state of Rothschilds Bank of America as a central bank, starting during the citizen war, ownly (see: State) bank notes and was killed in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to exhibit its own bank notes and wanted the EDF - was killed in 1963; the Deputy Louis Mc Fadden was released in 1936 after he wanted to resolve the EDF for the resolution of the world economic crisis in 1929.
In the years 1859 - 1871, the global powers of the Rothschilds led to formulate a plan for the disappearance of three world wars by Albert Pik, a free mourning of the 33th and so the highest degrees of knowledge.
The first war had the aim to eliminate the great monocratic states of Europe, which should be broken by the second war, particularly the colonial government of the British, and the third war should reduce the global population by about 0.5 to 1 billion people (in such a number would provide for their analyze and luxury, and it would not even consume so many resources), a universal religion (the ecumenism is nothing more than the ground) and finally leads to the overcome of absolute power.
The method with which the group of the richest families work with the rothschilds on the scene is the solution of a crisis and the following offer of a solution (order from chao - order from the Chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to the decrease of the situation (see the creation of the EDF, so that the crises such as those who have been resolved in 1907).
After the murder at the Habsburger Thronfolger Ferdinand in Sarajevo was able to solve the first World War, they destroyed the Russian Zarene by the revolution of the Bolschewiches.
The first world war ended by the opposite, military and economic capitalisation of Germany (for the destruction of the Russian Zareland was not more necessary), then the solution of the Mediterranean European Middle Eastern Hungary resulted.
In order to simplify the Second World War, the bankers left a set of conflict situations through the policy by designing Germany with a huge war reparation; therefore, they undertaken the conditions of sharp mass, so that they had to undertake the German only a sufficient forced leader that called the laws and offered simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the Czech Republic State with a strong German minority, the function of a five-Financil Colonnency and also to simplify the war breeding.
In the end of the 19th century, Rothschilds initiated the creation of the ionistic movement, which focused on the creation of a Jewish State as a capital of Jerusalem (Rück return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration already mentioned was the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestinia; it was first cooking with the occupied Arab population.
Terrorist attacks were on both sides.
The Second World War occurred, and whether Hitler was now letting from the chalet, in which the international banks had kept him first, or whether it was just difficult to appreciate, in any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration campaigns was the conditions for the recognition of the Jewish State through the world.
Israel was founded in 1948, and as well as by the war repairs against Germany of the Second World War, the calling of the State of Israel provides the creation of the breastpoint for the Third World War.
If the international bankers are able to disappear this war, the Jewish people will be similar to the Second World War, in the former fight line, together with the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge labor, a source of war and Chaos, not only in the country itself, but also in international (and only thinking how the people shared in attachers and endangers of Israel).
Who is the lawful and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where the iniquity only solves in an endless speir of violence, and at the beginning of the giant individuals and their battle under global power?
It is necessary to distinguish here between the inhabitants of Israel and its leading, but the international bankers in Israel as well as us, the people, exclusively their own candidates.
The current first Minister of Israel, Falke Netanjahu, is a typical example of a fashistic accident that could extend international bankers who can make everything to simplify a war with Iran, which is in view of the membership of Iran in the Sanghaier Organization for Cooperation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), and that would be able to come to a global conflict through the control of Iran on the only 2 miles broad street of Hormus, over 20% of the world-wide educations, to a warning of the world economy.
In which light the words of David Rockefellers appear from 1994: "The only thing we need is a relaxing crisis, and the people will welcome the new world order."
The new world regulation is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of human population serves a small group of financial artists.
A world where every newborn is planned at the birth to submit this event of total control.
"And it makes the small and the great, the rich and the poor, the free and the servants, to give themselves a mark to their right hand or to their deaths, that no one can buy or sell, except he has the mark, the name of the animal, or the number of his name.
This is wisdom! He who has understanding overcomes the number of animals.
For it's a human number, and his number is six hundred sixty-six."
Film Argo: If it's the worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob demonstrator of islamist students was appointed in Teheran and took 52 diplomates as guests.
For their release, they called for the release of the corrupt shadow of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who was endorsed after the revolution in the United States, who had kept the patent over his regime over ten years.
For the American government, there was no positive movement from this situation - it could not be able to throw the shoe over the boat, since it would have disappeared the confidence of their partners in other countries.
At the same time, she was not in the way in Iran where the revolution had focused on the establishment of a theocratic regime to translate the liberalization of communities.
It was a serious slaughter for the call of the United States, and the Fiasko then made it worse.
Finally, after 444 days after negotiations were transmitted by the Algerian Government.
The cracksal of the brain called home a bottle of solidarity and anti-iranian shapes.
The debakel in Iran was significantly involved in the deterioration of Jimmy Carters against Ronald Reagan in 1980 with the presidency elections.
The film Argo of the Register and player Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which has made the United States a small part set.
Indirectly before the appointment of the message, six workers were flighted.
This ended after numerous complications in the residue of the Canadian Messenger.
The CIA has been in cooperation with the Canadian authorities to bring refugees from Iran, and thus helped them a extravagante story to the exchange of their real identity - they are being apart with Canadian pools as members of a film stage that would be visited in the country of Drehorte for a scientific-fiction filter.
Combination of Genres
The experts for "Exfiltration", Tony Mendez, developed plan also required the cooperation of Hollywoods.
In order to secure the tarnation, articles appeared on this film project in the newspapers, the press conferences were stopped, and the physical production society had a real office.
The details of this operation have been long secretly kept. The film stands on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Appleck movie is a special combination of several film geners.
On the one side, he is a realistic polythriller, at the same time also a dream. "Caper Movie", that is the story of an upgrading Husher element, such as the film of Ocean's Eve.
Thus, the levels of the film are changed - on the one side, the documentation scenes from Teheran (in the title of the Iconic Temporary Photographs are shown, and there are no great differences in the film description of the same situation).
On the other side, the locker passagies from Hollywood, which is therefore ironic and easily overwhelmed.
And then there are still the scenes from the center of CIA and other institutions - men in touching the table, on the office flower, on the phone...
Ben Spleck is a notable restart of his carrier.
From a flat player, he has become a respectable director, even as a player, he is no longer the objective of ironic notes.
Argo is his third game film after the crimi No children game (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the Thriller city without grace (2010).
At the same time, it's the Emplecks first movie that doesn't play in the diary boston of the Register.
The Scanner for Atmosphere of the place was part of the characteristics that extracted the previous films of this registerer from the standard Hollywoods.
However, Jesleck also demonstrates this guest in Argo where Teheran of Canada is " played".
The best scenes of the movie play in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have really occurred - the income sequence of the restructuring of the message is very imposing in their supervision, and yet admitting the feelings of the smoothness and the disagreement, which is invented if sometimes moves the story.
An similar effect provides a picleck with his team also in physical scenes (the false film table on a baser in Teheran).
Too many acts in too many places
The Register also had to consider that the story was not many of the film senses.
But he worked right with the Wenish, while he sometimes finds the reality - what does not always work like that elegant (the scenes where the dry crisis is off by a telephone in Teheran, or also the persecution year on the start road operates something missing).
The weakness of Argo is too widespread, which is involved by need to show too much action in many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood workers, but their figures had been made more space, and so they are not in the film at anything else.
Shick's movie lost something with the power. It's a movie that you can follow with some interest and then the creation and the trills of the 70s of the retro style.
However, he's just sick.
However, as a memory of a living part of history to this day and as a proof of how the ideas of the all powerful and aware secret service have been overcome, he is sufficient.
Directives for the removal of airballs, bananas and the circle
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which has announced annual survey on the absurd bank costs, has decided to produce the competition of the EU-Overeign Regulation or the idea of the EU.
"After this idea, the EU's unprofit plan brought us to introduce a 40% female rate in the management of large European firms," said Patrik Zuer, who is concerned about the organization of this survey, against the Právo newspaper.
For example, the sentence of the European Court of Justice on the Compatibility of the Safety for Gender and Women.
In addition, women in life insurance have a benefit because they have a lower risk for insurance companies.
"Further incredible incidents from the EU International may be named to the end of this year.
The real vote is then implemented until the end of February 2013," participated.
The EU-controversal Regulations shall be the associated combustion of bioethanol of powers that are in their consequence, the prohibition of the reliable cock-modalmeters only because they contained a relatively small amount of these dangerous substances, or also the Directive on the size of hot carriers because of the eggs have been significantly produced in this year.
Critical in the past also expired the fatal prohibition of the use of the word "Butter Overstrich" or the prohibition of sales for original lighting.
Banane must be 14 cm long
The EU Appa Council decides often under the pressure of this lobby from trade and industry, whose demands are represented in Brussels in regulation of one or more Member States (e.g. Tschechy currently seeks, for example, to translate the demands of the Czech banks).
Lobby's interfaces were also understood that bananas of the highest trade class in the EU should be at least 14 cm long and that they should not demonstrate "commerce analymy".
The European Commission defended the argument that they are only harmonizing the unilateral national standards that would dismiss trade.
The standards relating to fruit and fruit were already shown by the EU against the opposition of some countries, noting that the present directives would lead to the damage of food.
A candidate for the survey in this survey may be the EU Regulation of the past year to be reviewed by airballs in the sales of children under eight years, without supervision of adults.
The EU refers to a American study that is the leading cause for children's growth in accordance with airballs.
An similar restriction is already applicable for children to 14 years in the use of annual market steel.
Kuriose accidents also exist at home
Relativ is also a directive which relates to European officials itself - everyone who takes a official function in the EU may not use the title of Macedonia and must be held by the Federal Republic of Macedonia (Forme Yugoslavia of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com called in cooperation with the free economies Lassez Faire, which is the EU Regulation on the extension of food equipment in the area of a Member State.
The EU has thus established the maximum volume of food plants, which remained on the day of our EU access to the Czech Republic.
Tschechs then override the fixed volumes for pilch conserves, which drew us a high currency of money.
The organizations of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money in order to make them no sea, or that they should give the idea to help providers for applications on supporters.
These ideas are not free of Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are concerned that we have no sea.
We are invited to the EU restoration," said in the original of 2004, Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas, the Minister of Agriculture.
As a argument, he argued that the cereal producer was very high and that the State campaign had been overalled by the intervention purchases.
Since Tskchy has another way to seize, the EU should pay for us a hundred million euros.
The Czech Commission concluded that they had an indication on the sale of cereals from countries that did not have access to the sea.
As a result, the supporter for aid contracts to the Communities welcomed the Ministry of Regional Development under the leadership of Minister Pavel Nćmec (US-DEU), it should be concrete to the resources for the establishment of aid contract to Brussels.
EU: Western regulations are exceptive
However, regulations will be provided in Member States easily to the objective of the criteria, the EU’s efforts to regulate and to ensure the effectiveness and development of the European Union, in view of some experts more recognized.
A more serious problem is considered to these experts above the EU funders for projects, which are not in a position to enhance the European integration, which have resulted in the budgetary negotiations of each Member States.
Emotions also call for the fact that the Czech has to fight like other Member States in Brussels with a view to the right to use of specific names of traditional products and that fight is not always aware of this.
Czech could, after a six-year-old fight with Germany and Austria, defended the name "Olomoké tvar 周ky", the Inlands (Tuzemský r), whose tradition was returned to us until the 19th century, but our producers had to replace "Tuzemák".
The design Rum shall be used only for products from sugar-destillation, not for products of sugar.
In the official list of the products registered in the Union, visit the world-level chambers Feta and Gorgonzola, the Lübecker Marzipans or the parmaschinken also the Karlsbader Zwieback, the Carlsbader, the Carps of Pohoelice and T月ebo, or also the saazer hopfs.
With a EU margin, the pordubicer lives or the Hoicer roles can be made.
"The people want me to save the Republic, but I'm just a amateur," says Okamura.
Mr Senator, what is the idea to assist the President's office?
I am not about to be Senator or President.
If in our country it was to work all without problems, I would not have candidated anywhere.
But I can't see how the Republic is planned for 20 years, as the damage moves around, while people will increase taxes and pension analysis.
I had no ambitions to be politicians.
But if I see something I don't like, I'm trying to propose a solution to change this.
And since I'm already over 40 and I'm independent and partly, I don't have any other opportunity to affect the things than candidate for a Senator or President's office.
In the Senat, you made it and then you went on the way into the cast.
Do you don't know your elector's back?
I told me all the time that I'll take the fight on the burg after the result of the senate choices.
Afterwards, I have expressed this and said that I will be candidated for the Chairman's office, if I'm elected to the Senator.
My goal is not the function. The function is a tool that I can realise my visions.
I need a lot of influences and a most powerful mandate.
But the difficulty is not only that we fight as a people in the kitchen and before the televiser, but that we want to change something.
This is why the media who want to raise one the honour and change the freedom of the word to lie with freedom.
For example, I was confirmed that I would be a journalist or that I was a Consequent of Jihí Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
The fight for the burg has taken you with those of the material and criminal abuse of politicians and with a repressive complaint declaration over 20 million krons.
You need to change laws.
As President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate is able to adopt legislation proposals.
How do you want to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I used that the travel manager remains a free sphere, and that could be done.
The problem is the small policy - if someone from the right or from the left with a good proposal, it is obviously disappeared, and it only holds the population.
As an independent party, I have a greater potential to gain support for all parties represented in the Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take the best thing for our country without skills and partidogs of each party.
See you as a man in the policy on the right or left?
I feel that people see me close to the left.
For me this right-Link tank is but it is completely unrealisable.
For me, it's important we're going.
I don't think if someone hears to the left or to the right camp; I want to bind the people.
Instead, I support every good solution, even if this comes from the KSELLM or the ODS, and I will turn me against bad ideas.
It's missed you if someone calls you as a popular.
But do you not confirm what you just said?
If you have a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal target and a vision.
And this is what you want to get close.
It is possible to describe this as a popularist, but all the proposals I have spoken are working in the world or have been discussed by important experts.
But without support in the parliament you are only lockwords.
And so you don't get far away in the policy.
Or do you think it is you if you just speak enough enough to people, for example, to carry out the material and criminal defence?
I don't have any other opportunity.
Politicals, journalists and publics to convince and try to bring them on our side to carry these objectives.
As a President, there would be no problem for me to invite the Presidents of the Parliament's Party's parties to protect legally the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and lawyers.
And the fears should then say why they reject this.
A strong personality noticed to misconditions can be pressed on the political scene.
Take only the direct choice of the President who was a public pressure service.
I'm clear that I'm a amateur; I'm not a genius, nor an intellectual.
I'm trying to find a member of my views and visions.
I just started and tried to find the majority support for my program.
I'm always trying to judge the things myself, and if it doesn't happen, I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
It sounds a little as if Okamura Czech should save.
I'm not a retreat.
I know that I'm alone reaching nothing; therefore I've spoken with several known personalities whether they don't want to candidate for the Senate.
For example, I have spoken with Radim Jančura, who had not yet disappeared on job transfer.
Furthermore, I supported the research journalist Jana Lorencová who discovered the drug in the trade with easy heiz oil.
My candidature began with the condition that people are deeply unfriendly, but now I am not sure.
Instead, sixty percent of the electoral authorities have not gone to the elections, and those who have gone have chosen mostly representatives of the stability.
In the sense, we're only two independents.
People have chosen such sensitive settlement that changes will only be very difficult.
However, I will fight for my visions, for example, for the direct selection of citizens and chiefs.
Do you think about the creation of a party?
I have not thought about this because I have no time to check the past of every potential membership and even not have the money for it.
I have not even money for the President campaign; on my transparent account, only 20,000 CZK.
You don't have money?
You're talking about advertising statements, how do you see?
I appreciate approximately 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a foundation with a value of 25 million, a apartment for about 10 million, an additional for 8 million, a artist collection, which is valuated about 10 million, and a Aston Martin for 3,5 million and a 周code Superb, which is approximately a million. And then I have a few million in the account.
The Aston Martin was a childstraum - James Bond always pleased me as he went into the car, galant was to women and at the same time fighted the evil.
You're going to a Aston Martin, you have a $60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the Republic but you don't want to invest in it.
That's not exactly convinced.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I have to deal with something?
I've already got 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsors shown that my program is probably not too interested.
And I am not obliged to manage the campaign from their own resources.
The costs for the campaign will be covered by my content as a Senator.
But I could not live alone; for example, my son could not finance the English school that costs 30,000 per month.
If I'd just want to get money, I would be able to pay for nothing.
Do you therefore continue to work as an undertaking to have your exit?
Didn't you tell you that you're going to return these activities?
But that does not stand together with the height of the content.
As I promise, I was partly back to my activities.
For example, my poster will be the manager in the early year's business manager of the carrier.
People want to see me as a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I have to live of something.
In what months have you been used as undertakings?
It's about 200,000 to 400,000, and it's still like this.
However, as President, I would put my appeal completely.
The complete conversation will be found in the Saturday exhibition of Právo.
The MVRDV architectures demonstrate that the real adventures are not only in the head - for example of spezies and the recently created bookberg - 2 photos
"I find the building pleasantly, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passant on the street.
And Stefan Spermon, IT technicians in a nearly large business, says, "Yes, it's beautiful, the house."
But I'm asking why we need a book trip today.
All have Internet, iPad and e-books.
No man's still voluntary in one of these old Style libraries, or?
Specifications, a shortly needful sleeping town before the Toren Rotterdams, is a rekord term.
The 800,000 inhabitants community shows the lower education rate of all the Netherlands.
In order to combat this dumm circumstance, some years ago have been decided to contribute to general education and to build the seven physical blocks presented on the euros, as well as a finely intended steel-tonatures.
The success of the educational office was in borders.
And so the citymen recognized that there was only one opportunity to become the statistics: a library needed!
Winy Maas from Rotterdamer Architecturbüro MVRDV, Master of the wonderful balken diagrams and producers of cynic buildings, took the case with a living position and appeared to the competitive Hearing year 2003 with five books under arm and a grinsen on the face.
And while the jury was still disappointed at her eyes and covered the axes, the Greek Maas flowed his reading part of the size to a pyramid and waited for his attractive words with the words: "Leebe citygether!"
This is why he is my proposal for the bookbook of Spinzenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Neon years later, the 30 million euro mountains were mounted.
It is part of a revitalization project, which also belongs to the debtgarage, super market, post and a number of limited living and series houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the bookberg was described with the second "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project is named for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the spectacleless small tourist that had no longer to offer than an postmodern footplace and an uniformly housing house, after which white fassades would be refused to mount a molecry manufacturing in order to a part of timely architecture.
But above all, the spects now have the first public culture in the history of his substance.
The long way to book
The first impression: bookeldorod under cocktail.
However, there is a lift that leads through the mountain massive, but the true space and readers are followed at the slightest scene of the topografie.
The roadly green internal space is clear and obviously, the burned climb trees and the elegant roads speak unfortunately the language of a public city place.
The urban environment is perfect.
You are already viewing Parkbank, dog and football guys and girls playing.
And everywhere books, books, books.
"Otherwise, the books are standing around the fassade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is most unbelievable and unconscious," says Winy Maas.
We put the classic space configuration on the head and filled the read area of the internal outside.
Internal of the bookberg is used: in the middle of the offices, Internet library, shopping, environment and home technology centre.
A special joy are the black books regimes, which once clothes, even if wearing, even if they are swimming countries.
Optic, haptic and sweet are strange.
Even inflated architects and construction architects protect the head of the unknown material.
"We wanted to work here with recycling materials," Joop Trouborst says, project leader at the City Geography Spezies, on the question of the standard.
And so we have been thrown out in a foreign agricultural operation a day on an appropriate residual product from the agriculture.
Since many years, in the Netherlands, a millimetres of winters are used in greenhouses and fields.
It's sweet and dictated.
The tend textil holds, two seasons, then it's riff for the sperrmoll.
For the library, the Vlies - firstly printed in these amounts - to four centimeters of dish plates.
In effect and pressure, the so-called agricultural plates (KLP) is strengthened to a dark, homogene, chargeable material that brings to new cars and to a shot to sports.
After 105 steps, you've been taken on the gupfel.
At the end of almost 500 metres long changes in the literature chapter is not only paid with a fantastic view on the city but also with Holland Croquets and Fix trees.
They are guaranteed for atmosphere, especially for the right airlight in the literature cell.
Depending for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is, although the many glass surfaces are a pre-country project in French ecology," said Trouborst.
Goust and cut with earthquake.
Although the bookberg is under a glass tour, the sun seems only to be shortly inside.
The widely wooden limbs that are in the glass of the glass serve as a disappearance and a large part of the sun-investition.
The room climate is very accepted.
The remaining takes full rows.
Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptiker of the IT Branch, already moved the way into the new books.
Lisette Verhaig also was there.
And also the TCM learning learning Cynthia Bogarde, which is the Boekenberg as a spray of the "longly superfluous soul".
The reason: To open up a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to separate a book from his personal file.
This should first be filled with the optical lungs in which not completely covered library - at present 70,000 pieces -.
The concept is gone.
The rules are filled up to top.
"Nothing is worse than a half library," says Architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation now, every resident has a certain relationship to this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just on the scene.
This MVRDV is available to the King Diszipin that is called in Fachjargon Identity.
Spezies wrote literature stories.
So young and unformed it also likes to be.
This is finally a approach to identification.
Szabo: "The Dutch must play a greater role"
Germany has been voted on the adoption of Palestinia of the vote.
According to Stephen Szabo, experts for US-European relations, Berlin's balancies on a slight diplomatic degree.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany had first reported that it would vote against the request on a observer status of Palestinians at the United Nations.
But then he was disappeared by Berlin.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany is not supported what Israelis did in Gaza.
However, Germany has now to be careful because of his particular relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I think it is not supported by the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - but without critical against Israel.
During the resurrection in Libyen in March 2011, Germany also included the voice when it was going to establish a air condition zone.
This was finally carried out by the NATO.
May it be difficult to make Germany a clear position in important international issues?
Yeah, that's right.
It is that it is just set up its external policy, although it is a policy that has been managed by the United States to an external policy.
There is no coherent and unique policies that the Europeans do not have.
The Germans are therefore contrary to the flowers.
They are expected of them that they are playing an independent role, but they are not ordinary.
I think they still do their role, but they are on the way to an "normal" external policy.
Foreign policy, such as France or Britain.
What does a "normal" external policy mean as concrete from German views?
It shows the need to address positions in national interests, independent from which the United States or European Partners are.
I believe that the German external policy is motivated by economic policy, such as exports and relations with certain regions, Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are different to a certain degree other than the other largest, and therefore Germany has to protect its interests.
Have these economic interests affected the stop in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the United Nations?
For one, Germany has great member markets in the Middle East, especially in the Golf States.
This is why it must be careful to the public, but also to the Electers, not to shot the heads of the Arab countries.
It's playing a role in each case.
But I wouldn't want to add the weight too much, this is not a fully separate relationship.
But it plays a important role in German discussions.
Have Germany affected its relations with the U.S., containing important decisions of the vote, about the vote on Palestine?
I think in Europe and even in the United States is a great understanding for the German position.
That's why I don't think that this was such a dramatic breast as the libraisy question.
Germany may even play a certain respect.
Because it indicates, however, that it is seriously taken as international players and has to be considered its interests.
There are different views of the Palestinian initiative in Europe.
The U.S. has been clearly spoken for a veto.
Are there different views between the United States and many European nations?
Because of the American internal policy, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the government under Obama's home may have a lot of understanding for the European position.
But because of the political situation here, the government cannot present this public position.
I believe that the real differences of view are not as large as they always appear.
If you see the relationships between Obama and the Prime Minister Netanjahu, Obama is not so glad about Netanjahu's policy.
Can Germany make it difficult to agree with its close relationships with Israel and the United States on the one and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other side?
I think this makes it so difficult for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little more easier for the Germans if it would give a coherent and unique European policy, which is not now the case.
So they can't be part of a wide line and have to make things out of their own position.
They're doing this with the euro.
I think in the future it will take a leading role to Europe to a European position.
This is of course not easy for Germany, for the relationship with Israel.
This was always a significant subject.
But I think the German is clear that they need to play an independent role.
Germany seems to be the role of international players - do you want to take a main role in Germany?
Or does Germany still have the leading role?
Germany is not yet aligned. This is still unrealised, and, in apparent reasons, it is still hard to play a greater role in the country.
For example, if we look at the European crisis, it will be the most different feelings of anti-deut.
It's not easy to German.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be infringent countries.
So Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be sensitive for the most different neighbourings and opinions and it is not easy.
Now, the impact of the United States is continually involved in the European policy, but the EU is flowing this vacuum at the moment, but not who remains there any other?
The Germans will just need to play a greater role.
Even if it doesn't like them, it is unbelievable to them, and it makes it a lot unleavened - it's life!

"Making protection" in China: If Puma and Armani are soon Chinese
Armani is a world-known brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
What is Armani Polo?
There is an official name which has not to do anything with the origin companies.
However, it enjoys so long as the real names haven't pushed.
And then even it is not clear whether they get right.
"There will be more difficult for foreign countries to protect their brands in China", says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer in the Casseli Taylor Wessing, which is specialised for protection rights violations in Fernesot.
Every week there's a new case on my writing table.
The followers have already a few additional letters to allow them to sign their brands.
This is just a Lu-Gucci from Gucci, instead of Prada, you can take Prada-Kny.
German companies are also copyed legally, about the sports producers of puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with records of the Markenamt in Peking.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company had protected the product sign Zegna DF Puma, a artist name that was also served at the Modern House Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is known that the Chinese world managers are copying and in the last spiritual property.
In the large cities, there are more cheap houses that are sold almost exclusively vegetables.
But the cases of pattloch are different: at the order of his mandates, he is concerned that Chinese companies from the Markenamt receive the right to use a description which is already protected anywhere elsewhere.
The Chineses call the Bang Mingpai, a acquirermark.
The word focuses on "Bang Dakuan".
These are women who are rich men.
The Chinese authorities do not know any fault
"There is busy, you must fight it," calls Pattloch.
"The brand is deceased, the installation is struck, the image chain is very normal."
The financial waste and the process costs of the sector concerned are in the millions, especially in detrimental products.
According to the CLSA market research company, China has a volume of 15 billion euros in the year of the third largest market for luxury articles and the most fastest growth.
However, the delivery of dubial imports in the brand register are difficult to achieve and go to money.
By nine years, the procedure can be carried out, with unrealised outcome.
Pattloch reports of cases where the Court of Justice ends, because after the long time of the requested name to "Marktreality".
If the complaint has a pech, he should even pay the platform, because he's hired his brand in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes here is the law of the dungal.
Exalted cases relate also to graphical elements.
2009 Daimler lost a legal road with the construction machine Sany, the company who recently overlooked the German Beton pomplomester potzmeister.
Therefore, the Chineses can use an emblem that is similar to the Mercedes star.
The volunteer Geely originally used a blue-whe-wheat logo remembered by BMW; the battle was completed, Geely had to change it.
Modern Lacoste producers perished in China against postahmers from Hong Kong and Singapore, who looked on the famous chrokodil in the other direction.
The Chinese authorities do not know any fault.
The Markenamt CTMO in Peking shows that there is too little personal and room engagement in 2010.
In the past year, it was returned from the "Not situation in the work course".
So, if the file is not processed by 22 percent.
A number of 57,000 cases of such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than in the previous year.
However, in the office, 81,500 were still waiting for adoption.
Costs costs much
As often in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, more than 1,4 million applications on brand protection were introduced, almost a third than 2010.
This is a record and states that China is on the tenth time back to the list of new notifications around the world, the Authority shares.
This is also applicable for the file of all valid brands, over 5,5 million pieces.
2011 will be taken by 1,8 billion Yuan on fees.
Simplified means that each registration in the last 1280 Yan or 160 euro costs.
However, it costs a variety of performances, as the case of the German family company joynberg shows.
Since more than seven years, the concerts fight against a Chinese plagiator.
The Germans could have reached that the illegal manufacture of analyzer vehicles was equipped.
However, the followers continued the Chinese rights in the Marke Freudenberg.
You even have denied because family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, President of the business manager of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The Markenamt CTMO, as well as the invoice of the muscles.
In the next two instances the joynberg was right, but the processer fights further until today.
You have to look at the hell.
It is now dependent on the matter before the Supreme Court of Justice.
Wentzler is sure to bring the matter to a good end, and it appreciates the professionality of the courts.
But he also says, "This procedure is extremely upside and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs have not been limited, but the company archive has even needed to see a hundred years old acts to make evidence.
Five years ago, a "six-numeric euro" boat of the area has been advised.
"Then you see how much we are worth", says Wentzler.
The dangers in Fert East have even turned back to Europe.
And then, if there are unprotected brands there.
So a Chinese producer in Germany wanted to advise the called joynberg for shoes and leather.
This business area has longly provided the concerts, yet he could decline the registration.
"You've gotta look at the hell", says Venzler.
Although as well as the lawyer Pattloch encouraged German companies to be very careful in business with China.
It is not likely to leave international brand rights, but the foreign countries should "all what is protected, even in China", as says Dentzler.
Otherwise, it can become much worse than the registration.
Indeed, ifs joynberg is undertaken in the last act of his Markendramas, then you may have to pay the licensees for the own name, Wentzler.
Or we will be thrown out in the market segment.
World day: Stamps, singen, help
In Heidelberg the Chor Imbongi - and in Swaziland the waters are glad about it.
The story of a connection that exceeds more than 8733 kilometres.
First of all, there is the stamp: Cowboystief, basketball shoes, dames pomps and masters slippers on the parking boat, find him quickly.
One three-third.
Then the voices of the songs slowly argued - Alt, Bass, Tenor and Sopran, and followed themselves.
And Fite Hopf, the 29-year-old Dirigent, it's almost out of his substance when he's bringing them together with his craftly desired messengers.
It is Montaguendo, in the music space of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Chor Imbongi provides a new loed.
The cinquanty songs and songs came between 23 and 69 years, from the human-genetician to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each vote has another text and this also in a very strange language: Zulu, which is speaking by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Assistant assistance
There are around 34 million infected HIV in the world, which apprecies Oneid, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million people live in South Africa.
In Swaziland, 245000 waters live.
More than 40 percent of the population are positive, including HIV.
For 180 Aid waters in the village of Esitjani, the Verun Voices for Africa Paten in Germany found.
70 of them visit a further school.
For 15 or 20 euros in the month, you can take a patent.
It guarantees the child's school money, school form and a warm meal time daily in the Gogo Center.
Imbongi means to Zulu story number or also lobprezer.
The banking language is finally unable to speak in this room, but sing.
Since about ten years, the Chor's songs in this strange language produces and brings them back and returns to where they come originally: in South Africa.
For 8 733 kilometers airline from Heidelberg, north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village Esitäi, which depends on the German head of the German Chores.
Forty percent are infected
Any 2000 people live there, some still in simple leather and strohweats, a large part of them are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents, because they are created to the HI virus.
The Swaziland is shown in the small, where total Swaziland is: higher HIV infection rates, lower life expectation worldwide according to Unicef.
Circumcisions of men who have apparently reduced the rise risk of half are not accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland leads to the immun shopping virus in itself, to die average thirty times, there is no saltness.
In a common African journey in spring 2005, the Chor discovered the village, but especially the immunists saw many children on the streets that were not only in an old care, but also in particular: food, clothing, education.
Without school censure, you have no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was the private engagement individuals to send a child to school for a few euros in the year and allow him a warm meal time on the day.
But a year later, the Chor founded the "Voices for Africa", which is almost professional about the Aids Wishes in Esitjani.
Facts to sexual translated infection
What are the most important sex-translated diseases?
The bacterial STI numbers syphilis, clamides and trippers (Gonorrhee).
Often viral STI are HIV, human pallomavires, herpes genitalis or hepatitis.
The parasitary STI is the filament and the skins.
Who are the main groups concerned?
Syphilis and tripper are particularly present in men who have sex with men.
The Robert-Koch Institute provides that at least four of the five of all syphilis fials reported in Germany will be translated by sexual contacts between men.
In adults, theerosexual adults are clamide infections, trichomonadens, candidas (Pilz), Tripper and Human Pappilomavires often translated sexual diseases.
The distribution of HIV is lowly compared among theerosexual adults in this country, however: around 20 percent of the HIV new infections are on this group.
Youth infections are more often more often than in other population groups.
Following European explanations, three quarters of all young people infections between 15 and 25 years.
Human pallomavires are often presented in youths.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually translated diseases are compulsory.
The number of syphilis infections has been more than doubled in 2001 to 3698 diseases in 2011.
The number of HIV new infections has returned since 2007.
2011 there were about 2700 cases.
This is a decade less than in the year before.
What symptoms show on sex disease?
Infection diseases may produce procurements in the genetic area, injury in urination, influences, sub-based sorrows, bottles or goods.
However, often, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and remain unremarked therefore.
How can you protect?
Condomes can reduce the risk of ensuring, but no hundred percentage protection.
For partly, heirs of sexually translated diseases can also be added through school infections and low corporate contacts.
In particular, the experts recommended that regular investigations in frequent changed sex partners are regularly changed.
Morning diagnosed early, most STI can be avoided and later.
Through patents, Sponsors and not last, the guests that the choir is in all Germany come together together.
"We have already sent about 200 000 euros to Esitjani," says Annette Lennartz, the President of the Union.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini is managed, a self-conscious and translated woman, the moneymen in Germany.
She also is concerned that the forests are good, at one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as you call the old women on Zulu, are the supports of the village.
Some of them have taken up to 14 waves, give them a dance on their head and ensure that children in their uniforms appear at the same time to school.
Whoever has no more comes in the protection house in Khanysil, a single woman who is paid exactly from the agreement, as the two cows every day for more than 200 hungry children.
Furthermore, "Voices for Africa" has called a school in life, built two guest houses, and jointly with the American health organization PSI organized that many in the village have made a HIV tea.
This is not self-detection, because it is obvious that the disease in the whole country is also the most lovely damages.
A King with 14 Women
"Aids is an absolute table," says Annette Lennartz, "for it has to do sexy."
In fact, strangely in a country where the king is officially 14 marriage.
The latest absolute Snow-Afrika, King Mswati III., is known for his extreme lifestyle.
Poligamy instead of democracy.
In addition, this Stately sanctified life form has also been debt that the HIV virus has spread so fast in the past decades.
But also the many changing workers who carry the virus through the country.
Without free condome, it was at every egg, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are not used.
Culturality is another - flesh to flesh."
To promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi-Chor has all two, three years together through South Africa and cans songs full weapon, warmist, supervising and black self-consciousness, many in the south of the black continent even from times of apartity.
A bus full white, which sing songs in a black language - so much recognition brings not only a shadow and joy, but has also discovered some Green Greensoldents.
The trip always leads to Esitjani, where the sonners visit their patients.
Even if you're not found the small village on land cards, it's more known in the valley of Ezulweni Fluss.
"Come to Eitjeni, there's the light" people say there.
And when you return the 8733 kilometres of the airline to Heidelberg, to the stamped scanners in the sample area on the mountain home road, then it is lighted.
Sender: NASA discovered rain on the Mercury
The Sonde Messenger found evidence that it is on the Merkur Eis Planet.
The ice discovery may be covered up to 20 meters.
NASA has shown the existence of iron on the planet Merkur.
Although he stands on the sun next, there are also water that was driving, such as triumphs published in the Fachmagazin "Science".
The sond Messenger found evidence that there is a iron cover in the permanent region in the shadow of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and may be even 20 meters dick.
The water was probably from comites or may also asteroids that were affected on the mercury.
Nobody brings the iron fund but with the existence of life on the planet, the head scientist of the Messenger-sodes, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on the mercur can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, funds could help clarify how water and other building stones of life have been made in other areas of the sun system.
Without note of the earthquakes, the songs, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix are to investigate the levels of the world.

All after color-decoration will be taken by spiralgalaxes to true arts.
The opinion published by the South-East European shows the numbers of thousands of light years disappeared trifid nevels in the star picture Schuhe.
The name Trifid consists of the Latin word trifidus (dry parts, treasured paints), since the slight heart of the stars is divided into three parts.
In the star picture, astronoms have photographed the provisions of a cosmic karbobulation: 400 million light years away from the earth, the knees of two disappointed galaxies and will be uncertainly collected with each other.

Our views in all: The most important telescopes
The telescope will be found 1608 by Hans Lipperhey - yet before Galilee was set up a year later to the star observation.
Since the pillars of the optical telescopes were always greater - and the views that they deliver are always deep.
30 years old, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale-Telescope in the Palomar Observership was near San Diego the world's biggest Ferrour.
The speed, here in the image, had a average of five meters.
In Arizona, the Large Binocular Telescope is located.
It can look in all the same as two slides, each with a diameter of 8,4 meters.
The internal life of the Grand Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Island La Palma is large - only 10,4 meters in the diameter.
The southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to spare costs.
However, he reached a diameter of about 11 meters.
Indeed, the telescope is fixed in its height line - and thus restricted in its movement.
The Hobby-Eberly Telescope in Texas is also fixed in the high-winkel.
His speciality: the high lightness.
In fact, this is - although, although it is less than speed-profits - to the world's largest speedlescopes.

By 2007, the two Keck Telescopes grew on the Hawaiian Vulkan Mauna Kea as the most world's world.
They offer equal two shots with each average of ten meters.
The Keck-Telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea-Observatory, which is next to them with the Subaru Telescope and IRTTF in the sky.
Also on the Mauna Kea, a new, huge telescope should be drawn - with a middle of thirty meters.
It's on an illustration.
However, the most important end pressure from all provides the world's space-level Hubble Hubble.
Since April 24, 1990, it offers pictures of far-related worlds.
Since March 2009, the World Telescope Kepler is looking for extrasolar planetes - mainly for those inhabitable.
On 2 February 2011, Nasa was announced that 1235 planning candies were identified since the mission initial.
The last starting preparations are documented in the World Telescope Kepler.

One of the tasks of the Teleskop: It's to look after the light of the first stars and the galassies after the urknall.
Scientists say that there is also the Southpol of Merkur Eis.
However, there is no reliable data because the Messenger is far closer to the northpol around the planet.
Radar measurements have noted that it is on the Merkur Eis for decades.
By the 2004, Messenger-sodes - the first creating for the Merkur - the scientists now have awareness.
Today butter drink - and 168 years
In the southern Azerbaijan, many people have reached a high Bible age.
There is even a museum for long life.
A spring search in the country where 97-year-olds are still compared to youth.
In the southern Azerbaijan, many people have reached a high Bible age.
There is even a museum for long life.
A spring search in the country where 97-year-olds are still compared to youth.
The journey through the Talish cell is called wildmantic.
The small bus runs through the roads of the road, with closely overwhelmed hills, rivers and easy farm houses.
Everything is green and green, you might think you can stand in the blackwald.
But here is the highest south of Aserbaidschan, the border to Iran is just a few kilometres away.
Here, the Kaukasian people group of the Talibans, which is not much known, except she speaks perfectly Persian and Asian and is very long.
End station is Lerik.
The small village is with too powerful architectur from sovereign times that do not want to apply to the Malay Mountain countryside.
Tourists from Europe are low to come here, to appreciate the arrival of the Aserbaidschan City of Baku.
For the 323 kilometres, you need eight hours because the road is only clean.
The famous richest that thanks the country to his oil in the Kaspische Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fassayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has the teg to tourist attraction.
"Baku was appointed in May with the Eurovision-Song festival - and in the next year we have a festival of the elderly people in the world", says Fassayeva.
She is the director of the museum for long experience, probably the only one on the world.
This is the vita of about eight half talyken from the area, which is older than 100. Fassayeva shows on a black-Weiß photo.
This is my grandmother, he was 120 years old.
A age of 136 is still born a child
However, the surrounding star of the museum is the Shelter Serali Mussolmov, who has to be aged 168.
However, there is no birth survey.
And in view of the oldest documented person who has been 122 years old, Muslimov's age appears very unfortunately.
"He was born here in the region, he died in 1973," said Fatulayeva.
The husband had been married three times and had 23 children, and in the age of 136, he must have born a daughter.
So, Sarai Mussolmov has disappeared at his age for a few decades?
But also Rembrandt School, old researcher at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, has been listed by the high-speakers in Mediterranean.
"There is also in some areas of China, Japan or Hunza Thal in Pakistan," says School, "and in Sardinia, there are extremely many of the old men."
However, there is no scientific indication on the age, especially in the case of personal status registers.
Every day, obviously smooth butter
However, the fact is that people in the region are often reaching a Bible age.
There are now 20 persons old than 100 years.
So why are many guests here in the south?
The aeric travel director Farid Mugimzadeh explains that with the particular gentlemen of the Talibans.
Museum Directorin Fassayeva dagegen believes it lies to the food.
However, that an expensive calorious cow of the Taliban must be so healthy, the flesh, bread and mostly milk products, and of which many of them daily drink a glass sweet grass, appears from food science not exactly plausible.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps the young people? In Cumaniran, a mixed village outside the city of learning, Rubaba Mizayeva lives.
With their 97 years, she is still young for these widths.
Mirzayeva, which claims to have 143 followers, lives in a simple wood house that is typically for the whole coukasus region.
She sits on the ground with a butterfass that she's immoral and rolled.
Eight people live here under a dance, including one of the sons of Mirzayevas and a daughter, both are the longest herds.
Two little kids go around.
In the kitchen you will prepare the guests of the tea that serves in the typical, fowling arms.
Mirzayevas white deeps stand perfect in Riih and Leed, under their heads, it prevents the long, dark blue creatures that their son shames us.
I've always shot my hair with milk, so they never went out of me and drew their colour.
"Shampoo I never used", says Mirzayeva.
Monthly retribution is enough to live
She's always eating what she did from her own court, Tomaten, Cartoffs, herds.
My whole life I didn't buy the only time in the supermarkt food.
Then she told her husband who was in the army.
It was the worst time after the Second World War.
But everything was better than the "leavened father" Heydar Aliyev over the ruder.
The propaganda sounds strangely from the mouth of an old woman.
However, the colt, which is directed to the image of the nation, which ruled his country as a Dictator, is not known by borders in Aserbaidschan.
To 2003 he was in power, and later he took the ruder of his son Ilham.
There is always no need under Aserbaidschans.
230 Manat (and about the same amount in euro), Mirzayeva is a monthly rate, for the present circumstances, a amount from which you can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayevas also has a long-term son right: "The elders enjoy high respect in our culture."
They live inside the great family, are loved, careful and happy.
If this is no reason to stay as long as possible
The word "Menary Right" lacks in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Kairo.
Revaluating customers in Kairo show the deep range of the country.
The future constitution with the sharia as a base is strongly contrary.
The Egyptian President did not spare with Pathos.
We need to create the transition.
"And that he's available is in my responsibility, before the people and before God," he said in the countryside.
His speech was sent to the whole people, especially to the Christian captains, the Liberals, who explained Muslims and Sakulars.
Because they all, until now, are disappeared in a convincing opposition, are afraid.
Be afraid of a divine state in the river of grace of the powerful muscle breeding.
He said, so Mohammed Mursi is almost excused to circumcise the competences of the Constitutional Governance and extended its competences to "to save the revolution".
However, what the 61-year-old engineer who leads a doctor's title of the Southern Californian University will really want to save, is the Egyptians, the world is not completely clear.
Should the Judicial be discovered?
In fact, the 234 articles which have been observed by the Islamistic Members 100 constitutional constitutes, since, in a 15-year-old parforce regime, are partly concerned.
As in previous constitutions, it also means in the draft, the legal interpretation based on the "Islamic Rights".
But what's the name of the Principles?
It was and is a statement, and it was to be afraid that the Islamists will be used to use the shame formulation and the legal framework for a closer explanation of the skills.
At least, a new added article is close: all the matters concerned must be covered by the University of Al-Ashar, the most important islamic institution of the country with a great power in all the Sunatic islamic island.
It must not be, but it can mean that the spiritality takes into account the legislation, what actually has been the proclaimation of the Judicial.
Many of the experts are designed
The problem is also: the civil military guiding needs to continue to be resolved.
Those courts served during the Mubarak Government to subprise oppositional.
After the tour of the Dictator, 11,000 civilians were settled in military.
The State also must, so it is in the draft that "the real conditions of the Egyptian family" protect "and promote their moral and values".
This is legally formulated by unscarf that State institutions could also control the contents of movie art and literature.
In the clear text, it means nothing else than censurus.
None of the other articles is expressly determined by the equality of men and women.
For this reason, another forbids to polite or denial the prophet Mohammed and his Messengers.
But whatever it is, and how it must be recognized, it remains unlawful.
Dubios also encourages the formulation which has been prohibited "detection of men".
Is there a caricature of the President or a Witness at the costs of a lawyer?
Explanation, as many in the draft, which provides Mursi to the Subscription and will be represented to the Egyptians as soon as to the People's vote.
"The Revolution has returned"
The opposition has been formed for weeks against the overwhelming of the islamists.
10 thousand gathered together in unlimited place at the Free Tahrir Chamber in Kairo and promised to bring the Charta to case, or not before it could enter into force.
"The revolution is returned and we're gonna be blessed," said Hamdin Sabbahi, the third-party of the presidency elections.
Peace-noble Price manager and ex-chaef of the International Atomic Energy Autority Mohamed El-Baradei explained that the Constitution Procurement was "to the Mullberg of History".
By short news Service Twitter, he wanted the attachers to Mursis to lead a "Putsch against Democracy".
"When he calls the referendum, we'll go to his palace and move him," said the Opposal Jasser.
"We are not yet courageous that the blood of our brothers is not yet drunk," the Egyptian media held the opposition policy Caled Ali.
And several judges announced that the referendum would not want to watch what would be wrong.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized muscle brudership was on the side of it, but not on the Tahrir Palace, but after a massive gap on the other nitrogen before the Caire University.
Many women and those who were disappointed took part of it and cried: "This people calls for the application of God's law."
They asked of Mursi, "Aspring the country!" and they said, "The Koran is our constitution."
A fight for the Holy One to the symbolized Tahrir plate, on which all his beginning, would likely be awakened by a war likely situation.
This was evidently not to risk the Mursi attachers.
The muscles explained that both the worms of the Constitutional Procurement and the Defenders would have sound and clearly explained.
Now, be the time to make the people to decide in the electoral horns where the country goes.
A majority of the Islamist project shall apply as safe.
"The word of human rights does not even come before"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which would actually go to February and join all social forces.
The 48-year-old manager and President of the Egyptian Organization on Human Rights (EOHR) defended the muscles when they sat in the prison or before the court.
Not because he would share their world views, but because human rights are inadequate for him.
For this he was verified, condemned, arrested.
"And now the word of human rights is not even in the new Constitution," he stated in conversation with the "Women on Sunday".
Mursi power extension on all three forces in the State allowed the lawyer to resign.
These measures are enormous disappearances against democratic game rules and will lead Egypt to a new direction.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the Chairman sets it out of fact," said Saeda.
However, without civil society organizations, democracy can not work.
Saeda feels alone allowed, even from the international community, which considers the ideological direction camp on the Nilo, with a mixture of renutrition and disappearance.
It could be wearing.
A demonist warns on the tahrier: "You have a monster that you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the world's most bad fish?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of life, not only in Europe, but in the whole world.
The secret of the country could have something to do with the local appetit on quite abusive fish?
You take a selection of overcoming chambers.
You'll put them in the middle of a bathroom, smoother sports clothes.
And she took a week there.
So nearly, you must imagine the sweet sweet of rakfisk, one of the great delicates of Norway.
I found me in the small city of Fagernes, about three hours away from Oslo.
There are snow, spectcular landscapes here - and this hard oil in the air that simply don't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is earned with salt, which, depending on how you would like to stink your fish - until a year is fermented in water.
When in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather is cold, the norways are flowing to a festival here in Fagernes, which is now really very amazing speciality.
"It's red and then it goes down with a glass Aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually worked in the local firewave, but as the so-called "Rakfisk-General" also produces the Festival.
To forgive us about small fishermen and to take great amounts of alcohol to themselves.
"Man people like the Aquavit more than the rakfisk," says Havard.
The spiritose can disappear the song.
I'm costing some tastes.
If you refuse to bring the rakfisk close to Nasen, it is not bad - like Sushi, who has a right long bus back.
Rakfisk is the product of a whole other, weitaus farming northern epown when there was no coal opportunities and fish was baptized in the winter of salt water.
In the deepest winter, he was then equipped after long production and - unfortunately disappeared seats with alcohol.
Again, before a generation, thousands of Norwegians looked at the search for work sought to leave their country and were mainly wandered to the United States.
Today the population grows fast - more than 13% are immigrants, angelized by a floring labour market, high loans and an overall health.
Even from Sweden, the old rivale, who was not even far more rich than Norway, smooth immigrants.
Rakfisk is seen as something important - as an essential, even a closer part of the Norway story.
He's part of the leading courts you can buy here.
But in fact, it's all easy here - a small glass bier or a sandwich costs bright 10 euros.
Norway, it is not often in the world pressure, and most people don't seem to be disappointed.
This is still a hate to call other Brevic in the name - those racistic legal exhibitors who have slaughtered 77 males, women and children last year.
Instead, you're only referring to the "Corrence of 22 July".
Norways are hard to accept that someone in their peacekeeping country is so brutal murders.
Since the previous 1970s, the growth of one of the largest oil and gas industrys of the world has been responsible for the modern richest of Norway.
"But oil is not the only reason why it's good to us", says Anna, our kellnerin, shared round tablets with a clear rakfisk and constitutes the northern ideal with their long hair and the blue eyes.
We're one - as you say, an emotional people.
Your English is exactly as most people are doing here.
We're not very becoming, we don't like praise.
Norway has been very careful with its oil riches - a large part of the sector's contributions is invested in a particular fund for future generations.
As in the years to the world economic crisis, all about money that they do not have, Norway decided his money-based officers.
"So long we can go to the winter Ski and walk in the summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"And of course rakfisk eat," adds it with unbearable laughs.
I'm standing in the snow and putting me for another court-- from Rakfisk I have enough.
So a Elch-Burger is in any case another thing.
But at the evening, the skill's back on the food plan.
The hotel in which I logge is one of several events that organize a rakfisk service at the guests of the best - or maybe the sweet synthesis is the most strongest fish.
There is a Live-TV maintenance to a showmaster with flower, which is edited by Tellers with rakfisk.
The spectrum is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What point you have there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor Jericho?"
"There are our points, Havard."
You're crying and laughing.
A man escapes from his throne, possibly overlooked by the Aquavit.
But maybe it's the stretchest dust of the whole fish.
Mexikos Enrique Pena Nieto is before difficult start
During the future President Enrique Pena Neo prepared on his office, Will Grant of the BBC analysed the challenges that he had made and the missed feelings of his people.
Currently, the transport in Mexico is very bad.
Even in better days, this is a steady city, but on Monday, a rock of road was created, which is closed a number of important transport courses in the capital city and guarantees on the roads for Chaos.
However, the goal was not to stimulate pendingers on the way to work, but to encourage demonstrators to reach the Parliament.
On Saturday, the new President Enrique Pena Nieto will receive the President's license and take the leading of the national.
It's before a complex task.
Under the different government Felipe Calderons, Mexico has been economicly assessed, but the country is in the grief of drug war, which has already been 60,000 lives in the past six years.
"My Government is strong to reduce violence," said Pena Nono at the beginning of this week in the Oval Office of the US President Barack Obama.
I will propose a new security strategy that we can achieve this goal.
Before he went with the US Presidency, Pena Nieto was active as the Governor of his home State Mexico.
In this nearly, widely widely part of the country in the capital, the views are divided on the new State-sociation.
A direct man
For example, in the distant small city Valle del Bravo, it is pleased to remember him.
The inhabitants of the vacancy write to him the development of the tourism and the construction of the infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can go on one of the carways that allowed Pena Nieto to build and make a great improvement in respect of the brown, holprese roads that have been here once.
Plaques with his name also apply outside a modern center of sports and an impressive interactive museum to climate change.
"We're waiting for real and sustainable changes," his friend and political partner Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who is a Congresser for the Party Pena Nietos, the PRI.
In particular, what the security and economy is reflected, we hope to a interesting and true change that our country is so urgently needed.
After 81 years of power, the PRI was solved by Vicente Fox in 2000.
The Congress Deputy Olivera states that the Party, after 12 years, provides great expectations to Enrique Pena Nono outside the presidency of Los Pinos.
The predecessors of the Opposition, the new President, are not subject to the substantive.
He is a very direct man, very engaged and has great plans for the country.
He is an excellent Stateman, especially he is also a person who can listen to.
But on the other side of the State, many people do not share this view on their former governance.
In Nezahualcoyotl, even known as the city of Neza, the contrast could not be greater to the planted roads of Valle del Bravo.
The place is hidden by car transfers and puts a pretty town of Mexico itself.
And the problems in the community are of crucial urban nature.
At the beginning of this year, the military was enabled to fight the drugs covered in the quarters, and violence against women is a particularly awesome problem.
On a flower Brachland near a great depony was left only in the past two years, the bodys of the decades of murdered women were left.
During the official time of Governor Pena Nieto, more than 1,000 women were killed in the Mexique State - a statistics that itself overcome the city of Juarez, which is recognized for their violence and murder against innocent women.
The criticians Pena Nietos believe that it has not occurred at least the problem of women murder during his official time.
However, in the worst case, his government has concluded their eyes before the problem.
In a beton construction, typically for the coming quarter, Irinea Buendia fights with the dreams when she shows me photos of her dead daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana 2010 seemed to be a suicide.
However, their family believes that she was killed by her life.
"When I came home to her, it seemed to be kidding her body," Senora Buendia remembers.
There were signs that she was killed, and the body screen had already been used.
While her mother tells her story, she looks at the wall a picture of Mariana down on us. It is brought near a cross that brings one word: righteousness.
But exactly these, the family, have been surprised by her until now.
The authorities have treated me as if I'm an injury, unruistic, nervous.
They want to accept their judgment simply and keep your mouth.
"But this is not possible when it has given so many forms and disappearances," she said.
On Saturday, President Pena Neo recommends the Presidency, he also takes a great responsibility.
10 thousand mexican families were involved in the past six years of violence crimes, and the new President has promised to take care of seats during his official time.
"I hope he was as President," said the PRI Congress Advocate Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But the families of the victims are most afraid in the city of Neza.
The State Administration claims: Bradley Manning has not considered a misunderstanding
The State Administration against Bradley Manings Prejudices that it has been mistained in prison
The hearing is concerned with maning time in the military area of Quantico, Virginia
The defence is contrary to the defence of the complaint because of severe hate conditions.
The release of the US is proposed to have been using thousands of confidence documents
The State Administration has tried to determine that the army free Bradley Manning - appealed to the greatest confidence information of the US-American history - a few opportunities for advertising the missing of him in military warmly.
In a crowd audition manings during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meded, Maryland explained Maj. Ashden Fein that documents were required to be visited by prison officers during maning's ninemonatier Haft Time in Quantico, Virginia had not made any complaints on his treatment.
One day before the Kreuz Authority, who was arrested by a request of defence for the defence of the defence - maning has already been crashed by the hard-time-- maning outlined, he would have requested the Suizid in prison.
The secret service analyst of the US army arrested in June 2010 will be proposed to load thousands of reliable documents during his service time in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks never confirmed maning as a source of information.
In the hearing on Friday, Fein had completed the forms that the officers after their meetings were met with maning during his debt in the Quantico military army, where he had been enhanced by July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers made questions of management and wrote his answers.
When Fein asked him to the forms on Friday, managed that he had assessed the treatment by his arms as "excellent" and the treatment by the Institution as a "sehr professional".
The forms, so fein, did not include complaints on miscontract, although the officials had asked his treatment directly.
Maning answered, he had to express his concerns and the officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they were not logged.
"She wrote (only speaking of thoughts) "No problems" and that was not necessarily meaning that I didn't say anything anymore," so maning.
The judge, Prince Denise Lind, also asked maning why he did not assess himself on his treatment when he met with a committee who had to investigate sustainable issues mentioned by him in January 2011 before months.
Maning answered his intention during this meeting has been able to bring his observation status to the “prevention of violations”.
The military said that this restrictive status, which is a level of self-assassination, has been granted to him and to protect others.
"I wanted to convince employees that it was good to me and reject the observer status for prevention of violations (...) to reach a higher quality of life," said Maning.
Maning said on Thursday to his arrest and arrest to Kuwait, where he was arrested about two months before he was sent in the Marine Basis Quantico prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he killed the self- murder and was once aware because of the Hitze.
Unable to know what was happening to him or to the outside world had been charged.
"My world broke on Camp Arafjon, together on this chain," said Manning on Thursday.
I thought I would die in this army.
When he was forgotten to Quantico, Maning had the majority of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without society.
It's just allowed him a matratze, a deck, flip flowers, clothing and brick.
Maning said he tried to stay in movement, because it was prohibited to sleep or even to sleep.
He got to sleep with a light that ended out of the outside in his cell.
If he was drowned by night and couldn't see his face anymore, it was opened to turn back.
In January 2011, manings lawyer made formal impairment against the treatment of manings.
In April 2011, Maning was sent to Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, the judge maning also asked for an accused that he had raised in his statement on Thursday - so he had sleeped a night in his cell in Quantico and had to be seen in a morning selection before washing and other prisoners.
Maning had said that he never had the opportunity to fill up with his cover.
At the interrogation on Friday, maning, he concluded from a command of his guard that he could have put the cover with which he had to be covered, but he said that no one had asked him.
On Thursday, maning said he was encouraged to sleep in the previous night, and he had been trying to show a officer that he had no danger for himself.
Maning said to the officer he could use the bound of his sub-hose or his flip flowers to destroy himself, but it did not.
In this night, so maning came out, being his sub-hose, flip-flopps and brilles will be removed from his cell.
His complaints hope the judges to take into account at least and to reduce drastically his debt measure, he must be condemned in his negotiation before the military order.
The defence indicated that management would be acknowledged in the fault while other complaints which are considered as extremely to be considered.
The continuation of the hearing is established for this weekend. It is expected to justify the terms of complaints.
The pentagon remains at its position that manage has been kept in accordance with the provisions applicable to all of the highest security conditions in Quantico.
The complaints against Maning are the benefits of the enemy, the unfair publication of secret information on the Internet, the transfer of national defence information and the public property or documents.
If he is found in all points of accusation for the fault, he has a long-term trap to him.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people will be encouraged because of the lack of opportunities to leave Mexico
Mexicans are trying to accuse the foreigners - they call them serious times in remembrance, he says.
Navarrette is the view that the Mexican Americans have been arrested between two worlds
On a recent journey to Mexico, I was just overcoming the hall and came to the passover check when the board was widely made in me.
Schilders revealed on two warnings: One for "Mexicanos" ("Mexican"), one for "Extranjeros" ("Austrangues").
I stood there for a few seconds, uncertainly to whom I should appoint.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexican" all my life.
A ethnic core - just as my friends are called "Iren" or my friends in New York "Italy".
Afterward, I decided to be for the Mexican-Amerika.
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandmother's house there was no need for curves or bindestries.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to say in this language at two ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a mother language, and I will not leave my American accent.
So I took my American journey and put me into the lock for Extranjeros.
I thought about that moment in this week when the future mexican President Enrique Pena Nono visited the white house to meet President Obama.
The agenda stands on all the topics that are expected when the captures of these two countries were met: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nono was also very interested to speak about the growth of the Mexico economy. It is a reason for the Mexicanians today, with the same likely likely to remain in Mexico, instead of expanding in the United States.
He wants to translate itself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade block on the form of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue the Mexixic war against the drug cards, even if he had no details on this regard.
Mexico’s relationship with the United States is comprehensive and fully resurrection.
Most of the Americans have probably never lost one idea that the United States enter into Mexico in 1848 and that the leading of the country would have to allow them more than half of their territory.
But for the Mexicans who think in the centuries and not in minutes, memories of this event are not to see.
As soon as a US government officer is only the laughest critics of Mexico, they are hearing - at the Mexican press and among the Elites of the country - replying how the Americans defend the sovereignty of their neighbouring country.
And the children of Montezumas are on the battle.
And yet, the greatest challenge of Mexico in truth is in relation to the more than 35 million mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Did you like to talk about resentations?
There's more than enough.
Mexiko has winners and losses. People for which the country offers opportunities, and others for which it does not.
The only reason why many of the mexican origin in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio lives, it is that a person in our tribe - perhaps a parent or grandfather - no chance had been commanded in Mexico, and in the northern direction.
And in most cases this person solved a profile - dark, unformed, out of a poor village, etc.
We are the seeds of these people, and our faithfulness applies to them.
Not Mexico.
And though we can now live the American dream, visit good schools and get good jobs, we can never lose that it is the American dream that we live — not the mexican.
Our identity is sometimes possible to disappear, but what our loyalty reflects, this is not the case.
This is clearly applicable to the United States.
In addition, we are aware that many members of the Mexican leading history do not like.
This is contrary.
You look at us as a masktime of a delicate ground and look at us down because we are not mexicanic enough.
Our Spanish will never be enough enough to be strong enough to our bands in Mexico.
Your view is a symbol of the shipman.
If our families wouldn't have failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then, we wouldn't see us now back to the summer - with an enlarged life in the United States, but lost any.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and brought into legal child into the United States, recalls that between Mexico and Mexico’s American Spannings exist, because the Mexicanians have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexicon Americans.
While she is US American citizen, she looks like a part of two countries.
But many mexican Americans I know have feelings to belong to one or another country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigre del North, but also Bruce Springsteen.
You're enjoying the best of both worlds, but no one's disappeared.
We'll see in Mexico as an American.
And in the United States, we will see the Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship more complex: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educational busygery want to recover their connections with Diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as a provincial "Botschafter" for Mexico who represent their interests in the United States.
We must tell our American colleagues about how great this country is, and pressure on the political leading to intensify their bindings to Mexico.
Now.
That won't happen.
Many feelings are too hurt.
And in view of the injust income distribution, unlawful corruption and drug management, many of us are not so sure whether it is really a great country.
I'm afraid you should go through her alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not ready to forgive the United States for the transition with Mexico a half century ago, they must also accept that some Mexico Americans have a lot of the way as their family members have not been treated so far.
Hmmmm.
Maybe we're myxical, as I thought.
Old festival, new Near East
The arms rate between Israel and Hamas could be demonstrated as an unexpected founder for peace
Can there ever be a close peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest blue events seem to renew such hope in Keim.
In the usual debt orders, more than 140 Palestinians, who killed most civilians and six Israelis - and at the first time, the rakes of Gaza were killed near the Israeli Metropolies Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
However, although Israelis and Palestinians appear to be bound in their historic conflict, the Near East changes around them.
The Arab birth has created a new, unconscious situation, and whether they want it or not - Palestinians and Israelis have become part of these actors.
Maybe this will lead to more blood diseases.
However, there are reasons for the adoption that the dead pact situation could finally find its end.
A war that neither is lost nor winned
On the first view, optimism seems to be placed in view of the current situation of all others.
Even if the arms agreed on 21 November, this warriors strengthened the arms of the arms on both sides.
The manager of Hamas, the Islamist movement controlled by the Gaza Street since 2007, is resolved to renew Israelis, although his group had to describe great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are killed and the 1,7 million inhabitants of the Gaza Street are taken into one of the most desolate and closely widespread eggs of the planet, Israel has not been able to destroy the Hamas.
In fact, Hamas in Westjordan, controlled by the Rivalizing, Middle Palestinian Group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders could come to conclude that they have time on their side.
As the islamists in the Arab world have gained influences, Hamas has able to take friends on their side.
Turkey, a recovery, regional power, which first believes as Israel's most extreme muslimal commitmenter, has taken for the Hamas Party - just like Katar, one of the most rich and dynamic golf States.
Judge Hamas attachers believe that Israel forms a islamist halfbmond - from Lebanon in the north, where the military Hibolah has the power, over Syria, where the refusals of an increased islamistic expression could stand before the structuring of Bashar Assads, until Jordan, where Hamas' alleged to the king.
And in particular the rise of muslimbrudership by President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt, the most stronger and most important Arab country, in the southern Israel's flash has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the Laisist Despot, who reigned Egypt to his thirty years of 2011, was only a few time for the Hamas.
In contrast, the brothership is dismissed with the Hamas and depends on their leaders of people's views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, the Hamas could not be exposed as a a actor that is unable to be deployed by Israel and the United States.
The Israeli Hardliners will make a contrary conclusion.
Military saw the Hamas no longer danger.
The Israeli Rakete Dead System, "Iron Dome", has been able to be survey and many of the Hamas races have been destroyed.
At least a time Israel will be able to sleep quietly.
In diplomatically, the United States will hold their position unfairly. Many European countries have made Hamas responsible for the latest violence.
Israel has happened well in recent years, particularly under the Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has ignored the peace process to large parts.
Although rakees from Gaza have killed since 2004 about 30 Israelis, the country has remained relatively free from self-term agents, not last thanks to the exploring plants that have been made in West-Jarland, and thus the main part of a Palestinian State, which protect the Jewish seeds that were explained for forest laws, but continue to be extended.
Netanyahu is well here. His Likud-Partei has been in front of the elections on 22 January by Avigdor Lieberman with a other fighting group.
Why do these back-list Palestinians also restore and let them a own State?
If they had actually control over Westjordan, wouldn't they also disappear as their fellows in the Gaza Street?
No, it's better to keep them behind the wall in shoes, they should have the heads.
The hardliners may be able to translate, but the Arab birth could make them a strict.
Even though the islamists who are now in Egypt and other countries have a little lack of power in Israel have been focused on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel’s defence seat is greater than his four Arabian neighbors.
A war with the local supermacht will not help the new Arab governments with the establishment of their economy.
That is the pragmatic President Mursi together with Barack Obama to reach an arms station, it might be an promised character and may symbolize the beginning of a new medie.
Israeli also should think more long.
While the rest of the Arab world is undertaken by democratization, Palestinians continue to stress their right of self-determination - a folk fashion that is unfortunately explored in Israeli areas, just as a bus has explosed this week in Tel Aviv.
The subpression is now undermined by the democracy in the Jewish State, and the growth of the Arabian population will only be reduced.
Blood missions to resume Hamas in Gaza settlement will be requested increasingly in the years of their diplomatic tribut.
Both sides need an outdoor stock
The right answer is the one who represents the most successful representatives of both sides, the large part of the rest of the world and of this period: two States where Israel is encountered in security areas.
The - for the close future - little - hope is that the outdoor wavelength allows more impact on the implementation of this solution.
Egypt has now to stop with Turkey and Katar the delivery of weapons in the Gaza settlement and is better positioned than ever to convince the idea of a Jewish State on the basis of the 1967 borders, complemented by territorial steaks and a common Jerusalem.
External Arab nations should also move Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would be more done for the creation of a Palestinian State than by the previous application of the UN observer status.
Obama must also contribute its part to move the negotiations to Israel.
During his first office time, he reaffirmed the idea of his own peace plan.
Something away in the white house seems to be rejected as well as a participation.
But this is a painful, short-term perspective.
The United States have an important interest in the stability of the Middle East.
And this is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws for uniform cigarette packages are entered into force
Health warnings and disappeared body parts on neutral green packages that are equal to all tabakmarks
The world’s first laws for unique cigarettes and tabak packages have been entered into Australia. This means the brand logos and colours will be replaced by neutral, olive green clothes that are printed with drastic images which are swimming parts and sigarettes.
From the different health warnings and images, it is the only difference between the packages in the brand names printed in the same, small letters.
This leads Australia to the world's most closer rules for tabak packages.
The Australian Federal Government wants to remove young people from rain by eliminating the glamour image of the tabak consumption.
The government of studies showed that people who have not started with 26 are not yet starting, with 99% of the probability will also be started.
"You can see in children young ages that they understand the message to buy tobacco concerts with their brand image", says the Federal Health Minister Tanya Mehrbersek. It sees studies that, for example, showed that children are associating the crowns of a logo with the idea of a princesin.
Although Australia is one of the least railway rates in the world and the changes are only low to the benefits of the multinational concerts, other countries have already made similar steps.
The tabaclobby fighted against the laws.
So it said that the laws would benefit from the black market, which leads to improving and easier accessive cigarettes.
"The laws will lead to serious, incompatible consequences," Scott McIntyre says British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian fibres will be offered in the streets of Australia to larger numbers of these products.
Others say that the laws have adjusted their business.
Sandra Ha von Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, notes that the demand for Zigarettes and Silikodecks has been brought to discover the uncontracted packages, since the Conzern British American Tobok, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Toboc had been closed two months ago in the top Australian Court with their complaints of law.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units in large business and waited for new matters.
That's a good business for us.
As a result of experts, the hake is in the care of social media accurately from the population group to which the plan is planned.
A number of Australian laws has prohibited tobacco concerts from the TV warning to enhance them as a sports sponsor and the majority of the skills have not been able to provide cigarettes in businesses. Now they have changed to the web.
The Australian government has prohibited the Internet by local enterprises and sides, however, does not have an impact on international sides.
"Whoever markets a tabak and has only a small area to buy its products, it's not about the Internet", says Becky Freeman, researcher in the Sydney University.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Freeman, Freeman has established an increase in experience reports in Marks which were used by "normal people".
You need to ask: Is a private person that finds so great increased in Marlboro-Signers that she takes a video for it - or has a branding agent to do so?
The British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry instead of Marketing is focusing on the new laws.
It has even gone so far to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to implement the new regulations - these countries have respected the world trade organization on unfair trade restrictions, although none of the countries have greater trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected for average 2013.
Furthermore, the Government has conducted conversations with other countries to consider similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country in 2001, which was written by photo warnings.
These have been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Another laws are undertaken in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian railers show themselves bitter.
The pictures don't affect me.
I'm just gonna ignore her.
"It's just takes a kitchen and throws off the board," Victor El Hage says when he bought a cigarette chain, on which a photo is printed with an orange.
Indeed, there's just a reason why I'm gonna stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, operator of the Tabak Trade "King of the Pack" in the Internal City of Sydney, says that the unique packaging has noted the compliance of his rules.
"Today I used a hour to place a delivery, now I need four," says Yu.
"The government would simply make cigarettes completely-- then we would have told us okay that's what we're doing." He added that he's obliged.
In a constant election world, it's beautiful, even pleased
This thanksgiving I used five hours in the airport when our aircraft was run because of the mechanical problems and we had to wait for another flight.
So I had enough time to make me a few thoughts about long.
I don't want to lie.
A half day at the airport at a airport is quite nervous - even if books, magazine and iPhones are available (and naturally free tax shopping).
But more academitics and child development experts lead longer than something positive.
If it follows them, it is for us - and our children - well, likely to be pleasant.
This will be encouraged to lose thoughts in interesting actions, which can promote creativity.
And because most of us today are almost constant on one or another screen, we don't get the advantages of the long-term benefits.
So, should we welcome the long parts of the poor open?
Yeah.
And no.
So I'll come back again.
How many people also have found that a relatively relatively current phenomenon is which has grown up with a growing free time.
But Peter Toohey, Professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) does not see it.
"Actually, the length has a very long story," he said.
The housewide pompejis makes a Latin graffiti on long-terms back to the first century.
And then there is still the question how we really define long-term.
John D. Eastwood, a associationed psychology professor at the University of York in Ontario, in Canada, is the problem of the defining and discussing long-term types of life.
After a long lecture of research literature and the presentation of the idea before a group of 100 persons came Professor Eastwood and his colleagues to conclude that long parts of experience would like to execute "a satisfactory activity that can not be able to defined".
Apathie is a long time, so that the person is not occupied but wanted to be.
In the apathie, there was no step to do something.
The key investigation of the long-term, he says, turns out in a "creasing of the attention process, paid with worse milk and feeling that the time perishes only slowly."
Likewise, the depression can almost be heard.
But professor Eastwood believes that, although these two situations could be related, people who are concerned see the problem in their environment or in the world, while depressive people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we believe that we are slow, even if we have a little difficulty to concentrate.
In its study "The Unngaged Mind: Definition Boredom in Terms of Attention" - to German: "The unactive understanding: The definition of long-speakings under the aspect of attention," which appeared in the September of the Facility "Perspectives on Psychological Science", show professor Eastwood and his colleagues on a previous experience at the participant of a band that had heard a magaziny article.
Some groups heard a slow television program from the nearby-country room that had nothing to do with the content. Others heard it at a lower smoke, so it was pretty incredible while the third group did not understood these gardens.
Those who have missed the television of little hearing have given more than the two other groups - they had problems to concentrate, they could not find no reason for this and write their difficulties.
If you are trying to concentrate on a difficult or strong task, the strengthening of attention may lead to long-terms, Mark J. Fenske says, associational professor of new sciences at the Guelph University in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
If you are running an integer activity - "such as searching for false products on a manufacturing trail, you can miss music and help to feel unlikely."
In fact, he says, we know now that the heroes and the cristals are often interpreted as a sign for long-terms, they can even fight by persons remain more attentionable.
"Studes have shown that children who are able to make up, learn more and keep more information than those who are advised to the sterility", says Prof. Fenske.
All of us will be a long time - my spring flight, a dream speech, a particularly exciting film.
But some people are more easier than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed in the 1980s a "Scala for long-term opportunity".
On the skale there are comments like "Much of things I need to do again and are monoton" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
With the support of such scalens, researchers found that young people are slower than girls, so Stephen Vodanovich, Professor for Psychology at the Westflorida University - especially what is the need to be more and more of the needs of external travels.
But generally the teenagers are a quite relaxed hair.
In 1991 Reed Larson, Professor for Human and Communities Development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he was almost 400 teenagers and seven to eight times in the day he contacted with a page.
He discovered that 32% of adults in school and at home workers were required, whereby 23% had not been required if they were not in school.
However, only 3 percent of the parents had to feel nice.
Prof. Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn't know whether the percentage rates have increased or sinked.
However, he is sure that " youth will be affected as a particularly long-term", mostly because children and teenagers have no big impact on their entire day end.
Return to my original question: Are you healthy?
Sometimes not because in extreme case, it leads people to take extremely physical risks to disappear the lucky or drugs to deal with them - they have shown studies.
On the other hand, many philosophies and authors investigate the relationship between long-term and creativity. This opinion is Professor Vodanovich, who investigates the topic for more than two decades.
"In the long part, the brain will say that you should do something else," said Gary Marcus, Professor for Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain doesn't always know what you've got to do.
If one is slow and uses this energy to play and cooper, you will be happy.
However, television can take care of short-term feelings of happiness, but those contempted again.
Thus, who is enough of a iPad for his beloved child may, however, take away from the long parts. However, it has not learned to maintain or control himself, professor Fenske says.
And he adds: "The same control is transmitted from a situation to the other."
The child learns not only to undertake himself, but also takes more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should heal long-term.
We don't have to see them critically.
Instead, our goal should be made to feel aware of the specific activity and technology risks.
Professional Eastwood does.
"It sounds like we should be slow before, but long-term is the warm, incredible desire to do something sense," says he.
He believes that people in truth are looking for a way to disappear and resolve.
"In an area where we are constantly superstimulated, it can be difficult to work when the laugh is once disappointed."
There is no clear guidance in Colorado for the new Marihuana law
The 19-year Community colleague student and football players Anthony Orozco stands in South-Orozco for a proceeding to the court that will be shortly legal in this State: the possession of some less marihuanabrooks and a feed with which he flights it.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were on a September day with the car in Lamar near the border to Kansas when they were arrested.
After the officer of the police, Marihuana was found in the car, Orozco was designed for the possession of drugs and drugs - cavalcare delimites which are seen according to a crime of 100 US dollar - and received a court term.
"We are being treated as criminals," Orozco.
But he's one?
In the unwanted weeks after the decision of the State to legalize small amounts of Marihuana to the own use, the response to hundreds of small drugs is less than from the location.
Some hundreds of orders towards Marihuana are adopted here and in Washington station, which have already been adopted similar measures.
The police authorities follow adults over 21 years, not longer for ownership, but are legally authorised as soon as new laws enter into force in the next weeks.
But the lawyers in the conservative desires of Colorados have announced that the Marihuanadelics existing and still settled people before the court.
At the same time, several cities, from the towns Denvers to the Western Mountains, are designed to decline new licensed Marihuana in the opening of their communities.
"I don't know what will happen as next", says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
And also regulatory authorities in the Federal State of Washington are ratified on the head.
They were waiting for a guidance aid to establish a licensing system for production, production, distribution and sale of drugs, and have a period until 1 December 2013.
In Washington, it is considered that Colorado, in any case, is prevailed by most States, which concerns the regulation of Marihuana. There the drug was only legalized to medical purposes and then to the own consequence.
"Colorado has a stronger regulated market. This is why the State goes well to orientation," says Brian E. Smith, the supervision authority for spiritos in the State of Washington.
But Smith also provides that no place or system can do any more than serve in the meaning of a green leader.
"We have no real presence that we can follow", he adds.
The Washington Act I-502 shall enter into force on 6 December and also form the end point of a green zone where the State licensing system is not yet available but the property is legalized.
And inadequate practices need to be explained at this time - how to agree the state provision of a "comprehensive access" Marihuana with the prohibition of Cannabis in the area of 300 meters about schools, parks, plays and children deployment institutions.
"It will be more difficult to find a location for a licensed cannabis house than in towns, especially in the Marattle Balance area", says Ben Livingston, speaker for the "Center for Legal Cannabis", a recent research group.
On November 21, Head Oates sent his employees to Aurora e-mail in which he explained that the government manager would continue to follow smaller Marihuana disasters in persons over 21 years and that the police would not be directly stressed for these acts.
Head Oates added that the police continued to take steps to regulate farmers of medical Marihuana and would continue to follow drugs.
In Old County in North Colorados, Ken Buck Buck is a more stretch view.
After the vote, he added that his authority would continue to pursue the cases of Marihuana, mainly to move consumers to solve.
At the present 119 persons have to be answered for the possession of approximately 50 grams or less Marihuana before the court, although many were accused for other delicts.
"Our authority has the obligation to pursue abuses in which it has acted at the current time of crimes," Buck made a statement.
The reactions are themselves in places like the rural Mesa County, where the Marihuana initiatives were designed.
The police in Great Junction, the largest city of the country centre, shows adults for the possession of smaller amounts.
The State Officer Pete Hautinger supported this decision, but also decided not to fall all outcoming proceedings.
"I don't think that I'm wearing my time to carry out the right until it changes," he said.
Although 55% of the electors supported the measure in Colorado, it was clear that it would not be easy to agree the personal consumption of Marihuana with the complexity of government and legal system.
And the opposite reactions throughout the State promoted under local officials a deep green skill in terms of the great green experiment on days.
In the case of the State lawyers, Sean McAllister is a legal prosecutor of Denver, who acts in the case of Marihuana Delicts and acts on the place as a speaker for the national organization for the reform of Marihuanship.
"They have an important part of their life in order to follow persons in criminality that they are still not able to accept legalization," he believes.
As the first states that treat Marihuana's smaller amounts like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are treated as national patterns for the legalization of drugs.
During the preparation of a timely legal sales, the Federal Government is also at the same time nervous on instructions that would continue to negotiate the sale and construction of Marihuana on federal levels.
For the jurisdiction movement, they hope that the Ministry of Justice will be remitted.
Despite a number of on-sight-related arrests of consumers and solders of medical Marihuanas, the Federal Government has granted the sale of medical Marihuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other States.
Kevin A. Sabet, earlier drug policy adviser of the Obama Government is that criminal officers are likely to not enter into the doors in order to take smaller drugs, but may be puffed up under the new laws regulated by the State Marihuana.
More cities in Colorado were not just waiting for the Federal authorities.
Again before the election day, some local communities managers were authorized for new Marihuana schools, although they could first be opened for a year.
The last week Montrose, a city in the Western, has decided to be six months a ban that will probably be adopted next week.
"We don't want to move in a position where we're led to someone and then stand at federal level before a great problem", says Bob Nicholson, a member of the city Council.
Our community has acted against this legislation.
We're going to say for what the community has decided and not then what the State has decided.
Many questions are still open.
Petnella Wyatt: I was mobbed from Oxford because I'm Tory
Today, not only university students will be attacked for their views
It was always my greatest dream to get a place at the Oxford University.
My father and my older brother had visited that university I had the first time for the most knowledge of the world, for a modern Greek symposion, which promoted the large pillars of civilization - free thoughts and tolerance.
But within two weeks after my arrival in the College's end of the eighteenth years, I had forgotten to study story - I had again packed my collar and made the first scandal of my life.
My dad was dreaming together.
My friends were disappointed.
In the evening's standard, I would have gone because I had a problem to have a communion in the neighbouring rooms.
The author A N Wilson explained that I would have left the University because I was obliged to drink from damaged tastes.
But the truth was less sure.
I'm going away.
Yeah, loved, because I'm lying under systemic mobbing and drugs.
Not because of my right un normal name or because I came from a private school.
You had just shocked me from a reason - a reason that appeared in this pleasant moving for so exciting and grausive: My middle of the dead father Woodrow Wyatt was an important adviser Margaret Thatcher and I was the defender of the Conservative Party.
Why do I say that now?
According to the current reports, a new generation of students of the gender rights leads to similar persecution.
The organised and growing hate at Tory students in Oxford has developed in the middle of such dimensions that a group of them last week requested the same rights of equality, debts, disabilities and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Juneor Common Room (JCR) of the Corpus of Christ, they will be identified by their political views "Of active, personally attacked and unresolved".
They are requesting a place in the Committee of Equality of their colleague to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Its situation was recently expanded documentation on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the right", which was designed tours as an excentrator and Neonazis.
This was shown, among other Absolvent Joe Cooke, earlier President of the conservative studentic association of the University of Oxford, who was carried into a rolls-Royce and was used with silver colorful approximately and silver gostock.
Other universities say conservative students, they will be considered as "Sincen buses for the introduction of higher study costs".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, Vice-President of the Conservative Student Association of the University of Nottingham, laid down in a lunchday period: "There is an increased leftest at universities.
People believe that we're like the Bullingdon Club without all of us."
Samuel Roberts, 21 and History student in Corpus of Christ, which initiated the search for greater protection, is the view that such climate is "incomprehensible". The 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, designed President of the conservative studentic agreement of Oxford, has observed a growing obstruction against students of gender rights.
"This poses a danger for the intellectual diskurs and for the benefit of the members," she said.
In my first week, in Oxford, I had an likely minority.
As an unbelievable 18-year-old I came in September 1986.
The Hass to the Conservative Party had reached its high point.
In the past year, the University had decided to grant Margaret Thatcher, a former student, on the basis of curriculas in high school.
The atmosphere would even have stopped the tanks.
In the first days of the first watch, in which new students know and the tutors, I got a prejudice to the future events.
I made the experience that the tutors had not only stopped the skill of Tory students but also participated with joy.
Political topics such as the mountain worker, the privatization and the abolition of the government of sanctions against the South African region found their way in the wooden wooden rooms of the Tutorium.
In my first events, I had to translate French texts from the 18th century in English.
"Miss Wyatt", said the Tutor Harry Pitt (a middle of the)," "Reset the first paragraph."
I'm droved about it.
Pitt was a small man with a face as a clothe, and it was quite worthy.
"There refused to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students knocked.
In my eyes, we were dreams up.
"I propose that they take a few French hours at your free time - so if you don't work too much with your social activities," pitt bound me.
I turned back to my room with a blue head.
I sat at the colleague alone at the dinner when someone was easy to go on the school.
It was an English student of the second year named James, who was a member of the conservative studentship.
"I know who you are," he said friendly.
Unfortunately, it's like it.
Everyone who is suspected to be Tory will be dranged.
For me it's pretty bad enough, but they know that your father Margaret's near, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory First Seption provides to be the attachers of the Labour Party.
In a local pub, I later tried to make me.
I believe that I wasn't in any point with Mrs. Thatcher's a view.
This trick should be shown as unsecutable.
A study member of the philosophie, policy and economy, who was ironally visited the Eton colleague as conservative, said to me, "You're the daughter of a Fascist Swiss."
You're disappointed.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was incredible and ridiculous.
"Who have Tories Sex?" asked me one.
They're shot each other, right?
I felt how Homosexules had to feel before the liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever have been able to lead a normal life to the University of Oxford?
Can I see the same infant once after the infringement of the darkness?
Should I use the Labour Party and express my natural disappearances?
The three years before me were denied before my spiritual eye to a feast of the idea and isolation.
The only tour who opened to be Tory was Norman Stone professor for the timely history who had his seat in my college.
He was desired not only to be a conservator but also because he had consulted the external policy and wrote words for them.
He was just rarely there.
He hated the place, found him provincely and small carried and declined him for his marxistic-determinist historic perspective.
He took a prosecutor at the University of Bilkent in Ankara in Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he said to me.
I started pending between Oxford and the house of my parents and found flexibility in close friends and family members in the city.
My father told me I hated Oxford, and why I did it.
He seemed unbelievable.
During his time in the quarters, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," said he quiet.
That would never be done, not in my city of the dreams of the tourists.
Even my communical friends still put free manners on the day.
His burning eyes were deceived.
Give the whole opportunity.
I'm sure you're just knocking.
It would cut me the heart when you went.
My frequent travels to London became more emotional resistance.
One of my husband's friends, also Tory attachers, had given the pressure and discovered his convictions.
During a tutorium in the next week, in which another story student had seriously described, I was "un enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I've gone back to shame, I gave my parents to have undertaken a "shake" and he called her "level trottel".
The illumination was only short.
It was my father who killed my Oxford Carrier's last Nagel in the Sarg.
To that time he wrote two columns in the Murdoch Presse for a week.
My door was closed.
I hide in my room, and after five minutes I opened my households.
When she went, I got a buyer and took the first trip to London.
I never returned back.
You can call me a fucking shit.
But no 18-year-olds should never lead to a educational institution under such disappointment and disobedience.
And it is even tragic that it was Oxford - a university who produced not only 14 Tory Prime Minister, but hide himself after an unprofit call of equality and thought freedom to this day.
"Valentino affects Eleganz of beauty"
The exhibition "Valentina - Master of Couture" opened this week in London says ABC with Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian model.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital, which is worthy of the accommodation of an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This designer has recognized the designer in the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a great retrospective for which more than 130 clothes of the hair couture, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his unchanged Italian accent.
This exhibition is the conclusion of a story whose only protagonist is "il Lord" Garavani, but without its different clients could not be written.
Valentino has always suffered a faszination for the rough and far-related world of the aels.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will be seen until 3 March, there is a number of private letters and photos with the title of the most ready aristocracy, started by Princess Salimah Aga Khan, about the Princess Marie-Chantal of Greechenland and Margarita from England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as a tropphose of his social upgrade from the diversity model in the city of Voghera in Northitalien to the ideal of the international Jetsets.
In love in the Adel, it must not be of profit.
"If at least they're not coming out their knees on your glorious tip, how some beautiful beauty teachers do from the Popmusic," Baronin Fiona Thyssen Bernice says.
In the 60 and 70 years, the two of them lived in the Alpens and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, great guest and elegant guest.
"We all are glad when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," the exhibition of "Heini" Thyssen, a pleasure with forgotten beauty, such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenia Niarchos.
Valentino has always been the elegancy of goodness.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a clothing of Valentino
Also, the argentin model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charism of the Modemmaker.
A lot of years ago, we went to his home to dinner at Piazza di Spain after a moderary view at the Piazza di Spain.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
On each detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and music was recognized, and the impact of it was opened.
"All inviteds felt important and loved," remembered the "Top-Model", which started their race at the week of the Haute Couture 1995 in Paris.
"He never comes out of the mode because his designs are artists," she concluded.
Properties of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of sincereness, more than the mutual favorites.
He loves people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Someset House was transformed in a green and 60 meters long walk that offers a road stage: the user takes the place of the model and chooses the course to wonder a tragic "Audience" that brings the masters of Valentino, such as the clothes, the Jackie Kennedy for her wedding with Aristóteles Onassis, the costals, the Monica Vitti in "La Notte" or a mantel of Wolf and Leather, who listed by the Kaiserin Far Diba.
In this publication, the names of Sibilla de Luxembourg, the Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, the Mete-Marit of Norway, the Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophia of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and Modemmaker, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unconscious".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a Hose, a Hemd, a west man "Gillette" and a Jack from the Herbst/Winter collection 1971-1972.
"It was a gift of him," says Naty Abascal, one of the Museums of the designer.
"I get him all others because of his great love for the women and because he highlights our beauty," adds the former herogin of Feria.
I like the colours he's used very; they have a lot of light and understood the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and manager in the Mode Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can also forget the first time when they took a Valentine.
When I lived as teenager in Italy, I was dreaming to have the age and the opportunity to take one of his dinners...
The end of the 1990s then finally came to it.
I bought my first Valentino clothes for a festival in the closure of my vetters, the Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red clothing with flowing rock and a drapped head with a decololete that makes honor for his name.
"It was a true dream," the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg said.
"Valentina does not depend on the mode, his belonging is timeless," explains this Italian aristocratin, living between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg maintains its evening clothing of the Modemacher "with absolute careful," "for a clothing is not only an clothe, but also the associated memories."
The king's mode
The great end of the exhibition in Someset House is the wedding cloth of Marie-Chantal Miller for their wedding with Paul de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "Ragazze" (as the Modemmacher called his neighbors) were necessary to make this eleven-been-beam clothes with perles, twelve different steelheries and a four-one meters long suit.
According to the journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the Fachpresse, this clothing was a mile stone in the end of the 20th century, "the return to the clients of the top society."
For years, the Elite has suffered with the "sving-being" of the Elite, Valentino is now her best examples.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest name of Italys), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander de l'Ordre del Arts and of the Lettres, which is designed with the honor delegation, comulated Garavani as many honors, such as each of his customers.
"Mir is always his refrigeration, his peace, his fitting and perfect outward," D'Arenberg says.
I've seen him last one month ago at a Gala de Orsay rescue in the Museum.
He sat on the table of Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of me.
"He was doing; the time left no rings on him."
And this says a princess...
The most difficult professional of the world: the human workers of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the thresholds of the Indonesian volcano put their life and health on the game when they take 70 kilo swimming on the swimming, stone ways.
There are people for whom their work is the hell, and others are working in the hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 min workers who gain their life by taking weapon from the Ulcan Kawah Ian in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
So he must grow up every day down on the ground of his neck, where the extensive sustainable gas is exposed from the earth in contact with the air.
After he broke out large pearl stones that can cut up to 70 kilo, he transports them into two bamboods to his shoes over the rocked paths from stone.
Although there are only 250 meters to the street of the Vulkan, which is up to a height of 2386 meters, but the intrusted twice needs more than 40 minutes for the rise in the wheel time, keeping the balance and needs to set their steps in order to not extract and abstract them.
You know that each step can cost their life, as this happened a French tourist, which crashed the shareholds of the Kawah someone years ago.
The mine workers of Kawah Ijen won 5% for each kilo Schwefel that they build.
Together, they are talking about the way between the tourists that they photograph as circles and run with the hard cows of three kilometres to the wage, which has made a ministry a little further on a height of 1850 meters.
Society is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been using its workers since 1960 and (not better) who have been used to pay 662 indonesian rupes (5 Eurocent) for each kilo Schwefel.
This is then sold for each 10,000 rupes (83%) to the petrochemic industry, because this mineral is widespread every day and is used to produce steel woodens, firework articles, cosmetics, dynamites and even for the clothes of sugar.
"When we usually take 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupes (3.8 euros)" says Anto, which makes three streets a day.
For each street he needs three hours where he is completely done, at the end of the day he has 138.000 rupes (11.5 euros).
What a misfortunate reward seems to be such an unmensive effort, but it is the reward of what he would benefit with the field work.
"The day of the ministry workers here, where 15,000 rupes are paid on the day, and the average monthly agreement is two million rupes (167 euro) is very high," said the trainer who had previously worked as a waller on the tourist island of Bali.
There he won 75.000 rupes (6.2 euros) on the day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto is with his family to Banyuwangi, a village near, returning from a reason that in Indonesia is as important as the problem: "I married a girl from Bali where they are Indians, and I brought it to Java to return it to Islam."
Anto has Asthma, attempt with difficulty, haughty often, and his eyes are renewed because of the gifting gas.
The 27-year-old anto puts his life on the Kawah Iwen on the game, whose weapon has left the first springs, although he opened his face with a mask and special brown.
Anto has Asthma, attempt with difficulty, haughty often, and his eyes are rescued because of the gifting gas from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay for the achievement of his dream.
"I'm gonna work here for two years because I want to open a load or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This sympathic and intelligent young man, but in life, could work as tourists, kellners or at the receipt of a hotel, but instead he makes the work of a tragedy.
He shares a smooth wood clothes with other towers and stands every morning about two hours, because the weapon also extensive night, where his characteristic yellow colour is blue in the dark.
The shadows are required, he puts into the light of a small stink lamp to his hair, which he bought himself from his own money, in the corner.
For about 400 thresholds on the corter floor, the colds with hang on their shoes are loaded.
Despite its large gains, the mining society has not mechanised the building of suits to feeding costs, and provides the trends that are working on their own account and paying weight, no equipment.
They also receive no part of the 300,000 rupes (2.5 Euro) Approvision for photo-apparate that the watchers of this natural park together with the income payment of 15.000 rupes (1.2 Euro) requires from the tourists that come to the photography of the Vulkan and the human tragedy.
"This work is protested for the animals and not for the men" Madrusin, a sharp, 42 years old trends, which worked three ten years since the school was left at Kawah Iwen.
He is able to take up up to 110 kg and ensure that he continues to "authorize" because he needs the money for ensuring his three children ages between 10 and 18 years.
I'm not going to rente, I'll die here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even if the weapon blows the hair and throws the eyes when the wind suddenly dreams and the mine workers into the dark skins that rise out of the corner, the men are so hard that nobody lies about serious diseases ... of course, except the usual attempts, arthromes, pains in the knees and Blasens on the skins that have made themselves from the weight of the crowd.
With the corb on his back, Uninik with his 53-years is just in the way to take 50 kg.
Every day he and his friends 15 tons of swimming out of the volcano, which are transported by three LKWs over a bottle between the pool to camp in Tamansari in 18 kilometres of disappearance.
"I won't go in rente, I'll die here because the volcano was my whole life," said Oneinik, while he opens his mouth far, in which some deeps lack.
From his five children, the elderly worked with his 30 years as a sweefel thief.
The time passes, but the army is a generation to generation in one of the most powerful professionals of the world: those who work as a human burden on the cow.
Singapore needs children to save the economy
Singapurs have the fault that they have no children, the carriers, the stress and the costs of real estates and children.
"The population of Singapur has to grow up."
I'm a patriotic husband, you're my patriotic marriage: we fulfil our citizen's commitment and we're creating life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for Minzbons, but, however, - or just so - they were starting this year in Singapore to a viral video on YouTube.
The series are part of a rapper-song, the local prophecies such as "boo" (Lab) will be a "bao" in the corners, to make a pleasure about the lower birth rate in Singapur.
The Werbefirma BBH, which has shooted the video, makes the hope that the Werbepot has reached a nice way to make the problem carefully.
Her creative leader Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to bring people to fulfil their "national obligation".
This is just a thing for the Internet, so we had to make it sweet and white.
It is the greatest problem in this country.
In the future, we are the worstest of the world, so we found that it is a subject to which we had to worry.
We knew that the government had tried many, such as the marketing of parfüms with Pheromons or the organization of Speed Dataing Parits (Sheets).
It may be that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not lead to successful.
So we thought: Why do we not do anything as creative as possible to address this problem, such as a rap?
1,2 sons.
Whoever does not take this topic is the government of Singapore.
Every year, it provides 1,300 US dollar for political measures to encourage citizens to get more children.
A package of the government for marriage and parents granted up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity survival and distributes tax benefits.
But all had little success until now.
Singapore is a rich, high-technological city State in South-East Asia, which is also known for the conservation of its governments and its rigorous social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate is currently at 1,2 children per woman.
The last time, when this rate was infringed over 2 - what was also known by the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why do the Singapurs no longer get kids?
Tan Wei Ming, Director for Ehe and Family Policy of the National Population Authority, said that this is to renew a "modern training" and "growder carrierchancs".
"This has allowed people to marry and to form a family significantly more options in relation to life objectives and to put priority," she explains.
These changes in the social identities have to be higher number of all persons and the delayer of the heirs and births, whose result is the reduction of the birth rate in Singapore.
However, a immigration policy focused on drastic growth of immigration in order to affect the reduction of the population to resживance in the local population.
In Singapore there are web sites where the shortly caused Xenophobie flows against many new inmigrants, especially against the Chineses that are critical to keep the lies low and not to integrate.
The increase in immigration will also be seen as one of the reasons that the Government Party in Singapur has achieved its worst election result since the independence.
Since the elections, an attempt was undertaken to correct the problem with higher contributions and benefits for foreign workers.
Unexpected Foundation
During the falling birth rate, the impact on the economic growth of a nation, the tax income, health costs and immigration policy shows also unexpected consequences.
The Government is trying to achieve that many small apartments are not built.
This has already an impact on the housing market.
The Authority for Stadical Development has started controling the number of small apartments known as "shapes" and can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square metres and show a great success of sales.
Nevertheless, the concern is that they can promote the living style of the Alliance, and that they disappeared the building persons to build great apartment for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, Director-General of the Immobiliate EL Developers, says that his "sheets" will be selled much more fast than greater than living units.
They are so popular, and the units are around the day and even weeks are buying faster than the larger living units.
This means that they are very better for our Cash Flow.
However, it adds that the new standards will give the developers more clear orientations that have been made before obstacles to the way when they wanted to build too many small living units within a project.
Too many Stress
Singapur is a city State.
Even if these new rules could prepare the way to increase the national birth Council, the discussions with the Singapurs working in the financial year is to understand that they have no great effect.
"The people are strongly stretched, the apartments and also the education are thorough, because it's going to be out of many outside" says a young manager.
Children can get others.
"To me, it is important to have my own money and time" says another, about twenty years old man.
Gentlemen and women lead their carriers, stress and costs for property and education as a reason that they can't have children.
The Singapurs therefore have the last word when it is about to get children, there can the government do so much.
The offline Private Offline is private
Privacy
According to the Dictionary, it is about the private property or "no area of private life where you have an impact on protection against any kind of immunity".
What is private for someone under 16 years?
How will this definition be used on its daily and the social networks?
Does he understand the dangers that he's being exempt if he's known in the Internet situations that he wouldn't share in real life?
El Periodico interviewed five young people aged between 10 and 15 years who are often under the network.
In four of the cases, they assembled the intention of "and something very own" at personal level and "on the password and the user" when they apply it to social networks.
"My deepest secrets I wouldn't have known in a post," says the 10 years old Jorge when trying to explain the importance of "privat" in web pages such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has two years over accounts.
"There are very confident mysteries, my mother can know it, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I load beautiful pictures or pictures of games.
I also get my time with acknowledged.
"I wouldn't share a photo that is not of me, or of someone who makes the dream."
The boy is sure that it's wrong to write obscene photos, of nakeds, of crimes, or of political or mighty comments.
Jorge's sure to know 35 friends who he has in FB and nine Folgers in Twitter.
Most of them are friends.
In addition, the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I added me to Twitter to print me and to write an interesting Tweets.
"I don't know if someone answers me, I'm just calling her up!" he adds.
"The social networks are sustainable, I can quickly speak with friends in the telephone or with friends."
He answers that he would never take an invitation from an unknown one.
Even if somebody recommends a stranger, he would ignore this.
The case of the 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he will not know 20 of the people he added to his friend list.
"It doesn't be ashamed because we have something common, for example music," he adds.
According to the kid's instruction, he didn't have asked him or asked him after his address or phone number.
"If anyone is concerned about me or she asks me, I'll just disappear him from my user account."
José reported to Ask after he read a recommendation in Twitter.
The boys are not unknown experiences that you're known as Cyberbullying today.
The recognised of a friend was expressed in a social network.
They threatened him and requested money.
"He never learned who it was," he assures.
According to José, the victim has not closed the user account.
"He only made it private."
Then he explains a number of steps to ensure a user account.
In difference with Jorge, this boy's photos of acknowledged photos would be higher in unbelievable or painful situations.
Yeah, I'd be doing this if he's unympathy, or I want him out.
"But I know this is Cyberbullying," he said.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, teacher of English with high school in education and teaching, means that to orientate children and youth must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to be informed.
"The Internet has been a means of searching for information; with the appearance of these pages, the rules have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the Akademiker Marc Pressky, inhabitant of a Master Titels in Pédagogik university of Yale and author of the "Digital Natives and Immigrants" formed these conclusions for the declaration of the phenomen.
The digital nationals are children and young people who have grown with this technology.
"We're the digital immigrants who have to learn where we still learn" he says.
He explains that it is a complex topic, "although we want from them to have a definitive criteria to be published, published or spoken, and that is in an age where the rail is not sufficient."
"They must also be desirable when they are most important to be loved to have thousands of friends without considering the consequences," he adds.
According to the Fachman, it is the most effective and efficient way to teach children and youths what is private to ask them questions that they bring to think.
"Speaking to say that they don't have to do it," he said.
Porras calls some possibilities then: There are things that you wouldn't have to tell a stranger. Why do you then do it on the Internet?
Or: Would it like you when you publish a photo from you, such as the one you have published by a friend?
You know what the others publish about you?
Have you asked the other persons before allowance if you've labeled photos of feeding?
And another question: can we all know what you're doing at every moment?
Another point is to understand them that they need to act online as they do it offline.
It's the same rules.
"With outside the Internet does with respect, integrity and other principles, and the same needs to apply to social networks."
Monitor
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teachers and educational advisers, comments that it is incomprehensible that parents read the social network directives.
If they understand all sections, they have solid basis to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"Tempour of playing the age, or what you can share or publicly" he said.
According to Guardia, children should be remembered to the Lection "Do not speak with foreigners".
Conclusion of the unsur without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th meeting of the Presidents of the South American Nations (Unasur) in Peru has ended without publication of the Lima declaration which was previously announced and theoretically signed by the seven present governments.
Efe reiterated the access to the signed document at the VIth ordinary meeting of the State and government officers of the unsurrection. The sources of the State and Presidents were initially participating in the providing offices that they would be transmitted after the class, but then explained that it would be a certain time published on the website of the Peruan Government.
In questions on the text, they indicated that the content of the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, was presented in short statements to the press.

On the official website of the ASPA, you may be convinced that the document has been published on the last Sunday.
At two international meetings, the Peruan authorities stressed that information systems would be available for the journalists, but they have highly limited access to information.
The meeting also concluded with the common obligation of Chile and Peru to adopt a sentence of the Court of Justice of The Haag, which introduces a border conflict between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, were attended during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would take the decision of the IGH which begins on Monday in Den Haag, in the process of introducing Lima against Santiago to hear the workshops of both sides.
"We will follow and execute the judgment of the differences that we currently make this International Court of Justice," Humala said together with his Chinese face.
"Chile was, and remains still a country that keeps international laws, seeks peaceful solutions for combating, concludes and undertake the international courts," adds Piñera and green Humala with a hand pressure before the facts of both countries.
The confirmation of both Presidents that they would be submit to the EIA has been made after Columbia, after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which had made a serious error, the objection against the Bogotá Agreement to be determined to subscribe the sentences of this International Court of Justice.

With the crisis in Europe, "the economic consolidation (in Latin America) can not take triumphants, but should serve to extend our production performance and bring up a better future to our peoples," Humala added.
"We decided to give a number of 31 emblemmatic projects the priority to improve local links in South America and particularly in rural and border areas... and to conclude our countries and new economic forms," said the Peruian President in a assigned declaration.
These projects would also be five peruians situated on the coasts of the coast to Brazil and two of them should provide better connection with Ecuador, although he has no further details.
The concluding document has also taken reference to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the election transition in this country serves for its reapproving in the South Americans" of which it is currently excluded.
The need for the Latvian America also continued a integrated region for the welfare and peace and good neighborhood relations was a further point that has been stressed on the meeting.
In this sense, the President of Columbia, Juan Manuel Santos, was expected to take the marriage conflict after a question of Bogotá after a question of the IGH sentence of the IGH.
"It may be able to meet me on Tuesday (Saturday) with President Daniel Ortega," said Santos.
"We will check all these ways - they are not exclusive, and the Nicaragua Agreement is also necessary to discuss with Nicaragua," he emphasized.

"South America has to learn at the integration of citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa today confirmed that the creation of a common government is a goal: "South America can really learn from Europe."
Correa, attended by the Presidents of the South American Nations (Unasur) on 6th meeting, explained the State television television in Peru that the Europeans "in the Second World War and in other exhibitions" and "the Europeans are practically a father country."
In this regard, he defended the project to create a South American government that leads the Member States of the unsurrection.
"The free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as it is already in the Andean Community, but there is still reactive sectors which have a return to the past", he warned.
The President of Ecuador also urged the new creation of the United States Organization (OEA) under the intention of reduce the impact of the angels of the States and to take into account those signed by San José on Human Rights Agreement.
The teachers are never obligation to do something, and we are always signing the South Americans.
"It is uncertainly that the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights has their seat in Washington and has been funded by the United States," he explained as a player on the political asylum, the Ecuador's founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he does not harm this decision because he has not convicted his principles but his "democratic values and opinions on human rights".
He added that it had "based changes that Assange is delivered to a third State and would not have its procedures".
He also criticised the Swedish Justice, who requested him to submit him into his State territory a Authority because of a nice sex-sexual delicate, while "Swedish legal proceeding allows this through a video conference that could be carried out by Ecuadors' message in London."
Correa explained that the dangers affected health and psychological status of asylum.
"Now, since he was in our message, I didn't talk to him, the ambassador told me that he had a easy problem with the lamentations, but not a matter of worse," said the State of Ecuadors.
However, it is the danger that he is close to physical and psychological damage because he is arrested in a large room and could not carry out physical events in the free.
"This would affect each person's health," he added.
Correa showed that the solution for the asylum, which has been granted in Ecuadors' Ecuadors' Ecuador's news in London, was to be a free letter, which he could travel to Ecuador, and that this is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He emphasized that it had been given with London to find a solution for the ended founders of WikiLeaks.
We do not act with human rights, but we do not refer this word to this case, but it has given permanent conversations.
"The solution for this problem is in hand of British, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe because the lawyer of Assange, Baltazar Garzón, leads a number of procedures to various European institutions," said he.
And "with the Great Britains tomorrow, this is done after my opinion."
And when Sweden Assange heard the Ecuadors' message in London or Skype, as it was allowed and made in other cases, the problem is solved.
Correa used the opportunity to confirm himself as a defender of the liberty of press and said that what he does not tolerate, "the Mediterraneanity, the evil views and the lies that cause the free view."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the bad and perverse politicals, but bad journalists who strive and strive to gain," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated that Ecuador is not more of such journalists "and not even managed by the bankers or hegemon and sponsorship countries," and took it in order to re-election "the revolution will be deep to continue the way in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to establish Veto against Paraguay in the unsur, at least to its next elections, argued that the organism should remain "fair and no optionalism and none of any legally dressed State reign", because "the legitimacy of democracy has been destroyed in Paraguay".
The Chairman Ecuadors also holds the desire of his Colombian contradiction, Juan Manuel Santos, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice of The Haag, which has granted the maritime state of Nicaragua, to negotiate the visional borders between the two countries.
This judgment is currently not implemented.
It is a problem between a South America and a Mediterranean State.
Conflicts are incredible, but they need to be overcome in the fight after a common way.
They need to be fully treated so that you can overcome and look forward.
He also assigned to a good conclusion of the conflicts between the Sea limits between Peru and Chile before the Court of Justice and said that it was right to call for Latin America to international instances when both countries are bound to take the judgment, even if it is very hard."
With regard to the possibility that he is candidate for the next presidency elections in Ecuador to reach his third mandate in consequence, he stated that "with much optimism and joy, although sometimes it is very hard."
Correa assured that if he solves the elections in February 2013, he would go back from the political life.
The power has never personally interested me, but in such unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this social poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the faith that I was who guaranteed this likely victory, so I must come to this responsibility," he said.
If I should win, it would be my last period as President, then I'll get back from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"This is decided," he said.
Correa also took the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, relating to Cuba.
I just spoke with the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro. He told me that he was able to go back after the election campaign to Cuba.
"It does not mean a waste in the situation of the President Chávez," said he.
Today, the Ecuadorian State Chair took part in Lima on 6th meetings of the State and Government Heads of the South Americas (Unasur) to participate in a higher regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause for death by AIDS is today a too late recognition
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he confirmed the research result: HIV-positive.
"It was like if a bomb inclined," he said about the moment in which he received the diagnosis that the doctor had not recognized the success "againfully tried."
He hided it before his family.
He decided to take care of his sickness and began to inform about it, and that with such a use he felt just his 43th birthday.
He was unfortunately one of the elders of HIV-unity of the civil de Guadalajara Hospital (HCG), where he came to several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio lives with human immunity virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was difficult for the beginning of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment opportunities and more stigmata.
At the same time, the director of the IMSS's clinic for decided, "because it brought into a sackgase."
The same time AIDS was the synonym for death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with life quality.
However, many people are still coming to the clinic, who have nothing known about their disease and have already been harmed by the virus and has created their immun system, and are victims of opportunistic infection.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported case, "decides the great success today that the survival of a patient who takes the treatment rightly and the survival of general population is equal", said the leader of HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanuva, while he said that this information was based in April this year from a viewed scientific publication.
The Fachmann for Infection diseases and HIV/AIDS, Andrade Villanuva, commented that scientists had concluded that AIDS was not a death penalty but that the years of survival and life of the immunization of the immun system of persons at the start of treatment, and that those greater opportunities would be not dependent on drugs: until 30 years, when you choose from 200 CD4 and 50 years of life, with a currency of 500 CD4.
It's just said, the above outlines mean that whoever has the HIV diagnosis in the age of 25 is positive in this sense, "the problem is 75 years old while he is under control," said this Fachmann.
To be able to secure this progress, it is necessary to recall that the life expectation of the Mexicanians today is average of 76 years.
Although death in the past years has reduced significantly (in Mexico the number of people died at AIDS, from 6.678 cases in 2007 to 4.862 in 2011 (UNSIDA's annual report), it is true that 60 percent of the patients in the national database died.
All in Jalisco died in 2011 255 persons, and until May this year there are already 187 death cases; however, it is ensured that since 2005 there is universal access to antiretroviral medicinal products.
- So why are people still dead?
I think the problem is not the access to treatment.
This is my view, and this is in our hospital.
At least in the past 12 years, we had no medicine-related problems. The problem is that people will come in far-related state because they don't know their infection situation, i.e. in very late phases of disease.
He makes a blocked statement: "News of ten patients come to us when they already have a close infection. In order to affect global mortality, the premature diagnostics are needed, so that all persons in which this is necessary have to be offered massive recognition tests."
In this proposal, the officers and officers of the Council of State de Prevention del Sida and Jalisco (Coesida) (SIDA) (SIDA) and the patients as a factory that carried out his test at a private labor, and that was the only reason why it had made a friend of him, who had already been in the AIDS-Phase, and even the Caposi-Sarcom (other creative tumor) who had a usual complications.
Everything's different if you know you have a AIDS.
Some think they're gonna die, and they want to hear nothing.
"If I have to die, then it's more than three times," they said in my case.
The change was to improve, I approve good, faithful sports and take the medicine.
His parents just know that he had cancers today.
I live a normal life, like all others.
"I work, a lot of enterprises, I have an active but responsible sex life, I look at my health and the other person," says the factory who determined to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to encourage those who have feared today in the world of AIDS Day.
They should test when they are involved in the risk group. Every time they know whether they are positive of HIV, and if they already know the diagnosis, they must learn how you can live as all people are responsible.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condome behind the loading table
Among health programmes and the simple citizen, Ricardo Salazar, journalist of Guadalajara, who took the case of HIV.
And the most important is the prejudice.
In the places of this "will the distribution of Condomen really increased; before they were retained individually, now they give us packages with hundreds that are well, but there are still still people who have no access to a condom," he said.
The risk persons for new infections are numbered by young people.
"What do you need this?" is a wide spot question of social workers, guidance staff in schools, postponents and health systems that do not want young people to take care of them.
He suggested that this ineffective distribution should be reoriented; the condome must not only be found behind the load table, but in public toilettes of institutions that are often visited by youths.
It should not be promoted by promisiveness.
It should not be paid to them the bier and model, as the Governor Emilio González answers whether it would be distributed under his management.
"Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to bring the condome closer to those who already run a sexual activity," he brought it to the point.
Jalisco key data
There are 13.435 cumulated cases (12.158 AIDS and 1.317 HIV).
The State is seen at 4 places of new and collected AIDS figures, and at 13th places in relation to HIV.
92% of the events of ensuring sexual traffic, 6% over blood and 2% pernatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because there are 4 or 5 persons who do not know it.
After the U.S., a sentence confirmed that the restructuring of the Vitro group has not recognized the restructuring of the Vitro liabilities reached by a trade competition in Mexico, an unrealised case for each national enterprises with neighbourhoods in the neighbourhood has created the problem of payment.
It could therefore be said that the procedures for survival of the companies which are adopted by the Mexican law have no validity in the country of Stars and Stripes in relation to international agreements.
The practical recognition of the sentence held on 15 June by the judge Harlin Hale at the court in Bancarrotas for the north district in Texas, in order to ensure that the Mexican undertakings of their ownership are not helpful on the side of the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the most glass producer in Mexico's gate and Tor to call for three inconsistents to the Supreme Court of the United States.
During the judge notes that the believers must submit to the law of competition of the United States, the Professional Governance of the Fifth03) in New Orleans first states that it is the main process of trade negotiations treated in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in proceedings in payability of undertakings with a transnational profile is not known.
In fact, the model law of the United Nations has been established for the reconciliation of international trade law, and the American law Institutes was established as a sharp.
Secondly, the sentence means that without the voices of society after recognition of the competitiveness in the competitive mass that Vitro's Philippines with their mother society would not achieve the necessary majority for restructuring commitments.
However, this opportunity is recognized by the Mexican laws.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case in which this scheme has been approved.
There are a half-seven examples, including Agremex and Commercial Mexico, whose commitments were confirmed under the group of the Federal de Concurses Mercantiles Institute.
In addition, it is true that after the votes of the Philippals, the believers of Vitro, who were compulsored at the courts of the United States against Vitro, the Geier Funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergence, Elliot International and Liverpool Limited had not reached any majority.
The vote would be 45 percent against 37 percent.
This will not be taken into account by the professional office.
On the other hand, Vitro Schuld has been made for its difficult situation since 2008 in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States that had discharged the country.
For this reason, the family González Sada introduces the same vocational authority to ensure the vote in the plenation, which is, by all judges, because only three of them were deleted.
If it is not done, the cecirador's impense is imposed that requests the review of the procedure by a higher institution, in this case by the chief Court of the United States.
In this case, the court has provided a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura friend of the Court (Freund of the Court) which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro under the law on trade competition, and that it is stressed that it had been maintained by the agreements signed by two countries to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States' law.
It will also be pointed out that the country has underlined the principles of the United Nations Commission for International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down for the cases of cross-border payment incompatibility that ensure the comparison of debts and believers.
Double Karambole: a shot for Vitro and the country.

Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life."
The Worldenbummler of the Basketballs, Hector "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to the corbsport for more than 60 years and prepared the whole world.
Some in Puerto Rico have a so large spiritual collection of the history of the country's Basketball story like Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was bound in 2008 to the Roll Statute, Rexes was six years ago part of this sport, as a player of lower classs, players of the first national liga, powerful and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or President of the Basketball Trade.
"My life has been in the Basketball for many guests, even in the same time when I was the president of the BSN, the Chief of the National Society and President of the Contract, in the 1990s, I remembered Reyes at a visit of Pria Hora at home at Bayamón where he lived with Isabel, his faithful marriage for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not overcome with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all with photos and memories of his long carriers and testify them.
Bayamon in the heart
The first emotional memories are those who remember at his time at the Vaqueros from the middle of the 50s of the year to 1982, where he felt his 15-year-old jubileeo as a manager or business manager of the club.
"There were my best years I knew most because I was part of eight masters of Vaqueros since 1967, as a manager, employer or trainer.
There were many full years, including the five masters after each other from 1971 to 1975.
And then I accepted a Mastership in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy at BSN.
From then on the "Cuco" location which was a very good manager," says Reyes.
I still know that Gene Bartow, who worked here as a trainer, was appointed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said, "I have a very powerful and 2 m large player.
Do you want him?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players who had the Puerto Rico ever.
Bartow recommended the Raymond Gausse specialists, who allowed himself to be aborted and one of our best advertisers.
I still know how he said that if Minnie had allowed a Master for Bayamon, the Gausse would provide for another.
The Master of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him but he was already out of a distance because he was already in the upper position of the bond.
At that time, he prevailed to enjoy his comprehensives and the mission in the National Society.
I still know when at the first time, at the beforeolympic tourier in Mexico against the United States.
Then the World Master of 1990, where we explained the fourth place what would really be Bronze, if it had not been the Canadian Seed Guiderichter who reiterated us the last game on the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of the World Sexuality in 1990 the best National Managing you've ever seen?
It is part of the best, as well as those who gained the Olympiade 2004 against the third team.
But my favor is the manager of the Pan American games in Cuba in 1991, where we bound gold and the United States team sent a fight as at the time when they were fighting against us at the Bronze World Mastership.
In those managers, they were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculin (Ortiz) again, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be able to be in 1990 because of a kinnition.
A manager who might not have been the best in relation to personalities, but we had a gold medal and prepared us great joy, was those of the pre-olympic tourist 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Paul Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruit as a replacement for the closed players because of the precommissions on the Panamerican games in Mar del Platt, we fight the gold medaille.
Who was the best player of Puerto Rico?
It was without doubt of Piculin Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tourists are implicit.
No one in Puerto Rico has as dominated as piculine.
And this, without taking into account his road into the different lies in which he played.
Who was the best trainer from Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a series of good trainers like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armanito Torres.
The boys like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think is the best you've reached in the connection?
I was part of the most successful medie of the National Managing Society from 1988 to 1995, which the BSN was the beginning of the 1990s to 17 managers in a saison.
What else will you do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as regionalization of the below categories.
That the boys in Ponce is likely to play in their area and to meet the national playoffs from other kitchens of the island.
The children today make many travels and games unnecessary.
At least I see the result of the prescribed training and courses for trainers, tables and settlers.
I'm angry about this.
What are you doing today?
I like to hear music, see videos of music of my time in YouTube, enjoy my kids and go to a basketball game.
And of course, I enjoy my wife Isabel, who was always on my side.
Larry Hagman's dead.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Wordh (Texas) and was recognized in the world with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". In the televisions of "Dallas", where he played a skrupellos, homestic and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oilmagnat J.R. Ewing in the TV series "Dallas" was dead as a symbol of the Habgier of the 80s.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new staff of "Dallas", died Friday after middle of cancers, according to the press communication of the family at The Asociated Press by Warner Bros., Produced by "Dallas".
"Larry was back to his loved birth city of Dallas, where he played the Iconic role that most pleased him," said the family.
The family of Larry and his best friends were with him in Dallas for the feasts of the Larry.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and consequence, was at Hagman when he died in Dallas's hospital, told her public Jeffrey Lane.
He made all the joy they knew him.
He was creative, great, sweet, white, lovely and talentized, and I'll very disappoint it.
"He was a original person and lived life in full gains," Grey said in a communication.
Hagman was diagnosed in 1992, and he told that he had been drunk over years.
In 1995, a amazing tumor was set in his liver, and he understood a transplantation.
In the years ago "Dallas" Hagman was known in the television as a closer type in the years 1965 to 1970 with the "Bezauverende Jeannie" of the telesehanstalt NBC.
There he played the astronaute Tony Nelson, whose life is put on his head when he tried to be an attractive "Dschin" ( played by Barbara Eden), which will live at home with him.
He was also producers of two comodias that were only expired short time, such as the Good Life (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His kneeworks are well evaluated roles in the "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his mystery interpretation of the sovereignly disappointed J.R., which Hagman made a superstar.
The dramatic series of the CBS TV chain on the Ewing-Clan and other figures in their environments were extracted from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertisement "Who skis on J.R.?", which should create an Episode full emotions where Hagmann was almost killed, has led to an international speculation, and millions of dollars were kept in Wetth's houses.
The series reached a review record at that time.
When the answer was known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen average of 41 million viewers, which had been transformed into the second most vised conversation program since the end of "MASH" 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the weaker of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby).
J.R. had disappeared and drove her to be prostituted if they didn't leave the city, but others had reasons to see him.
Hagman interpreted the role of the Ewing as a corrupt, unrealised man with a charismatic laugh: a backing businessman and unseen husband who then strived to put his alkohol disease to Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what will be on the grave of J.R.," Hagman said 1988.
It should be called "Here calms the beloved citizens J.R. Ewing".
This is the only business he didn't win.
Victoria Principal, the middle of the original series, remembered Hagman on Friday as a "andornal personality and outside the screen".
He is for millions of teachers in the world unbelievable and unsearchable and remains us who have had the luck to know him and to love him, get in our hearts.
Two episodes of the new exit of "Dallas" were exposed for a few months ago with a great success in the TV-channel TNT.
The adoption of five chapters for the second staff was completed, and a sixth chapter was exactly translated, informed the sender.
There was no immediate statement on how the loss of Hagmann would be treated in the series.
He was born in Fort Wordh, Texas, who was the son of the player and Sänger Mary Martin, classic works like "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a young man when she got Larry during her marriage with the lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck to the theatre offices in New York the beginning of the 50s, and he served from 1952 to 1956 in the airway forces in England.
There he learned the young designer Maj Axelsson and married them.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived long time in the California city of Malibu, where many Berühmtheers had their residence.
2001 he titled his memeans "Hello Darlin: Tall (and indeed True) Tales about My Life."
"I haven't written anything of what I believed that it was damaged to someone or could affect him on any wise," said the Associated Press at his time.
After the Leber Transplantation, he was used for levership dependents and worked as voluntary in a hospital to assist patients.
"I pray them, give them comfort, I talk with them when their operations are going to go and then," he said 1996.
I want to stop some comfort, like, "It's no fear that it's a little unbelievable the first time, but it's gonna be good to you."
He also took part in several campaigns.
The beginning of the course, which studies the "End of the world"
Every week, students are studied with apocalyptic topics such as atomic war, Zombie, Virus and Keime, and the global strengthening.
Each semester, when the professor of the religious decided to stop a course over the end of the world, he knew that he had an unreasonable affair: the end of the "lang backing" of the Maya calendar on 21 December, of which many believed that it was the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what should wait for him in the following two months: the destructionist Hurrikan Sandy, which has described some as "Deudarmaggedon", and a growing conflict under the participation of Israel, the place where Christian theories believe that the apocalyps starts.
"I have not seen that this will be the most apocalyptic semester that has ever been", said Charmé to students at the University of Rutgers (New Jersey).
If someone analyzes what happened today in the world, as if we were going to disappear for thirty days, this would be a really good period.
And he remembers that evil is good for those with apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor that has to be the last in history, which offers courses on the "the end of the world".
In Temple, the assistant professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, culture and the end of the world".
Every week, students are studied with apocalyptic topics such as atomic war, Zombie, Virus and Keime, and the global strengthening.
"We analyze, why these ideas are extended to the time," said he, as well as how hypothetic scenaries are offered to a certain manner of mankind.
If nuclear material is requested in the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could be dismissed.
This month, student films analyzed as apocalyptic content and studied how they had made comparison with the real life.
"I've tried to inform the students whatever the possibility is likely to be reliable and unable," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari has created a team for artistic history and anthropology to offer a course with the slight name "The end of the world".
"We don't take up 2012 so we always keep the option to stop the course again, for the case that the world is not undertaken," said Restall.
In spite of the "proceedings" the students must study, create projects and participate in complete tests.
In Penn State, the final audit will be carried out at the presence of the Apokalypsis, so the students have no other opportunity to work as "to continue the night where the world is well going to end", said Reinstall.
The courses were very loved.
"In two hours there were no places more," Restall said about his course for students with high average, who filled 35 students.
We received e-mails from students who asked whether they were still free.
The students will ensure that the cure is counting to the interests.
"It's fascious to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers Chamber for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sectality or religiousity is in fact only a question of drought or its lack.
The 25-year student Will Wekesa for Psychology and hospitals explains that all the apocalyptic films have been seen.
"I haven't heard anything of a teach where this is teaching," he said.
I like it.
But no of the students asked - and less a professor explained to believe the last date of December 21.
"Our first project treated the prophecy of the Mayas, and in some way we discuss it," said Julie Zeglen, student in the last year in Temple, 21 years and West Chester.
The Mayas never told the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
However, he notes that the West Society is an apocalyptic fear that reiterates several centuries when people reacted to changes in their environment with the priority of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"And the other way people don't think so," he said.
This is mainly in the English world of the case.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of the University of La Salle, who teachs the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question whether he would know a course about the "the end of the world".
"The Philippines don't participate in the end of the world," he wrote as an enthusiasm to an exception of a higher institution.
We have a condemnation from Daddy.
Restall suggested that many days were spoken by the last court, and said that if on 21 December nothing happens, "the people are immediately thinking about a new date" or philosophized that the 21 December of the beginning of a seven-year period was the end of the world.
Students and Professors take this date easy.
More people said they want to go to feasts about the end of the world.
"I probably call a few friends to weep together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old student for communications.
