In terms of exchange, the boundary of Prague in the negative
After Tuesday craft, Prague's breakfast reactivates his losses.
Transactions with actions have almost half of the usual daily trade.
Mardi, from the beginning of exchange, the bourge of Prague renua with her shot of the veil, when she lost almost six percent.
This time, the decline is due to the fall of actions in Wall Street.
The reaction of the market is the result of the vote of the American representatives' Chamber, which refuses to adopt the state-up plan of the American financial sector, is also sensitive.
Case of actions in Asia
Asian borses lived on Tuesday a dramatic crack, even though indices succeeded, during the day, to make a part of the losses.
The Hang Sing Independence of the Hungkong boundary lost four percent during exchange, but later he reduced a part of loss and reduced the reduction of approximately 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises after the movement of Chinese actions from Hongkong lost 3,8 percent, the markets were closed in Shanghai.
Sydney's ship was lost more than five percent, but finally it had been achieved to reduce losses to 4.3 percent.
According to its index, the Bourse of Taiwan lost 3,6 percent.
"The exhibition on the rescue action to the US will affect the financial markets of the whole world," comment Joseph Yam, head of the monetary office of Hong Kong.
Although Hong Kong is part of China, he established its own currency policy, which is independent of the Chinese Central Bank.
The interest rates have the same level as the United States.
According to the first Minister of Australia, Kevin Rudd, American lawyers should rapidly resume negotiations and adopt the financial support proposal.
In other words, other countries would be risked by the implications.
Blood of American actions
Lundi, the United States Representative Chamber rejected the draft support of the financial system to which it had to be devoted up to $700 billion ($12 bilances of Kč).
Thus the lawyers refused the appeal to support the draft President George Bush.
According to Bush, the project should resume the main causes of financial crisis and help to stabilize the whole economy.
American actions live, Monday, a blood bath and the main action indicators have known the greatest categor in the last 20 years.
The Dow Jones indicator lost about 7 percent, with a shot of such insurgence for the last time in 1987.
The indicator was already lost during the vote, but when it appeared that the proposal was not adopted, it was in free loop.
The Czech Congress: The United States Government can inject $700 billion in the banks
The Heads of the American Congress and the Government of President George W. Bush agreed on a broader form of the financial assistance agreement to the American financial system.
It will be submitted to the vote at the beginning of the next week.
American lawyers made a decision-making tour in the preparations on the adoption of a rescue plan in the form of a financial assistance of $700 billion ($12 billion) granted to the US financial system.
Success is not so safe.
The Congressmans must end a number of details of the agreement before the final version of the law and submit it to the vote.
The financial support plan will be reviewed Monday in the Representative Chamber.
This Sunday to Agent Reuters Barney Frank, the Chairman of the Committee on Bank and Financial Rules of the Chamber.
According to the sources, the plan should be given priority to the vote to the Senate.
According to the economics, the announcement of the fact that the saving plan should be a first major psychological factor to raise financial markets.
But, given the complexity of mechanisms through which market aid can be effective, it will follow a "dessillusion".
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have achieved a great progress.
We have regulated our divergent views on the form that should have the package of market stability measures," the Bloomberg Agency confided the Democracy Nancy Pelosi.
The final vote could be done since Sunday.
On Saturday night on Sunday, representatives of the lawyers met the Minister of American Finances Henry Paulson in order to give the government a final form.
It should buy, at financial companies, inventive real estates that lead financial enterprises to considerable losses and threaten the system’s stability in its entirety.
"We are on the point to agree on a plan that will function and which must also be effective on the market.
It is still needed to continue this market restoration plan, but I think we're there", said Paulson.
A signal for Asian exchange
World financial crisis has considerable impacts on action markets.
According to the Democratic Senator, he has not evacuated Harry Reid, the legislators so that the Congress had conducted a definitive agreement on Sunday.
They want to calm the investors before the starting of the Asian financial markets, which are located in the first hour area, where the Congress' decision could affect Monday exchanges.
However, it is not possible to precise with certainty when the two American Congress Chambers will proceed to the vote or if negotiations can not be blocked at the last time by such or problems.
The legislators hope that it will be adopted during the coming days.
Nevertheless, the law will still know more changes.
The total amount intended for the system must be divided in two parties.
The first $350 billion, as President George Bush wished, must be available as soon as possible.
However, if the Congress will have the impression that the programme does not fulfil its function, it has the possibility of blocking the allocation of the remaining amount, following two steps: first $100 billion and then $350 billion.
Mr. Bush welcomed progress in negotiations
Although the President could put its attention to this decision, the Congress has the opportunity to put it in minority.
Despite these amendments, the main idea of the programme, which consists of obtaining financial funds for the exchange of the bad real estates, including the chuta value, because hundreds of thousands of United States are not able to pay their hypotheks, was maintained.
"All the work is done.
The Chamber of Representatives should be able to proceed on Tuesday to the vote of the law, and the Senate of Monday," said the Republic Senator Judd Gregg.
The President George Bush is himself content of the progress in the negotiations.
His carrier Tony Fratto explains that Mr. Bush was content of the progress made on the same day and appreciated "the bipartite effort to establish our financial markets and protect our economy."
Double parachutes Limitation
The President of the Headquarters of the Senat Christopher Dodd Committee said that the lawyers agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of the contributions against loss, the degradation agreement, the removal of the time axis plan.
The new Law also provides the limitation of duplicated parachutes for the directors of companies participating in the programme and establishing a committee, which will ensure the monitoring of the Fund.
This should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We worked very hard on the question and have made important progress towards an agreement that will go and be effective for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan also provides aid for real estate owners who have problems to pay.
The Government should negotiate new agreements in the case of hypothecs that it will raise, while reducing debts monthly and allowing those to keep their homes.
Marek: Psychological assistance
According to Patria Finance David Marek, the proposed plan is a good idea, but its achievement will be very difficult.
"And it was necessary that the mechanism and the price of the removal of stakeholders would be ignored.
This will be determined to share the losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, at the iHNed.cz server.
If the plan is now adopted, or at the beginning of the next week, it is not, according to Marek, so important as it is.
"There is much more important than the congress are agreed since this week, that they support this plan and will conceive it as early as possible.
This psychological significance of the agreement, preveding the plan, is most important than at this time," said Marek.
External fight: MP3 readers against mobiles.
We will advise you, how to choose
While practically all mobiles can read MP3 files, no MP3 reader can be phoned.
It seems to be clear that it's better to buy just a phone.
There is sufficient reasons to provide an independent reader.
The entire choice depends on the use mode and the requirements of the future ownership.
It would be absurd to buy for the house a cooler of high game graphics to put the new maximum Turbulenc album.
On the one hand, such musical products are not coming on wine disk, and, in the view of quality, there is no objective reason for this.
But, if there are in your daytimes of wine drives, with rock art, jazz or blue, you'll be dreaming at least of such a gramophone.
It is also music during movements, i.e. the compressed music, to say it easily - from music in MP3.
There also there are categories in charge of price and quality.
For one, it may be unacceptable to pay eight thousand krones for a reader, as one of the Pink Floyd fans would have been bad to support hearers bought for twenty-quarters in the market.
Here are two extreme, including there's enough place for everyone.
The choice is wide.
Battery life is also decisive
Some players of high gamme music are capable of much more things than a simple music read, but it is not known functions, obviously, of most of the mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the telephone.
Besides the first functions, the phone calls and SMS calls, it is able to read music and films, to save these films, it has a variable quality photo device and, for example, can be able to serve the navigation.
And if you're taking into account the Smartphones and communications, you'll have a small computer in your kitchen.
Since none of a corporate can grumble the flesh and no television will take photographs, we are practically assisting a miracle.
However, the universal character of the mobile is not without inconvenience.
More the number of functions you use is large, more the intervalle between two downloads will be reduced.
And the reading of the music is one of the most important energetics.
Sound rarely the mobiles that are capable of reading music for 10 to 12 hours, in most of the cases, this figure is very lower.
In this regard, music readers (specially the most rudimentary) are more practical.
In the case of good market mobiles, consider that they will play music only for a few hours.
If, further, you're going to call for time in time, try, to be sure, a second reload for work - this is even valid for the slightest devices.
The problem will not be made for MP3 readers, which are capable, after uploading, of a continuing operation of at least 9 hours, including less performing.
Another problem happens in the recording of music in the mobile.
Unfortunately, a limited part of the devices have a USB-universe connection, while more than all can't be connected directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course, you can store music directly on the memory card, but few card readers can take it without reduction, as data the small sizes of memory cards used in mobiles.
With regard to the readers, you don't need, except an exception (iPod), of any software.
It's enough to fill through the USB connector the music device from the computer.
Most mobiles and readers will create themselves a media library classified according to the name of the interpretation, the title of the album, style, or then after the judgement of the user.
Some devices show only an index with a tree structure, in the way the Windows Explore, others are capable of both (river, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent telephones with operative system).
Readers are easier to manipulate, mobiles have more knowledge.
In the choice of a concrete device, take particularly interest in the life of the accumulator, memory capacity, quality and exit type and, of course, easy of the command.
If the music is, mainly, a background sound and if in the day you are going to listen that for a limited time, for example, taking the tram, it's enough for any mobile reading MP3.
Practicely all mobiles today are capable.
You are not even obliged to take attention to music formats that the mobile or reader is able to read.
All are coming to read the MP3 and the great majority of the music that will happen until you just have this format.
It is part of the most widespread formats and partly of it, most of the devices also read from the WMA music format.
The AAC (format used by the Apple and iPod), as it is, is less current.
High Game mobiles also allow, for example, the acquis of music online.
It's enough to visit, since the portable phone, the operator's web pages (or those of another provider) corresponding and buy the song or the album concerned.
This service should only be a convincing reason to provide a musical mobile.
The offer of operators is unfortunately miserable and, in most of the cases, it is limited to speed tubes.
The prices are not lower.
Nevertheless, it is generally considered that this way to buy music (which by GSM, Internet, even by the Internet without collapse) will manage the music industry in the future.
Most people always bring their mobile on themselves.
Every time you want to listen to something, you only have to get out of your pocket mobile, while you forgot your MP3 reader to the house.
But it's also important if you've always got an earlier or a free hand with.
If that is not the case, you can use the integrated weddings, which is practically using all mobiles, but a minimum of MP3 readers.
For many, the main advantage of music mobiles is their price.
The lowerest costs normally less than three thousand.
For a price of three thousand curons, we can have a walkman already very convenient.
But, most of the cases, you will be limited by the absence of output for ordinary hearers.
The price of the best telephones and the best designed, may also be a entry for ordinary hearers, does not exceed 15 thousand.
The readers are contrary to have a easy command.
In fact, anybody comes to ensure the command of the most rudimentary readers - who do not correspond to the least sweet (see our choice).
A minimum of functions; and the comparison of the command with the position of a box, cutly used in the past, or a grapher, is evident.
There is no risk of collection in the form of a mobile Internet radiated by hazard, followed by an immense data transfer factor.
Select this device
Even the less sweet mobiles (e.g. Vodafonne 527 generally contains a slot for exchanged memory cards (type M2, microSD, and so later).
Even taking into account the additional purchase of such a card, you will not exceed two thousand krones.
But look at you.
Basic models are in principle only supporting cards with a maximum of 2 GB.
Only the lovers are even with memory cards of 8 GB.
If you already have a mobile and you want to buy a good MP3 market player, take a Cowon, a Creative, a Sony, a Samsung, a Emgeton, or a iriver.
Based on capacity (max. 2 GB), you must not exempt over 1 100 krones.
If you are part of the most requesting hearers, choose more specialized mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices are long of independent command touchs for MP3, and so the layout of the command is closed to the MP3-dependent reader.
Sony Ericsson, whose motors of walkman series have the same user menu as MP3 readers separately sold, is the most farest in this area.
The same service, in the same price category, but with a memory capacity (year 16 GB) and a lifetime of the acquirer (normally 15 hours, up to 35 hours) is ensured by a MP3 reader produced by one of the above marks.
A first virtual operator will win Czech in this year itself.
Maybe
The mobile market in Czechya is relatively developed, and our operators are practically proposing the same services as their partners in Western Europe.
Despite this, it lacks us all the same - a virtual operator, who would force classic operators to lower prices.
He can't miss for a long time.
We have already mentioned on Mobile.cc the fact that Tsk operators are part of the most slightest in Europe.
The Czech Office of Telecommunications, which reported that the price of a SMS was higher in us than in the rest of the Union, has confirmed it.
This is why, in accordance with the latest steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming recurrence, a paradoxal situation to happen — the SMSs sent from the foreign will be for some clients of the lower Two mobile operators than in the country.
How is it possible that prices in Czech Republic are so high, compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there is a lack of competition that would really want to enter into the fight.
This can appear to paradoxal, since we have even three mobile networks and a proportion that exceeds the 100% widely.
In contrast, the mobile operators like to complain that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this way, Pavel Dvoak, the Chairman of the Czech Office of Telecommunications, who said to several replies that in Tzechkie there was no place for another operator, made chorus with the operators.
It is likely that a classic operator with his own network has apparently much luck (and now it would only find difficult frequency).
But there is still a possibility - a virtual operator.
It is just the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market which has brought a significant decline of prices to which the classic operators should also be reacted.
However, before the entrance of troubles, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile on the market, voices like those today's at home have been left to hear in Great Britain.
But it appeared that he remained from the place for such operators and that they could have a real success.
We are not obliged to go looking for too far to find examples.
On February month, we had informed you about the launching in Poland of Virtual Mobilking.
In only six months, this operator has been able to gain more than 100 thousand clients and to become the fifth operator of the country.
Let's add that behind the Mobilking, there is the Penta Financial Group, which is located between others from the U:fon in Czech Republic.
The benefit of virtual operators is the opportunity to focus on a more concrete group.
In order to be effective, they need much less clients than a classic operator.
They are indeed exempted from construction, operation and components of the mobile network relatively high.
So in the world, virtual operators are profiled as lower cost operators - they offer calls and good SMS market, which is often contrary to a limited service offer.
For example, Tesco Mobile offers SMS at least two less than its competitors.
But, as the example of mobility in Poland shows, put on an inhabitant target group can also be a good cause of publicity.
In fact, this operator sees specifically the men.
"The real men choose motive - an operator that will be pleased to them and to whom they can trust", said David Seibert, the CEO de Mobile Entertainment Company, operating this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if such a concept would be able to walk at us too.
Miroslav ≥epický, Vodafone port, certainly: "The Czech market is relatively small for a segmentary approach, on which most virtual operators are based.
As far as it is relatively saturated from the point of view of service offer."
In Czech Republic, no chance, the mobile operators say
However, it seems almost sure that if there is a virtual operator in Czechya, it will not be mobile.
"We discuss the extension of this successful project, but the negotiations are not very promoting.
The starting of Mobilking will be placed in other countries of our area," he said in a telephone interaction for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková, a port of the Penta financial group.
It has so indirectly confirmed that the operators in Czech Republic, in any case, were not favourable to this idea.
Nevertheless, they are trying to make them all possible so that a competitor can not appear.
The GTS Novera group, who would like to translate a new step in order to become a real telephone concurrent in the business customers area, does not hide, for a long time, its intention to launch a virtual operator.
"We are much to be able to propose our customers not only fixed telecommunication services, but also mobile.
And the early one will be the best.
We have already conducted negotiations on this possibility for several reprises with all Tschech mobile operators.
With some, we have been able to progress in the negotiations," said the Pavel Kaidl Group.
The future may therefore be promised.
According to non-official information, it seems that we may be able to acquire the first virtual operator already in the end of the year.
But for the moment, his creation is accompanied by a total silence.
"There is not that there is place on the Czech market for a virtual operator as such.
The Czech market is in comparison with other very specific.
For the present, no subject of a complex and serious project in this area has been contacted us," mentioned Vlastimil Mršeć of the Telephone press department, in his statement for Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
The T-Mobile Martina Kemrová port states in a rare intensity with the declaration of O2: "We have not registered for the moment of viable and bilaterally advantageful project, which could serve as a basis."
And added, "It is practically excluded that a virtual operator would be shown in the T-Mobile network from here the end of the year.
To operate in a so limited time laptop, we should have a concrete agreement since now."
Vodafone is rather directing its attention on the achievement of requests to obtain its own 3G licence.
Miroslav íepický reported: "We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the field of shared costs and infrastructure.
This is what, according to us, means the most appendix of the client's view point.
The main Vodafone strategy in this area is the discovery of a partner to establish a common network for a fast mobile Internet."
Responsible authorities: in phase with operators
The starting of mobile operators is easily understandable, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to a decrease of prices and therefore to a decrease of their benefit.
What is therefore good to facilitate the achievement of such a competitive?
When it is their interests, the operators can hear it as pearls in pearls, and the Chicany is accompaniing the creation of the U:Fonon also tests.
The most apparent pressure on the U:phun has been performed by the T-Mobile Society.
Showing accessible information to the public removed web pages of the μTU.
But today, U:fon is ready to serve as an argument to accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted the subject: "The mobile market competition was also recently facilitated by the entry on the market of a fourth mobile operator.
In view of the character of the mobile market in RT, it is clear that the entry of an additional player is submited, and especially its services, at high requirements."
But given the attitude of the mobile operators that are, the identity of the Czech regulation agencies appears declined.
However, it is not only the attitude of the μTU, which, in contrast to the Great Britain and other developed countries, is unfortunately not, in Czechya, the power of intervening in economic competition.
It is exclusively part of the Economic Competition Office (UOHS).
But the last adopted, in the face of this problem, its typical position.
"The entry of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible to follow the conclusion of a agreement between a mobile operator and the virtual operator concerned on the location of the necessary infrastructure.
No agreement of this type has been concluded at this time, since the offer of potential interests has not been given sufficiently interest for classic operators," he stated in response to our question, Christian Chalupa, from the Department of external relations of UOHS.
A formulated statement would therefore not be surprised by the representatives of the operators.
However, from a office, which must represent the interests of consumers, and among others also take care, if no person benefits of its position on the market, such a declaration is more than deployant.
As far as Christian Chalupa adds: "In the foreign, where virtual operators are normally present, they may be found that their entry on the market has contributed to a decrease of the prices of mobile telephone services."
However, pressure in the sense of a fair market function and decrease of prices apparently does not be part of the interests of the UOHS.
What is actually cooking, is almost touching the three mobile operators, which disappears from their reactions.
The question, if this is really a disappearance, is of course.
In the same way, a strictly identical price for all service stations is strictly due to the damage and hard fight of competition.
"The office has, in this regard, not raised signs of an anti-comprehensive behaviour, so there is no reason to intervenir in a way or in another.
No of the operators have a dominant position, there is therefore an increased responsibilities in the market behaviour.
The tools required for the opening of the mobile market to virtual operators are probably missed by the telecommunications regulator, as indicated in its Kaloupa statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many points of discussion.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets developed by the NATU, as the telecommunications represents a single market point of economic competition.
No Tschech operators have a dominant position on that market.
However, some of the law experts propose another vision of things: so that the establishment of a virtual operator may be possible, the consent of a network operator must be obtained every time.
And the mobile operator has sufficiently monopol on his network.
It is so that it is necessary to play a dominant role in a segment of its activity.
However, even without admitting this argument, it should be at least worried for UOHS that three mobile operators appear in a similar way.
However, the complaints of many stakeholders (including the GTS Novera, already mentioned) show that they face, in negotiations with all operators, similar restrictions.
The resolve the responsibilities on the μTU is a sufficiently current tour in communications, through which UOHS is bound the hands of the case.
We already met this kind of attitude in several similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to take place in the renovation of the Telecommunications Act, which was recently adopted, to expand the powers of the OECD on the field of economic competition in telecommunications, although many specialists promised an improvement of the situation.
This, representatives of UOHS must be very well known, but their interests are apparently a part.
When nobody looks, it can walk
This says that the function of a kind of virtual pseudo operators, several in the Czech mobile networks, remains inspective.
It is undertakings which publish their own list of mobile telephone services, but they are only public.
In most cases, it is a question of firms in the multi-level marketing.
Specified mobile telephone services are thus proposed by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and well others.
The price lists of these firms usually happen to the election.
The magie tour consists of the fact that the company has done before the operator is a classic business client, which commands a large number of cards SIM.
As a important client, it has special price offers (and others).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibite such return.
"If it had been what you said, it could be a crime of the contractual conditions we would consider and which could lead to a census of cooperation with the concerned society," answered our question regarding this problem Martina Kemrová.
Nevertheless, it is quite likely that an echo of such activity has not occurred to the responsible of mobile operators.
In the case of the three undertakings mentioned, it may be thousands of customers.
However, there is no operator against such proceedings.
In fact, the activities of these companies provide non-legable benefits and, at the same time, by opposition to real virtual operators, they do not threat them at all with their own official marketing.
Miroslav íepický indicates possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however, the services of these companies are used only by a percentage of clients that are negative.
Furthermore, these are contrary to admit that the SIM card in their phone is not registered under their name, so they can't be fully disposed of it, as ordinary customers of mobile operators."
But this is exactly what should appear straightly to the NACH.
Moreover, there is a question to the UOHS.
If mobile operators feed their eyes on such a procedure, why can they block the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the UOHS has relatively widespread powers to be able to deliver such a activity, and if it would not be able to make an explanation of the operators, which claims that it would happen, their contractual conditions, interdisting it.
When we will not be the worst country
As we have already mentioned several times, the entry of virtual operators on the mobile market has resulted in a significant decline of the services price.
However, practically in all countries where virtual operators had appreciated, classic operators had been struggling, so soon less, to prevent their creation.
The arguments used by these last were practically the same - a too small market, even too saturated, problems with quality of services, etc.
However, it is precisely at this level that, in developed countries, regulators, who defended not the interests of mobile operators but their customers.
As well as by formal measures and by informal pressure, they have ended to obtain the creation of a first virtual operator, followed by others.
Unfortunately, Tschech regulatory organizations address this issue in the way of a warm land threshold which is moved to a close goal.
Following the experiences we have, we can't leave the impression that the confusion in the skills is in these cases more than profitable.
But don't throw the lack after the gentleman.
If the culinary information say true and a virtual operator will soon appear at us, the Czech mobile market may be moved.
If one of the operators accepted the creation of a virtual mobile operator, UOHS may only be difficult to remain imposable to the rejection (in discrimination) of other interests.
And we may stop calling better than the rest of Europe.
The new Hymne has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to the four achievements of the new version of the Czech National Hymne.
Sunday, at the occasion of the Tsk Nationality Day, the first Minister Mirek Topolanek presented the new records of the national Kde homev m月j (Where is my patria?).
The hymne was again registered by the orchester of the National Theatre under the direction of Jihí B月lohlavek.
We have four versions - with a single male or female song, a interpretation with cold and a instrumental version.
The song is assured by Kateãina Kn月ínková and Adam Plachetka.
Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček are the authors of the hymne arrangements.
You can listen to the four new versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bålohlavek considers the Czech National Song as one of the most beautiful hymnes.
As he had already confided before the Rozhlas (the Czech Public Radio), he chose for the interpretation of versions only of the songs with young and representatives, which are marked and appreciated.
"After the beginning, I tried to take care of what the two cantors, as well as the chief, had a good word, so that the words might be well understood, that they sound simultaneously," said he.
Tschech National Hymne will celebrate the next year of its 175th anniversary.
Kde housev m月j retained for the first time in 1834 on Stavovské divadlo (the Teatre of State) in Fidlovačka, the original Czech of Josef Caetán Tyl, accompanied by the music of František Chrroup.
It has become popular and people have spontanly made it.
After the creation of the Czechoslaovaquie in 1918, the first couple became naturally an integral part of the national hymne.
It will delay one of the seven national symbols even after the creation of the independent Czech Republic.
How the new sounds hymn
Common Transport (MHD) Pragues will introduce, Friday, push in their balance system
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, it will be included in the history of Praiský Dopravní podnik (the Praguean Transport Agency) as the date they will go to the metro, trams and buss, which will, instead of having a cart in paper, will have an electronic coupon in their pocket.
At this time, this last is accessible for at least a hundred thousand people, owners of the Opencard card.
Passengers can buy a kit 30 days or 90 days (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the time to write it on their card in the information points and offices of the Dopravní podnik (the 'Agency' of Transport) situated in the Mádraí Holešovice stations, Nadraí Holeovice, and Once, Roztyly, Lesaany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
From yesterday, there is also a possibility of buying web cubes on the web pages of Dopravní podnik: www.dpp.cz.
More than four hundred people benefited from service during the morning.
Those who start to use the online magazine can finally forget tickets in the metro stations, where they had to feed in long cuts in the purpose of obtaining card tickets.
Indeed, they will buy their card by Internet and record it on their Opencard card in one of the thirty Måstská knihovna ( municipal libraries).
"In these points, there is a curtain with a formed staff, which will help interests with the purchase by the Internet and will also record the card they bought on their card," said the port of the project Martin Opatrý.
Besides the libraries, it will also be possible to save the Opencard e-mails in automatic distributors installed in the area of several metro stations.
What does these distributors look like?
They're red, remembering the machines to combine the tickets and passengers may have already noted them in the metro Roztyly, Bud月jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Today, the city in five, but from here the end of the year, it should be four-eighteenth there," added Opatrný.
A automatic controls the cup at the heating place
Autos that will work from tomorrow are easy to use.
It's enough to enter the Opencard pocket card and the buyed cut previously will store himself on the card.
Electronic cups are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in the area of the city.
In the petrol trains and bus lines of 300-499, which mainly uses the inhabitants of the Central Bohem communities to access capital.
"In the integrated trains in Praiská integrovaná doprava ( Integrated Prague transporters), the controllers are equipped from card readers, with the help of those they establish temporary and local cash validity;" explained the control of the Philipp Drápal bills of the Ropid Organization, which acquire the times of transport in common practice.
The petrol buss are equipped with card readers in the chauffeur cake.
Thus, in the boat it is necessary not only to show the shopping card, but also put the Opencard on the place specified on the side of the box.
This is how the chauffer controls the validity of recorded cubes.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the recorded coupons, there is nothing more simple than asking this information to the chauffeur," complemented Drápal.
Passengers who do not take penurial bus and will not remember the date where the validity of their coupon is expired, can rejoin the automatic distributors, initially used to store the cards.

Sudden claimed a referendum to the United States
The Swedish Germans asked in 1945 about the integration of the United States in the United States.
This declines a letter set in the collections of Jihočeská v diedecká knihovna (The scientific Library of the Bohme of South).
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we would like to live at least under the United States Patroon.
In 1945, some groups of Southern Germans were predominantly addressed to the President of the United States with such an desire.
This disappears between another letter reserved in a private archive, which is today placed in the collections of Jihočeská v diedecká knihovna.
The Germans of the U.S. Krumlov shall not allow the President of the United States to allow "šumavská ≤upa" (Regio of forests south of the Bohme) - annexed by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - to the Czechoslovakia.
"We are aware of the situation and we want to be sure that the words proclaim that the American troops come on the German territory not in oppressors and enemies, but in Liberators," is written in the letter, signed "Persones, whose sort of the Šumva stands in heart."
Since Czechoslovakia’s railway is not promised - knowing the national Czech character - that brutality, disastrous attitude, incomprehension, oppression and servicity, the authors of the letter ask the President of the United States to take into his hand the protector of the Šumva for now and forever.
"We can't believe that you will grant this territory to a foreign State to us, which affects and destroys minorities and has not contributed to the victory of the Allieds without taking into account the view of the four million inhabitants," is written in the letter.
The claimed reason for which authors cannot sign the letter is the fear of the desire of vengeance of "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States had learned the opinion of the Germans in âumava, it would only be to organize, according to the authors of the letter, a referendum in the region to establish whether its inhabitants would wish to be part of the United States or to live under the United States patroular.
Although the text contained in the letter may, taking into account the current knowledge of the history of the next war, appear a little naïf, according to some survivors, it illustrates the expectations of the Southern Germans in the time.
While the Czech Germans should at least interfere that the question of their expulsion of the Republic would be, very little of them had been such a possibility.
Some expected that the United States and the Great Britain would get a certain type of autonomie for the South.
Others believed they would just stay in Czechoslovakia.
The famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born to 周eské Bud Øjovice, confirms it.
During the war, he was, as the German of Bud-Jovice, engaged in the sea in the Baltes countries.
When at the end of the war, he was captured by the English and placed in the Holstein region capture camp, the tens of the Czech Germans came to consult him to learn the cheque.
"They believed that once returning to them, the cheque would be profitable to them," said Kalupa.
None of the Germans who lived in Czechoslovakia before the war was expected, according to the Beneš Decrees, he would be expulsed from the Republic.
You don't think - you're thirsty!
A motivated campaign will attack leaders
Action towards road safety the most costful in the Czech history.
A way to characterize the Mediterranean campaign only in the intention of launching the ministry, the Department of Transport.
The office of the Minister Aleš ◆ebíček believes that it will encourage the conductors of a dangerous behaviour to the flight.
This campaign costs 150 million will appear to television, radio, cinem, Internet, but also to treats.
It should encourage the drivers of the speed and alcool to the flower.
But also remind them to take the census before starting.
In particular, she wants to touch the conscience of young leaders, motards, pitons, without forgeting professional leaders.
What's going on in the spots?
Over the personal stories that will attack emotions.
The Slogan "sanglant" of the whole campaign is also proclaimed:
You don't think - you're thirsty!
The phrase "You don't think" is included in majuscules on the immatriculation plate.
Then, in a blood flacon, there's the phrase "You're pairs".
What should symbolize that you can pay life a moment of attention.
The spots are "hair" the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry has inspired similar campaigns in the English-saxos countries, where there can be a common view of images with drastic images of the victims of accidents.
It believes that this will lead to a decrease of incident rates and the number of deaths on the Czech paths.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
The Sugar and Food Strategy against conductors
"What walks with the conductors is the system of sugar and fouet.
For them, the sugar is represented, for example, by winning time, when they cry red fire.
The fouet is the threat of a amendment or accident.
The risks must be recalled to the leaders," said Martin Koćán, the psychologist of transporting the hospital Na Homolce.
This is how we need information campaigns in press and especially negative publicities, thinking psychologists.
The panels reporting the danger of conductors are already less effective.
"When a statistical panel which keeps care of a danger is installed, it is likely to smoke with the environment, and the conductors will not be remarked", said Ko'án.
Olmert would make peace exchange almost all occupied territories
Ehud Olmert, the President of the Provisional Government of Israel, was proposed in favour of all the territories occupied in 1967, including the Czech Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Heights of Golan, in the exchange of peace with Palestine and Syria.
He made this statement in an interview published on Monday by the Yedioth Ahronth daily.
"We must go to an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to make almost all the territorys (employed), see all," said Olmert to the daily.
"We will keep a certain percentage of the territory, but we should give the Palestinians a similar percentage (in Israeli territory) because peace will not be", added he.
It admits the possible refund to Jerusalem-Est.
"Whoever desires the security in Jerusalem, and especially doesn't want the tractors and bulldoers to write to him the feet, as it has happened to one of my best friends, it will have to refuse the parts of Jerusalem," said Olmert, encouraging the two attacks in the city, in July, in which many people were killed and tens of people wounded.
According to the first Minister, it will be necessary to find "a special solution for the Mont of the Temple, the holy and historical places" located within the Vieille City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the whole city will be involved in 270,000 Arabs.
It will not work," he pointed out.
Golan Height Related
Olmert also was proposed for the retirement of Israel of the Heights of Golan, which is, according to it, an essential condition for the conclusion of a peace agreement with Syria.
This would also need some efforts from Damascus.
"I don't propose to conclude peace with Syria only on the basis of a past of Golan," said he.
"Sirians are very well knowing what they're gonna have to refuse to get Golan.
They will want to reject their current relations with Iran; they will have to reject their relations with Hizbollah (chiefly Chief); they will want to refuse to constant support that they grant the Hamas terrorism (mobilely chiite), Al-Kaida (Terrorism Rio), as well as the Djihad (Saint War) in Irak," said the first minister.
Questions after the incident: Are the stewards in the car are illegal?
The law will ignore them; walk in a long distance is prohibited
In the context of the tragic accident of the company of the Student Agency near Padou, Italy, the question is whether stewards and passengers can move during the trajet within the car.
"If we want to respect the law of a steward, a steward activity is contrary to the road movement law," said the Portal of the Department of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The incident in question, during which a 22-year-old host, was apparently caused by the driver of a train that crowded the way of the car.
The young girl was at this moment unfortunately sitting by the chamber, on the most dangerous seat of the vehicle, although she had two other seats.
But the car can have an accident, even swimming in a brush way, even when the steward serves the coffee or distributes the newspapers.
What matter is, it is if the car is under its technical fiber equipped with debt places or not.
If this equipment for places is not homologized, passengers must stay sit down.
The long distance of the Student Agency is not available in places; that has been confirmed in update.cz by the director of the Radim Jančura company.
"There is a question we have discussed with the Ministry and at the beginning he prohibited all movements of passengers.
Then they canceled it and we got that passengers can go to the toilettes during the trajet, provided that they had their own seat," he defended its position.
The law Ignores stewards
"There is no unique legal interpretation of the Steward role - no legal requirement is concerned with this role.
In addition, there is no legal requirements that the carrier does not prohibite services.
The Road Transport Law only knows the term of car receiver; it does not define its rights and debts," added the Hanzelka Port Portal with more ambitiousness.
Josef Pokorný, the Director of the Department of Road Transport, considers, in the contrast, that the law is sufficiently addressing the problem.
"All depends on the fact that the authorisation has the permission to propose places in its authorisation.
He said all the rest of the place, "which.
The cars are divided in urban cars, where there are places and a maximum limited, interurbian speed with delay places and a higher allowed speed and long distance without place, with the highest allowed speed and the highest seats of safety ceinture.
As in the airport, a expert said
Jaroslav Hoćín, expert to BESIP (resecurity of road movement) in transport, does not see the movement of stewards as a major problem.
"In regular movement, there is no danger. The situation may be compared to the service in the airports.
There no longer, it is not sure when a turbulence and the air hostile can be known by the head."
"O, in the case where the autocar would be released brushly, the laws of the physical would obviously be valid.
Like a city bus or a tram.
The transporter must manage the security of stewards by internal requirements," he also believes that the issue of the law is not regulated.
Jančura is ready to remove these services
Student Agenty is the only car transporter to propose steward services.
He's kicking it two hundred.
Even after that accident, the director does not consider their measure as a risk meat.
"Not, since I'll have the impression that it's a hazard, I'll remove it.
Passengers can receive their coffee and their newspaper in the boat.
It would also reduce the costs," he said.
Safety concern is the reason that there is no stewards in its vehicles the director of the Asian Alexeï Litvine, which ensures, in comparison with SA, a very reducted number of lines.
"We don't have hosts. We're opposed it since the beginning.
Soon or later it will end by a death accident," said he, a year ago, in Týden.cz.
An immense tragedy has occurred
A young hostile of the Plze's region, who worked for society for two years, died during the accident on the line of Naples.
A Slovenian truck probably left the emergency stop band without using climbing and locked the way to autocar.
The chauffeur of this last attempt to avoid it through a brush manager, but he broke it on his right side.
Jančura refuses that the two seats reserved at the rest of the stewards were sold.
"In the case of long distance lines, it is not possible to reserve these places, they are blocked."
The company accounts to deal with the train driver.
For the disempt of the young girl's family, the office shall not expect the court's judgment, but for the financial compensation, it also takes into account the offence.
An amendment of the law?
Not viewed
A change of the law, which is currently developed for more than one year by a team of thirty experts of the Ministry of Transport, could provide specifications on the movement of stewards on the side of the car.
"Or, she didn't get any conclusion on this point.
Indeed, she doesn't care too much to bus, but rather to the pointing system, to the maximum speed on the car and the use of the portable to the flight," said expert Hocchione.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider stewards activity as a thing that will focus on the security of passengers," concludes the Hanzelka port, specifying that the control of car safety is under the police and office for security at work.
The hopes of the Düsseldorphos are located on Francfort.
Great words were not missing in the letter addressed by the WestLB Directoral Committee to the employees of the house.
By an union of Düsseldorf's financial institutions with the Deka-Bank de Francfort, "the central institution of the financial markets of the Sparkasse's Finance Group could be, according to the public reporting Monday.
The WestLB would bring a "competence block" doubled by a sustainable productivity in such cases.
In all cases, such a relationship could be the case of decision-making to other concentrations in the bank sector of the countries.
See what this is like when a direct committee wants to demonstrate its action capacity in difficult times.
Because WestLB, wounded, is always a strong pressure.
This is not only the European Commission, but also the Federal Surveillance Authority of Finance Services, which has only recently understood the Government of the Northern Western Government that the time was undertaken in the search for a future solution.
However, it is a question since a few days - also on the side of Francfort - of a relationship with any form between the Deka Bank, which was aware of Spanish customers from their investment funds, and WestLB.
Of course, the Chief of the Deta-Bank Franz Waas knew in the presentation of the figures of the semester end of August that he had no sense in the fusion of the house of the Mainzer Landstrasse with a country bank, which is Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Deca ' s Administration Board, each half which is supported by the countries and by the Covenant Groups, has charged the Directorate Committee to conduct talking with WestLB for common commercial activities.
This could then be the debit of the financial market or parts of the financial market.
However, the talkers are only going to start, saying in the financial position.
It is not the first time that the Deta-Bank, with its 3000 employees, is the one of the most important employees on the financial place of Francfort, between the lorry that it is the consolidation of the sector of disappearances.
In 2003, Deta-Bank was believed for a moment that the Deta-Bank could fum with the country's bank of Rhenania Palatinat and Halbab.
Nobody's still disappeared from this neighborhood.
The plans had been publicly made that the Government of Hesse had spoken against all the participation of Hellaba in them.
Afterward, the two other houses were no longer joined.
The bank of Rhenania Palatinat was ratified at the bank of the Bade-Wuttenberg country in Stuttgart.
But there have always been new treaties on Deka-Bank grouping with countries' banks.
Finally, Günther Merl, Chairman of the Leader Committee of Hellaba, was committed against any trade fusion strategy with its bank.
Independently, the feelings seem to be spread that the grouping of the various public sector institutions is particularly urgent.
Now that the election to the Parliament of the country of Baviere is passed, a BayernLB unit with the Bade-Wuttenberg bank could be conceived at first.
For Helaba, this is not an special news.
If the pressure of new fusions should be increased, the potential partners would escape him little.
In the south, it would now be a Junior partner, although she has been better residue to the crisis than Munich and Stuttgart banks.
The Hesse-Thuring Casts group, which is 85% of the Helaba capital capital, turned out a storm at the beginning of the year on the whole meeting with WestLB.
He would stay at the NorthLB Rigour.
However, these geo-trategic reflections reflect only one of the faces.
Another face poses the question of how the different commercial models of each of these banks can be seen.
In June, Merl would point out that the decision-making question, namely what model the future capacity of the banks in the countries should be ensured, has not been resolved by the German group of ships and payments.
In terms, the WestLb's exceeding could have been placed, the exceeding which is apparently not wished here.
This is also the question in the letter of the Direction Committee: in any case, a global resolution for the establishment would be considered.
How all this will be put into the same panick with the unit of certain entities with the Deta-Bank remains to see.
The second weekend of the Beer party is also known as the Italian weekend.
For Elena, it's the first time for Luca the third or fourth time.
But this time, Elena joins him as a little friend, and so it's nothing like that, he said.
After them, close to a five-litres of the Kaiser brand, a well-building bar that shows approximately 200 visitors of the birth festival what deep sounds his goat can produce.
Elena shot first Luca, then put it up.
From Bologna, they came to Verone.
From there, from the railway near the new Puorta Valley, four bus take the start at 23:45, "Monaco dining, bird festival" for 6:30.
Three bus are mainly reserved for Italians, in one of the buss traveling Brazilians exclusively.
In a part of the parking, South America sing from before and already next to their draps, they have already danced last night.
And also bruising, she explains Marco Guarda, that's not for Italians.
The buses are in Marco, which brings a long twice swimming clothes of furniture and lunchs to large silver montures.
Since five years, they're going to the drink feast, there's no more than this year.
They're going there night, staying on the feast, and returned at 22:30.
And through the night would imply unnecessary costs, explain Marco.
The travel costs 75 euros, including the welcome pot with a bike Kaiser, brassed in accordance with the Bavarian cleanness law, the disease insurance and a responsibility of the German group - Marco made a language course in Francfort.
And already bus roaring in the night on the Autostranda direction 'Brennero'.
There's no drink, not yet.
Quietly, everything becomes quiet in the bus, travellers sleeping.
That's better, they'll still need their forces.
Peace will be made in Bressanone, and Holzkirchen, while a large number of other bus with Italian immatriculation plates again makes a bit before Munich, on the 8th autumn.
When at a little morning, the Marco group finally arrives at six thirty hours as planned on the parking near the Thèse place, nearly 50 other bus from all Europe are already there.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco holds a last talk, explains the attack plan.
First, it is covered by the small yellow box.
Desus is written to the left `Fête of the bever, in the winter, and next to the Internet address of the Marco travel agency 'conosciviving.it'.
Second: 'The doors of the beverage chapter are opened,' Marco cries at the little morning.
"Corir!" Turn and reserve the places on the foundation of the tent.
"Don't be locked, and not all yellow boxes on the same banks, you must divide them in the room!"
The chope, crying in Marco, cost 8.25 euros.
And don't forget the consigment!
́ Show the security officers that we are good!
Since you leave your places, they are parts."
Third: "It's evening to get back here at ten hours and half pills!"
And that's, it's gone to the birth party.
On the road, someone's noise of the yellow cocktails to the trees to find the road, the panels and even to an electional view of a great bavarois popular.
We want to be ready to return.
It's the second weekend of the Beer party, known as the "week-end of Italians".
There are no specific figures; it is said about 50,000 people who move through the Alpes and found in the bike water, 10 percent of visitors would have come explicitly from Italy in this weekend.
The Munichian police is strengthened by the South Tiro, by Italian voluntary savers who support the Bavarian red crown that achieves statistics on countries where Italians occupied the first place before British (60 interventions) and Austrians (approximate 80) with approximately 200 medical interventions.
That is particularly appreciated by Italians, is the Hofbräuo Brasserie.
Insomnie Nothing for Hypo Real Estate Actors
The German banking system is relatively stabil, stressed the Federal Minister of Finance just a few weeks ago.
What a chance that politician used the word 'relatively' and that it suggested that the German bank sector would not be disappeared by crisis movements.
This has actually happened this weekend.
The financing of the Bavarois Bavarois Hypo Real Estate (HRE), on the DAX, obtains a German bank-consortium credit of a billion to protect market turbulences.
A person in the confidence of the situation said to Reuters Monday that the aid credits were released up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate should now pay interests on the fraction to which it would be right.
The money is so much of private banks as of public law banks.
In the back-plan, it is Depfa society that supports loss.
The status financing was, according to a newspaper, refined to very short term for long-term projects for which he had undertaken money, which was not more possible since the fairness to the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank liquidity reserve was reduced from 95 per cent to 2.37 million, the own capital rate was also lightly faily 1.6 to 1.45 per cent.
The current benefits and networks from financial transactions were, in comparison with the previous year, falling in the grain, benefits from the allocation of credits and mobile values determined, as well as the rehabilitation of provisions in credit operations have resulted from more than 70 to 5 million euros.
It is only due to the important benefits of the reimbursement of the accountability costs in aval resulting from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group, and the reimbursement of interests according to the book of tax procedures and commercial purchases for Conzern companies that the deficit of gains has been moderated by about 16 per cent.
After his privatization in 1990, the former State Financial was first missed on realm industrial credits, which was then engaged in the Air Bank.
Because classic state funding was not sufficiently rentable, the Depfa was then more intensely involved in infrastructure projects and the financing of projects in common between private investors and State (Privat-Public-Partnership, PPP) and internationally diversified.
The Hypo Real Estate, on the value of the company, must proceed to loves that should be calculated by gains and losses of the group, a key effect that remains even enough slow.
The fact is that the divisions have been assempt.
Today for 2007, two thirds were thrown.
The Hypo Real Estate is, since the Depfa race, a highly important investor of state and infrastructure.
It is stronger than other undertakings depending on the refinance of the inter-banc market as it does not have any customer deposit.
With the fatality of the Investment Bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the allocation of credits between banks was again significantly tariff, banks which accumulated their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate has an annual need for a part - approximately 50 billion euros - of all the Depfa credits of a short term refinance.
According to a Communicated Hypo Real Estate, the financing need for the group is covered with the medium-term credit and the protected undertaking of the impact of the international financial markets out of current traffic status.
Other sources say that refinance would be secured by funds until the end of 2009.
The Chairman of the HRE Georg Funke Direction Committee explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group should not be able to return to the medium-term financial markets.
The Federal Bank and the Federal Statute for Finance Services (Bafin) participates in the principle that the capacity of the Hypo Real Group is now ensured.
Assets and creditors of the bank have only hoped it.
However, in view of the dynamic and imposability of the crisis, there is no certainty.
In addition, it is not imposable that it is not possible to return to the financing throughout its extent.
But the contrary cannot be disappeared.
After the fact that the bank is, in accordance with the latest communications, even on the doors of dinner instability at the end of evening, this saving for at least provisional will not be able to resolve the spirits.
The course of the action was 75 percent to 3,30 euros.
The courses of the obligations are particularly good.
While the debts at the first were hardly bounced, the courses of the second plan will be flood.
The most touched are the investment funds of the old Württemberg company Hypo and those who have a lifetime over 2009.
The obligations of the Hypo Real Estate bank appeared to be an alternative speculation place, now their value must be considered as dependent on the stability of the international banking system after the net duration of the bank crisis and the crisis of the Institute that has even brought the crisis into the establishment by the race of the Depfa bank.
Since emission institutions, the lower-related governments and commercial banks are still ready to support the system, there can be a resorption in time.
Or it will happen that nobody hopes at this time - that financial crisis could be overcome in the next 15 months.
But face to the renewed voices of a partly nationalization, the probability that approve sureness is today becomes a simple founded hope.
This should reserve nights of unemployment before all the long-term creditors on the decision to know whether they have to separate their commitments.
The short term investors can always use what they have taken to make a report of loss for the next years on the next tax income of the capital of the automaticly pre-supplied busers gains.
Sylvana and the secrets of the bottle in Bento
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, must be present for the first day at the High School of Tachibana, the girls start to laugh: the Almande is so "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana already knew this word thanks to Mangas - in her new exchange log, she talked about Japan.
"The first course day in Japan.
What I was excited.
Too the way to go to school, I was afraid.
I live in Tokyo's pension in direction of Kawasaki and I take the train 40 minutes until Tachiban High School.
I've been able to find the way alone, happily I'm not lost.
The start of courses seems not to be fixed as strictly as at us in Basse-Saxe.
Students appear each after the other from eight hours, until at 9 p.m., a table tour starts with teacher, the "Home room".
But before the course was starting, it was me to present me.
I'm not all about how to love talking to people, especially before a class of 40 students.
As I had not yet the school uniform, I put a old juppe of my home mother, as well as a chemite, blue shoes and black shoes.
So at this festival I was presented before the puppet, and I tried to speak correctly: 'Sayonara Wo She Sylvana...' - I'm called Sylvana, I came from Germany and my birthday is in a week.
At that time, I was very glad that I began to learn the language well two years ago.
The 31 girls of the class have made all low meats, laughed and made signs, and I have always heard the word "Kawaii".
I already knew him thanks to my mangas.
It belongs to the essential vocabulary to the survival of Japanese gems and means "mignon, chou".
Then I was fast laid down to my place.
The girl in front of me made me a great ironic smile, she found that it was a honour that the corresponding duive sat next to her.
The rest of the time was quiet enough, but when the gong resoned, I was assailed in the rules.
Everyone talked to whom better, he could smile and put a lot of questions -- in that case, it's enough difficult to understand the Japanese.
During the pause, they all went out of their Bento.
My mother had also done this kind of Lunchbox - that's really different than the German miserable.
I had a rice to aromatic herbs, small shoes, a salt of concommer and trees, fruits and kind of meat around Tofu.
Most time, I don't know what I'm eating exactly here in Japan.
The things have a strange appearance and a completely new goal.
Whatever is sure is that everything is really good.
Well, unless the clothes beared, brrrrr!
The Bentos are not only dinners in Japanese schools.
It is sometimes that a girl offers a boy a Bento that she prepared himself, and that is then prepared particularly sensitive - in the hope to make a little better the boy's knowledge during the pause.
I read this in my manga.
I'm pretty concerned to know if I could also watch it here.
"Why is Japan particularly?" I asked my friends when I told them that I wanted to pass a year to the school in Tokyo.
Then I always said,
' Because it's pretty fun, what'
Finally, read mangas, that's what I prefer for years.
And to better understand the mangas and culture that is there, at one time, I also began to learn Japanese.
For me, it was really clear that I had to travel one day.
Because I also have a weak low for traditions, uses and customs.
And here, we give them a lot of importance.
On the one hand, Japan is the country of the most recent technologies and trends - on the other side, it is serious, disciplined and traditional.
And as all is so well organized, I never felt losing here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have never seen."
rats also have senses
A rat or a coffee was before the danger, is it mean that he also feels scared?
The neurophysicien Joseph LeDoux is convinced: many animals also have feelings.
But how could we check that he tries the same thing when he acts in the same way as we?
In the "Edge" online magazine, contributions are published for several years by scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of articles of responses to the question "What do you think you are true without being able to prove?"
I believe the animals have feelings and other states of conscience without me or any others had until now been able to prove it as it can't be proved that other human beings have a conscience.
But in that case, at least we can hope that all human brains present the same configuration.
Since we turn to other species and address the issues of the resurrection or general conscience, we go into practically difficult fields because the Hardware does not match.
When a rat is before a danger, he does the same thing as many other animals: he makes death, was or attacked.
Human beings are in the same way, that is why some scientists decline a comparable life.
But I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the structure of the brain make the transposition of our subjective life to the animals difficult.
One of the aspects is that almost always related circuits to human conscience include the pre-frontal bilateral Court (such as its participation in the short term memory and in the direction and execution functions).
This wide region is much more developed in human beings than in other princes and seems to be fully absent in other ages.
Thus, at least for these aspects of our consciousness depending on the Court of Justice, including the conscience of whom we are, and the ability to predict and decise, it is reasonable to think that human being is even different from other principles.
Another significant speciality could be in the language nature of the man: a large part of his existence being linked to the language, which often means that his conscience depends on.
In that case, the animals could be excluded.
But even though the conscience should not depend on the language, that would certainly affect it, so that animal conscience, whatever the way it has been produced, would probably be different from the most of our conscience.
That is why it is so difficult to determine what awareness can appear in other animals.
If this, internal and sustainable, let neither measure or, because of this particular equipment, analyze by based on our own experience, then his observation has great problems.
Most of my developments refer to the content of awareness, but there is another aspect of conscience that should be easier to access scientificly.
Awareness process could be reviewed without taking into account their contents, and it was exactly what happened during short-term memory studies, particularly with the example of visualization.
But in this approach that Christf Koch and Francis Crick followed, we focus more on the nervous correlations of conscience than on causel mechanisms: both can be identical or not.
Unfortunately, this approach also emphasized the weight of the before-frontal Court in the realization of visualization.
But what does it happen for emotions?
I conclude that an emotional system such as the fear is active in a conscious brain of his own activity.
So what we mean as "peur" is the mental state in which we find when the activity of the local defence system in the brain (or its follow-ups, such as the reactions of the body) come from the living memory.
Thus observed, emotions are closely related to the cortex regions which characterize the princes and particularly the humanity.
Sub-styles directed from the feeling, associated with our evoluble nature, denial, because we can, with the help of the words and the grammary, distinguish and categorize states to impose them to others than to us.
For example, Antonio Damascus believes that the sensations resulting from primative activities are born in the regions of the body sensation of the Court and the cerebral tronc, as well as Jaak Pankseep, which is more focused on the cerebral tronc.
As this network has not been much changed during human evolution, it could be very part of transversal feelings in all ways.
With a purely theory point of view, I can't say it, but I think it's unmontable.
Pankseep argued that what seems as fear for men and rats is really likely feeling as in the two cases: How can we still check if rats and men feel the same thing when they are doing similar?
A coffee was before the danger, but if he feels scared?
In my eyes, similar behaviour does not suffice to prove identical vessels.
Certainly, the comparison of nervous help: rats and men have similar cerebral troncs, the cofards by against do not even put a brain.
But what is the cerebral tronc in the origin of the sensations?
And even if we could prove that for the man, how could we demonstrate it in the rats?
I think the rats and other mammifères may even even cofards (ho knows?) have feelings.
But I don't know how to demon it.
And because their feelings are really clearly different from ours (for human conscience is relaxed on special circuits and language), I prefer to learn the emotional behaviour than the emotional sensation of rats.
In all cases, progress takes on the nervous plan in the measure where the same thing is in the rats and in the humans.
As I don't expose language and conscience in rats, nor senses, I don't know if they exist.
It could be judged as a short term, but I prefer to advance rather than to know me constantly against a wall.
I'm actually an emotional pragmatic.
Platin, President of the EUFA: a time of grace for Poland and Ukraine
The Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik explained that the preparations would soon be placed under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The Government considers the EUFA decision in Bordeaux as a evidence of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize, in cooperation with Poland, Europe campaigns," declared Wasjunik.
"But this is not a friendship for our country.
The work is just starting, and there's still much to do in the two countries."
In the calendar of construction or destruction of stations, streets, hotels and airports, the two hosts walk after the time.
The number of stages for Europe campaign could probably be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't lose time.
We need to work at the maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian Greek Ligue Surkis.
"The EUFA has always made us eye."
A more radical measure was decided in Poland.
The direction of the PZPN football link was suspended by the National Olympic Committee after many scandals and replaced by Robert Zawlocki, independent manager.
The Commission was meeting on the request of the Minister of Sports Miroslaw Drzewiecki Minister.
There would be "the real danger that the PZPN could not operate in the rules," said Drzewiecki of the Polynish PAP Presseance Agency.
"We assured in an email to the President of the EUFA that the preparations of the European Championship in 2012 wouldn't suffer it."
Several members of the First Division ligue have already been sent in the previous season condemned for obligatory manipulation; finally, the beginning of the League has even been delayed at the last minute.
Dennis Quaid has been signed against-account
She wanted to make the promotion for a new movie, she spoke about her private life in an interview - and now she had nice with her ex: the Hollywoodian star Meg Ryan raised the vial on her ex adultery Dennis Quaid.
It's the pit -- and contra-atque.
A late war of the Roses for the former Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid couple: seven years after their divorce, the two Hollywoodians lead to a disgraceful battle - to see and to the south of the world.
Last week, Meg Ryan was expressed in an interview for the American inStyle newspaper about the causes of marriage earnings: "Dennis I was infidel, and it was very painful."
She would have known the extension of the trumpet only after divorce.
The reason for this striptease of the thought remains in the press relationships of Ryan for his new film "The Women" - has been told the story of an adulter.
The reaction of Dennis Quaid on his infidel sea qualification was clearly: it would be "Monstrueux", he said at the "New York Daily News", 54 years, that "Meg renews the history of our relationship and manual."
It would be more "registerable," that "the pain and the boundaries that contain a divorce for each child will be revived in public" for their 16-year-old sons.
When Ryan lives alone since the divorce, Quaid relaxed and soon becomes the father of jumeals.
So his response was in the case of a band: "In any case, my life continues.
I'm happy to have a wonderful family that goes to the best."
Airport prices and chutent hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and hotel nights were less than the previous year.
In Germany, according to a present study, the flights would have even reduced to 50 per cent.
Flights and hotel nights will be benefited - that is the result of a study of the provider of financial services and American Express travels.
The company analyzed its booking data of the first half of 2008 and established, after an increase in prices in the first quarter, a net declined benefits in the second quarter.
After hotel market prices increased for years, hotel nights have already reduced many places.
During January to March, prices increased in 41 of the 48 European cities that were further reviewed by 6.9 per cent in average compared to 2007 in 41 of the outcoming 48 European cities.
However, from April to June, prices were 3.6% lower than the previous year.
The tendance was especially neted in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay from 30 to 37 per cent less than one year early.
The causes of all this would be for American Express in the lack of the dollar course which led to a "slow of travels to the American tourists".
Financing places such as Francfort or London would be more touched by the reduction of hotel prices than industrial sites such as Hanovre, Colony, or Stavanger.
In the Swedish city, hotel prices are a 26.3 percent higher, the record in Europe.
So on flight prices, trend was increased in the first quarter:
As a result of the increase in the kirosen price, passengers in economic class have to be paid average 7,1 per cent more than in 2007, long-mail flights, very fuel consumers have even increased up to 29.2 per cent.
From April to June, the prices in economic class were 12.5 per cent in comparison with the previous quarter, business class and first class, however, price changes have been largely less pronounced.
In Germany, prices have been more important infringement than in other European countries:
The prices increased from January to March from 11.9 per cent, in the second quarter, were 23.6 per cent.
German internal flights were even divided by two according to this study.
The reasons of this price damage would be on one side a flying economic growth, and it explains the firm.
The request would be on the terrain in a lot of travel market segment by aircraft.
On the other hand, there would be an accredited pressure of the competition of the "Open Ciel" treaty which releases the air circulation between the United States and Europe.
The sign of the situation of tendu is the removal of the aircraft companys from non-terrely trajectable, as well as the high number of airlines that would have put the balance during the first half of 2008 - they were 24 companys as nothing in Europe.
HSV bat Gladbach 1:0
With a simple goal and methods, SV Hamburg becomes first from classification.
In Bosnia, Luhukay has not always succeeded to find our official.
From Christffer Small. Agranddir. Astrousion in disaster for international Marko Marin player.
Gladbach's player will only be later in the game and his rising reign was evaluated against the goal framework.
His message was precisely formulated, he went out of his lips in a persuasive way.
He just knew he was right.
"We need this second goal," Mrs. Hermann Rieger, "we need this second goal."
It wasn't a big thing in the garments, the mid-times was over and most were raising in their place.
Rieger was about three decades the HSV physiotherapiete, played a large reputation as well as old protagonists.
That is why his request was received to the strategic places.
The assistant Cornelius Jol acquired and lifted the powder to approve.
Cornelius is the brother of the enterprises of Hamburg Martin Jol.
So the orders seem to have been similar: and that's done with this second goal!
It was missing in practice.
"All wasn't very nice to see today," awaits Marcel Jansen later.
Bastian Reinhard would "be more detained."
This is 1:0 (1:0 to the mid-times), the Hamburg team must be shocked by the head successed by Mband Petric (to the 11th minute); and the fact that the very weak players of Gladbach couldn't hurt the weak players of Hamburg.
"There was a victory sale," said Marin Jol.
The SV of Hamburg will celebrate that Monday 121 years.
Saturdayly after summer, supporters celebrated themselves, the blue sky above the arne and the provisional classification tables on the geother screen that indicated their club as first of the class.
It's a birthday without true feast.
"We know we're going to take back," said Marcell Jansen.
The intermediate result of the table is more sure that the first line is more incredible than the domination of its HSV.
The team with his lately involved – the Brazilians Neves and Silva, the but Petric as Jansen designed by FC Bayern - is certainly sweet, but it doesn't look still.
"We need more charm and more dribbles," asked Jol.

However, the sum must not be paid once, but progressively.
In contrast, the State should receive options on the actions of the financial society that can be correctly evaluated to the evolution of the course in order to reduce the burden for the public Treasury.
Action courses in the tourball in Europe and the United States
Milliards of aid for banks in Europe and the United States do not affect investors' concerns.

The shadow material affects the flight of space sounds
For years, a mystery phenomenon leaves researchers in the perplexity: shadow material influences the speed of space sounds while it is called gravitational support managers.
Experts fear that the general relations theory is not completely correct.
For almost 18 years, the Ulysses space sound wants in space.
The death cryogen is threatened by the road conducts soon.
Since years, a mystery of fenomen is caused to disappear among researchers - the nomal of gravitational support.
The gravitational support is a managing of space sounds, with which they have an additional expansion in the sky-level field, for example, the Earth.
So songs can economize a lot of fuel.
The American-European research sond of Cassini-Huygens used this physical art, as well as the Ulysse sole song.
This is what the researchers also appreciated for years: flying objects are not always 100 percent of the way it is expected as well as the generous laws of gravity.
Furthermore, irregularities appear at the level of speed.
The songs become unexpectedly faster or slower.
Until now, physicians couldn't explain this effect.
They baptized him the nomale of gravitative support.
Some experts feared that the theory of the general relations of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction force of the fact of the space corbure, could not be completely correct.
The American Physician Stephen Adler of the Institute For Advanced Study of Princeton always believes that Einstein was not stubborn and tried to explain the naturality of gravitative support with the support of the black matter that astronoms identified in the universe.
"The black material could be responsible for this anomy, which is also located near the earth," he wrote.
Space researchers know the existence of the black material only for about ten years.
It appears to be an attraction force whose effect is observed on other heavenly bodys.
It is, on the contrary, fully invisible, that it does not send or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, particularly no visible light.
According to the calculations of the sciences, the black matter would also represent a good fifth of the whole universe mass.
Tourists entered into Egypt are free
After ten days in the hand of their advisers, the tourists in Egypt should be released, and it was confirmed by the Minister of Ethiopia.
The Swedish reviewers had expired a number of millions of euros.
During the spot before the release, six o'clock prenses would have been killed.
In the south of Egypt five Germans were taken.
The negotiations for the ransom would already be undertaken.
The Germans are without stop in the kidnappors collection.
WELT ONLINE deems the most important cases.
European tourists in Sahara are apparently free.
This is what they have communicated from the Egyptian TV, the Arabian television chain of Al-Arabia and the Italian media.
The Italian Minister of Business Estrangères Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the bulletins of the Italian Television chain Sky TG 24: "We are concitoyens and other discharges have been released.
We are currently checking their health status," says Frattini.
The five Italians, the five Italians and their eight Egyptian fellowships are well and are secure, announced the national Egyptian television.
The 19 parts of the excursion in the wilderness should already be towards the Caire.
The circumstances around a fusillade before the release of otages remain still slow: so the kidnappers would have been close to put a term to the extension, according to the words of a Egyptian security agent, before the Sudan Army killed six of the kidnappers without crying.
"The problem was solved.
They were agreed with a ransom," said the agent.
It remained only to collect the otages, when soon, "This surprise" has occurred.
The Swedish soldiers killed that Sunday six of the raceers in the border area between the Sudan, Tchad and Egypt, and arrested two of them.
An amount of six million euros had to be paid by the German woman of one of the otages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" would explain that, according to the words of a German mediator, the liberation of otages was delayed because the kidnappers were afraid for their security.
According to the article, the advisers wished to release female otages after the payment of the race.
Men should be retained until the viewers found a secure way to escape.
The German Ambassade in Caire refused to comment on this article.
Abus of a beautiful mother who mixes the suicide."
A court was informed that years of abuse inflicted by her beloved conducted a woman to survive.
Michael Trerise, 57 years later, in the Cornouailles, was arrested for six years after admitting eight heads of accusation for uncertain facts.
The Court of Great Instance of Truro reaffirmed that he regularly read his beauty-feel, Stefanie Randle during his childhood from 5 to 7 years.
Trerise wrote in a confession letter: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court was informed that Ms. Randle, aged 34, had been murdered at Mutley, Plymouth, April 1, 2007.
Infant when she lived in Coventry, Trerise bound it and bound it before he put it to sexual acts, while her mother worked at the pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in the Cornouahs.
His beautiful brother went to Plymouth.
But the court was informed that Ms. Randle, beloved by National Trust, was infringed by abuse that had been inflated on him twice a week.
General Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife said to the court that friends had told Mrs. Randle, who was a good surfing and cyclist, seemed since 2006 "emotionally dead", and "ha lost all hopes to life."
In April 2007, his true father, Terrance Randle, found him dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
We think she's killed by just enough with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle addressed the beautiful father of her daughter who had otherwise, she reported a letter of confession that thus ended: "I did the attack and the band regularly."
"I haven't murdered her sexually.
"I feel responsible for his death."
The judge Christpher Elwen said to Trerise: "You are really strangers as fetichists, your victim must certainly be terrorised, especially at the age of 7.
"The slaughter has been completed by the murder of the victim.
And what even more wonderful, is that if she hadn't done this man, her story wouldn't have ended at the court."
He added: "I emphasis in particular, as describes him his father and his mother, the effects of your crime is committed over years on Stefania.
"In those, she would be unfortunately today a young woman happy, promised and successful."
Prosecution for the loss of official data.
The Ministerial Office of the Cabinet Office who had forgotten secret documents in June, will be condemned by the Office of the Secretariat Act at the BBC.
The man of the Ministry of Defence was moved when he forgot two highly classified documents on a Waterloo train.
The documents were in the BBC hands before being delivered to the police.
This is the least serious condemnation of this act, without any consequence of criminal intention.
The corresponding BBC, Frank Gardner said that this episode had many whitehall people.
"They will have thought that this matter would be left between the walls of the Ministry of Defence and the Cabinet Office," said he.
The employment that cannot be appointed is accused of violation of section 8.1 of the act, i.e. the closure that relates to the safeguard of the information.
The Crown Prosecution Service suggested that the ministerial officer would be placed under the Metropolitan Police, seeing the very sensitive nature of its work related to the Secret Service Committee
The documents lost contained appreciation on Al-Qaeda and on the resources of security forces in Iraq.
He was informed about the decision on Monday morning and then was transferred from home to a secret place.
building societys face B–B factory.
The British building societys could have to pay more than £80 million, to cover the rescue of Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of Bradford & Bingley's 2.6 million sponsors.
The interests of this presumption will be paid by all companies recovering the money of the sponsors, including 59 building companies.
The Director-General of Building Society Association (BSA), Adrian Coles stated that it was "irritable" to know that companies and their members should pay the cassed pots...
The loan of £14 billion will be reimbursed when Bradford & Bingleys' hypothetics will be declined.
But interests that are going to increase in the same time will be debt, every year, to 700 financial companies recruiting deposits .
The Financial Services Competence Scheme confirmed the BBC that 59 building companies are included in this list.
It's irritant to see that the institutions who had a prudent behaviour must now pay some of the facts of the institutions who have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
It is declared that each company must pay a proportional amount to the deposits that it is undertaken, and that intermediate companies must pay approximately 18 per cent of the cost.
The Treasury believes that the pre-related interests will be exempt in 2009 at $450 million.
This means that companies will need to find £81 million to regulate the interests of the first year.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Building Committee for Building Societys, said to the BBC that this decision was injust.
It's an irritant" to see that the institutions who have had an prudent behaviour during the recovery of the real estate market now need to pay a lot less prudent institutes.
According to the BSA, no company has failed since 1945, from the first year.
"We must consider all the aspects of this case during the next weeks to assess the options to prevent the building society and their members pay this salary facture," said Mr Cole.
The interests for 2009 cover seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010, the interests of the whole year should be paid, which could also be doubled.
Since the building companies are organizations without action, their Member shall end by paying the facture or by higher charges, or by lower interest rates for accounts.

Jersey people must pay more for their milk
Jersey Dairy announced that she would increase the price of her milk, five penny to the litter, from Monday.

An ex-Pm of Bangladesh was rejected
A court in Bangladesh rejected the former SME Sheikh Hasina, which could so be arrested when returning to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused him to grant his precaution because of its consideration for extortion to a case man, $50 million to Taka ($729,000) when it was PM.
This is one of the many accusations that are addressed to him.
Khaleda Zia, the continuing rival of Sheikh Hasina, was relaxed in precaution this month here.
Sheikh Hasina should return to Bangladesh for a few weeks, but his party League Awani has concluded that the provisional military Government of the country would first give him its entire freedom.
The correspondants emphasized that the terms of his release are contrary, because if it is allowed to leave the country for medical reasons, they do not see why it could not remain free from return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers have announced that she will now call on the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the request of Sheikh Hasina said that she was not required to be careful when she had been authorized to go to the foreign for medical reasons," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will have an appeal against the Order of the Supreme Court"
His lawyers argued that she had needed this precaution to return to the country to prepare the elections in December
Sheikh Hasina should return after October 17, said a former leader of the Awami Party.
She was detained last year after the military interim government had assembled the power, but was released in June to submit himself to the foreign.
Sheikh Hasina like Zhaleda Zia, not the accused they do.

BSkyB lost the ITV judicial battle
BSkyB has lost its proceedings as follows the Commission of Concurrence, which would enable it to reduce its participation in its ITV rival transmittor.
The Concurrence Court of Justice ordered BSkyB to reduce its ITV shares from 17.9% at least 7.5%.
The Commission stated that MSkyB's participation had prevented competition and had allowed him to influence injustice ITV.
BSkyB bought its shares in 2006 to a agreement in fact to prevent NTL, now called Virgin Media, buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Fair Trade Office reported that the acquis by BSkyB, ITV shares, had seen suspicion of the ITV independence, encouraged the Commission to investigate.
The patron of Virgin, Richard Branson, a group of consumers and the Ofcom regulator were all opposed to this purchase.
BSkyB reiterated that the force to reduce its ITV shares would not be reasonable and, in the contrary, it was extreme – especially because BSkyB is to refuse its vote rights.
New investigation in the case of American prosecutors.
The American General Avocate appointed a special complaint to check the issue of the license of nine American Prosecutors in 2006.
It is born from the account of the general inspector of the Department of Justice, which criticizes the actions of some ministerial officers.
The report was critical to the officials of the White House, legislators and the former Procureur General, Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation is based on the subject of lawyers who support that their license is from political causes.
The Special Auditor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether the officers who were investigated during the investigation have lied to the investigators, injured the justice.
"The General Inspector Glenn Fine has not been completely confirmed nor solved," said.
The appointment of a special accused can make witnesses to submit, was one of its largest recommendations.
The dispute begins by the radiation in December 2006 of nine American prosecutors formulated by the Department of American Justice.
At the time, the department said that the prosecutors were licensed because of mediators.
But then he wondered that the licensed prosecutors were not more criticised than their other colleagues, which encourages some observers to grant these licenses a political conception.
Some prosecutors were accused of being close to the Republics of the Congress, while others had refused to investigate the complaints of fraud vote against Democrats.
American prosecutors are investigating and pursuant to the prosecutors for the government.
It is certain that they can be licensed at any time, but they cannot be for political reasons.
The Chief of Justice, Procureur General Alberto Gonzales, ends to be accused of being involved in this licensing case, and at the end, he delimited.
Some ministerial officers of the Department of Justice also gave their release.
The report of the Inspector-General was very critical to the role of Mr. Gonzales in this case, explaining that he was considered "the first responsible" of these licenses, and ended by" to "determine" its role of leader," notably succeeding to not involved in this case.
Other ministerial officers, including the former employer of Bush, Karl Rove, have been critical to have not been able to cooperate during the investigation.
Meat Loaf's epouse must be honored.
Rock star Meat Loaf, must be honored at Q Awards for its epic Bath Out Of Hell song.
The cantor, who will receive an oscar during the ceremony in London next week, said to be "honorated" to obtain this recognition.
The song of nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the Hit of the Meat Loaf album of 1977.
The evening of the price transfer is presented by Coldplay with this year a limited selection to four categories.
Paul Rees, editor of Q magazine, said, "There are songs that are transcending things like the time and the genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is surely part
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requested a great voice like Meat Loaf.
It begins with a instrumental section that is almost two minutes.
The chanson was carried into the United Kingdom, as only in 1979, which was classified at the fifteenth place.
Furthermore, his album Bat Out of Hell remained nine years in English classifications, and was sold more than 40 million examples throughout the world.
Meat Loaf- or Marvin Lee Aday, on his real name, caused health problems in the past years, even undertakening an operation to heal his heart battery to become irregular, after heated on the scene, 2003.
In 2007, a strong layout forced it to cancel concerts.
Then he found a kist in his vocal fingers.
A Sombre rue in the village, Subvent Forgotten, and Peut Etre Welcome in Vente.
New York has hundreds of arrivals, bolevards, roads and other parallal roads, some famous, others only functional.
And even some veterinary taxes, as well as long-term local residents can not give indications to get to Extra Place, because they never heard it.
The street is located in the East Village and runs the north of First Street- to do not confusion with Second Street- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
From about 30 feet width for 120 degrees, it is like a poussy flat rather than a active arter.
. No panel specified the street.
It is virtually impossible to find it on a standard atlas.
However, this road has wonderers.
For example, Avalon Bay is, the constructor of recent luxury newspapers on the first street.
He would like to restore Extra Place, and create a more flow transition to the stores and buses, which should open in the new immobiles.
Other wondering, including the long-term neighbors, said to be characterised by this just because it remains one of the latest and older roads of the pool of houses.
But the Department of Preservation and Development Immobiliate the city manager the street has no interest to keep it.
At a meeting of neighborhood owner committees, representatives of city agency and Avalon Bay have built a proposal authorised the owner to buy the street.
But the Committee prefers that the street remains in the hands of the city, and requested a new proposal to submit the next month, Susan Stetzer said that the local manager of the Committee No.3.
"It is only a few spaces in the city, and we would like to keep the city in Extra Place," she said.
"They could propose that they can remit and manage it, what otherwise Avalon could do, but we want to maintain it public."
Avalon Bay announced several months ago that she wanted to restore the small street and install seats, some would be used by a coffee where the constructor will grant space.
The proposal of this potential acquisition was made public at the meeting of this month.
Michele of Millly, the door of Avalon Bay, said that while the company wants to operate the street, it doesn't mean strongly that she wants to be the owner.
"The main interest of Avalon Bay is to relook this goal left, and to make it public," she said, noting that it was the city to suggest the sale."
Seth Donlin, a door of the Preservation of the Immobilier, confirmed that the city wanted to sell the street, notably, that the Agency's mission was to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared with her more colored neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place left a story story.
Some believe that Austra Place takes this name since 1802, when the heritage of the greatly closed children of Philip Minthorne was divided, laying this small land end, which remains since left.
The later entry of the CBGB, a punk rock monument closed in 2006, opened to Extra Place; the street is certainly more famous through the photo covering the album of Ramones" Rocket to Russia"
"It was a great place," said Danny Fields, the Ramones Manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
She was full of iron, hair, barriers, posters, sheets and hearts."
Some residents, including the bloggers that had already spoken about the evolution to the luxe of East Village, were opposed to the idea to sell Extra Place, saying that this humble small property should remain public.
Others have proclaimed Extra Place as a real rarety- a virtually identical fragment in the city which should be fichu in peace.
Jeremiah Moss, who leads a blog named Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled "The Book of the Constitutions: A Nostalgic Order on A Ville in the Extinction Process) reports the history of Ville and Extra Place, published in 1952 in The New Yorker.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a small cul-de-sac stretch, shadow of day as night, and delimity by the doors of a red iron trap and Persians, full of newspapers in the past week that turns around the pitchers."
A few exceptions near, the street always has the same warming.
A core rat on the base of the road, nearly one door that held jadis to the CBGB, which has now become the seat of a chic clothes seat.
Graphits on the walls, a 22-year-old bucket bottle, stays with newspapers that are just going to be thrown.
Some passengers said to think only rarely at Extra Place, and suggested that it was valued.
Mr. Field said that some under estimated the attraction of the street in its current state.
"The best years of my life," said he, "released in shame, humble and deepest places."
Debat Bilingue: Immersion in English
In this part of the Education Survey Programme, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the position of candidates concerning the knowledge of education.

Mr. Obama states that "Afro-American and Latin students have less chance of deploying the fact that white students."
To combat these differences, Mr. Obama's education program supports particularly among both such issues, "conscious transitional education" for those who learn English.
However, the question addressed to Obama is whether its desire to achieve a well-known education that defends the education in other languages than English, and its interest will also be interested in eliminating the differences.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school of the east of Los Angeles account.
Students of this school are largely Spanish, and lower income.
More than one third of the students, formed many new arrivals, studied English.
The CM1 students have been 100 per cent of the 2008 Math State Examination, expert.
Likewise, almost 93% of students have been reviewed by English-de languages-d'arts
This incredible success has been achieved by another ingredient than the progress made by Mr. Obama.
Sixth Street launched on analysis, practice, constant assessment of capacity and exhibition attitude.
Furthermore, and this is an example that Mr Obama could copy, report Linda Mikels, head of the Sixth Street, this school has introduced the instruction of the English language" completely alliance."
The total immersion in English focuses on the almost constant use of English in the instruction.
Mrs. Mikels, contrary to the knowledge education, said, "We had a huge success with a student who was coming to Mexico, 12 months later, if you were going without his class, you would have no chance to identify it."
"It's walking, seeing, 'they's a market for us'"
Mr. Obama should not take an example of the Sixth Street Prep and reply it in other schools consisting of Spanish students learning English.
The excellent results achieved by this school are talking about them, but the education policies within its party (Associations for National Education support the knowledge education) and its extreme support for knowledge education, the pronostics of Mr. Obama's response.
Although it is favourable to the immigrants to learn English, Mr Obama has recently considered this question as unsignificant, when he declares that we all have to stop the laws of English.
"Only, he says, "You have to ensure that your child speaks Spanish."
If Mr. Obama really wants to eliminate the differences, it should then consider the forms of education that function, rather than delay or consider them as insignificants.

The second Defining Time Feature for Improvement of the Team Record.
After past these eight weeks, more time than anyone in uniform Jets Shaun Ellis, the defender thought he had seen everything.
He looked at the second time when the Jets turned a 0 to 0 into a explosion.
"I've never seen anything about this kind," said Eliss.
The second time started after the Jets and the Cardinals played up with noisy warmings.
Then the quarter back Brett Favre succeeded to make a passport in Laveranues Coles allowing a 12-string touch, precursor of one after middle during which their relationship has made a bond.
Favre found Coles for other two touches, the first when a back corner fell and the second, at 10 seconds of the mid-time.
"I didn't go out of my area," Favre said about all his passports to Coles.
"It's a mediator"
"We communicate extremely well, despite what people think."

It was the best Jets could mark at a time.
"The coach of Jets, Eric Mangini, to whom we have asked to describe this fool, said, "the second time or the third?"
When the Jets said to him, "I can tell you I have appreciated the second time than the third.
"Individual points have been marked in a few times."
We're rested, overlooking the world record.
Haile Gebrselassia, Ethiopia, again proved to be worthy of his title of the best founder of the century, after struck its own record of the world in the Dünger Berlin marathon, and then becomes the first to run 26.2 thousands at less than 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory in 2:03:59 from a plate-place course, Gebrselassia shot 27 seconds his record of 2:04:26, disputed the last year in Berlin.
In 35 years, Generslassie reported the 26th record of the world of his crowd superbe during which he paid the world campionship or the World Record for any distance, from 1600 meters of the marathon.
In the last month, Gebrselassie had missed Beijing olympic marathon, fearing- may be exaggerated in today's eyes, that the pollution of the air has not enlarged its athmic problems.
On the other hand, he promised to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect-friendly consolidated conditions, 48 degrees at the start, 55 at the arrival- Gebrselassia gained Sunday, now a average impressive of a thousand in 4 minutes 43 seconds
Peace courses such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat, both of them, transformed in a background course, have contributed to the reduction of the record of the marathon over two minutes in the last ten years, since 1998, when Brazil Ronaldo da Costa wins in Berlin in 2:06:05 .
After the Sunday victory, Gebrselassie said to the reporters, missed cramps at the mollet two weeks ago, and missed training for a week.
It's obviously that the rest has allowed him to stay bright, but not wrapped.
"I'm so happy," said he to reporters.
"All was perfect.
I left it last week, and today, I had any doubts; but at the end, all went to the best."
In particular, it was reproached to Kenya, the rival is African of the Ethiopia to have too heavy its courses, avoiding the global stars of the marathon, in fact focusing on livers as if they were in a pistolet competition, and more considering global records than the sense of competition.
But this critic does not reduce the size of the capacity of Gebrselassie as a founder corner.
Sunday Gebrselassia, before four Kenians, would register a time of 1:02:04. on my way.
Two kenian election triggers, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, continued to try to Gebrselassie after the chapters of the file was lost.
To a little more than three thousands from the arrival, Gebrselassie made his final refund to detain Kwambai, which ends secondly at 2:05:36, improved its best personal record of five minutes.
Kamathis is coming third at 2:07:48.
In the female course, Irina Mikitenko, born in Kazakistan, now German citizen, has completed a remarkable year in receiving the seventh time of 2:19:19.
The English Paula Radcliffe has the global record of 2:15:25.
The last print, Mikitenko's 36 years old, surprised the whole world to Londres Marathon at 2:24:14.
She could not participate in Beijing games because of a bad hypothetics to the dose, but promised to win in Berlin by improving its third marathon, its personal record of almost five minutes.
She runs using a heavy strategy, laying the Ethiopian and Kenyans' group to take a nice benefit, and then extract them approximately 18m2 after.
Askale Tafa Margasa de Ethiopia arrived in 2:21:31, while Helena Kiprop, Kenyane, ended third at 2:25:01.
In a Ville to Part, the Orgueil and the tests of the Black Vier
In the development of its immense park, a few thousands of the insolent, lighting and gentlemen Orlando, there is a small quiet city where the fierity and the complications of African experience are born.
"Eatonville, the first city completely black to integrate, children's house of Zora Neale Hurston, this description she did in 1935, is not just as simple to do our days." The city at five lakes, three shorts of croquet, 300 founded feet, 300 good births, full of goals, two schools and not prison."
She has now become a pearl city
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the Festival Zora every year in Etonville to harm Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
And in different ways, the city she described has become touristic through its inclusion in the Florida touristic guide equipped by The Depression- was Federal Writers' Project remains a place partly.
She is also independent, worthy and private that she was not already in the 30s, when Hurston told that the black rural population of Floride was often refreshing to share its real thoughts with the white man, which "bearing us so little, didn't know what he lost".
Even if this is the year of the election of a black President, Senator Barack Obama, who also invited an open dialogue on the race theme, many here are aware of the view of the foreign.
"We are very prudent about how to tell the story," said Hortense Jones, 59 years, resident since ever and the old parishest of the city.
"The reality must be complied.
Eatonville has long been defined as a paradoxe of triumph and battle.
It is a historic model of black power and a community of almost 2400 people where poverty rate is two times the national average.
This is a central but also an example of a sub-Sudist-Swiss-South-South-South-Woomen, otherwise accompanied, which recalls the birth of the American slave.
What would explain why the residents are fiery and protectors at the time.
The interest towards the image of Eatonville was born with Zora, which everyone is called Hurston.
She presents its birth city throughout the world through sincere books, full of dialct, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in the Floride Guideline transformed this city, just located in Route 17, a road through the Floride center, often forget, which walked in the head of the black history and human drama.
Available as a huge fall in life as in literature, Hurston conducted the readers in the property store of the first Maire of Eatonville, Mr. Joe Clarke, which was then divided in several private parties.
"Get the road on the left," she wrote, "You will find the modern public school marron and white, with its gardens and the well-being gameards, which Howard Miller has always carefully, but he will hardly read and write.
She also referred to the new husband of Widow Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn's drunks of all kinds and everything that can serve transition people.
So, at least a hundred of words, Hurston associa Eatonville to a government car but also to analphabestization, recurring, and sex.
Of course, Fodor wasn't like this.
It was not actually a portion that everyone was appreciated.
Zora has well described the reality " said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the young girls of Johnson that Hurston has immortalized, circled without colour, interpreted by men who loved their beauty."
She added: "A number of people have not appreciated."
He always remembered Hurston as a living and excentric person, who was often returning back after his family moved to Jacksonville, Flat.
Augustus Franklin, 77 years old, remembered that Hurston was usually coming to town without warning, on the edge of a Chevrolet, a cigarette to the mouth and brought pantalons here, where even today, it is proud of traditional vessels.
Many residents were excited, Mr. Franklin told, while many were moving about it.
"The people were always happy to see Zora," he said.
But he added also, washing into his chains of the poster patient that gives the Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was certainly baptized, that " she never remained too long."
At the death of Hurston in 1960, she was poor and its books were out of production.
Eatonville and the whole world seemed to have forgotten him.
Although she was jacked a star of the literature, a Contemporary of Longston Hughes and the only black woman of Barnard College in the 20-year-old years, she was buried in a tomb anywhere, in Fort Pierce, Fla, where she was seeing.
In Eatonville, no great memory or plaque for the great public.
I don't think they understood the contribution or heritage that she offered to the world " said Valérie Boyd, author of "Wraped in Rainbows", a Hurston Biographie published in 2003.
A crucial moment comes in 1980.
Public officials of Orrange County wished to make a author over five ways in the city to replace the Boulevard Kennedy, main road on two ways of the community.
The development of Orlando has already reached Interstate 4 to the west Angle of the city.
The proposal was made while Etathnville was just referring to a difficult period of his story.
A forced integration, among the other things, has ended to the relatively illusic of the community.
In the 50s, the dispute on the mixture of racials conducted hatred to the doors of the community.
"In that time there, a band of white young people came to launch oranges or objects against people sitting on the coat," said Mr. Franklin.
"A lady is even dead."
They laid a past of their car" .
In a letter of 1955 addressed to The Orlando Sentinal, Hurston has certainly made the request of the Supreme Court for a forced integration, defining its decision in Brown v. Board of Education.
The residents now proclaim that the elimination of racial segregation in schools, although positively in some aspects, has spread the cohesion of Ethonville and has deployed youth confidence.
"The Black Children were usually embraced--I remember it well-- we embarked our master in the morning, and even in the evening," said N.Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins, as well as the head of the Sauvegard of the Community of Etatonville, a group does not benefit.
This was hard, added, until the time that teachers and students came no longer from the same place.
"You don't embrace your white professor, because he's white- I mean there's a cultural start line" said Mrs. Nathiri.
Citizen rights also allowed the creation of space for well-known Zora Neale Hurston-words, actors and artists who also have been prevented, such as she, a warrant of a very glad confidence and conduct lines such as: "How can they take care of my company's pleasure!"
This happens to me."
In 1975, Alice Walker writer went on the anonymous grave of Hurston and began to fight to reviv his reputation.
Five years later, an accompagned biographie on Hurston carried out by Robert E. Hemenway, a real seller, and the American songs, and the United States.
The project of the autoroute came just when the most famous girl of Etatonville had found her attraction .
And this time, the old neighbors of Hurston considered it as a salvage.
The community began to organize a festival Hurston to demonstrate the catastrophical consequences that would include this author.
A hundreds of fans came to the inauguration of the festival two years later, and many returns in January, to memorize it.
After many years, it resumed the proposal of the authorisation.
"The fiasco of the carrier on five ways, extremely fast, a real civic fierce," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd resolved all the explaining that "Zorra saved Eatonville".
The victory against the self-related project allowed him to change its own image.
Many not residents, such as Rachel Munson, were a lawyer who frequented our church since 1993, began to come to a great number, and the residents began to recover the past.
Eatonville is classified by historic city since 1998.
A monothema library (only named Hurston) will be opened in 2006 on a great Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains an anonymy for Floride: to six thousands of Orlando, she can at any time be considered as a back road after one day of staval rain, such as she was when she was founded by 27 black families in the years 1880.
(They are 90 percent of blacks today)
Foreigners who come to discover the history of Etatonville, his reason to be, are still treated with consciousness.
A majority of interviews needs to be requested, and some things such as the walls of the vial church of Etatonville, painted by white man, reflecting black men in the fields, should not be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a courageous teacher who has a weak for the red red, always fear that their island community does not understand.
However, in view of the extension of the Hurston festival, a certain level of local orgasm is emerging.
The young people, particularly, focusing on consideration of Eatonville as Hurston considered its entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, better or worse, but also fever, creative, bossy, folk and missed than the other ethnic and racial groups in America.
It is a good civic appeal that Mr. Franklin, Edwin Harvey, 18-year-old, which is intended to return to Eatonville after the college to work for the local government or for the police forces, who need additional forces.
And even for the youngest, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon of 11 years, Winter Park, it seems to have learned correctly the Eatonville description.
"The most people who walk in this area will think," "Oh, this city has nothing compared to others" Alondra Kenon said after the middle of the last Sunday.
But if you stop and take the time to complete the story, it's a very beautiful city."
Here in New York, all speak closely finance.
Although nothing has changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan had been away from the kitchen and the gentle screens in Times Square, they wouldn't understand that they were in the cyclon's eye.
They could never think only in the glass and nest offices above their teeth, bankers and cover fund managers that monopolies New York, apply the worse" working day to the office" since the crack of 1929.
The books continue to faucer on the trottoirs, with their cards and their muscles for the morning meetings.
The latin always trays between the residential immunes, such as mules, a fifty-ninth of luxury chemists to a play available on their balls.
Office employees continue to make the shock to buy their shopping sandwich for walking goods, and it is still unable to find a taxi between 16 and 19:00 a week.
I didn't feel the crises, despite the completely evilists until the summer after I decided to go open a new park account.
Hopefully I was planned to work on the end of middle, because I'm going to tell my local daughter of JP Morgan Chase, a twenty-year-old people who do the shock.
Not before the guests of the chains, nor to get away of the species or to make a verse, but before the service guest, where the usual clients commanded their cheques, the tourists asked the direction for the Macy magazine, and the new customers would work accounts.
Most of those before me, I'd learn later from Starr, my "related personal banner" would be all for the same reason as I.
Not in the same way, because they had already disappeared their economies from the smallest banks, such as the New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and the Icelands.
They disappeared their money from thirty-named building accounts (this a building society), credit associations, and the type of local parking chains and their filials that are only in a state, and they say to treat customers as their family.
In a recent time, 15 of these banks have failed.
The last days, Washington Mutual, a bank at the capital of $327, was used to the fail syndic, and the New Yorkians returned home for the week last Friday, another bank, Wachovia, to the accounts of a $440 million, was desperately seeking a buyer to save it.
The Bureau and the carriers that are before me, fearing another potential decade, translated their money to a bank that seems to be reliable, or the one that makes the most saving in Wall Street.
New Yorkians have become very familiers in the world in the finance last weeks.
"I heard a dame to my local Chinese supermarche, speaking to the phone of Lehman Brothers, the bank that has done wrong, and his Master Director Dick Fuld, with the same family she could have criticised a college.
And Lyn, the uniform conciery of my immeuble, has changed the subject of our ordinary talk about Brad and Angelina or delivery of my fruit and vegetables.
She told me, following my visit to the bank. "I have put all my economies in the currency market.
"I changed, I don't want to take a risk."
Muslim Tomes were profaned while Austria is obliged to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, who left the right island of Austrian Freedom Party and , Philip Dewinter from Belgian Right Vlaams Belang, participate in a manifestation to present the "Citys against Islamization" in Antwerp, Thursday 17 January 2008.
They have red panels to illustrate red furnitures.
The police appeals the extremists of the right to profane a muscle of Australian museum, the weekend of the victory of extreme political parties on the general elections of the country.
More than 90 tombs were seriously disappeared in the Traun cemetery cemetery, near Linz, between Friday and this morning; it was according to the police, organised action.
Delivery have thrown on several tombs, Jewish symbols such as David's Story; detectives believe that it could be done to deceive the feelings of hate of extremists to musulman immigrants.
This accident could be in any way related to elections.
A portion of the islamic local community has stated that it was "profundly chucked" at the announcement of this profanation, which is just during the religious month of the Ramadan, which touches its end.
Austria is seriously thinking to find his strongness, following its oscillation towards the right at the parliamentary elections.
The two sides of extreme right-to-right, which were almost 30 per cent of the votes, the Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, conducted an anti-immigration campaign. Some of their slogans were even considered, according to the critics, such as xenophobes.
Heinz-Christian Strache, Chief of Freedom Party, who gained more than 18 percent of the votes, conducted its campaign against the foulard and bottle port, and even expressed its opposition to alaha food.
During his final course in Vienna, he spoke about "European brotherhood" to avoid Islam's month.
The two parties are trying to prevent the construction of muscles and mines, proclaiming that they would be a political symbol of the islamization of Austria and Europe.
The songs and analysis just after the elections have defined the extreme right as the strongest political block of the country, which is demonstrated by the majority of young voters who have made the difference because their future is concerned in the European Union.

The Kent police said that it would not discuss particular cases or potential movements from Glitter in the state.
An open word of the Kent police said: "The Kent police will make everything necessary to protect our children as foreigners.

"I photograph the master out of the scene to capture the elements of his character" Günther Bauer - Photography
No tall, no swimming clothes.
The sense of the grand masters of the flamenco, freed from all tensions to get the man or woman's appearance.
On the one side the artist.
Otherwise, the person.
Insufficient, except in the intimity, in those unknown moments of the great public, where you are discovered to intimid gestures and views of artists that are not concerned to mount on scene.
The Alejand Günther Bauer melange in "Flamenco - people" the theatrity of some scanners with songs, dansers and guitarists with this less known side of artists.
In this project, the photograph reflects the particular iconographie of the flamenco under different Englishs.
Including in the Planning of Photography Flamande, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, greater every day," the Creator explains that "Flamenco - people" may be anybody but, after seeing the photos, the observer considers that it is not typical arts on scene.
These people photographed "in the street" are the artists capable of transmiting on the scene of passion, tristeness, joy ... in captiving public.
To catch these artists' personality moments, you must not do photos on scene.
They have a personality and a own character.
What I was interested was creating an intime atmosphere that allowed me to catch with the photograph of the stars of the flamenco's stars. "
With the "Populated Chant des Mines", Bauer started a long journey to photograph changing, guitarists or dancing with a plate photo device.
These are portraits that, through the selection of the camera and the material, remember the classic photography.
The implementation of various styles breaks with the classic side of the image, giving him a touch of modernity, this reflects the perception of flamenco according to Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that are evoluting and surrounding every day."
It is not the dance nor the singing in himself, but the personality and the character of the artist who arrests the public with his art.
The search for the sense and magie was the constant work that the day is present at the El Fotómata galerie.
The flamenco views like Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others are part of the selection made from approx.
The project has been transformed into a flamenco anthology, which will soon be published in a recording book of portraits expressed to the gallery.
The passion for Bauer portraits brought it to repeat the idea two years ago with the "SportARTProject Ports".
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco - people", the photograph adds that he would like people's portion, knowing them and able to enter into their life for a longer or less moment.
I think that the portion in the photograph is the most difficult manner.
You're finding you in front of people, persons that sometimes you don't know or who leave you just a few minutes to make them a photo.
Although these circumstances, as a photograph, I'm still trying that my ideas become real."
This carrier collection of the active flamenco called "Flamenco - people", is presented to the Galerie El Fotómata, situated at the 20th street of Mata (parallel to Peupleirae de Hercule) which will be opened until 16 October next.
Vargas Llosa recognizes the Roman that he wrote is "audience"
The Roman is deployed in places that nobody knows and treats unknown subjects, but once again, Mario Vargas Llosa is well decided to advance the new project on which he worked, a Roman who has a main person Roger Casemant, an Irish national who lived twenty years in the Congo and passed through Amazonia.
The favorite to the Nobel Price of Litterature confessed yesterday at the Hayival Segovia festival, that the Roman who currently occupies it is "the real audience" and that "all demonstrates that it should not write it".
"If I was reasonable, I wouldn't do it, but I'm going to do it and I hope it to end," has he concluded in his intervention to the exchange festival of ideas and thoughts that had seen difficulty in the city of the acquiring a hundreds of writers, stories and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The city and the dogs" was the most expected person of the third edition of this festival and filled its contract.
Vargas Llosa, who paid the price of Hay Festival to most of the participants's votes, made a complex room at the theater John Bravo.
The presenter of the Festival, Félix Romeo, retracted the birth of an excited public who had not seen the past time during which the Peruvian, with a wonderful memory and with a great humor dose, retracted the birth of his literary call, which was given to "sa soif of read" and "to live new experiences"; how he wrote of a "modous metodical manary" through an intense documentation work, correcting and recycling a part of the text to do with his "ispiration manager"; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexander Dumas influent his vocation and comments of his Romans.
The Spanish-American Roman recognized that " there is no means" to measure and to know whether the books change life. "But I refuse to believe that literature is a clean, an ephesy experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it was "a other effects" and "at least similar people", because we were asked to writers "no let to go to the frimousity" and to assume their vocation.
Pozoblanco's bad time shot the faither
The festival of the banders that concluded the roof courses of the Pozoblanco Fier was stopped yesterday after the horse tours were verified that the arden was impratic.
In this way, the organization committee, in agreement with Fermin Bohórquez, Paul Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonard Hernández, decided to suspend the celebration of the tariff course.
The bad time was stolen on this feet, since, finally, two feasts on three couldn't have been able to get place.
Samedi is the rain which prevented the celebration of the second tariff course.
On the appearance, there was José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and John Bautista, who had to be faced in the Arne of Castilblanco.
This is the only feast of Friday a place
Friday, the winner was Daniel Luke who cut three ears and was thrown into triumph, after making hand moves to the bottle with skin and skin.
On the next afternoon, Alejandro Talavante concluded on two bands planted on the pair of the bull and a cut ear that the flights discovered applauded more than its battle in himself with the bottle.
Better for El Juli, who entered into the rivers of Los Bauos without penalty or glory.
In the battle with the second taureau, after a clearly better fight, the most of the public was self-sufficient.

Heather Locklear Actrice arrested for having conducted a medicine
Heather Locklear, the famine Amanda of the telephone Melrose Place series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Bárbara (California) to have been conducted in the effect of a medicine.
A witness seemed to make it amazing managers by trying to get out of his garage in Montecito, as a Californian police carrier has devoted the people's revue.
The testimony indicated that at 16:30 Locklear was "founded on the accelerator, making a lot of noise, trying out the garage car, and walking a few times back, she runs on her sun moon."
A few times later, the witness, who at the beginning didn't recognize the actor, saw Locklear stopped in the middle of the autoroute and went out of his vehicle.
This person at this time called the emergency services because it was concerned for the life of Locklear.
When the police's carrier arrived, she found the actor sitting inside its vehicle, which was partly blocking the road.
"There had the oriented air," that is why the officers brought it to the specialized centre in drugs and alcohol to realize a test.
According to a police door, the agent has been cooperative and the alcohol abuse has been disappeared since the beginning, although "the observer of police officers at first view, we think that Locklear was found under the influence of a medicine."
Locklear was understood that he had conducted under the effect of a substance that has not been specified and was incarnated at 19:00 and left a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear went out of the clinic from the Arizon where she was intertained to sown a nervous depression.
Callares requested the ethical Federation of the Union to assess its responsibilities in the case of Silva
The General Coordinator and Deputy of the Union, Gaspar Llamazares, said today that it is the regional Federation to take a decision on the case of the former Joung Advisory and Sports of the Seville Municity, Francisco Manuel Silva, who has released the last week after he was accused to make favorite treatments to the members of his family.
"In this case, I am very federalist, and that will be the ethical organization who must take its responsibilities," said Laclazares regarding the conduct of the political party that it should be adopted within the Seville municipal Council.
However, the leader of the Union has asked that investigations make evidence of "transparency" for the irregularities that Silva could come: "The Gauche Union has always defended this kind of business to have a maximum transparency degree."
He also emphasized that the political party has "the very strict ethical codes for all officials".
"Sangre de Mayo," the busy wall of Garci
In inspiring the comments of Benito Pérez Galdós, José Luis Garci revealed the famous spanish battle against the French in "Sangre de Mayo", which is the most ambitious film of his film with about 15 million euros.
The cinéaste tried to "to scann the many persons and to explain social analysis" which he always advised in the work of the Roman Christian, and explicitly explicitly today during the presentation of the film, with whom Goodiérrez and Paula Echevar would be on the head of the long list of actors.
The movie of a period of more than two hours and half, "Sangre de May" will take its exit in the next Friday cinem rooms, which will then become a television series of more than four hours.
The great admirator of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci assures that he had done with this "un dream of child" thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who charged it, three years ago, to turn a commamatic film for the two hundreds of the 2 May Madrilyne, which he always accepted when the record was on the national historical facts.
The 15 million euros provided by the Madrid Community represents a "unique opportunity" to reproduce with the decades and the appropriate clothes of the "Spain" a leader for the fight, because the fight for independence led the people to refreshments under the Kingdom of Ferdinand VII, reported.
But the cinéast regrets that he had not obtained a financing as for the films" Captain Alatrist" or "The fantoms of Goya" - more of the double of that obtained for "Sangre de Mayo" - because he couldn't turn some scenes written in a script signed by Horacio Valcárcel, with which he collaborated during almost all its cards.
The cinema of "Volver started" has influenced its usual way to work on the scene of the actors, with which he has the usual to repair before starting the tournament and which he does not casting, because it seems to "husting" and considers that "the role of the cineast is to go to the theatre and cinem to keep informed."
Many actors in the "Sangre de May" repeated before the camera, like Miguel Rellán, Carlos Laarrañaga or Fernando Guilen Cuervo.
Four times candidate to Oscar (when he gained one), Garci believes that the three candidates films representing Spain this year at the Hollywood Academy," Sangre de Mayo »," Seven French billard tables » and finally the winner," the blind tournasols," are not representatives of the young Spanish cinemema, "which would like to be better known," said he.
With this Garci film, he doesn't wait for a price.
"On the beginning you believe you're working for seed, then you're noting that you're working that for prosperity, and now you're pleased to make a movie more", says Garci after more than 30 years of professional card.
Isabelle Bayón stands in the hair of the Sevillan Dance Tertola Valencia
A sevillan dance will be harmful to a dance also sevillane.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, a father's daughter (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and a mother Andalouse (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), is born in Triana, who is three years old to live in London with his family.
It was a free and special danser of Eastern Dances.
She became a passionate, pioneer of the release of the woman, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was buddhist and vegetarian and pledged for the abolition of the corte, which prevented the free movement of women.
The life of this woman who marked the story of the dance in Europe of the middle-border, was excited by Isabelle Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa and this last proposed me to interpret the Sevillane Dance Tórtola Valencia and it became me incredible."
According to the dance, "We don't try to tell his life but to translate his way to think.
The titles of his dance made me think about the flamenco.
So, "la danse of the papillon" made me think of a populary dance of Cuban and the dance of the serpent at some tangos.
Her dance was sensitive, and they told me that my way to dancing was identical to herself," she said.
The scene was made through two remarkable contributions: the of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabela in one of his spectrums, as he had done to "The open door"; and the professor Matilde Coral, who has expressly wanted to cooperate with the teacher who was his teacher.
"Matilde transforms Turtola into a mature personality.
I'm glad because she accepted playing a role in my work and it honors me."
The building was also made through the musical composition and the guitars of Jesus Torres y Paco Arriaga, the popular song of Michel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi de Morón; the slaughters of El Pajaro, and the viol of Rafa El Viola, and the cooperation of a actor, Johnfra Juárez, "which plays the role of the world partner of this kind of artists who were considered as dives".
This work also tells, in some way, the life of the woman who has been expressed in such far-related places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States or Russia, but also in all Europe, as it usually remained in London.
"I wanted to remember it because I think these women who have a huge influence in their time and now no one knows and does not appreciate its work," said Bayón.
The spectrum will begin at 20:30 at Vega's Lope Theater
The publication of the "Journal of a recent married poet" concludes the Trinate
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Journal of A recently married Poet" in the Church of Saint Stephen in New York, where John Ramón Jimenez married with Zenobia in March 1916, is included in the framework of the activities provided by the Ministry of the Cultural Cultural Cultural of Antalonia to celebrate the "Trienat Zenobia and John Ramón" (2006-2008), organized in order to memorize the fifteenth anniversary of the concession of the Nobel Prix of Litérature and their death.
In this way, the "Trienat Zenobia and John Ramón" comes to his end with the reform of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Museum Nobel and with the famous exhibition "John Ramón Jimenez: this little light" which was inaugurated in May last month and, after seen in the various andalous provinces, will go to New York at the International Congresss.
In the same way, the Ministry of the Cultural Cultural of Andalusia has bought eight hundreds of the Exemplary of a recent married poet, equipped by Peter Tabernero and illustrated by Jameso Pérez-Enciso to continue the work of one of the most known poetes.
America likes less than Paul Newman
"Now God creates perfect people
Paul Newman's most part."
This phrase is the actrice Sally Field, who worked with him in "Assence of malice", and illustrates the desire of the American cinemam, and all America, faces the frauding idea that Newman is no more than this world.
He had the penalty to get Oscar
It was no longer returned since 2007.
Everyone knew he was sick.
It was a hard knock for everybody.
"Whatever one feels about any expression, and now I lost a great friend," weep Robert Redford, "My life and my country were better thanks to his existence."
Nobody was afraid to make a ridiculous or exaggerate.
One of the fathers of the cinem and of the country died during a particular dark period, where terrorists and busy markets fear, the expansion of the Americans is very low, looking for dignity reasons.
When the time are so hard and without reason to live, it remains for human beings only for the admiration and is not necessary to be Luis Ceruda to love Paul Newman.
He incarned for everyone a ideal of beauty and truth.
He was Richard Nixon's enemy and the defender of lost and vain causes, such as the foundation for anti-drogues created in the honor of his old one died after a surdose and the creation of its own biomark.
This was a victory for a country which had the penalty to impose against a sustainable food culture.
This expansive wage of balediatization of Hollywood without taking attention nor to nationalities or passports.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, found that one of James Bond died before him.
Another English, the oscarised Sam Mendes, said to work with Newman, he marked the sum of his card.
The bad boy came from Australia, Russell Crowe, bowed name Newman as his greatest inspiration.
"He put us the upper bar," remarked George Clooney, who might be the only one today who tries to perceive the screen as Paul Newman did: being very honnest and having a serious and far-related private life.
It is not always easy or possible in the median jungle of our days.
But there is one who tries, and Paul Newman is an example.
After a divorce, he was married for fifty years in Joanne Woodward, who was even faithful if the opportunities had not lacked him to be it.
"But why should I eat a hamburger out of my house, if I have a drink in my fridge?"
In the sky, he assists with orgueil to meet his daughters with his fans on earth, something that is not so ordinary in America.
"Parmi all the great roles he has interpreted, he has never been so gentle as the divorced husband, the loving father, the great attentioned and phillanthrop," he says.
Madrid in the 2016 Olympic Game Organization
And yes, the dream of many of us is that Madrid could organize Olympic Games, after the end of 2012, that could be achieved in 2016.
But I'm asking if we're ready.
If we take the example of the course to yesterday, we are not!
They call him the perfect course, but according to me, it was the worst course I never participated.
If they had taken into account all the errors occurred during the course, they would be subject to an eliminative note.
But let's consider in detail and since the beginning.
The errors start with the removal of doseards, which allows you to go forward.
This is not bad, but if they make you move that would be better than they give you (including the electronic puce for courses).
And well not.
They did you go there only to take the dose (first error, move for it) and (as a long waiting file) surprise! There was only the 'C' size for the maillot (two error, because I need a XL size)
In what world lives we?
Is it because of the crisis they decided to buy only small postlots with less weight and less sweet?
Well, this is nothing about what happened the course day.
Besides the fact that you need to go very early to remove the e-mail push, the waiting file is 15 minutes and, further, need to leave its bag at the entrance.
The expectant has long more than 35 minutes, that is incomprehensible because 11,000 people are waiting for these courses.
Since there was a long waiting file, the competitions started and we didn't have left our bag at the entrance, although once done, the removal was worse.
Furthermore, the rain accompanied the expectation of more than 40 minutes during which the rebellions and seats of the baraque occurred.
I believe that about 500 people will have the pneumonia tomorrow, and some people like me, we don't even think in classification with the exact time, because of the push they gave me that, I think, did not mark the departure correctly.
Of course, if they asked me to cite a perfect example of course, this would not be the idea.
So I think we can always dream to become the hotel city for the J.O. 2016.
Microsoft searches for a receptor (virtual)
At the MIT Microsoft's MIT technologies, a new human recognition and interaction system has been presented, a species of Artistic Intelligence issued by little intelligence but capable of fulfilling some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a boat to move to the company campus) in response to what it was asked during a conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a system of recognition of forms and faces, this "receptionist" may know how many people are in the place they are - including remembering what posts they take - and listen to and listen to the key words of their conversations.
But also join them according to conversation groups
In the presentation video, the receiptist describes a third person, but it understands that it is not the group who is currently to speak with it and that it is not part of the company.
She asked her if she's here to visit someone and she told her she'll answer her in a few moments.
All this without a blue screen.
Printing.
But of course it represents the future.
Now the company has other things on which, for example, focus on the next version of its operational system, Windows.
This week we spoke in more about a strategie change in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be easier and there will be so many related programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that if the computers were sold with the indispensable place of unnecessary applications, they would be five times faster.
This represents a discovery because Microsoft, version after version, has not stopped adding functions and extracts to Windows.
Strategy change is welcome.
Microsoft has reasoned, his operational system lost an important but also its software.
When Google Chrome arrived on the network, I was one of those who joined the theory as Google Chrome is the first start of Google to make competition in Windows.
Many people just emphasized as a web browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be needed because it is the foundation essential to understand information and software.
He takes the same function as your wife or your husband when you have to say something to your beauty.
That's true.
It will never disappear but we must see the "mortal" of the operational system not as an absolute truth but as a relative truth.
This week, Ballmer confirmed this idea.
People do not less attention to the operational system but more on the web browser.
Only the computer will be circulated to make the Firefox, Explorer or Chrome tour, and every day people use more time to navigate on the Internet than to use windows.
To whom are the half of the applications provided with the system?
Whoever can at least.
And Windows 7 will contain less applications, much less than Vista.
Most hard, months income, less complex.
To date, Microsoft is more interesting in launching their own online services so that they will finally become an alternative to Google.
They do not necessarily need this, and I show you an example.
The photograph presented in this article was taken at the beginning of this month in one of the restrooms reserved to the employees of Microsoft in Redmond.
On the drink distributor, one shows their request to use their own search tool - "These Search. Our future".
In 2006, a study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees used to search on Internet information.
Last week a breakdown occurred in the new Windows Mobile 7.
It will not go out at the beginning of 2009 but to the end of 2009 or to see in 2010.
Microsoft will certainly try to run at the same time Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is more like a computer.
But the starting of Android was late and the iPhone is already on the market, that would cost them lovely.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Paul Picasso's turning on the Costa d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio was in the 'Diamant of blood' d'Edward Zwick, as Al Pacino in 'The Parrain' of Francis Ford Coppola and is part of the holding of the muscled gays.
And if we set out all his appearances, we could also cite this costume moustachu, which leaving weights in a walking circles.
It's not only a simple male postlot in coton, mood and without manners.
The English calls 'tank' but the Brüssel Marcel Fabulous in Brussels is different among all others.
First of all, by his name flashboyant - although he is known under the name "Marcel" - who has to see with the sport because he takes the name, according to the legend, the Marcel Cerdan boxer, a friend of the Songly Edith Piaf.
Marcel is distinguished from others by its excellent coton, by its uniex coupe, by its different logo and by the small Belgian drag (subsequently recognizable) that the most known body postlots have in the cock.
But attention, because the Belgian brand does not only produce tanks tops.
But it also produces sweat-shirt, back boxers, cardigans in cacher, coton screens, babies, mini-shorts...
Lodges designed for the comfort of sub-vestments.
Even if it's damage to bring them only as subvestments.
They're too charming.
"I want to become a young mother; the candidate doesn't worry about me."
His enormous comparison with his sister has not prevented her to develop its own personality.
Monica Cruz is small but full of viability.
Currently, Cruz sisters are very serious of their new activity in the mode.
According to Monica, they are not only beautiful and famous girls who give their name.
It was presented to the promotion that the Mango brand had made to Paris at its new social seat, as well as to the presentation of the most important prices of the mode than the Spanish sponsory house.
Monica is warm and fearful.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I even created for Mango for the new automne-hiver season, but also to assist the second edition of the Mango Fashion Awards and the dinner of Opera in Valentino.
A very intense day but, at the same time, exciting, waits for us.
What is your new collection created for Mango for this fourth season?
The cinemma of the years 50 and 60 loves us, and we inspire it much for our collections.
I love a lot of bailing me in the city and watching the women to see how they're shot, how they combine their clothes, I'm often doing it.
You're a very polyvalent woman, you don't know?
I think yes, but at the end, all together and these activities have many things in common.
Since I was the whole small clothes, I would like to go to my grandmother to look at the armors of my grandmother and to see his clothes.
It was gentle, almost better than going to atracting park.
Then, when I became dancing, I always tried to take care of my way to clothe me.
Dancers love very well living for courses and tests, to look in the middle and feel well.
And in the role of the actrice, when you put your clothes, it's where you actually put you into the hair of the person.
So, it's all associated.
You haven't been 30 years old. Is it hard for you?
Nothing.
I feel better than ever, my 30-years are glad.
I find that the woman is more sweet, has more experience and saves life with less problems.
Biological hours don't be afraid.
I did all the things I wanted to do from the little, and that gave me much luck inside.
So, you think you're gonna become mom?
Of course, I want to become mom because my body asked me and, though, I want to become a young mother; I don't want to lose it.
I don't worry about the candidate.
What I'll do is give much happiness to my son and remove it with a lot of love.
Let's go to the cinem, you're waiting for the different films you turned last year.
That's true, I felt they're out.
I, who is a woman about the theatre, am very comfortable and worried, I would like to have everything now, but of course it is not possible.
I felt the films 'the last hour' and 'In searching for the tomb of Christ'.
See what you'll think about...
A few days ago you started on the past with Naomi Campbell, right?
Don't get this!
I'm not moving on the trail to make the mannequin.
Only, Naomi Campbell called me, I know her for a bad time, to invite me to participate in London to a challenge of well-being for his association for supporting women and clothes that we expressed - I expressed two clothes of our creative collection for Mango - were sold to buyers for money for Naomi's ONG.
The people Naomi is a person in the heart of dance.
They say so many things about her, I know her, many things are not true.
Furthermore, it's a good side of Naomi.
She asked me to delay for a very nice reason, but if she asked me to make the weed, I would have done it even.
The important is making life better to women in the third world.
The alcool records on the flower will need to install the 'alcolock' system
The Minister of the Interior wants the conductor who had more than three administrative sanctions for alcohol, to install a system that prevents the starting the vehicle in the state of ice or if it is not soft.
The initiative has already been announced in the last month of June and now appears in the report of the Minister of State in which this initiative is considered as a pilot project that will be held a year.
Its goal is the reintegration of the conductor by proposing road revival courses.
The Minister of State for Road Safety, but also the Directorate-General for Route Safety and the Fundation Institute for Car Safety Institute will participate in this initiative.
According to the statistics, 30% to 75% of the cars arrested for more than one time in the state of disbursement, the car returns.
The alcohol would avoid that because it is a rayed system on the vehicle which measures the alcohol rate in the hall and prevents the starting of the vehicle if the driver does not sow; or when the driver's alcool rate is higher than the authorized.
Its cost is more than 1.000 euros and is at the charge of the conductor.
In this regard, a study carried out to the United States in 2007 showed that the vehicles equipped with this device reduced to 65 per cent of the crimes during the first year of installation.
And in Spain we think this could save life to 115 persons every year.
The measure is that administrative sanctions for two reasons: face these behaviour before they become criminal offences.
And facilitate its implementation, since legal reform can be made by regular ways but the reform made by criminal means requires reform of the organic law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in no commercial form, although some industrial and functional vehicles already have an expert.
On the morning, the Deputy Congress will vote in an initiative of Spanish socialist party, which proposes to install in school buses this system as has been done in France.
In Mexico without peep-toes
At 17.40 p.m., proposed official time, the Spanish aircraft aircraft in which the Princess of Asturies traveled to the President of the Benito Airport Juárez of Mexico.
The sun was at the sight of sleeping, but his races were still obliged to put his hand in the visual guises to see the king's couple down from the air.
The Spanish ambassador and other authorities were present at the foot of the scatter.
A few hours before I asked on the street, the taxi chauffeur, if it was the fact that the Spanish Princess had visited the city to end their official trip.
- Oh, well, so we can't go to the airport to take clients at this time, or then...
- No, not sir, I'm Spanish, but I've been alive here two years.
- Oh, very good...
But the Mexicon press very well knows who are the Princess of the Asturies and knows the importance of travel.
They are numerous to wait in the hangar of the airport near the red taste and a military rang consisting of 27 marine soldiers.
The Prince is sore and sorrowing of sea blue, the Princess, when he has the hair to the wind, is very sorrowful and not bringing its 'sauts'; perhaps they said to her that a prayer was meant.
They make a short stop at the photos before you go into the room where the official court is waiting for them.
At the door of the hotel where they log in, one of the four largest hotels in the city, a regular mexican television journalist is waiting for them.
The most pregnant price of the mode
There is certainly no more appropriate place in the world to present a mode price than Paris and certainly there is no extraordinary and good designer than Valentino.
Mango comes to submit the second edition of Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to strengthen the international image of the new talents of the mode.
The winner will be rewarded by a price of EUR 300,000.
Here Sandrina Fasoli, the Belge outcome of the first edition, looked at its models in the vitrine of Mango at 54 bulevard housesmann in Paris and she wept almost with emotion.
Of course, this is the second largest stock of the brand in Europe, which comes to be inaugurated with 1.335 square metres of surface.
The first bucket is located in London.
The events, as well as the desire to thank the Valentino Stylist, President of the Concours jury, made that we were found in a luxury dinner at Paris's opéra.
With the close table of the Chagals extraordinary family, the presidential table prepared by Mango, was still more spectcular.
Having grown on the heart and doing it against the evil good heart, because of the last one died of his brother, Nati was put a man's clothing and a few parks of ELAH, who knocked the soup, and arms, under his son Luis - a beautiful man of almost two meters of high – she came to Valentino to her dinner prepared in his honor.
Andik, Mango owner, a galant man, as well as Rotchil's Baron ended the night without warton because they had been prepared for two dames.
Monica Cruz, who presented to the store with a pantalon and a chemite – of his own collection - and which was to dinner metamorphosed by enduring a long sexy and black robe, was emoted when during the night visit of the Opera, accompanied by Goya Toledo, they showed us the room of the repairs of the ballets and remembering the good old time, she took one of the bars and made the manager of a greater.
The Inés Saster has not left for the visit of the palace dependences, but she has shown us before his portable phone of his son's photos.
On the next morning, we were pleased to see Olivier Martínez – another beautiful man who moves in moto - and John Travolta, who came to the intercontinental hotel of Paris, with his draps, his servants and asked for the prealable, that there are no owners in his room.
stars under Paris's stars.
Oh, there's life.
1001, the number of antistress
There is only 1000 but 1001 ways to forget chaos and freezing daily life.
And to cut all, they're all repertoired in a book that will make a relax to the library on 30 September.
The moon moon attracted us almost when he sounds every morning at 7:00, but it's even worse when we think of the aggressive rith that we impose the current life.
The office is a tension synonym and the dull computer.
Stress represents the badness of the 20th century.
But there are no one or two methods to combat daily fatiage and problems related to the work world.
But it's 1001, not one of more or less.
Apart from the positions of yoga, the classic mass or the 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott gathers together on the pages of a book all a "menu" of methods adapted to the goat and time of each one.
The anti-stress work is understood '1001 ways to spread' and will happen to the libraries directly from the editor Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone believes that it is not possible to get quietness in places such as work or through personal relations, this is a "manual" means such a credibility.
Furthermore, this manual offers other methods such as contact with nature or income 100% natural receipts that will be extended to you.
If the adrenal is not short in your vessels to restore the balance of your body and if the stress has become a problem, it's time to sit in the canapé, disconnect from his mind and focus on reading.
Sleeping and sleeping
Some kids speaking during the night.
I don't relate to those who are very wake up by telling us something that has happened before, but to the children who speak during their sleep.
The first time that happens, it can surround you, but actually it is not important.
It's a blessing highlight of the sleep called dream.
It's enough often, especially in children and adolescents.
It's sure there's more than one who speaks during the night.
This phenomenon may appear very sporadic (e.g., once in life with a strong fibre episode), or more periodic (all days, once per week, once per month ...), the day after the child is not remembered anymore.
There is no single reason that determines its appearance
They are often linked to other elevations of sleep, such as shocks, night-terms, night-terms, nocturne eruptions (pip feet) or somnambulism, but it is not always the case.
As we have already said before, they may also be connected to very strong figs, stress situations or superstitious situations.
Of course, it's a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it is also very variable.
He can speak with a small quiet voice, with isolated words, murmures or otherwise with crystals, crystals, long talks ...
In the case that the dream is very frequent, it would be worthy to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check whether there is a problem that causes a lot of anxiety and to get an explanation to this problem.
We said that it is a blessing highlight, therefore there is no treatment, except it is linked to another summit highlight that can be signed (e.g. if it is related to a sleep or stress appointment).
What we can do is take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try to not excite the child before you go to sleep.
Therefore, seeking quiet games and avoiding televisioned programs or series that are more or less violent.
With very nervous children and who have difficulty to spread, relaxation techniques can be used to help them to calm insidely.
This will allow the child to have more peaceful sleep.
Since the dreams appear to be quiet.
Remember that they're inaccessible for the child and that the next day he won't remember what happened.
Used Councils
Don't wake up.
It's unnecessary because it's unconscious and you wake up.
Even if he's talking, he's staying there and then.
Recall that if it is very angry in several times, it is advised to consult a doctor or to check what causes so much anxiety in the child.
If you understand what he says (this is not usual), you don't have the attempt to ask it to get information.
You won't get anything, because you sleep, it's not aware to organize his thought.
Furthermore, you will hear what he says, but you won't know what it's about to dream, then take care of how you'll interpretate the information and conclusions you're going to give it.
Don't tell the baby that you can ask it during the night to know his secrets.
You don't even lay it up.
This causes a lot of anxiety.
Finally, don't worry, that's nothing bad, it's a episode that takes only a few minutes.
Easy... ultimately
Illhaeusern finally found the path of the victory on his ground after a long period of distant.
Without making a big match, the Jaunes and Blacks have been created the largest number of opportunities and have successed to transform one for the gain of the game.
The rhythm was not very supported during this meeting where the attackers had disappointed to express himself.
After a first attempt of the Captain visitor Kauffmann who had the luxury on a distant road, Illhaeusern would take lightly the acetane and turn to the founderflick from far, then with Hirn on top, the Romein of the door of his feet or the Diabold had come to clothe the defence of Dannemarie.
In front, we were blocked in the middle of the terrain and just left Riahi's respiratory at the point of the attack.
The second start of the second time would be decided with first two occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the score for the Illhousians by Marais, well placed to resume a ballo on a first trial of Diabold (53e).
But the Illhousian buster will not be able to save his long happiness and will be obliged to rejoin the clothes a ten minutes later and then leave its coachpipes in digital invariableness.
But Dannemarie will not be able to benefit and won't have great problems with an illhousian Onz who just had just relaxed a little for "compact" its defence, horror in the last seconds of the game where, after a great coffee, the balloon was very close to the transverse.
Sarkozy to meet fishermen in anger
Before you flight for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a decline by Britain.
In view of the demonstration of fishery forces that have strongly perturbed the access of several breast and normal ports, the President of the Republic decided to take on Friday to the port of the Guilvinec in the Finnistry to meet them.
The last promised to receive it "in a constructive spirit" and they hope that he will come with concrete proposals.
A presidential visit that falls at the same time as a general meeting of the "Crise Committee" established by breast fishermen to get measures against gas prices, which has reached a record at more than 1.14 euros by average liter.
According to the David Martinon port, the President will "discut with them solutions that can be imagined to help their undertakings to find competitiveness and to secure the conditions of employment and marine reward."
Nicolas Sarkozy is waiting for close feet by fishermen.
Morning morning, they performed scargot operations in Morbihan and Calvados, offering boats around 10 km.
Quiberon's packing port was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-Isle were not stopped.
A filtering barrier has been carried out on the Quiberon island pressure.
The mariners have already shown their determination by burning, from the air, pits and pallets before the Brest port deposits, and Lorient, while manifestations had come to Concarneau or Saint-Briuk.
The movement was extended to other ports of the Atlantic façade and Manche, such as the Olonne Sables, in Venezuela, where the chalutiers were left to cut, or in Hebrew, where a twentieth boat blocked the movements of trade boats.
The fishermen in La Turballe and Crocic, in Loire-Atlantic, stopped on the evening block of the large raffinerie total of Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer decided to wait for the meeting of the ministry meeting to the Ministry to decide eventual actions.
In Guilvinec, the "Crise Committee" must indeed decide on Tuesday of the follow-up to move and participate in the Ministry of Agriculture and Praise in Paris.
But some breast fishermen do not want to be represented by responsible of the National Fisheries Committee, which did not support their movement.
"The Greece will continue" because "the fishermen will not leave anything" and "not want to move to Paris", for example, said Lyiliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fish Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay taxes on the gas, are at present approximately 50 centimes per liter but they believe that a boat's rentability seat has reached only with a gas lower than 0.30 euros.
Paul Newman the greatest
"Butch Cassidy and Kid" are dead by the suites of a cancer, in the age of 83, in his home of the Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford or still Sam Mendes welcomed the cinema legend and the involved actor, Paul Newman, died in the age of 83.

By 228 votes against 205 for, representatives refused the secretariat to the Treasury Henry Paulson's means he asked.
Approximately two Republics on three rejected its plan.
"It's a bad signal sent to the market, which sees the Congress unable to adopt a plan," said Lindsey Piegza, FTN Finance.
"This point shows what the market contained on this plan," added, fearing that a project adopted within several days would be "third."
"If the project is effectively dead abonded (...) then the relax will be rapidly passed to the Fed (the Central American Bank, ndlr) and other central banks to manage the crisis, which would retain more credit conditions," Brian Bethune, an economic chief in Global Insight.
And further emphasising the emergency, "All day that passes the crime of a financial institution" to the United States, Mrs Piegza has emphasized.
Following Washington Mutual Mutual Friday, the authorities organized the removal of the banking activities of Wachovia by its Citigroup rival.

Obama, Vendor at the point of the first televisional duty
In the first Friday discussion between the two candidates in the White House, he succeeded another to know who, John McCain or Barack Obama, took it.
Without surprise, the Republic and Democratic Czech campaigns declared their own victory in that television duty which would be followed by a third of the American families.
The policy analysis David Gergen believes that the performance of John McCain, although honorable, was not enough "brilling" to allow him to decrease his decline in his 5 weeks of the presidents.
The Gallup Institute, which was published on the same day, granted five points to Obama (49 per cent to 44 per cent to McCain), judges that it is the democracy who throwed the game's ping.
In indicis elections, which are accounting, Obama has been winning for 39% of the sounds, while 25% of them grant the victory to McCain, according to CBS sondage.
Obama should be able to confirm its progress Thursday with the good performance of his collaborator, Joseph Biden, during the first and unique public debate with his rival, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake of sub-examining it.
She's a good instincts, however, preved Bill Clinton this weekend.
McCain's seventh anniversary had not stopped putting up before his insufficient experience in foreign policy, while emphasising its adversary on these issues in the heart of this first face-aface.
"The Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
"I don't believe that Senator Obama has experience and knowledge necessary to be President," he also assured.
An attraction angle married since yesterday in the republiced televisioned publications.
Obama emphasized him that he represented the future.
Without demonstrating, it was shown concise and precise.
He made its capacity to take the good decisions and to restore the image of the United States in the world.
"McCain has not always understood, while Obama, yes," reiterated this week-end, a democratic spot responded to the Republic of having not taken the entire measure of the impact of the crisis on the "Amerika of the street".
"In the eighteenth minutes of discussion, John McCain had a lot of things to say about me, but nothing about you, said Obama, yesterday, before 20,000 meetings for an electional meeting in North Caroline under a battle race.
It has not even proclaimed the words "medial class" or "traven other"." The financial benefit of Obama, which is considered by the Americans as the most likely to save the economy at the side of the precipitation.
"The coming week could be a decisive tournament," he thought, yesterday, the democratic Senator Charles Schumer influences.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, an elderly of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "Economic Buses" to Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current decade is "the end of eight years of a bad economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
Reaffirming that it would even be able to reduce the 95 per cent of the Americans, despite the Wall Street summits, the Irish Senator also reported that the achievement of an energy independence of the country by the promotion of renewable energy was its first priority, with the establishment of a system of health insurance.
McCain wished to build a couple of 45 nuclear centres from this to 2030.
The two candidates issued questions on the financial saving plan of $700 billion (470 billion) last night by the Congress and extremely impopulated.
"A Minsk, you have noted that there was a choice, you?"
Youth and opposers showed tonight on the main place of the Belarus capital to reject the results of legislation.
Some hundreds of Bielorusses meetinged after the closure of the vote offices on the central place of Minsk to protest against the faultful character of legislation.
Although no result was yet declared, many young people came to demonstrate the power of President Alexandere Loukachenko: "the dictator, demission".
Some have not even vowed, 'What good, because they will do what they want to have,' said a young man.
They do not believe that the regime which has made good figures for foreign observers in the purpose of replying a language with the European Union is ready to carry out a democratic tourist.
The sanctions, including visa prohibition for 40 whitelorus leaders and weight of some having, could be raised if these elections were considered themselves by observers.
They did not have it according to the opposition.
"We have been held to disappear the electoral committees and our observers couldn't participate in the deficit," said Youri Potemkine, the Union's Democratic Forces, a herogenal group of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmic change, emphasized by Alexander Milinkievitch, an old candidate of the opposition to the President of 2006 and the Chief of the Pro-European Movement, because the interesting is the voices, and at us is the executive power.
If Members of the opposition enter into the parliament, they will be appointed, not elected.
But their entry to the parliament may mean space at television, meetings in regions and law proposals."
The opposition should therefore enter into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must be closed.
For if our economy, which is severely enthusished in Russia, is in crisis, and we are not reformed, we're going to become a Russian protector.
Or we want to be independent."
The fearful opposition that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe who has followed the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the monitoring.
It emphasized that the participation numbers are too high and that the generalization of the vote by advance (26% of the elections in Minsk) opened the voice to all manipulations.
"You noticed that there was a choice, you? Ask the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the vote offices.
And there will be at least five Members of the opposition to the parliament, those who constitute the best power."
The silence of the night gets back on the place of October.
At the television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Committee welcome their success.
The interview - the blood was safe
Hema-Québec welcomed the 10th anniversary of his foundation, and his President, Dr. Francine Decary, had reason to rejoice, because Hema-Québec became one of the most secure and effective suppliers of the world.
In particular, he recognized the confidence of the public who was seriously burned by the scandal of blood contaminated in 1980 and 1990.
As you know, the national blood reserves conducted by the Canadian Cross-Rouge Croix were contained by the virus of acquired immunodeficiency (VIH) and the C hepatitis virus for 1980.
Before this drame and the grave of the public, the Government of Canada introduced a public investigation in February 1994 by the judge Horace Krever, which was intended to make the light of circumstances leading to such tragedy and to formulate recommendations so that such a disaster would not be reproduced.
While the judge Krever was late to submit its report, some provinces then set a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Geneva Committee fulfilled this mandate.
Following the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two providers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to serve the Quebec and the Canadian blood Society to approve all other provinces and two territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Québec started his activities, at least 38 per cent of the people still trusted in the Quebec blood system, the Dre Decary was recalled.
The situation was amazing.
In the force of efforts to improve the security of blood and labors on the field during the years of follow-up, we renewed the public confidence," she said before notably proclaimed that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94 per cent of the Cuban population had now trusted in Hema-Québec.
The Dre Decary, however, keeps the head that "the trust is something extremely fraud."
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, Hema-Québec applied the precaution principle.
At this time, a new variation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease has been assisted in Europe with the eclosion of many cases of human forms of the folk disease, and has been revealed in 1998.
"And we didn't know anything if this disease could be transmitted by blood.
It was then supported by one of the main recommendations of Krever and Genelineau reports, which, when it is not known and that serious disease can decrease in the case of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterised by a degeneration of the brain that is inevitable to death.
In April 1999, more than one month in the United Kingdom since 1980 was rejected.
But, a few years ago, he was demonstrated without sure that this disease is transmitted by blood.
This episode has thus shown us that the principle of precaution had been implemented. "
In 1999, a more significant HIV-dissession technique was appeared on the market: nucléic acid tests (TAN) which allowed to detect directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus itself and not the anticorps against the virus, on which the tests were used until now.
The TANs have allowed to accelerate the motive period, which is extended between the time when the person was infected and where the first virus can be detected in the blood by our techniques, it explains the specialist.
It was possible to reduce the period at a period lower than one week.
Thus, the risk of certain donors was significantly reduced without knowing and can't detect them.
These improvements allowed significantly to reduce the risk of contracting AIDS by blood transfusion.
Today, a person at 12 million short risk to receive blood contaminated by HIV.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood products should be distributed before anyone is infected by HIV.
As Hema-Québec divides each year between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products, this will take more than 24 years before the transmission of HIV by a blood product.
I believe that today you can feel about getting or prescriving blood transfusion to recover health", said the Head of the Head of Hema-Québec direction.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain our safety of our products.
We never know what pathogen is going to get on the system.
Not later in the past year, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of the Meeting who, at the instruction of the Nil West Virus, is transmitted by a blood insect.
The Dre Decary continued to stress that, more than a security approach, Hema-Québec must also provide sufficient appreciation.
"The needs are increased because the population has been old.
Anticanceral treatments as more aggressive, patients often need a recharge in red globes or plaquets.
The older population also has effects on the network of blood donors, which is only 3% of the Chebecos acceptable to the blood gift."
Each person in health, age of 18 and more in response to the admissibility criteria may still give blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
In average, 14 per cent of those proposing their blood are not accepted because they are attacked from AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have seen in a country where paludism wasted, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
"Before these 3 per cent, we are able to maintain an inventory that meets the hospital needs.
The pearls are very rare.
But the members of this network of donors should be renewed as they are old and can no longer give their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to keep them and encourage them to become regular donor.
The life of today is so weird, we are rarely finding time to pass for a time to give his blood," decreased Francine Decary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec provides not only blood products, but also human tissue, including oxed greffons, heart valleys, oculary balls and skins that is almost used for large burned.
These tisses are analyzed, transformed and congeled before being intertained at Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public curdon blood bank to Québec.
The Ombilical cordon, which was considered jadis as a biomedical disappearance of a rich blood in smoking cells to serve to treat serious diseases, such as leucémie.
"You have disappeared, a few weeks ago, the banking of our thousand cordon blood samples and is intended to provide more than a thousand per year.
The Dre Decary, which describes this cordon blood preption program as very popular, should be proposed for greffs at the beginning of the next year.
"Mothers are desired to have access", because Hema-Québec has not the ways to propose this complex and costful program in all the Québec hospitals.
Socicer - Impact in half-final
The Montréal Imput is qualified for the half-final round of the USL first election series, through a 3-1-3 victory (4-3 to the total of the purposes) to the costs of the Seattle Soners, yesterday, during the second and decisive series of the final quarters at the total of the objectives, in the Saputo Stade.
The area environment Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive goal at the 90th minute of game.
After a first half without the purpose of one side as the other, the middle of David Testo and Rocco Plancentino marked the other networks of the shown training.
Roger Levesque was the only one to get Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Remember that at the first match of the go-to-to-side series, Friday, the Imput had brought a defect from 2-1 to Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the bathroom of Seattle.
The Imput is measured to Vancouver whitecaps in half-final.
Saturday evening in Minnesota, Thunder made a deficit of 3-1 in the back game to import it 4-3, but whitecaps have also accessed the half-final round 5-4 at the total of the goals.
The Imput should face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short - But Victory of Kovalev
The three-number of one of the Canada is ready to take the season.
The unit composed of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the attack in a 3-2 Canadian winning of the Canadiens in the face of the Floride Panthers, last night, at the Bell Centre.
Costitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a goal, Plekanec felt two aids, and Kovalev collected a passport in this wine, the fourth of the Tricolore in six preparatory matches.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only goal of the fusillade.
"I'm not yet ready.
I need another game to feel like I'm going to do."
"He tried to do too much in the first period, noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He had a beautiful birth."
Northern Charter
The First Minister does not exclude elections before the end of the year
As soon as the General Council of the Liberal Party completed, John Charest went to John-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (left), trys to be elected at the opportunity of the partial election today.
"Removing the limits of our great northern border," this is the long-term ambition that John Charest has presented with visual force all over the great lines, in terms of the General Council of the Québec Party, at Lévis, yesterday.
During his talks, Moulin was planned on images.
They turned on a bottle, on three large screens, the spectrum of hydrochrical bars, mining operation, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", cards, etc.
Most means as in electoral period.
Furthermore, the first Minister refused to exclude that he would deploy the elections of this car, even if he noted that his hour was very charged.
The "North Plan" is the fourth pane of a "vision" which the first Minister intends to have for Quebec, the "new economic space", which includes an understanding on the work with France, a agreement between Canada and Europe and entities with the Institute.
Although not mentioned in the words of the first Minister, the opening of the North - the Northern Territory at the 49th Parallel - never had been subject to a presentation.
However, the first minister was born to explain why the north was “a great potential joy,” but did not give an estimation, investment amounts, or a specific priority in the projects coming.
More than a few events of what could be developed: including hydro-electricity, forest, but especially the mine sector, doubled by the growth of the emergency countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures.
The North contains "nickel, zinc, kitchen, platine, or, silver, iron, titane, and even diamond", according to Mr. Charest.
This "territory two times large as France", "It's at us, it's Quebec.
Not only it is in us, but it's in us," he stressed, as to show that he was asking a national founder.
Québec was much built in his relationship with the North, he emphasized: the road towards the gold in Abitibi, the Quebekio engineering, the Baie James.
"It's to us, that's our future," he added, after having made a theatrele stop to complement the implant card behind him.
The North, 70% of the Quebekois territory, includes a share of the Labrador that Quebec has always returned, has expressed the first minister at the press point.
"It's a traditional position that all Governments reiterated.
There is a border line on which there is no great time, and, when the opportunity is present, I will reiterate this position in the name of the Government," said.
On the other hand, "with climate changes, we need to recover our north vision," he said by speaking about the Northwest transition, which will be opened all year because of the source of glass.
In this new geopolitical context, the first minister believes that the territory is a debt.
And the inhabitants of the Territory, the First United Nations and the Inuits?
The first Minister said that the Quebec Government would be very careful in their respect and that the project would benefit them, in particular to young people.
Two senior ministers who come from two different parties, Peter Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ancient Deputy Deputy of Ungava), have already held consultations at a thirty-three of communities.
A intergovernmental intergovernmental committee presided by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) has been an important place.
The first Minister does not exclude a great meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a moment when "a common vision will be given."
North Development would also be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "concerned, ordered and respective environment", promised.
John Charest described this "vision" as continued with the first officers who have before it.
"Come the Liberals before us, we thought otherwise to transform the challenges in new opportunities of growth and development."
This was also one of the recurrent topics of the end of the week, which was enthusied in Friday by a great cocktail to underline the 50th anniversary of the arrival of John Lesage at the head of the party.
One of the adopted resolutions proposed that the Central Beauharnois in Barrage Adélard-Godbout re-accompanies.
"De Godbout, who created Hydro-Québec, at Lesage who made the Quiet Revolution and Nationalization of hydroelectricity in Bourassa, who made the Baie James, has made our party for the future," said John Charest.
In the press point, he invited another reference, conservative, the Roads to the North" of John Diefenbaker, first Minister from 1957 to 1963.
In addressing the draft hydro-electricity barrier of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr. Charest emphasized that its service was planned for 2012.
"There remaining between us, but I prefer to be there," said he confided his military warrants, endorsing their narrow applaudements.
In fact, the first Minister said in April that there would be no election in 2008 and, unfortunately, not in 2009, has declined the possibility of declaring the automne, which allows it.
It notes, however, that his hour is filled, including by a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Québec-New York Summit.
The General Council of the weekend provided a platform with national resolutions, including "Constitutional Aspirations" which were passed as a letter to the post: the PLQ particularly recognizes the "specification of Québec" in the Constitution.
He also wished that the Quebec named members of the Council of Radiodifusion and Canadian Telecommunications and that those last have a veto right to decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, the major lines of the North Plan have been welcomed with scepticism.
The Chief Pauline Marois called the North Du-Québec Development Policy that the Landry Government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the Liberal Government, reaching the power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If he had done it, "we would be more advanced today" Mrs. Marois commented on the sides of his candidate in Jean-Talon (scrutin that has been today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said to support the adoption of a North Plan by the Government.
"But what we want is that it is not just a spectacle," commented the leader Sebastien Proulx in the replacement of Mario Dumont, which is today from vacations.
Letters - A Decade country
This is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of the "Justice" (Irony) in the Harper Chain, who allowed himself the last age to tell Louise Arbour that she was a "honor" for Canada.
Thus the opposition of this woman who has conducted an incredible fight for justice and which merits all our wonders as long as he said about the environment of the first minister, and on Stephen Harper himself.
We are here before a government who is the only one, among all the western countries, to have not repatriated his hospital in the Guantánamo concentration camp.
A government who does not take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young adolescent at the time of the facts that were reproached to him.
The only government who, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, refuses his word and leaves a child-soldat in inhuman conditions.
The only one addressed to a parody of justice to assess the accused of the accused.
Remember that UNICEF, International Association and the Canadian Barreau Association, in particular, is a pleasant for the repatriation of Omar Khadr, to benefit from a fair proceeding in Canada.
It is the same government who closes the eyes of torture: it is little important that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, unfortunately after many years of exit.
It is not yet aware, but we are now assisting an insensitive erosion of our rights, our freedom and our Democracy, that word that Harper does not stop burning and sounds so crowd in his mouth.
This is the time when no moral no longer exists: we can cure, torture, impose arbitraryly a Canadian citizen according to the good will of a government head to the minority (thus after 14 October...).
Many of the elections believe that they will find greeting in a party prepared by the Vertu, the Law and the Order: they do not see that this Government has rejected what did the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Toews, is there, in this renovation, and not otherwise.
Libre opinion - Orwellian discours of Barrick Gold
In its edition of 17 September, The Devoir published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian Minister Barrick Gold.
Following an orwellian logic, he states that the world's greatest warrant company has tried to continue to disseminate six million against three authors and a small editing house without the soup in the purpose of launching a "a transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of prosecutions in dissemination, but the law.
Without surprise, this fundamental difference is completely overcome by Mr. Garver.
Because, for Barrick Gold, would it be the best way to conduct a public debate to lead to the destruction whoever is obliged to support a position against her?
In the case of the proceedings, the authors and editor of the Black Book Canada will have to pay considerable amounts to prepare their defence and to combat, to very illegal weapons, against a military lawyers supported by almost without the foundation of the ministry.
Tactics, in these unrealised fights, are often to destroy defenders in order to impose a regulation to the friendship that will deploy the opposition to any one who will resolve the question.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it's before the public opinion that she had to present its vision of facts.
In contrast to what it is done in several of the countries Barrick Gold, the discussions in Canada are normally being made by the exchange of ideas and not by matratics.
It was therefore sufficient for the ministry to open its books, folders and establish a real debate through the newspapers, media, publications and financing of independent research teams that would have been able to make light on the matter.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust the public opinion and reject the reverse of the hand's pensions and support letters to the Black Canada authors.
Maybe Mr. Garver could explain how he can at the time ask a "public" debate while deploying the opinions of the same public?
In the world of the Vice-President, it seems that this word describes only the paid lawyers and not all the Canadians; this is a very close view of the concept.
In democracy, even detractors have the right to the word.
What you don't understand - or do you don't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is the public who supports the authors and editors of the Black Canada makes it first because he rejects the brutal way of the ministry.
This public is ready to hear Barrick and Judge, but on the basis of civilized arguments exchange, and not in the context of the numbers of surrounding as a prosecutor-Bâillon (for the following "public debate", Barrick Gold has also come to put a stay on the place of the Noir Canada authors in order to stop the use of this term...).
Besides Mr. Garver's super-related discussion, Barrick Gold is a direct attack against the Freedom of University Research and the Truth Research, essential to any democratic society.
It has never, in block, the right to quote confidence sources and the debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the same basis of intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects over the rich enterprises of this world in a country such as Canada, without prejudice to reprehension, who can do this?
If Barrick Gold really wants a public and transparent debate, she could do it according to the scientific standards used by the Black Canada authors.
She has a repair right.
The university environment that we are, is known to manage discussions and disagreements and solve conflicts for a long time.
The pursuant pursuant to Barrick Gold clearly shows that, in contrast to what it provides, it has no desire of a transparent debate.
It's a loss for university world, as well as for public debate in Canada, and it's time that Governments set up an instrument that limits this kind of abusive persecution.
Wall Street Saving Operation - Democrats and Republics hear
The Bush Administration and the Congress' Chiefs, at the time of the Republic and Democracy, are finally reached to an agreement on the largest economic saving plan since the Great Depression of the 30-year-old.
The new version of the United States Plan of 700 billion dollars in order to solve the financial crisis that has followed Wall Street for months must still be included by the two Congress rooms for months.
It provides, inter alia, better control by the elections of its implementation, new mechanisms to ensure the reimbursement of the public money undertaken, new provisions to contain the number of houses undertaken for standard payment, as well as the right of supervision of salary payments provided to the leaders of the undertakings.
The American Secretariat to the Treasury, Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the Republical Representative at the negotiations table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news a few minutes later, in terms of a marathon of negotiations for two days.
"We have made great progress for an enthusiasm that will be effective on the markets," said the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
"All has been made in way to open the real economy and the regular Americans of the current crisis in Wall Street," explained the democratic.
"It's the fundamental point: if we don't do that, traumatism, chaos and perturbations on the daily life of the Americans will be immense," said the Republic Judd Gregg.
The negotiations had turned to the sprint in the last hours by fear of the effect that would cause a new scene on the humor of investors.
The limit time we were granted was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates to the American presidential election have been highly favourable to the entity, but have not been lacking to express their mind that it is obliged to come to this extremity.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama assigned the addendum of certain provisions to the entity, including in order to allow the owners to maintain their home and the payment of the undertaking leaders from the State.
"When contributions are requested to take extraordinary measures because of the independence of some, there is nothing to be happy.
But these measures are necessary," commented he on the onwards of the American TV.
Another chapter was asked to know if he would vote for the proposed plan, his representative, John McCain, said, "I would like to see the details, but I hope that yes."
"The big lines I have read [subscribed] that it's something that we're all going to digging and with which we're gonna be able to progress.
The option to do nothing is simply not acceptable," said he.
The plan of 700 billion is intended to buy with the money of the contributions to suspicious credits, risk-active actions and inventive United States financial institutions.
After 14 months a crisis deployed by the enclaration of an immune bulletin which first led to the fund of risk-related risk credits (subscribed) before extending other forms of credit titles (PCAA) and deploying on a loan of liquidity and delaying banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of republic helics who made the first project of agreement last week.
It is believed that the democrats have accepted that some "toxic" actives of difficult enterprises are only guaranteed by the government instead of buying.
In order to assemble Angle for everyone to the Congress, it was also added a stipulating provision that if the Government had to take losses for five years with this programme, it could set new taxes in order to help recover it.
The new plan provides the payment of a first tranche of 250 billion to which 100 billion would be added if the President is necessary to the judge.
The payment of 350 billions should be included by another vote of the Congress.
In exchange of its aid, Washington will receive participation in aid companies that will take part in the benefits and that it will be able to return when the tour is passed.
The Federal Government will have the possibility of delaying income procedures relating to the housings attached to real estates concerned by this plan, as well as to fix limits to reimbursement and departure compensations provided to the leaders of affected enterprises.
The architects of the plan would like to see the vote of the Chamber of Representatives since now, and the Senator Seat.
Despite all their efforts, it is not yet sure that their plan will have green fire.
The votes have actually continued to rise here against this project, both in the Republic and the Democratic camp.
"On evidently, Washington does not hear you," said the Republic of Scott Garrett, member of the Chamber's Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yeah, there are solutions.
But it is not that it is to benefit from contributions."
Animator of a small group to the Congress surnamed "The sceptic box," the Democratic Representative Brad Sherman presents things otherwise, but it comes to the same conclusion.
"Five hundreds of emerging economic professors, including three Nobel Prices, have written to us to say: We are asking the Congress not to press and consider carefully the way to take," said he yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we had the evidence of the global nature of crisis.
In terms of an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partly nationalization of the Fortis banking group for 11.2 billion euros (16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Belgian Governments, the Netherlands and Luxembourg was required after the French BNP Paribas bank had noted that it refused to acquire its competitive since it lost two billion euros (2.9 billion) in the crisis of real estate loans in the United States.
Forest employees 85,000 persons and are part of the twenty larger European banks and the ten larger securities.
"It's not the lost money," said the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Bos.
In exchange, there is a right of vote in the bank and influence.
It's just something that the springers and girls are now appreciated that the time is announced incertain."
During that time, on the other side of the Manche, the British Government seemed to nationalize another bank that was damaged by the financial crisis.
According to the English press, the Government would reiterate the entire loan at the Bradford and Bringley bank, including more than 41 billion (75.5 billion) of real estate loan.
The Spanish Santander bank told her yesterday that it would buy successors and customer accounts from the British Bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock that the British government should nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a bonded icon
His beauty in the sight of the skin was long his expected card, some will say his weakness.
Was he released from the narcistic mirror, the American actor to the charming sore?
Yes and no.
His pudeur, his sensitivity and talent that dreams from source will also be far away from the power register that brings the true holy monsters.
But what a big foundation corner!
Paul Newman, lost Friday, in 83 years, wasted from a pump cancer on his side of the Connecticut, remains one of the latest icons of the American cinemma of the fast years.
The more monumental than Brando, whom he looked, and whose kind of rival was long to the screen, more careful in his game, certainly more fraud, but also the apostle of the freedom and the enclaration of dramatic conventions.
Mixed bloods often make magnific children.
He was born in Ohio in 1925, from a Jewish father and an Hungarian mother of origin.
These European races will be one of the glorious faces of the American dream.
Without me, the last quality mark.
For in him, all a busy country of the self made man, the battle of the Pacific War, who studied the dramatic art in Yale at the beginning of the 50s, then spend the Actor's Studio in New York, before triumpher to the theatre, television, soon to the cinem.
The same man who wars for Civic Rights was also the car pilot that was classified on 24 hours of Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with the actrice Joanne Woodward.
They also have the shadow of this secret star, discreet, detained, allergic to the spectrum of the business show, which will not have to perish the enigme.
An honorable man, in the most noble sense of the term.
Paul Newman's disappearance triggered the cinephiles this week end, while his great roles are on the black screen of memories.
More than a half-sept of a seventh American art in perpetual change through it.
The young man who rejected his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La Chatte on a burning roof adapted to Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More closer than us (1990), Mr. Bridge has been sentenced in his old age by a marriage that had not fulfilled all his promises.
As other Paul Newman's history.
This boxer Rocky Graziano, delining, violent, unforgettable in Somebody Up There Likes Me (Mared by hate), by Robert Wise, a role designed to James Dean after his death, which really started Newman in 1956.
This sympathic bit in the brillantism The Sting (L'Arnaque), Oscar of the best film in 1973.
The Hostler de Robert Rosen (1961), he will take the personality on the return to The Color of Money de Martin Scorsese, which values his unique Oscar on nine nominations in 1987.
This face through the ages was he.
He's still.
Times move through his way.
The young people know him especially through the Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, teacher of a little orthodoxe team.
His fans found it in 1994 in The Hudsucker of the Coen brothers.
With a last parrain role of the Irish maffia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the bottle was blocked.
In contrast to several cinema leavings that have left quite early in the middle, Newman will be leaving long in skin, while deniing Hollywood, oranges, fasts and concessions.
The French cinéaste Bertran Tavernier considered it, not without humor, "as a challenge living to "underplating" judged its highly supported performances.
Professional work has not always been thrown for the beautiful Paul Newman, to which the roles fell long every kit in the beck.
However, at least the first young people than the marginal: Nevrossed, alcoolic, slaughters or dissessioned, whose perfect traffics reflect the costs and revolutions.
As a realistor, Newman reveals bad faces known of his true potential sensitivity.
Her wife Joanne Woodward, in 1968 (on the Roman of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, was a female end of melancolie.
He who lost his son Scott by overdose gives him his film Harry and Son in 1984, the work of pudeur and tristeness.
Among the rain of damage that was driving here on Newman, his grand friend and old arms friend Robert Redford (when they played together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very attractive: "There presence made my life and the best country."
Genrosity, existence love are vibrant trades of the actor lost.
Moreover his leadership, also is a great military for civic rights, ecology, independent cinem, a contestor of Hollywood's decrees.
Many of its binds will be seen to sit on winegrete pots, sacks, biscuits and other foods, judgeing the process of driving bad warming, any gag at the start.
However, the benefits of these sales were transferred to its Children ' s Fundation for difficulty.
Newman, rather than sitting on his myth, will be bound to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter containing the words: "Today and until the end, your father was incredible recognizing his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us have followed the way of a American artist so fun and so generous.
Citizen model, in sum and in theirs.
What could you produce Zurag & amp; in their factory devices?
Successfully, on 8 October, will begin hearings relating to the current criminal procedure, against János Zuhelp and its complaints.
Politicians and its complaints are accused of criminal organizations, permanently and regularly, with particular damage, and other accused heads were retained against them, such as false and false use.
According to the parque, the money from subventions was transferred to personal purposes, while the benefits were justified by false facts.
The money of the State and municipalities, approximately 65 million HUF in the total, was on the side of the Fiatal Baloldal movement and on the other hand, in the pocket of some people.
Its method also was to touch the money of the subsidies obtained by emitting cost facts that no real performance had been provided and so associations never respected their commitments.
According to the accused Act, a large part of the facts was false.
For these last, they used factures to the market of Józsefváros, while they manufactured the covers in Kiskunhalas.
For the names of companies that were going to figure on the factures, it was decided, inter alia, during the northern Balaton province of the Balatoan Balaton, carried out by Staván Lados, on the request of Jaános Zupply.
According to the disposal of that, he had to repay pensions and restaurants.
For its personal consumption, he requested a factory, on which they realized the other facts that they would, among others, be introduced to the Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Ministry of Social Affairs and the Labour, as well as the Capital Municity to access subventions.
The majority of the factures was created by István Lados and its complaint András ◆ri, which according to our information, was particularly concerned to edit the items necessary for the obtaining of subventions.
During a "representation cycle", one of Lados's choices was a corner.
According to the two facts issued by the Summit in 2003, this place assured the restoration of a group of 90 persons, members of the Ourtos Pont Egyptian Association.
However, according to the proposals of the gentleman, it would be impossible that while people occupied this place, at the same time.
In the same way, in 2002, the factory established on behalf of Jobb Jövíért foundation, which later will bring the name of Egypt to Harmadik Evezредert, a large number of forms and funds.
A pension, located in Badacsonytomaj, had only three rooms, and a maximum of ten people could have been able to pass over the night. However, the factory mentioned hundred thirty clients.
Factors of facts to delaying imagination are also falled in the exchange when they mentioned the Pigal Kft society, also in the Horeca sector. In their accountability, neither Job Jövërt, nor Hopá's name, appeared, according to the information in the park.
Gyzć Farcas, the manager of the society, said to the hvg.hu site that when the parquet called him and showed him the factures, he knew, soon, that it was false documents.
"The name of our society and our tax number was set at a bad place on the cache."
He added: "In addition to the form, the fact that, according to the factory, hundred people lived there, did not collect, because this facilities is not only our rooms, which do not have so much place.
Furthermore, the factory also mentions breakfasts, and our restaurant is closed for a long time."
The Emitters of Factors of Features have not been recorded on Budapest travel agencies, taking part of their choice, but only foreign journeys. Thus, they have shown stays in Hungary on facts to regulate in species, which is also against the accountable practices of the Agency.
As it was appeared during the survey, they also add the TVA on these documents, while the benefits on travel activities, which are located outside the European Union, are without TVA.
Likewise, the TVA rate of the four facts established on behalf of the Hotel Reveloppep at Jobb Jöv quaet was wrong, since the company's performance does not support a 25% TV as indicated, but a 15% TV. In addition, the hotel's employees have only printed facts, while false revealed.
The survey of the parquet shows that the "emittors" also made mistakes mentioning the transport of goods by road, that the emittor of factures could not operate, since its profile was the investment advice.
Furthermore, it is for seconds of forms, such as inadequate facts and false secrets, that the facts emitted to the order of Egypt to Harmadik Evezrett Alapitvány, from XXI. Szazadi Culturalis Egyptians and Biztos Pont have been shown falsely.
As well as in the case of Ravenna Bt. or the sports station of Kunfehertó, which are both authors of the factures issued in their name.
The fausers did not take attention to the fact that the HIB Kft society, established in Nyiregyháza, was in liquidation at the time that (in 2001) the Fiatal Városert Egyptesület group was deemed to take a reply to them. According to our information, this is why the liquidator of the company never had issued this factor.
Facts established in terms
Another category of factures emittors is the composed of those who were fully aware that he was requested to submit fruitful facts.
The Esély Budapestert Alapítvány, at the request of the Fiatal Baloldal Group - Sijú Szozialisták, has established a factor at the order of the Egyptian foundation to Harmadik Erredért, for a sum of four million HUF.
According to the prosecution Act, Collab Kft company manager was brought to prosecute fair facts by one of the accused, Ludovic Gyorfi.
Also, he cooperated with the Suggests, Biogate Kft., which is currently under liquidation, which in 2003, issued facts to the foundation of Jobb Jöviert Alapitvány, the Atlasz Egyptesület Association and the Vösfenyć Egyptesület, for about five million HUF, but from which no benefit has been effectively provided.
No financial movement has been made, no longer, since the facts that have been canceled by the following, but that is, the organizations have noticed to mention it in their accountability.
The following category of factures emittors is the company directly related to accused.
The Administrative Delta Trió Kft, therefore, was the Director-General of the Delta Trió Corporate, occupating the fuel and vehicle trade, whose social seat was in Budapest, but where it was not found, was Iván Kubatov.
In October, November and December 2005, the company issued several facts on sale of information equipment for approximately 18 million HUF.
According to the investigation, these equipment would have been bought by Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which was in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The director of the company was a Roman origin man to which Iván Kubatov would also produce documents relating to society between 2002 and 2005.
According to what we know, Kubatov recognized during the investigation he issued facts to the Order of Atlasz, Hopá and Egyptian societys in Harmadik Evezedert Alapitvány, and undertake their counter-valuator.
This is precisely at the request of Iván Kubatov that Roman massages created the Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft and Jos-Investment Bt.
Actually, no of these companies were working, what the accused explains that they were not receiving work.
It is served even in these companies, as the request of Master Zsolt Szente, coaccessioned and the editor of the company funding acts, it has established facts in their names, as the associations of Atlasz and Y-Geneezar relating to Zuhelp, as well as the associations of Atlasz and Y-Genere Research.
Kubatov gave to organizations 15 facts in total, issued by Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, for a value of 14.2 million HUF.
The parque thought that 10% of the factures and TVA were going into the Kubatov pocket.
The man has even used the SZ-Beri Bt society to establish fair facts that were used in the context of the subvention application of Biztos Pont.
In January 2006, the Society and Szovetség Association at Modern Magyarországenet introduced a subvention request for the public service of socialist partners, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They have obtained this subvention for a amount of two hundred thousand HUF, but these amounts were not used for the objectives set out in the request.
In order to avoid that, five factors received from the company Works Kft. Works Kft were presented to the TMA.
In addition, these are the facts that were found during the investigation carried out in the Arcád Kemecsei Office, the Ministry of Education.
In the hearing, a part of the accused will refer to the method of manufacture of the factures, as she had already done before the park.
What might be really interested would be that the main accused, János Zuhelp himself, decides to raise the vile on the whole history.
His flights are not very detailed, and even though it has promised several times to tell the least details, it has not yet done it.
The question is to know whether it is in its interest, or then socialists would have concluded an agreement that, in exchange of the reimbursement of a large part of the 50 million HUF, Zusi would take the chapter only.
Today, the last is probably checked, since the requests for his residence in overseas, based on the alignment of its detention conditions, continue to fall in the ear of a sore.
While those who have caused much more important damage, and the authors of non-related economic crimes, they are free or at least proceedings, waiting for their own home to the end of the procedure.
Psychology: Why do we cost more money?
In the sales of the buyers, the buyers are tend to exempt more, and to overcome the goods.
The neurological and economic researchers of the University of New York have been able to update the neurological and economic bases of this known and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to their study published in the Science Review, human beings do not want to be detained in this type of competition, such as a sale of eBay buyers, and therefore they have even aimed to pay a too high price.
These research have tried to draw up a neurological scheme of this kind of "jeu" with the assistance of sales to expert stores.
One of the volunteers groups played loto, while the other group was involved in the sale of players, while using a functional magnical resonance process (IRMF), researchers analyzed the active areas of experimental issues.
In both games, participants could gain money, but during the sale of acquirers whose essential element is the overseas of a third, the whole under the cerebral tronc called striatum was intensely moved during the loss of the part.
This part of the brain, on the side of several other functions, plays a role in the "auto-stimulation" system of the nervous system.
This is why, according to the researchers, the price currency explains with the escape before the violent reaction of the striatum.
In support of their theories, economic members of the research group have continued financial monitoring analysis.
During these, three groups overseered with a partner, in different circumstances.
They simply informed the control group of the real value of the product concerned, and they did so.
Another group, they promised that if, in addition, they gained from the part, they would receive $15 additional dollars in reward.
Although the third group had received $15 before the buyers, but the members of the group also lost the money, where they lost the buyers.
The difference between these two groups is in fact that the accent was placed in one on the victory, while in the other, on the echo.
By proofing the hypothesis of neurologues, the members of the team of the "concert" players were provided to higher installations than those carried out by the control group and the "for the victory" group.
"These results cannot be demonstrated by no existing economic theory.
In fact, each of them explained the phenomenons found in sales only by the pleasure of winning and the parade before the risk.
Only the methods of neurological images have helped to remove the contradiction between the two theories by deploying, now, on a third explication." - Andrew Schotter found the professor of the economic science capacity of the University of New York.
Hepatite: When should we visit a doctor?
In the world, approximately half billion people suffer from hepatite B or C chronic, while in Hungary, chronical disease is mentioned among the first causes of death.
It is estimated to hundred thousands of the hepatitis diseases of the virus in Hungary, but only seven thousands follow treatment. This is the fact that diseases often do not know that they are virus porteurs.
Hepatite name is a general name given to infections touching the faith and caused by different virus.
There are many similarities between their symptoms. The inflammation of faith and jaunity is characteristic, but pathogic agents and diseases generated differ one of the others.
The hepatitis virus, according to the pathogen genes, are mainly available in two forms: the hepatitis A and E through the digestive tube (e.g. food or water), hepatitis B, C, D and other organic liquids (sperme, vaginal segretion, salive).
For travellers, it is in any way recommended to vaccine virus A and B. There is no vaccination against C.
The hepatitis A symptoms appear two to three weeks after the consumption of contained food, generally, accompanied by bad general state, weakness, smoke and nuts.
Then develops on the hair and on the white eye a visible jaunness, the skins become clearer and the door takes a more fountained color. Healing can take two to three weeks.
Over the world, a million people die from the most serious form of this pathology, such as cancer or cirhose of the fever caused by hepatitis B.
The main cause is that, according to estimates, only a 10-year disease receives medical treatment.
Hepatite C may also have serious consequences: if it is not treated, it can lead to a cirhose or a crowd cancer.
Most diseases do not know the virus, because the pathogine gym is so severely destroyed the pearl cells. In many cases, the first symptoms appear only after 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, precoce prevention is very important, as well as regulatory expenditure tests.
The contamination is much higher than the average population of three groups: people who have submitted blood transfusion before 1991, drug consumers and tatuates.
Currently, 200 million diseases have been numbered from a chronic type C hepatitis in the world.
Since the disease may be detected by a monitoring of routine in the laboratory, it is advised to consult his doctor who has been treated after the unrecognised survey of the unknown origin symptoms.
The disease may be healed if it is detected in time. The virus can be evacuated from the body, so the risk of condensation is disappeared and the development of a cancer is predicted.
On 30 September is the worldday of hepatitis, organized for the first time in 2004 by the representatives of diseases from the four corners of the world.
Its goal is to take attention to the chronic pearl cycle, caused by virus, the causes of its development and the importance of the pre-cooked diagnostic diagnosis of disease.
He who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the results of a recent research, religious credibility would work as a kind of analgetic, which would have already contributed to more supporting the death of catholic martyrs.
The British daily Telegraph published a article that the researchers of the University of Oxford have made an interesting experience by analyzing at what level the faith in God could affect to the tolerance of the pain of human being.
In the context of this experience for at least strange, 12 Catholic believers and so many children were subject to electrochocs, while each of them observed a painting represented the Vierge Mary.
According to the results, the Catholic believers were able to exclude a large part of suffering.
By human palpation technique, the Catholics were able to active the part of their brain responsible for the regulation of pain.
This analysis is the first of a series of experiences, including academics, savings, philosoposis and theologists, participating in different areas of university.
More precisely, the experience is deployed in the following way: an instrument emitting ectrics and disseminating electrochocs is set on the left hand of the experimental subject.
The researchers asked the participants of the experience to look in supporting two pearls, the one being the Vierge Marie painted by Sassoferato in the 17th century and the other, the Dame to hermy painted by Leonard de Vinci in the 15th century.
The researchers in the origin of this experience hoped that the Vierge Marie's view had a kind of faithful status among the believers, while the choice of Da Vinci, not very different from the first, was on its slow effect.
Experimental subjects have passed a half hour in a IRM scanner, and at that time, 20 electrochocs in four parts have received, considering or seeing religious peinture, or more topics.
The Catholics said that in the view of the Vierge Mary, they felt as "in safety," like someone who is "made care" and they were "counted, and peace envahied them.
In view of the peinture of religious thematics, they accounted 12% of pain less than when they looked at the work of Leonard.
The Miguel Faria psychologist, who himself has participated in the experience, thinks that the same effects can be reached with any other strong image, in the athletes, in the condition of finding the appropriate photo.
"We should find an image of face to which they react very positively, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
Tom Wright, announced English, welcomed the results of these research.
"The practice of faith should change and in many cases, actually change our personality," added Wright.
After these excellent results, it remains only the question of knowing what would the effect of the regulation of the pain of subjects if the believers show a Madone painted by Leonard or a pearl of the same calibre?
Would the view of a Vierge Marie's best quality would cause better results?
You're what you're talking about.
At the time of his tenth anniversary, Google states that we can find it at the foundation of the poke of people as the sky above their head. He knows where they have passed their holidays, what specialists they consult and what their interest centres are.
However, it is not yet enough, according to Eric Schmidt, which is one of the influent persons of society.
As regards the sceptics establishing a parallel with the Orwell's horror vision, they do not just see the sense of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt said that there was little, at the financing Times that Google's main ambition is to gather more information on its users. This is necessary for Google founders to respect their initial goal that sounded as follows: "Rejoice all the information of the world!".
According to the Guideline of Google, after ten years of a world-commerce work, they are always only at the beginning of their objectives to be able to treat all the information.
On the question, what's there in five years? Shamidt answered that he would like Google to answer questions like "What can I do tomorrow?" or "What's the work I'd be better?". However, the software can't respond to this kind of question, just at first view, when they'll know it enough about users.
It is not perfectly clear for all intertainers that the words used during the Internet research, the IP IP address of the computer which launchs research and pages that then consulted by interested persons are precisely repaired.
By the intermediator of the Personalized Search program, two years ago, users can, for example, store their own search history and consult what they searched, on what they clicked. In a long term, recommendations, program based on the same logic, will be able to give many more personal responses, and will provide us products and services on the basis of our previous statements and our registered preferences.
What if someone serves my data against me, if he looks at my work? They ask users, who are worried about Google's information monopol.
In most cases, it is the potential represented by society that can rise from fear, and it is not the remembrance, the fear of the punishment, the desire of freedom or eventually the revolution against the power that can substitute in the international cases against reaction.
However, it is a confirmed that the terms of search are not only registered, but in cases justified, they are transmitted to a third, and in such a legal case, nothing protects the personal rights of the internal.
The most closest example of the last time is probably the action coordinated against Brazilian pendophiles during which Google had transmitted to the Brazil Government the information he had collected on the public page called Orkut, with a consequence of identification.
The person’s concerning the rights of the persons have been able to make a suspicion suspicion in May last, when Google, the arm below with the Electronic Legal Protection Organism EFF has proved its right to the court in front of the FBI. According to the sentence made in the future, Google will not always be obliged by any of the points of the Constitution to inform information on the secret request of the FBI.
(In the same time, the Federal Government has successfully obtained some 50,000 website addresses and 1.000 terms of research that he had reported on the strengthening of the Child Protection Act, voted several years before. But at the end, it has not been able to provide the lists of private users' search, nor the whole list of the Internet sites and words closed from the last two months.)
Google's judgment is so contrary: it is shot by those who fear the transmission of their personal data, because they think that their immediate sphere and their private field are suffering when they start using Google services. Therefore, they're attached to them in the spirit of revolution that they're manifested against the physical multinational societys of their conservative image.
During this time, the American geek culture and its "saving" gathering passionates, actives and enthusiastic users of the computer that appear in many countries see the next generation of large enterprises, the "grouped corporation" by opposition to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued as an invader of the world because of Windows, and that, even though all of them fight for the same objective.
This may be explained by the fact that Google, contrary to Microsoft, does not ask its identification users, does not ask money for its applications. The documentary code and the program package, continued freshly, has a much more accessible, younger and more cool effect, in the face of the official manager of software.
The reason may also be that geeks are very precisely seeing the relationship between person's rights and Internet, and what web 2.0, the most proclaimed word in the past years is just behind him.
In fact, the web 2.0 does not matter anything else than cooperation, as we are intentionally laid down the streets behind us, and that we serve the communication channels set to our disposition, and while the size of these changed one by one, the senseal remains the same: we are expressed.
A young man, generally, can hold a profile on several public pages from Facebook to Xanga, and it can even add them to other performances, such as Twinter, or last.fm, listing his musical standards. Afterward, it can add them to a prosecution system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm. These young people can also keep blogs, in which they can automatically appear their most recent photo galeries on Flickr or Picasa.
As many examples can be known, such as the little friend who easily understands the pictures of the morning, taken by the common friend's cycle, with which his unfidal friend has passed the evening, or the company who has licensed one of his employees, is nothing but for the sincere views that he wrote on his top management blog, it may be on one thing: the term of private life is totally to resume from our days.
The one who lives a online life is the one that is the way he shows himself, and so the principle can be defined behind the behaviour of young people today.
He wants to hide something, or at least, to try to retain the Google monopolie, you can do it (e.g., for example, with Scroogle, using the Google search system, but at the same time, not intentionally laying any trace.)
The number of persons who, deliveredly, are not registered on public pages so that they can not be able to find them, are not minors. Google's online services, through the processing of text to the image process, may be replaced by alternative versions, which are not ratified with extreme server parks and who do not gather our best profile, being present until this day.
Public opinion is waiting for, without really hiding it, the time Google will defend his real nature.
The company, with its current value of $156 billion, is more than IBM (140 billion), Intel (124 billion) or Coca-Cola (110 billion). AdWords/AdSense public areas threaten the number of businesses of publicity agencies, while the benefits introduced to a more important speed of serious migrants not only to Microsoft but to many other informal programs.
However, critical observatory observers are, at the same time, of conflicts with worried effects: for example, the top management of the society has rejected, in its entire integrity, the protests of employees, after doubt the price of the company, and after the company had been too unrealised to the daily restoration, taking any time. All this seems to be solved by the fact that Google has already reached the Chinese government and in accordance with the terms of their agreement, the company has detained all the results that would be good and the interests of the Chinese regime.
According to one of the internal rules of society, new services are not announced only when they can be used. What is about, that in the next months and next years, they will move the world on new points. While some think that the project of scan and books and magazines of Google takes so important dimensions that the company will underly find the Supreme Court of the United States, others trembled before his health system, because in that, it can build a full medical benefit from our previous analysis results, our doctors and our problems.
The fact that Google up a genetic database can give a good material first to the next generation of science-fiction authors. The Roman of the famous Cory Doctorow, written with half orwellian tonnes, describes the future in which a man could be approximately approximately through Google's data.
Two young people helped to disappear the traces of Uzd's double murder
"The police has conveyed two young men to ask them in the case of the double murder of Uzd. Founded suspicions, they helped to disappear the traffics of the crime." - said the port of the Commissioner's department of Borsod.
The young people have recognized the facts they are reproached, and now they are accused of complicity.
Two young people who, according to MTI information (Hungary Telegraphic Agency) are young girls, are free.
The complicity of murder may enter a detention that can go up to 5 years.
The suspect of the double murder of Ozd, a young man of the age of 23, has been placed in provisional detention, Sunday.
The leaders of the accusation networked against him are multi-life murder, committed with pre-mediation and interest.
During the investigation, he revealed that the young man of 23 years had a large amount of money to a 53-year-old.
The suspect didn't want to regulate its debt, and that's why he would take his creditor, the last Friday, on an Uzd site where he killed him, and the young man's daughter, aged 9.
According to the MTI information, the young man prejudiced his crime and the weapons with which he was about to commit its secret crimes on the places of the crime is the evidence.
The police reviews the weapons and circumstances of its use with the assistance of specialists.
Varsovian boost makes a proposal for the excavation of the boundary of Prague
The boundary of Varsovian values proposed two hundred million euros, about five thousands of Czech quarters, for 100% of the Prag's action package.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the shipment of Varsovian values, confirmed this proposal that the Polonians had despite the fact that the Czechs had previously excluded the end of Varsovie's cycle of the new potential owners of the run of Prague.
The cause of this exclusion is that Varsovie is in the hands of the State.
99% of the actions are in the hands of the Poland State, which wishes to separate more than 60% of its actions in several months of activity.
According to the Czech Economic daily E15, the Polonian proposal represents the highest offer that has been made up to the exchange of Prague's boat.
According to the Czech press, the boundary of Vienna, the Nasdaq transatlantic boat, the New York Stock Exchange, the bounce of London and the German Börse have offered to this day.
Peter Koblic, the manager of the Business of Prague, said the last week among the interests, the busy of Varsovie would be the new owner the least goodest, and didn't exclud the fact that this could lead to the disappointment of Prague's bourge in the future.
The value of the borse in Prague is estimated between 5 to 10 billion Tschech corners by the market specialists.
Based on an agreement between the assets, some 90 per cent of the papers would be sold.
The most important owner of Prague's borse is the Patria Finance Investment Bank, with approximately 25 percent of participation, followed by 14.7 per cent of the Ceská Sporitelna bank and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent.
The financial crisis of the European press point
In their comments of the Marin on International Financial Crime, the leading newspapers of the European Press Journals have already been a "Ofteenth September".
"The global financial catastrophe has to be made to the President of the United States" - accused the daily of Rome, the Republic. "The President has not even been able to block with its own parties a proposal of law, which was not provisioned to vacuum, in order to help a dissolute situation..."
On the place of a new Pearl Harbour, as the warren Buffect, is more appropriate to speak about a second 11 September.
A part of the maddrine press is also seeing the emitted bucket in Washington.
According to the vision of the daily On Mono, these are the lack of the political direction on the basis of the global economy on the ground of the foundation.
The risk of the funding of the American financial system is increased daily, and the whole world will then pay the strong price.
The Bush Plan was far to be perfect, however, according to the vote of the Congress, a real threat, which Washington does not propose political tool to address crisis.
World economy falls in the empty, just when in the history of capitalism, one of the largest transformations has happened.
We can't ignore the longer threat - notes the Geneva shower.
Some states can still throw a saving bouge to their financial institutions, and through the money of their contributions, they can save them from the fatality.
Of course, if any more banks are combined with the ownerships, or the financial means, or new improvisations will not be sufficient.
In long term, we need the states of the European Union to make a few cases of their national ecosystem, and they focus on control over the divided financial markets.
On Monday, the financial agencies have received more than 100 billion euros - remembered the Westernian daily, The Standard, which adds that the fears that European contributions will also have to put their hand on the pocket, very deep, similar to the Americans in order to remediate the crisis, become more realistic.
Today, the EU has not really occupied the crisis, which, as a tsunami, is partly the old continent.
The "reservators" should not be burned after one hundred billion euros, but it would be reasonable if they noticed in what case it would be reasonable to touch the money of contributions, with the aim of preventing more damage.
Intelligent car follows the flight of the burdon
What would be a better method to develop technologies that are to avoid an obstacle, if it is the emotion of an objective detector already present in the nature?
For example, that of the bishops.
In the mirror project presented at the CEATEC, which was placed in Japan, the Burdonnian Abbabels gave the strategic idea of starting to Nissan engineers to inspire them on how they need to conceal the next generation of objective detectors.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan built a mini robot car, a bio-ispirated bio-ispirated command system, BR23C type, which has equipped the qualitys of the beverages, is the final goal to encourage the development of a system that can avoid all obstacles.
At its flights, each abeille is its own space, in oil form, which is actually a lot like our secure protection coke - explained, in the exposure, Kazuhhiro Doi, the director of the Department of Research and Development and Public Relations of the Mark.
Abeille's face eye plays a primary role, as it is capable of seeing in all directions, in an angle of 300 degrees.
To imitate the functions of the face eye, engineers addressed the idea of the telemeter to laser.
It identifies the barriers in an angle of 180 degrees and a distance of 2 metres before the BR23C, he assess the distances and sends a signal to the mixture processer, which transforms it in the maintenance of evacuation.
The discharge of the obstacle is placed in a second fraction. Afterward, the auto-roll mini mini, imiting the abeille movements, immediately changes the direction of its wheels in the turning of a sufficient angle to avoid the collection.
In contrast to all existing systems, this manager of avoidance is fully instinctive.
"If it wasn't so, the mini robot could not react enough fast to avoid the object" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the manager of the Laboratory Mobility and the robot project.
It must be reacted instinctive and immediately, as this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner weakness of the protection supply, a cotton where the collection is considered inevitable for the moment.
All this process must reflect what is done in order to avoid other beasts.
The process must be pushed in an eye climb.
To the opposite of the beams, the difference cannot go up to top, down or diagonal, it can only be two dimensions, and only in the direction where the wheels can turn.
In this way, in place of the infinite combinations that put the biscuits to avoid other beams, in our case, only the rotative movement, and the acceleration as a manner for the disposal of the robot car.
The BR23C uses Lethium polymer batteries that are lighter and whose energy concentrator is larger, which makes their longest life time than in the Lithium-ion version.
According to Andoh, it is the instinctive reaction that is primary, not the data processing, and still less the capacity to store.
This mechanism must be treated only a few signs in the second and react to them.
It is not necessary to store and react with the intuitive logic based on the data of the previous managers. So it is only using a few kilometres of memory kilo-octets to continue.
We do not need memory of a giga-octet capacity, nor even mega-octets.
It's the first step towards the design of an immediate evacuation technology. According to Nissan's estimates, this system will enter in the series of cars manufactured in the next 10 years.
Another application could be its integration in the GPS satellite navigation system so that it could lead the driver to its destination by avoiding obstacles found on his way.
We have even given a name to the baby out of price.
The written version of the economic saving plan of $700 billion in order to acquire certain bank credits and to use several times is ready.
At the first tour, half of this sum will be expensed.
Requests that, during new discussions, the coast leaders of the Congress have been extended to the same day and days, around the saving plan of a total amount of $700 billion.
"We have done a serious step forward," said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic President of the American Chamber of Representatives, then it remains only to put the agreements on paper.
The compromise, born from the plan, is supported by the two candidates in the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain.
The American Secretariat to the Treasury Henry Paulson said the results of the compromise that the program will work and will be effective, however, other measures must still be implemented. On the other hand, Pelosi is not a question, here, from Wall Street's saving, but to turn the roads of the economy in the other sense.
The written version of the plan was opened before opening the Asian markets, Sunday at 20:00, Local hour of Washington (that is Monday at 2:00 a.m., according to the local time of Central Europe), but did not provoke spectacular mountains in the boundaries.
Lundi, the Chamber of Representatives will be the first to vote the law proposal on behalf of the Emergency Emergency Law for 2008, and then its sort will be between the Senate's hands.
Saturday, President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi, then the White House also welcomed the news of the agreement.
"We are satisfied with the progress achieved this night, and we highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to establish our financial markets and to protect our economy," said Tony Fratto, the Port of the White House.
In addition, the programme diverged the initial proposal made by the Bush Administration, which pointed out that 700 billion dollars should be paid only for the excavation of certain credits.
The first 250 billion will be released immediately after the adoption of the law by the Congress, probably Monday. This first sum will serve the secretariat to the Treasury to buy suspicious credits from banks, while the use of $100 billion will be left to the discretion of the President.
The programme will be monitored by an independent body in which the President of the Federal Reserve will also participate.
The expenditure of the second half of the 700 billion depends on a new decline of the Congress.
According to the law, the secretariat to the Treasury will establish a combined strategy: it will also buy suspicious credits, titles on hypothetics and doubtful hypothetics, and other "toxic credits".
The competent persons of the Ministry have stated that railings could be placed in the framework of a sale of acquirers, but also directly.
The rules provides the possibility of relevant companies to participate in a programme of insurance, where the secretariat guarantees the tools for the origin of concerns for which companies will pay an equivalent premium to preventive damage.
Henry Paulson said that the law provides the tools necessary to assemble $700 billion for urgent needs of the financial system, which is the wide exchange of certain credits, their insurance, or to avoid the risk of seeing the system undergoing the funding of one or another important financial institution.
"We will take the necessary provisions to be ready to apply the law since it is signed" he added.
Nevertheless, bank leaders who are in bad posts and waiting for the State's assistance may be expected to ensure that their starting indemnities, as well as simply doubt-Atlantics, will be placed by the Government.
The allocation of salary is mentioned only in specific cases, and the restrictions are also depending on the basis of which the secretariat proposes its support to the company.
The principle of the platform means that if the secretariat has been acquired in the framework of a sale of the acquirors, they will impose more taxes on the duty parachute, unless the President of the bank discretion is part of the pension.
The Government will directly interfere aggressively after the removal of suspicioned credits to ensure that the amount paid to leaders is not extracted.
To ensure that the image is complete, you must even add that existing doubts are not modified. The plafond is only about the new contracts, that is to motivate the participation in the plan.
It is the first time in the history of the United States that legal allocations will be in force with regard to the appointments of the Director-General - commented the President of the Commission on Financial Services, the Deputy Chamber, the Democratic Barney Frank.
Furthermore, the State has a right to acquire parts in the banks involved in the plan; so the risk of contributions decrease, as they can even be gained in the case since the economy and the safe banks will return on their contracts.
The draft law mentions that in the future five years, the President must introduce a proposal to the Congress, which will set out on the way the loss will be refunded to the contributions from the financial sector.
Of course, there were two sides who expressed their doubts in terms of this plan.
This is not why the American citizens have sent us, this does not protect the contributions of the dollars - said the Republic of California, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic Lady of Oio, Mary Captur believes that they are the same ones who take the measures, as those responsible for the Wall Street Foundation.

Barack Obama and McCain supports all the bank saving plan
Sunday, Barack Obama, as John McCain, candidates at the presidency of the two large American parties, provided their support for the government's saving plan of $700 billion. However, there are political candidates who require the release of the American Secretariat to the Treasury.
Following marathons negotiations for days and days, the representatives to the Congress and the Administration finally announced on Tuesday, in the summer, that they concluded principle agreements on the bank saving plan.
This funding plan, with the goal of the Wall Street crisis and the paralyzed credit market, has become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain are also present, every one as more fit than the other, to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent discussions, with the implementation of economic issues, Obama has been able to achieve a little progress. The advance of McCain, obtained with the appointment of Sarah Palin as a partner just after the Republical Convention, founded.

He emphasized that the proposal contains the terms of protection of consumers as well as supporting it.
"There is now that, with responsibility (...) a danger of your work, your economy, the whole industrial sectors and the stability of the whole economy, has said to a multitude of 35,000 people.

The press period of the German language territory
The right camp is intact, it is only in the heart of the party that the elections have become more aware - that's how the Der Spiegel, the low score of the CSU in the Bavarian country.
Haider is ready to control Austria to prevent red and black coalition.
The speed (spiegel.de)
In the Internet edition of the German Left Information magazine, Franz Walter analysis the causes of the CSU dramatic deficit in its article entitled "The revolution in Bavière devotes his fathers".
According to this recognised politologus, the CSU erosion started well before the triste two Beckstein-Huber takes its functions.
Christian socialists transformed the Baviere during decades, and now, these are the same modern citizens who turn their two.
This change of time is at the same time the problem of all Christian democracy, and in fact, also of Angela Merker.
For the CSU, the exchange has not been completely surprised, but Sunday, it has been a process that is likely, just ten years ago: the indiscutable heromony of the national party has been completed.
This has been 10 years ago in 1998, the CSU was 47.7 percent, and this for the first time since 50 years, with a score under the level of 50 per cent.
This was repealed three years ago in the Federal Day of 2005, i.e. at the time of the so-called Stoiber's election.
The cause may be imputed to the modernization "defending its parents" in the region which consists of the CSU.
This has been 40 years old that sociologues announced this but they were strongly stubborn about the ritme. However, secularization, the results of the North and Eastern Germans and the Baviere region could not remain without consequence on the reliability of the CSU elections.
Modernization will be paid with an increase in opportunities, and the consequences of such policy are also visible.
The right camp is intact, it is only within the party that the elections have become more aware, more critical and more inclusive.
It is also wondered that in the past few weeks, it is just the groups of classic citizens who are rather far from the CSU, such as independent persons, artists, bacteria detainees and higher studies.
In these groups, CSU support was lower than 40 per cent.
The press (depresse.com)
In its article entitled "Who? With whom? The parties presidents have the reservation of coalition issues", the Austrian conservator keeps care of the situation of the confused internal policy that has been installed after the austrian elections.
Austrian socialists in the SPE wish to discuss with EVP conservators.
The EVP prohibites the SPU to marry its internal business.
The BZE People's Party is open for negotiations, and the Greeks do not want to agree on coalition.
The elections have been made, now every tour around coalition, and in the debates organized at the public television, the parties leaders have difficultly let their cards interfere.
Werner Faymann, President of the SPU, confirmed that he wanted to discuss with the EPU.
The SPE wishs to show that cooperation of both parties is effectively possible - that is already in certain regions and social partnership.
The question in which he would imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current EEVP President, as vice-chancelier, remains open from Faymann.
As he mentioned, the Schüssel-Molter orientation was, in any case, rejected.
A reply of this combination is outside the issue.
Molterer answered with consciousness the motions of the red.
As he already said, a collaboration will be certainly unfruitful if Faymann is trying to enter into the EVP's internal business.
In its part, the choice of the opposition or entry into the coalition is currently an entirely open question. These points must be completely discussed within the EVP.
Jörg Haider, the President of the BZZZ, shows newly open to all proposals.
"To avoid the coalition of red and black, we are ready to accept government responsibilities," said Haider.
Jároka said: The neighbouring cycle of poverty and seligion must be broken
Today, in Paris, the European Summit for the Exemption of Events, whose host is France, as a representative of the current Presidency of the European Union.
In his message before the plenary meeting, as one of the main ports of the consultation of experts, Livia Járkoka, euro-deputy Member of the Fidesz Popular Party, took attention to the divisions in education, as it is a violation of the law which affects the most rich children, and that is the one of the main liberty to their success in life.
On behalf of the French Presidency, this high-level conference was opened by Xavier Bertran, French Minister of Labour and Social Affairs, and on the other hand, by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Employers.
Among those invited to take part in the consultation, European social partners are found as well as the most emerging representatives of legal protection and European civil organizations in the field of opportunities.
According to the Office of the Deputy Group of the Fidesz Popular Party, Járóka predicted that in addition to the distinctions identified during the emblems, the Romans are out of the work market, firstly, after their low qualification.
"An extensive majority of young Romans does not contain secondary diplomas, and, in consequence, an elementary education of bad quality, only an infeme part in the possibility of obtaining a higher study diploma."
Furthermore, Jároka stressed that education as a fundamental right of human being plays a key role when the other fundamental rights must be deemed.
Income in the previous education of Roman children is a strengthening of the European Union's economy.
According to the European Deputy, it is necessary to make awareness of these reports in a most larger currency, including between the Romes and the non-romes.
Indeed, early as a Roman child begins the school, it increases its opportunities to become a productive member of the labour market; the taxes paid from its income and consumption, it participates in the State budget.
"Of their nationality of the European Union, the Romans must be assured from their right to quality education and be protected from a low and sectual education." - Livia Járkoka said.
According to the Deputy, cooperation of the European Union towards an objective and action is necessary for immediate acceleration of the school-deregulation process and therefore for the compliance of existing anti-discrimination and preparation directives is a primary importance.
"The neighbourhood of poverty, settlement and unemployment must be broken, and the possibilities of the democracy to the Roman children are to be able to participate as citizens of full right to the future of Europe" has ended Járóka.
In the name of the European Year for the Employment for Alliance, the Summit's objective for the equality of opportunities organised every year since the Summit in Berlin is to ensure a unique platform to support the measures taken in favour of the equality of opportunities and to combat discrimination, vised at the European level and level of Member States.
CSU: Grace for a transition period
It's in October that the decision taken on the kind of the Huber-Beckstein dish
Despite this electoral eject, the heads are not yet falled, and the discussion on personal issues at the Bavarois CSU sums was held.
The Chairman of the Party, Erwin Hube and the Chief of the Regional Government, Günther Beckstein, can still keep their place.
The type of tandem, with a catastrophic voice loss of 17 percent, will be at the agenda of the Congress of the Exceptional Party, holding the last weekend of October.
Members of this very criticised pair, in any case, feel that they were not specially holding their seat.
Thus, they were employed to take the furnished members of the fraction and the basis, which one day after the "tsunami bavarois" has resulted in personal consequences for the loss of the absolved majority.
There's five years ago - it's true, even under the direction of Edmund Stoiber, at the top of his carrier - the socio-Chrétical union was 60.7 percent, while today, one year after the posh against Stoiber, it remains only 43.4 percent of their force.
During 46 years, the CSU was the only sovereign" of the Bavière that gave 18 percent of the German PIB.
But the conservators are still strong in this south region, the key importance for the Hungarian economy, and in the future they will be contrary to coalition.
As one of the first signs of an internal reiteration of the party, the Vice-President and the Federal Minister of Agriculture, Horst Seehofer, presented as possible successor of Huber, also received a place in this modest recognition group, which initiates the debates with the FDP libraries, as well as with the Library Electors, which formed the longness of the right values, about a eventual coalition of the Government of Munich.
A nest feet of the destiny was that by the list of the Libres Electors, including in the legislation of Gabriel Pauli, which took measure against Stroiber has served a possibility of push perpetrated by the two Huber-Beckstein, to be treated without deal with the very ambitious municipal political woman.
Now, the CSU leaders put all their energy to stabilize, in one way or in another, Beckstein.
In this transition, the Stoiber, who has to bear the fibers in the coasts, will also receive an active role. The former Chief of the Regional and Ex-President of the CSU, has appointed on 28 September as the most friendly day of his political carrier.
Lundi, Huber launched a few comments to the CDU. After him, they would have been much more supporting the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the deficit as a warning for CDU and also for Angela Merkel.
Following the Federal Assemblys, which will be held in September 2009, Merkel will be unfortunately if they are or otherwise, with a common force, the CSU, playing an important role in the 2005 national success.
According to Merkel, with difficult deception caused by the fiasco, CSU's ground loss will not influe in a negative manner of Berlin's large coalition.
This is still relative because it will not be easier to manage the CSU injured, and the crisis of socio-democrats will always be hard.
Since 1946, SPD reached its worst results with 18.6 per cent in Bavière.
Lukasenko - its rivers : 110 - 0
No deputy of the opposition has accessed the Bielorusse parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to the Russian observers, this is a country directed by Alexandre Lukashenko, which provides its prosperity and stability, while according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), it explains illusions committed in the deployment of votes.
The OSCE, sent 450 observers from 43 countries, does not recognize the elections.
Although the law composed of 110 people in the country of 10 million inhabitants had been very well opposed for a long decade, before the elections of her, the opposition of its forces under the name of the United Nations Democratic Forces (ODSZ) was seriously hoped that Lukashenko, renewing his President's mandate for the fourth time in suspiciably elections, on the traces of the change of the Constitution in 2006, "permettrated" this time the presence of a few deputies from the opposition to the parlement.
In this way, the ODSZ refused its boycott for the origin.
The fact that Belarusia, on the economicly more than Russia, would like to improve its reports with the EU, where, because of the qualified Bielorussian antidemocratic policy, Lukashenko and many high-local politicians would not receive income visa, was one of the expectations of the opposition. Belarusia has taken a credit because of the reduction of the imports of Russian natural gas, still slow, and also contributed to the transition of Beltransgaz society, the owner of gas conducts through the country, passed through the Russians.
The fact that the OSCE, during the evaluation of the campaign, focused on positive changes rather than on lacks, such as the prohibition to present for a third of the candidates at the opposition, was referring to a pre-payment.
However, the OSCE's reporter had already reacted the campaign, while the most important candidates to opposition could not appear in the media, and especially in the fact that the opposition could not be present in the removal of votes.
Despite all this, the opposition is also a Palestinian improvement in the political regime: political detainees found freedom, and Minsk is ready to small confronts with Moscow, still refusing to recognize the South East and the separate Georgian Basis. Or, Russia with which Belarus forms a document on a paper, convicts both independent territories for a month ago.
"We did two steps before, and one step back, but the most important is that the dialogue was loved between Bielorussia and the EU," said Alexander Milinkevitch to our journal.
According to the 2006 presidential elections, it is desired that it remains so, although "the power had feared in that parliament which had no weight, to make even one opposite."
The opposition does not provide protestation actions because of the results, but it is rather trying to reach its message on the need for economic reforms in the election.
"With certainly, we have a lot of matters about this: we must print our opposing newspapers in Russia, the local authorities put us bastones into the roads for the dissemination, but I can also see that they are more to support the elections, even in the course of older people" said Milinkevitch, noting that in the current system of Lukashenko, which considers social security as its main result, the cock of representations the most officially supported retributions will not be more appropriate.
"Of the enlargement of the country and the growth of the commercial deficit, the deficiency of social security, “the silence of a cemetery, is not more than a matter of time” - considers Milinkevitch.
In contrast to the opposition policy, Russian observers qualified democracy elections.
Serguei Lebedev, directing the mission of the Community of Independent States, said to the Russian press agent Ria Novosti: "The people do not believe in words, but in acts." The absence of opposition is only the evidence of the maturity of the Belarus elections.
Brunetta: "Today, little dinner before work."
Never, in the history of the Palais Chigi, there had no touring doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But from now on, this new measure is in force against the small malins, against which he points and then will drink caffee at the bar during working hours.
Today, the news of the former fairness was submitted by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and by the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"The touring gates tell Brunetta- are an instrument to better work, with more productivity, more presence and more services" specifics the Minister.
Now it begins a new range of responsibilities and transparency.
"It's the reformism" also emphasized Brunetta.
The installation in all institutions of the Council Presidency is completed with the Chigi Palace.
According to Masi, "the selection of the touring gates is even important to a symbolic view.
No resistance from the employees has been registered, provides the Secretary-General: "It is a process shared by employees, and we had all cooperation."
In short, more small dinner during the work hours; more coffee or believer.
The promise of Brunetta, which suggests sorely, " a good captain at 7:00 a.m. is a excellent and saving resolution."
During a conference at the Supérieur School of Public Administration
by Rome, the Minister reports that "in three months, the absence of public employees' diseases has reduced 50 per cent, or more than 60 million workers in one year."
And it adds that it is essential to make more effective, the Public Administration .
Italian, "with payment dynamics, the Minister--Inflation rates over the past 8-10 years have duplicated in respect of the private sector, and also the inflation rates.
At the same time, thousands of public employees were united to undertake the standards of the Brunetta Decree using the Codacons.
"In view of the fact that the Minister of Public Foundation is today the data on the decrease of the assessment on the workplace for the cause of disease-scribing the association of consumers - the people of the active famines" continues to increase.
In fact, thousands of employees in the Office's right and productive public administration were gathered to declare war to the illegal standards contained in the decree.
In particular, in Tar, the exclusion of additional locations in cases of service-related hospital; the extending hours of the homehold worker, during which the control visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Independents on the workplace, Napolitan: " crucial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, on 2.500 job accidents, 3 dead and 27 persons who remain invalid permanently.
In 2007, the Inail data actually confirm that white dead were approximately 1.200.
The figures showing the gravity of the phenomenon remaining one of the main causes of death, and causes almost two times more death than murderers.
To take attention to the institutions, social forces and means of information on this dramatic aspect, the Anim is today famous in all the Italian provinces, the 58th National Day of the victims of accidents on work, institutionalized on the second day of October.
"The concerning data diffused by the Animil, as well as the tragic events of the last days, confirm the importance of the subject of prevention on the workplace," said the President of the Republic, Giorgio Napolitano, in a message sent to the President of Animil, National Association of Labour and Unnecessaries, Peter Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses its "respective appreciation for the continuing associational effort to prevent workplaces, protection of accident workers, assistance to victim families and awareness of public opinion"
"Of naturally indispensated, everyone affected the poing to put a term to such tragedy that, by their size, submit the media cluster and the participation of public opinion, even though the daily reality presents us dramatic cases even reprehensible in their dynamic.
Napolitano does not hide that "there is certainly a resource problem: it is essential to invest in training and information"
Many initiatives in the school sector are particularly important for a directer conscience of the part of young people who enter into the work world.
It is our duty, maintaining attention to this phenomenon, not under evaluation of social gravity alarming, implementing and improved legislative standards.
On its side, the President of the Gianfranco Fini stressed how "This phenomenon of white dead is an absolute social emergency, which insults the conscience of each of us, and imposes all the institutions, to make concrete efforts to bring it quickly."
The data of accidents on the work appear to be reported to a positive tendency, but it does not prevent that the number of white dead are even impressing" later emphasized the President of Anmil Peter Mercandelli.
"We don't want that this "intensance to the rabais" actually translates in a minor attention, because it's just when the attention is relaxed, that comes into tragedy.
"We believe that in general, we do not suffice to combat accident phenomenon and the contrast can be performed through multiple actions."
"Subscribed to us Mercandelli more controls and inspections are necessary, as a more important intervention on the training of workers, and this is from school."
- He added, "as still needs to make efforts in terms of communication and awareness of public opinion.
"But mostly, a more sense of employees' responsibilities to a phenomenon representing social emergency."
"Mirandelli then described "progress deterioration of the conditions for immunity for the victims of work" and the deprived assistance to which the system orientates the last years."
"The goal is therefore to pay the insurance guarantee to the worker – he added so that the desire of the person who has an accident must not depend on spontaneism or enlargement of the lawyer"
The Mp3 fingerprints, they risk the audition.
Select full volume music during a long period using portable music devices such as Mp3 readers may cause permanent lesions to hear.
This is what the European Commission, which, in a communication distributed to Brussels, refers to the Opinion of the scientific Committee on improving and recent health risks of the EU, which is published today.
"Over this scientific-read us in the note-- it is that 5-10% of those who, for a period of less than 5 years, hear from the full volume music using portable music devices, for more than one hour per day and a week, risk a permanent loss of auditive capacity."
"I'm concerned of the fact that a number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and full volume mobile phones could end uncertainly their audition in a senseless way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"In accordance with the scientific data, you're a clear risk and we must react quickly.
The most important thing is to make consumers aware and make this public information.
Furthermore, we need to revise the existing control systems in terms of scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and can follow new technologies."
Brussels requested the independent scientific Committee to consider the problem, in view of intensive use of portable music devices and the increase of the number of young people expressed to the voice.
"Scientary-concluses the UE- executive confirm that there are good reasons to worry, and that the European Commission will now consider with Member States and other stakeholders , which measures could be taken to improve children and adolescents, against the exposure to the voice of portable musical and similar devices.
There is already a European security standard that limits the sound level of portable music devices at 100DB, but an increased concern about hearing damage that could result from an extensive exhibition to such sound sources.
It is possible to limit these data using solutions such as the reduction of levels and the duration of bruit exhibition.
The Committee notes that the users of portable music devices, who listen to full music (more than 89 decible) for 5 hours per week, are defining the current limits on the maximum sound level allowed on the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions, during long-term periods, risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity after 5 years.
This includes 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number may be quantified to around 2.5 and 10 million people in the United States.
Roman has given the order to leave the Commission for the future of the capital.
Today, in March, we're going to end, in June we're going to shoot the weapon.
This is the calendar set by the Capital for the work of the "Commission for the Future of Rome Capitale", which took place this morning in the new seat, behind the Caracalla Thermes.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission will set the directives for Rome.
In March, when the Committee and the Joint Council will evaluate the analysis and projects, in order to present in June, the Strategic Plan for Rome with the Official " of the Capital and Major Gianni Alemanno " .
"The Commission is absolutely independent; all political, social and cultural ideas are represented, and it will like to emphasise German- it should propose Rome development ideas, which can serve decision-makings, remaining by the Committee and the Joint Council.
No superposition of roles, but only the desire to have a coin where to develop a great project for Rome.
In March, it will end its tasks and will then disappear, because this experience must have a specific time period.
In June-notice, we will present the strategic plan of work made by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale."
For those who accused the Commission to be unnecessary, seeing its opinions will not be binding, Germany said: "Every depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do, and on the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is, as in France, thanks to the Commission Attali, as well as in Rome, I am on, it will be essential.
Politics are too often accompanied by daily management and emergency emergency that appear timely.
On the other hand, we want to see from the previous, and more far from, to a deeper perspective, we work seriously on the development of Rome and its future."
Furthermore, the master of Rome wishes to point out that "This Commission is not an unnecessary organization or a bureaucratic group: it is absolutely free, and will not cost an euro to the Roman citadins, and will serve to study and to participate in the best intelligence that explicit the Capital.
For Germany, in fact, "A strategic reference building needs, not close or immovable, to allow our city to improve, which it absolutely needs, while thinking about his future now a unique spirit, ".
A future that, specifically the maire of Rome, "not will be limited to the ordinary common borders, but that will look away" not only in the optique of the future of the metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital, but also in relation to the role that Rome can and must have, as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama, the first anti-American president.
A famous American politician who wants to move for independent, wrote: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by its decisions, destroyed the U.S. economy and produced reports (such as it is still, as private citizen) with the Islam enemy."
The attacks against Obama increase while the date of elections approaches.
A dame of Miami wrote on a website: "This person is full of ambition."
Obama is really accumulated: he believes he will win the highest function of a nation that has all accounted, two teachers and five black senators!"
In fact, it is an attack that does not say anything great; it is apparently the racial attacks of nature, and they don't respond to the question of all the elections: will it be a good president?
In this case, it's still someone who speaks with the heart and not with the brain.
A newspaper of Mississippi, in the southern United States, wrote a article: once in the vote cabinet, we know who the American patriot will give his vote.
That's what he's emerging an aspect of the secret ment of the American mentality until the end.
"Set what you want, we will even see put the croix, on Obama or on McCain.
There are even people who play: if Obama wins, we go from the United States.
You're never revealed until now, at such a point that the black success of the candidate seems almost certain.
Of course, despite all these reasons, the winning card for democrates is George Bush.
It was asked to 1500 persons: What were the mistakes made by Bush during his mandate? 89 percent responded: Iraq.
America changes.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50 thousand soldiers and was returned to the feet.
In Iraq, 4500 soldiers lost life, and Americans have not been contrary to make the valleys.
Despite this, Iraq was, for most, the point of weakness of Bush.
He who will take George W will have a huge cup to do.
Use, economic disagreement is even feeling in journalists: it's the time of removal, and many accused the Internet, this "assassin" of the newspaper.
Five hundred American journalists were interpelled by the PEW Research Centre on the status of their professional and mental control for the future.
And well, almost all journalists are bad today about their future.
However, they have not openly declared the attached to the information, less worried about the credibility.
They don't feel isolated as sometimes.
The problem of the American journalists is the money, the money.
The 2008 periodist crisis is a destroyed economic model crisis.
Furthermore, the removals carried out in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work on the collection of newspapers are a huge problem.
It is a problem that must be solved, according to the interviewed journalists, if traditional journalism, such as the Great public hears it, is not deeperable.
A clear but complex evilism enrichs the American journalism.
Six on ten executive and journalists of printing journalists are convinced that the journalism at national level is now to follow a bad path.
Locally, the Executive Group is 65%.
Publication printed against transmission.
The journalists aren't bad to see where the web goes.
The largest editioning houses move to the Internet, which is many of them as "assassin" of the paper.
The "Economy" feelings of journalists has increased up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists admitted to the technological hope that it does something good for their journalism.
Today, the largest increase in the American journalism resides between the newsrooms, i.e. the directors and reporters who work for them.
56% of national directors are convinced that reporters share their values, while at the local level, this percentage is 23 per cent.
For some, it is related to the "sweetness of work".
The directors who think to lose their employment position in three years are 47% at national level.
With regard to journalists, 30 per cent is going.
The "safe trail" at the staff level (Now editors, ndr) in America is still at the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists are working under contract.
In a large nation such as Us, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journalists, reviews, radio, television and Internet, employers often offer what they want, and that is rapidly a question to take or leave.
Directors are almost always received large payments, while the director can win $100,000 per month, besides the payment and payment of insurance.
As for the holidays, logic is combined: x days after the first year, x days after the third, until 15 days in all, a number of years passed.
But, according to their revealings, American journalists are often "malad" during the year.
That's the guilty of the climate.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROME, COPPOLA REST A GROTTAFERRATA.
The Chairman of the Second Criminal Section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the Institute of the Immobiliary Agency Danilo Coppola, who asked to leave his city, Grottaferrata, for a room in Rome.
Coppola is undertaken for bankroat in the framework of the Unipol-Bnl instruction.
During the proceedings at its charge, the last week, he had obtained the removal of homeship transformed in obligatory residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked the real estate of the city of province to a room in the capital.
According to the Court, such movements (as not granted) would allow him to influence its society and to have access to evidence accused by it.
They are elected in danger.
The phenomenon was already shown some days, with the vote of the Representative Chamber, in contrast to the saving plan of $700 billion approved by the White House: a great number of Americans was, and it was more interested to punish Wall Street than to save the American economy.
And it is the New York Times to get here that it confirms that the current crisis is divided by the Republician Party, even more shared between its âme East Coast, modeled, favourable to the federal institutions and the Community business, and, in contrast, its new soul, conservator, hostile to" those of Washington" and the world of finance, strongly in the Central and South States.
The soul justly, who has feeled in a sense of the vote I spoke to you at the beginning.
However, what is about to be town is only an example of the changes, the large changes that the current economic earthquake is pre-announced or that it is already moving: not only to the United States, but in the west, and it may be not only here.
In the United States as in Europe, the crisis seems to make acceleration of cooking phenomenons since a few years, as they are, in the new climate, solidating and revealing.
The first of these phenomenons is the renewation, the extraordinary relations, the two-party category of the State Supreme, as regards a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis is a crisis of bank-financial institutions who, apparently, have close reports with the foreign, but, above all, are involved at large level, the balances of persons and families living in one country in one State.
This is immediately creating a political problem to control it: it is how to respond to the difficulties and protests of persons and families that are also an electoral.
In short, the crisis appears globally but politically, it is almost national.
Political internationalization seems really out of the game or well, there is no great thing to say: the evident evidence is provided to us by the European Union, which, as usually shared, between the various interests and between the various national strategies, is not able to decide any common policy line.
And so it is from the Government of each State that all are waiting for interventions, rescue plans, new rules, and especially a relief of credits: when it is a difficult period, there is only States that have economic resources, the mass of financial resources capable of try to reimburse the things in place.
They also have the necessary means and the legitimation to use them: two resources of an invaluable value, elements of which no market or international organization can never be provided similarly.
This new emphasis on the state-need crisis is the full harmonised remaining with the continuing importance that the recentest economic developments in the economy tend to contribute to a sufficient factor related to this element: territoriality.
Paradoxally, when we were convinced to be now entered into the network, the technology still more sophisticated, non-matematic, convinced that globalised financing was now intended to rule the world, we have taken into account one of one, that our future will oppose to regulate its accounts still more with enough material things such as water, reclaims, petrols.
Those things can certainly be transported from a place to another of the earth, but are associated with a surrounded area, in a territory.
So, who is sovereign, has certainly more cards than those who are not it, i.e., he who has the maliciousness to live in a place without collapse, without petrol and without water.
I'm now coming to the second newspaper that provides a fracture.
Who says Territory, Itet, Government, is inevitably called Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomenons.
From a cat, the conscience of the need for authorized leadership objective, the search for a person who is able to take the situation into hand.
On the other side, a discreet vague for existing leadings, economic species that have been discovered inadequate and full of shadow zone.
And also, some more deep thing, in a certain sense, even worried: a discredit, a suffering, an inadequate image, a feeling of disappearance that is attempting the entire class of directors in a growing number of Netherlands of the West.
In addition, it increases the conviction of different classes, before the actions are the same ideas of social elections until now, their way to hear and be, their culture in the complex acceptance of the term, with the same time, and to be far more for the majority's opinions.
In short, the request for leadership, foodly sustained, a powerful and redressed movement of the leading classes and traditional political orders, which appear in the "revolutional" electoral" or, in the changes of collective humors of these last time, from conservative conservative attractions in Austria Baviere, to the chute of worklists in Great Britain, to the refusal of American congress against Bush (and it might be that the victory of the right in Italy may not be occurred by hazard).
It is the impression that traditional elections, parts, programs, but also their rites, newspapers, their intellectual accreditations, formats, would always say, have more difficulties, which does not give today, to understand and therefore represent the deep coasts of the West society, and that economic crisis strengthens, increases and potentially declined.
In view of all this, speaking of a current "Mass relaxation" at the agenda, it seems explicitly explicit.
But we say well, keep the big eyes open, it's not without reason.
The supercale to walk on the walls.
Get the laws of gravity through a super colleague and, in the future, walk on parois like Spiderman.
This is the goal of various American research centres, and today, a team of four institutions has been almost successed.
With an adhesive measured at least 2,5 centimeters, the researchers succeeded to maintain a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical parish.
The American Science Review published the discovery of some researchers of the University of Dayton, d'Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material, found by the research team, is an evolution of those we know that use a particular carbon structure called carbon tubes.
"The principle of the colle can be imagined as a series of tubes available as a spaghetti hair." He explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Atlanta.
Scientists were inspired from geckos pattes, covered by microscopic pools that allow the animal to ensure perfectly accessible.
The tests carried out on various materials, such as seeing it, the Test, and the glass paper, showed that the new adhesive is ten times more powerful than the pattes of these reptiles, and at the same time, that it is easily detained from the paroi" explains Liming Dai, searching for the Ingenieur faculty of the University of Dayton.
MARCHER SUR LES MURS? –" This material could be used as temporary added" add Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on parois like Spiderman? Maybe it might be that yes, but researchers think a lot less exciting use such as connection between electronic devices, since the carbon tubes are equipped with heat and electric power.
Other applications may be related to airspace engineering.
For now, not super heroes.
The RECHERCHE-University of Berkeley in California also welcomes the research of a new adhesion.
In an article of the American Chemical Society American magazine, Californian researchers presented a formed microfibres like hair, which seems cleaning powders during the movement on a surface to ensure perfect and constant accession.
Medicinals: never with fruit wheels.
Attention at the court of pplemousse, orange and pome.
These drinks, mostly consumed by disappointing and rich in vitamins, if associated with some live medicines, increase the acceleration or reduction of the efficiency according to the cases, their effectiveness, with even serious consequences for health.
David Nailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, recalls the risks of the fruit jus that they are, in bottle or costs, if related to the injection of certain medicines; during the 236th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society at Philadelphie, he launchs a new warning: it's enough of green of pamplemous, orange and pums to reduce the abolition of some live medicines, deniing their generic effects and declineing the health of patients.
The pamplemousse court has already been strongly criticised because it has been retained to increase the effects of certain anti-arthmic, antibiotics, anxiolytics, staminal and neurological medicines, until toxic levels.
MEDICAMENTs A RISQUE- This is the Italian Medicinal Agency itself, which had given the new in a two-year information bulletin, when doctors and patients should not assess the risk of this mix and take attention to what it is drunk, if medicines, for example, Diazepam or Metadone.
PAS LE PAMPLEMOUSSE- According to the experts, even the orange and pome court contains substances that prevent medicines.
Long is the list of active principles inhibited by pamplemussis and other courts.
The call by Michele Carruba, Director of the Department of Pharmaology of the Public University of Milan: "These discovered are generally reported, immediately reported to the various national and international medicine agencies that need to need, change the information notes of medicines.
It is always necessary to read medicines that are taken, and, if something is not clear, not to be impressed, but to be clearly addressed to the doctor or pharmacian" said the expert at Ansa Agent.
The Economy Nobel of Paul Krugman.
The Nobel price of the economy was granted to the American Paul Krugman for its research on trade models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a neo-keynésian who is teaching the University of Princeton and is also a famous publisher of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most critical solutions in economic and foreign policy of Bush administration.
A few months after the attacks of September 2001, Krugman wrote in a article published on New York Times that the second event would have been more determined than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prediction which declines many polematics, which was repealed to the economicist for years, but now it was revealed.
"I'm surprised and even a little lacked of the speed with which the memory of scandals such as the foundation of Enron or Worldcom has disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "grand value economicist", but also a very aggressive style-displayeur, particularly critical to the outcomes of the Bush Administration libraialism.
Open Office, this is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft package"
This is the day of the distribution of OpenOffice.org.3.0, the open source of personal productivity that is to be touched always and more users from the office, professionals to the public administration, proposing a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
Following an year of printing work, carried out by voluntary development developers, monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with various news: the Welcome screen, and the revised and become less outer, other more important, such as the compatibility of the operative Apple Mac OS X, and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the last ISO standard version.
Open Office has particularly taken attention to the interaction with the Foundation Office of 2007, and it is possible to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.dokk, .xlsx, .ptx.)
So interesting, some specific functions to some modules, such as the one that allows you to reduce the CSV presentations sizes, for example, to send them by email, or to import PDF files in the graphical development module, keeping the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front, it is possible to create "PDF hybrides" documents that bind the typical format format graphic in elements of a calculation sheet or text developer.
Co-operation between several people is an element that had different improvements within the application: in the calculation sheet, different users can intervene, avoiding change conflicts, in the preparation of texts, as each partner has been admitted a color of comments for a better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are even working to bring some functions from OpenOffice on the Web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the next weeks they should give the final result.
The Italian version is downloaded to http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.htmlet and adds to the English version that was on the mirror since Friday.
Windows and Mac OS outside, the follow is as usually available for the Linux operative system.
On request, the installation CD may be sent to home or on the workplace.
And if the theme of free may be a way to disseminate it in houses, it is just in business, that Open Office follows the great challenge, which may already take into account the various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
Without account of the realities that provide a training, consultation and assistance service, ideal for small and medium-sized enterprises, which could also be opened to business perspectives.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Write, for the Word equivalent video; Calc, is the calculation sheet that seems to replace Excel; Impress, for the reval presentations of PowerPoint;Dbase, such as the famous Access, is the program that allows you to work on databases; finally Drwa is the graphic module.
Objective for 2008, reaching 5 million downloads, and considering that today we have been accounted at almost 3 million and 600 million, it is likely that with the output of the new version, you can even exceed the specified number
Kohl also is positive, is the fourth case of doping.
New case of positiveness at the last Tour of France: it is the Austrian team Gerolsteiner, Bernhard Kohl, the third qualified, and winner of the best grimper.
This is the site of the daily The Team that reports the news.
On 26ans, Kohl is the fourth positive cyclist in Cera, the third generation Epo, after the Italian Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli, and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The blood analysis carried out on Kohl tests are part of those carried out in the last weeks by Lausana and Chatenay-Malabry laboratorys.
If the anti-analyses confirm the positiveness in Cera, Austria will lose its third place to the Tour and will have strongly expire two years of elimination.
The news of Kohl's positiveness to the third generation Epoca, was confirmed by the Chief of the French Anti-Doping Agency, Peter Bordry, who informed the Press Association, had notified the positiveness of the Australian authorities.
The Austrian of 26ans laid on the Spanish podium, Carlos Sastros and the American Cadel Evans, thus railing the maillot of the best grimper.
IMMIGS: NEW YORK THAT THE DEMAND OF THE RACISTE?
Italy "as recently transformed migrant countries to a privileged destination for immigrants" welcomed.
This would transform the Beau country into a racist nation? This is what the New York Times has made a long article discussing the theme of racism in Italy, from the case of Abdul William Guibre, originary of Burkina Faso, killed the last month in Milan, to have shot a biscuit boat.
This is evident that New York Times is defined as the north Paradoxe: the North regions are at the time where the integration and more work are registered, but also" a strongest anti-immigrated feeling of the country and the most important support to North Lega"
In order to confirm the growing tension between Italian and immigrants, the NYT also refers to Milan, Parme, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno's episodes.
Not just.
Even the new legislation required by Lega to release immigration and facilitate the expulsion of clandests, it is stated as a evidence of climate change in Italy.
Tendance emphasized by the Pope as well as by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano during his meeting with Benoît XVI in Quirinal, asked what the State and the Church work together to win racism."

According to the last survey of Sunia, a simple room can feed up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now reached very serious aspects for excluding the entire number of youth categories, the right to study because of the highly global costs that provenance families should support the responsibility of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani in these cities, the strong demand of students has so deformed the market that a generalized increase process has been loved for residents.
In most cases, location offers also have a series of violations: free type contracts, not registered, without lower limit, sub-locations.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions by the intermediary review of the fiscal imposition are necessary to calm the prices.
Reading details the investigation, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the Brianza area, approximately 450 euros; for a simple room, we go from 650 euros minimum (New bande zone), at an average amount of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine and Fiera) at a maximum of 900 euros (Vittoria zone)
In Florence, a middle bed, EUR 350/400, a room around 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in the nearby university zones, it needs 250/280 euros for a double bed and 370-500 for a simple room.
In Rome, in the nearby central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), some 600 euros are requested for a simple, 450 for a bed in a double.
Lowly lower values (550 euros for a simple) for neighbouring areas of other universities (Ostines and Cinety).
It can only be recognized if it is away in the devices: 300 euros for a bed and 450 for a simple in the Predestina area, Cento cellule or similar.
To Naples, for a bed we need 300/400 euros, for a simple, we are exempt from 400 to 600 euros, with higher prices in the Policical, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari, by bed, EUR 250/350, at least 350 for a simple.
In smaller cities, prices are more absolutely lower, but they have an important importance in the citadin economy.
Finally, the cities such as Perugia, where locations are often undertaken by extra Community students, are registered a later anomaly: foreign students' loan is 25/30 per cent compared to Italians.
Available old Paradiso cinéma, the cities select the historic rooms.
History cinemic rooms for Multiplexs.
"A city without cinem rooms is a blind city, it's like an eyeless face"
The image offered by the scene Joseph Tornador, illustrates well what happens in the large Italian urban centres, but also in the province cities,
The process of marginalization of the cinemmas, with the birth of the great numbers, and the death of money consumption in the central areas of the cities, is one of the major events that appear to us inadequate and incognitable; it is also all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear, these are often stories and memory places, "It's like if one of my friends were disappeared, someone who is known, with whom we shared a road and so many emotions" observes the meter in scene of the New Paradiso, film that offers to Tornator 20 years ago, the Oscar first and the Great Prix of the jury of Cannes, and who told the poesie of a province room, and the nostalgie of a way to live the cinemam, may be lost forever.
The figures provided by Anec, the main association of traders, mean all that these five years, 316 traditional kinds of cells have closed, and these are the main rooms of the cities that have especially paid the costs: 10 of less in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 at least in Turin, 5 in Palerme.
Among the most touched regions, the Roman Emilie is headed with 82 perd mono rooms, followed by Toscane (44) and Lombardy (41).
The evidence that it confirms that the first responsible for their disappearance is the adherence of the multix, because the three Italian regions who have recorded the most new tanks: 195 screens in Lombardy over the past five years, 81 in Toscane, as well as in Emilie-Romagna.
"The Italian exploitation has been developed irrationally," Paul Protti, President of Anec, notes, "it is useful to build new structures, but it should also be necessary to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a close room in a city, these frequentors are not strongly disposed to go to the multiples.
Without speaking of the lack of credit for trade unemployment: the State's anti-debt is approximately 10 million euros.
It is shame that the Government does not respect the existing laws in a matter of ethical and moral view.
In order to support the sector, there would be 16-18 million euros per year.
Note the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, in concern of these closures, decided to solve the situation through the signing of a protocol between Mairie and Anec, the first of that kind in Italy, to defend and promoting the mono rooms of historical centres and petrols.
Under the prescribed rules, there are tax facilitation measures for generators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: spectators can enter in the limited movement area and will have special tariffs for stations and certain parkings.
"It's an initiative that pleases" notes Joseph Tornator, and I hope that other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
However, it is obvious that, in order to combat the super power of multix, traditional rooms should also improve the quality of the sound and the image, because the public of today is more required.
The defence of the traditional cinem is a theme that has always been important: the closement of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the etincelle that convicted me to make the "New Cinema Paradiso" which I thought for 10 years.
I lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I go before the Rialto, or the Quirinal of Via National, now closed, where I have so much lived of daily emotions, I turn from the other cott to see the brown panels from the powder.
License between political and ‘ndrangheta’, Mair arrest of Joia Tauro.
"The Maire of Joia Tauro was prepared to uniform the choices of the Marij to the interests of the Piromalli clan."
The Heads of the Calabre Division are launched by the Masters of the Anti-mafia Division, against the sea and the Master Seat Joia Tauro, Giorgio Dal Torrione, and Rosario Schiavione, and the Maire of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning for outdoor support for mafial association.
Manets also for Joacchino Piromalli, the former mediator between the clan and the public administrations, and his little avocate son, the boss homonym, already condemned for the association of mafial type damageers, as well as 10 million euros.
"a contrast to legal and moral regulations, and especially in good sense" the prosecutors, the two local administrations expressed the desire to pay consultations to Master Piromalli.
"Indeed, the clan was granted to write the judges to officially enter into the masters that facilitate the opportunities, already significant, control, and guidance of the public administration."
The President of the Regional Calabrais Committee Agazio Loiero, not only hide "collections between the local committees and the organized crime, there is more than one" in its region: "There are places where mafial intensity is stronger than in others, where the college is almost inevitable.
But there are also many politicians who resist to the pressure of the drangheta, heroes who are honorable."
The arrests of this morning follow the last July, after which the police announced the Piromalli clan.
From the end of April, the Joia Tauro Joia Common Council was dismissed; already in 1991, and still because of the provisions presumed between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been loaded from their function to manage the Ville.
John Dal Torrione, UDC Major at the dissolution time, was appointed head of a right centre coalition after the Mai 2006 ballottage.
He cried to the scandale when the prefector orders the dissolution of the Joint Council.
He accused the Minister of Internal Minister at the time, Marco Minniti, who accused that he had undertaken all for a political question, but in view of the request for incarceration signed this morning, judges explain that the Piromalli Clan had even succeeded to request the change of the A3 project.
In view of interactions against Dal Torrione, the pm is endorsed, " the availability to marry the requirements of a business man, representing a more known group, near the Piromalli, uniformizing the elections of the public administration to Clan's interests.
When energy is born vages, the largers are now starting.
This is a disadvantaged jacket that operates more than 70% of the planet surface, and now the large global energy companies are now discovering it.
Vagos, currents, married, here are the new renewable sources on which collapses like Chevron put their eyes, and now they try to put it on.
The possibility of obtaining energy from the sea movements has been studied for hundreds of years, and in the 70s, in conjunction with the first severe crisis, the research has been intensified.
When the price of petrol was lowered to 1980, the idea of exploring marine energy was developed, but now the ecological institutions and the new increase of the petrol gives a large expansion to the sector
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London was estimated in 2007 that 15 per cent of the global electricity need could be covered by marine operation systems.
This amount would be the double of the production of nuclear centres.
And in addition, there would be the flowers and marriages.
Coloss the attack.
The first undertaking on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 helped an agreement to build an installation in the north of Portugal.
When the agreement was announced, it would be said a real non-revolutionary.
Those two years of this, still more candidates among those undertakings who have always been traditional energy fall on marine energy.
"Chevron is currently studying the ocean energy technologies- said the ports of a company associated with the American petroleum colonia, the Wall Street Journal economic daily and evaluates the opportunities to cooperate with us."
The cooperation concerned concerning the obtaining of a authorisation issued by the American Energy Commission, necessary to give place to an operation of marine energy in Alaska.
This is a very interesting signal, especially if you are thinking that just in Alaska, use continues to extract the petrol, and recently President Bush has established a project for new excavations.
Outside Chevron, there are Verdante Power Inc. From New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey, which leads to the way of energy coming from the sea, and invitation is until now, although their details are not known, indicated according to observers, a growing interest.
Technology.
Experts are still talking about a technology at its beginning, so that marine energy does not disappear the fears against environmental impact.
At present, the systems such as Portugal or some in Economis are small, and they seem not to create big problems in the ecosism.
To produce large energy, however, technology needs to be used with higher environmental impact.
"And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, use a bottle system linked to the others.
The poussy of vags, which makes the bows up and down, is converted to a hydraulic pressure of pants and cylinders inside flowers.
Press turns to a turbine that is at its tour, foodly a generator.
Energy is sent to the river through marine chambers.
To now, we have four systems of this kind in the project phase, at the expectation of a unique federal approval and a part of energy could serve a military installation.
On the other hand, power is already produced from energy for a commercial centre and parking using six tours under the East River Marines.
The water movement in marines makes the tours of the turbines, creating a rotation movement that eats a generator.
Verdant announced having a long list of customers in waiting for the necessary authorisations to enhance energy.
After you go, the marriages.
A particular interest, say they to the Institute for Elective Energy Research, which now merits the potential of marine.
Although it is an intermittant phenomenon, the sea is more predictable than wind, sun or vags, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
And it is just about marine energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, with others, have invested 7 million and half dollars in 2008 and provided investments up to 35 million in 2009.
