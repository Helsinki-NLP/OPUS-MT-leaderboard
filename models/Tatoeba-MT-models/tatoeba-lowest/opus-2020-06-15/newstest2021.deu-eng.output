The life of the musicers ("The End Of The Game", "In The Skies") is a railway.
With Fleetwood Mac Green experienced a rare increase - the band felt their greatest success but then without him.

At the end of the decade, Greece reached 1979 with an observer success with one of religious theme inspired albums.
Fleetwood Mac is so dreaming without him in a new training on a successed hall.
