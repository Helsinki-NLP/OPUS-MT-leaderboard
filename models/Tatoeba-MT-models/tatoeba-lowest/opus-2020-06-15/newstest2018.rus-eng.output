The President of Russia of Armymond Putin signed the administrative responsibilities law for the violation of the deadline and payment of goods (work, services) in the implementation of a procurement for public and municipal needs.
The law has been invited to address a very rigorous problem of the non-compliance of its obligations by defenders in the implementation of public and municipal purchases.
Against two years ago, the situation that enterprises could not receive payment for the public and municipal contracts already completed.
However, the President of Russia commanded the General RF prosecutor to address special control.
Since the businessmen couldn't be conducted with the dismissible debtors that were not funded by contracts, they were usually trying to disappear from pay obligations and to include illegal circumstances.
The problem was overall in the country.
Since 2015, for the protection of the rights of enterprises to the receipt of public procurements, 9.7 per cent of the reports have been submitted, as a result of their consideration of discipline responsibilities, 4,5 per cent of the officials to the Administrative - 533, as follows, for the organization of proceedings, were submitted to 75 materials.
There was more than 66 billion kilometres of debts to the enterprises.
Since these huge amounts have not been paid far from the lack of multi-milliard contracts.
To the banking debt, many, systematic debts for the payment of businessers have resulted in more comprehensive amounts.
This is a characteristic case.
The small company manager gained competition services for a number of million rubbers.
The man had put all its vessels, has completely fulfilled its commitments, but it had not received the money provided for a time.
The results of a financial combust from payment, taxes, credits that would lead to banking, unless the undertaking had not returned to the procurement.
In several regions, the problem has now been resolved at a maximum level.
Nevertheless, at the first period of 2017, the total amount of debt on State and municipal contracts identified by sub-Agents of the Russian Federation was about 27.4 billion.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical values, the procurity is working in the manual anticrisis management regime.
The prosecutor is personally held outcoming meetings with the representatives of the local authorities, where all covered prosecutors are elected by violations and measures to immediately eliminate them.
Such operational meetings in this year have already been held in Yarowall and Ecatherinburgh.
In order to improve the payment of public debtors, the Federal Law No. 189-FS " on the changes to the Russian Federation Code on Administrative Crimes in the part of establishment of administrative responsibilities of officials for the violation of the period and order of the payment of goods (work, services) in order to ensure public and municipal needs, which was signed by the President of Russia last week.
The draft law was developed by the Russian Development of the Genequator initiative.
The new law complements the Code of the Russian Federation on Administrative Crimes, which provides a series from 30 to 50 per cent for the violation of the official person of the Defenceer and Order of goods, work and services in public and municipal purchases.
And if the official has already been administrative punishment for similar offence, it is waiting for discussion for a period from one year to two years.
All prosecutors of the Russian Federation have already been charged to ensure the application of these legislation news to practice.
The Civil Rights Protection Group announced warning to the Mission ' s movement
The National Association for the Promotion of Color population has published a warning for color-related people in the Mission, through discrimination to state and racial attacks.
The Group comments: “Provision for travelers of the National Association to promote the progress of the color population, actually until 28 August 2017, calls for African, hosts and citizens of the Mission to be particularly attractive and higher attention in the country travels in connection with a number of missile results on the racial race that recently exists on the whole region of the State and the arrivals here”.
According to the National Association, promoting the progress of the colour population, announced the warning of the group ' s movement was built by the recent law adopted in the Mission, which people have been harder to gain the ones related to discrimination, as well as that the law enforcement bodies of the State are often elected by their objects of minorities.
“ You are subject to violation of human rights.
They have stopped on the ways from the colours, killed and killed them," said the Cansas-Site old, Rod Chapel, President of the National Association, to promote the progress of the colour population of the Mission.
"We're often hearing out often as ever."
This is the first warning of such a kind declared by the United States.
The group was sent to incidents as the decrease of black students in the University of Missions and the death of the 20-year-old Torry Sanders, black men from Tennis.
Sanders died in suspicional circumstances previously in the year after the Benzin ended during the State trip, and the mission police arrested him without a prosecution of crime.
The recent report of the Commission ' s prosecutor State is also mentioned in the warranty, which is likely to be restored on the road for black waterers to 75 per cent above for white.
“ The aim of warning is that people are in the course of the situation and warned their parents and friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri,” said Chef.
“The people must be prepared or otherwise if they take money for the wagon or report to the parents traveling through the State territory.”
In accordance with the latest FBC reported on the family crimes of the air, 100 crimes have been registered in the Mission for 2015, which makes the state of sixteen in the State under such violations.
Also, the prevention of movement is a response to the new law of the Mission, after which it will be easier to address the legal person with regard to housing or work discrimination.
The previous American Union for Civil Freedom (ACLU) announced warnings for travellers on the Texas and Arzon since these States have adopted new laws of immigration control, in accordance with which local law enforcement bodies were prescribed to arrest people for violation of immigration laws that ACLU had to have an increased number of racial verifications.
The movement warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but the public organizations have recently turned into the response to certain laws and tendencies within the United States.

Rosturism supports the abolition of free payment for non-ported aircraft
Chapter Rosturismo of Oleg Safones stated in the RBK interview that it was "accounted" to the adoption of the law on the removal of the free railway at the aircraft.
"It is necessary to create conditions where a person who doesn't have a bottle can buy a ticket from a decade than the one in which the bargain is," he stressed (the TAC quote).
Mr. Saphon noted that, despite the threats of citizens, the highest clothes and the mobile phone would not be paid.
"It would be right to endorse all our citizens and tourists and say that it's to the highest clothes, to the zoom, to the mobile phone, to the IT or even a computer of relationship," said the Rosturism.
The previous President of Russia Armymond Putin signed the law of the Arabia's right to exclude a payment proceedings in an indirect aircraft.
It is that the aircraft can define the number of places and weights included in the non-important tariff.
Regiminium Putin commanded the pollution of Baikola
The President of Russia Armymond Puntin at the Bykala protection meeting reported that significant forest territories had been extremely polluted over the past years.
He encouraged the definition of the sources of financing, plans and executives to eliminate pollution.
Mr. Pattin also encouraged the full reform of polluted territories.
"We need to disappear with the objects that continue to work here, the most of them relate," cited "RA Novity" by the President.
He also added that the Russian General Procurement should verify environmental reduction activities.
In his words, there are problems related to the demonstration of steel stocks and a number of violations in the area of ecology by the disappearing organizations.
"I want to underline it: not all the undertakings to check, it also needs to know, but, in fact, illegal and environmental damage activities and to take relevant measures," he stressed.
The Ginevra had reported on the reduction of fish stocks in the Bykall area and proposed an increase in the number of ecological supervisions.
Remember, on 15 June, the Rule of Potterin, during the direct line, declared the need for changes of legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in natural territorys of a special protection regime.
The inhabitants of the island of Olhoon, which entered into the Baskal Natural Territory, reported to him about the problems of conduct.
The Chapter of the Minister of Agriculture of Sergey Donna had immediately proposed a solution to the problem through the deterioration of the border of the Baikola Waterguard Zone, but the Government of Bolivia recalled that such changes were inadequate because restrictions were linked to a number of regulatory acts.
Previously, in the Mine-Economics have proposed a solution to the problem by changeing the ground code and environmental protection law.
New temple in Jugosla
In the Seven communities of indigenous indigenous peoples of the North Rutania, together with the inhabitants of the Belarus Area, participate in the construction of a glorious temple in honor of the Headquarter Nigeria.
Its place is the area of the coast, the temple will be good from a far off, so he will serve the fishermen as a middle.

The fishermen also gives jobs to fellows.
Local inhabitants wait when the temple opens their doors, and the children are even writeing about it as about local ability.
Disneyland with death penalty.
Why do they keep the laws in Singapore?
I'm talking to the local businessman Chang, sitting in a bus at open air.
Considering the situation in Singapore, Chang smoke a sygarette over the other, the aircraft consists of the iron furniture office.
After the end of the businessman's conversation, one goes to the nearest orna, one hundred meters, and selects it.
It reports Chang for the museum in the public, 500 local dollars.
You know, I've just got a refrigerator, I can't stop the phantics from the brain, they're going to smooth.
Now it's all the videocams.
And indeed, the Singapore trainers are in the center of the city clean, like in the museum.
Chang says that three months ago his neighbor's 18 years ago, his neighbor expressed the graphs of the wall of the old colonial building.
The court recognized the guy who was guilty in the bathroom and sentenced to the porc.
What?
Stay here.
He got ten guns of the forest on the hedicians and went a week in prison.
We do not have corporal punishments.
As in Singapore, the highest level of life and the uncertainly serious laws was collected on the AIF survey.
Nobody thinks to disappear the death penalty here, it explains the lawyer Victor Li Hong.
And the Government has long taken the opinion of Europe and the United States on this matter.
If a person leads a big drug party or drugs, it's a settler.
In 2002, Chengy was detained by Australia's 22-year-old civilian airport: it was 400 g of cocaine.
The Australian Prime Minister, threatening sanctions, international defenders and even the Pope of Rome, was protected in his protection.
Yet, the guys were still impressed.
After this, the drugs of our country are slightly moved to the side.
This is the following: Singapore states that the laws are obligation to keep the EESA substantive, not only the humble and humble people.
It's important who you're a million, a president, a well-known artist or a European inhabitant.
If you're gonna find cocaine politics, you'll be sent.
When you walk in Singapore and meet the tables with a lot of warnings, you're just awaiting, how many prohibitions are in this city of justice!
For example, the awkward receipt is sold only in the athetics, and it is possible to buy a row on the receptor (!) doctor.
The tourist will not take a female, but it's supposed to clothe the roof in the metro. It's just one of the local dollars.
Four days I met two persons with white tablets on the chest, "I'm mourning."
In the middle of the ears, there are sometimes the "link in the palace" to take the parks and pitches on the week.
6 руб. pays the 'prosecutor' who forgot to lay water in the public tunnel and in the attempt of making a small need in the home left works a special detective, blocking the doors and sending a sign to the police.
Including all the ecost laws, the breathing of the bulls on the street, the public implementation of the song and even the extrême road of the road growth (!): it is believed that the water abuse is engaged by the chambers.
In the evacuation of the fuels, it is not possible to take a metro, otherwise abroads of 5 tons of syngaporate baxes.
In general, you're thinking that you're going to do something.
This isn't all right, it's trying to get me to Mohammed Cabri-Cadaguay, the owner of the local tourist.
In particular, the fatal laws are only on the boom, and in the last twenty years I haven't seen to take somebody's offence for their violation.
Why are they kept?
So that the citizens don't disappear.
Compliance with the basic regulations are inevitably followed.
As a result, if an incompatible age sales in the oxygen, it will be commanded: the store will pay a large amount, the offender will receive the flags on the "after the part" and the supplier will also be cast into prison.
Thanks to such serious crime laws in Singapore.
Is that right?
In the seventy-year-old years, we made a haose on the roadways, ignored lightfores, walked as they wanted, drunk on the road.
After the invoice of tariffs, everything was calmed for the year.
Now the driver, when drinking a glass, knows that if the police stops, they will not leave the landscape, put the size of the apartment and the year of the decision.
Many foreigners in South-East Asia seem to be different.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore with death penalty, the guest of the United States brought in a terror of all the riches of the people, “the fear of clean airport” and “ocultured nature”.
Example such things are in naturally sensitive and should not be in principle.
The first days in Singapore and you're right to throw a bottle on the trotuar, hide if you're in a metro with a marriage.
But then you're going to the Indian area, and then it's "Standard": the bus stops are shopping plastics.
"What's that?" - You're surprised.
And that's right, the syngapures are angry.
Everything's going.
Not for any such "presentation" will be arrested at the place, but you must know, if you are calculated, you won't be dismissed because you have violated the law.
It's enough to make a person fine.
It is certain that the authority in Singapore is fully authorized.
But you know what?
In Vietnam, I moved very carefully motorcycles often out of the tourists and cameras.
In the center of Paris, full of huge bombs and drugs.
On our streets, they are not all trying to throw a mud in the horns.
Singapore was the most peaceful, clean and secure city on the earth by the drago.
You're thinking.
This is human nature: Remember, and no one in Russia has been stressed by the royal until they were turned.
Although the main steps are not in Singapore, but voluntary compliance with laws.
And we should think that people in Russia would also have been happy with clean streets, absence of furniture in metro and would welcome the arrests of those who run a lift with a public tunnel.
That's telephone punishment. Thank you, don't need.
The other law of Singapore is at least to look at them.
Nothing of holy?
Now, the white house of Trompe was on the Statute of Freedom.
The most hopeful sign of the change of the mode is when he begins to fight the status.
The Americans understand that is not worse than all the others from here, in 2003, a theatrical contribution of the Saddam Housin status.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideas of the Government of the Trump Government, knew without sure what he did when he took a symbolic point on the Statute of Liberty during the dispute with the CNN Jim Akotiva journalist on proposals of the President on the Restrict Migration of the Migration.
Let's be honest, Milller hasn't tried to the same article.
The ownerships of the governing vessels and artists reflecting the Statute of Liberty would have deleted him if he tried to do it.
But he tried to her mind, and particularly the meaning that she was written in 1903, after 17 years after the end of the monastery, when the Pydeste was added to Amma Lazarus.
As Milller said to Acost, "I don't want to enter into the story, but the state of freedom is... the symbol of American freedom that makes peace.
The storing that you say has been added later and is not part of the original Statute of Liberty."
Milller's actually described the facts, but as he said, it's not actually about the story.
This is about the current sound of the huge Lazaro, the only ones in which the State invites not any immigrant but the poorest: "Your poor, your poor, / your dreams who dreams to smile free, / the unfortunate remnant of your grounds."
Nothing more "favorable waste" hadn't been shown on our screens.
Milller did not take literature -- he did not understand that in America there are no waiting for those people in America.
This controversia on the status is a part of a broader political and cultural war, which is really a dispute of America.
Lazaro, and her friends, who are fighting to put her words to the chocolate status after her death, were very well understood that they do perfectly political acts.
Cultural culture should be defined between the French and the American Republic through the Baile classic Physovia of Women's Freedom.
Lazarus changed her meaning that the female figure is not more abstracted, she had a voice.
And she received another name: the Mother of the Destructed.
The connection of the conservation and image was a vile phenistic course and a damaged attack against the American nationalism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the status, right while changed it back.
The Gremologue Rash Limbo, his kind, John the Cruzator, who reported the coming of Tromp, said in 2010 that the Liberty would not invite anybody, more rapidly she is a former non-conservator who has the flow of America in the darkness of the world: “The Freedom is going forward.
It takes the factor of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The fakel doesn't need to light the way in the United States."
Limbo's actualization worked on the point.
The meaning of the Statute depends exclusively from views.
The great creative achievement of Lazarois was to see her as it would have been slightly, unfortunate, but full hopes of people on the boats after long and often hard navigation.
This means in literally viewing the peace of people who seek refugees and the chance of best life.
Its status responds to them in words of hope and hospitality they dream to hear.
And of course, it's not the perspective that Milller and Tramp are ever wanted to recognize.
Their fake needs not to relax the way, but to consume hatred that is the only source of their force.
The World Championship of 2017: Niel Bleck highly appreciates the statistics of the Britain Society.
Elyd Doyle remembers the time when Britain’s collection was only two statistics.
Niel Blake, the Federation Director of Amount of Britain, said that the 16-style statistical part of the world collection at the Championship was "the significant contribution to the game".
A recorded number of statistical easier airports was elected at the Friday of London Chepenonate 2017.
Blake believes that Scotland is "fair" and the Federation of easy Britain Atlantics should take it into account.
"We know this and we're trying to understand and we're going to support until they've got a capacity," said Blake.
"I spoke with people in the Scotland Sport Institute, and they think it's related to what they've done.
The Scotland Federation of Athletes believe that with what they did, it's necessary to work.
The British Federation of Athlettics: with what they did, it should be necessary to work.
And people on the street think the same way.
I don't know why the circumstances were so complicated, but it's quite worse."
Some statistical airports are presented in the meal, including Lorra Muer and Andrew Bakert, who will be able to confront Mr. Mo Fakes at the distance of 5000 m; and Elid Doyle's team elected their captain.
"Elid's crazy.
Her capital talk was great, "which says Blake.
"Muchs were easy, independently, statistics or no, and from where they live or triggered, came out of this room, feeling fiery and nakedness to win.
The fear and the deep feelings that Elid had put in her were wonderful."
The silver medicator of the Society, who is at its fifth World Championship, is 400 m with obstacles, says that 16 statistics in the British collection are "incredible".
The previous record of the statistics on the peak of the world was seven equalitys in 1983 and 2005.
Lora Mur goes forward, specializing to the middle distance and killing five British and two European records last year.
It'll flee to 1500 and $5,000.
Crisis O'HER, who will be involved in 1500 m, is another statistics on which it is to take attention: for the back of his home season, in which winnings were in selection of the Britain collection and the Year orders.
Doyle remembers his first peak of the world when Li Mackonnell was only one statistics in the team.
Captain of the Team says it's "incredible fair" because so many of her co-continencies have gone into the collection, but in some cases, they're going to resolve the meal and fight for the ship.
"The captain of the collection chooses other team members, so it was a great honor in any case, but to know that your friends voted for you and you chosen -- this is perfectly a person," she added.
"Certainly, I'm very bitter for all the statistics who have entered into the collection.
It shows how many we have reached.
And they are all easily assets that will try to fall on the shiphold.
What about my capital talk?
Yeah, I think she was bad.
I just emphasized that we were very lucky to take the World Championite house.
So it's just how it's important to get support from the slaughters and use that we're going to look again at the Olympic Station.
I got another opportunity to go to his apartment and take part in orders, and the atmosphere will be just a wonderful atmosphere."
Facebook crystal block: Do not move to public post if you're not ready to listen to the electors
Our country's headquarter had understood the critical press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't allow them to criticize him from internal policies to its political principles.
The critics of him, of course, were angering.
But he didn't touch his mouth with the crystals.
Because yet in 1783 Washington said, "The liberty of speaking is likely to be put to battle."
Now I'm going to the director Maryland Larry Hogan, who would have to try to be more like Washington.
The subjects of Hogan have blown and have spent at least 450 persons who have reported their opinion on his official page in Facebook.
And this week, the American Union's protection of civil liberties was sent to him into the court.
The subsequent Governors called the speech that was bad, and the web comments were written in the spirit of "never and what".
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But it's also important.
And it's particularly important when talking about the guy of Hogan.
He is a wonderful popular government of the Republic of the Democratic on the primary State.
It is on the second place in the approval of between 50 Governments.
Hagan is not an active reactive.
He demonstrated a strong hand in the management of the State and its commitment to its principles.
He is also useful as a primary way of connection with his electoral, and has shown the low-leeve after the head chemioteropy.
Therefore, to block people who come to the Governor site, which is stated as a official public forum and are officers of the administration for the money of payers, are inadequate and in the final account.
In the Westernton Post Interview, President Amalia Chas defended actions by the Governor, saying that the blocking of commentaries is just their moderation.
But it's too easy to use the shapes, spammers and heathers that hurt on the Internet.
"Pst" talked to some of the real people who closed Hogan.
And that's exactly real people, not thrown, teacher, businessman, pastor who turn to their electors.
They all say that their comments were respectable, containing and not corrupt.
The pastor cited the Bible, appealing that Hogan was Catholic.
A lawyer Lakshmi Saram Raman from Bowei, the Maryland State, did not express hate but asked the crimes in the air of hate.
"I've written a perfect comment that I've been discovered by the lack of his reaction to the crimes committed on the slaughter of hate, and to the other news last time," she wrote in the section of comments to the article "Past".
"I also don't like the idea that when many people leave comments to the same subject, some say that it is so called a penalty, instead of recognizing that there is a great group of unlawful citizens."
Thus, the subdirectors called the "concentred Spam attake", others probably would call the "active life position".
In Facebook's euro, it's easy to draw up their image, just block critics or style negative comments.
This is much less positive work than before it was required to send people to, collect and spend news with critical transactions or arrest and kick the protestants' mouth.
But that's exactly what's going on now, just the number.
Hogen is not the first leader who criticize that he doesn't want to listen to Facebook and other social networks.
The Chairman of Trempo was introduced by the Twitter users who were arrested in his Twitter-akount.
One of the first, turned decisions on this issue was adopted at the same week in Virginia.
According to the U.S. Environmental Judge of Alexander James K. Kashshire, the President of the Laodon Monitoring Board violated the First Amendment, enrolling the elector in his actor in Facecbook.
And in Kentucky, the Republican Governor Metto Bevin presented the claim of the American Union to protect civil liberties for his conduct in Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be so hard.
At the time of Washington’s race of available email expenditures, it has performed approximately the same transfer as today.
From 1776 to 1800, the journal number grew up, and the anonymic writers severely disappeared his authority.
And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.
People under the "Urikola", "Wallerus", "Belizarius" and "Porzius" were written letters in the newspapers exhibiting the Washington decision.
According to the historical documents collected by the " Documents of George Washington", his office was defended by pirates that criticalize his position on the Treaty on Friendly, Trade and Sea.
But he didn't tried to put them down.
The freedom of speaking, identity and statements is in the same basis of our State.
The true leadership means that it is agreed.

Britain roads will learn to reduce damage emissions
Suspicable tunnels on magazines that can improve the elected oxygen cars have already been tested on the ways of Britain.
The country ' s transport agency, as reported by the Autocar publication, was noted on the positive results of the testing of a 100-metre tonne set on one of the shoes to the north.
The tunnel of the height of 6 metres is built out of a few new polymer materials that are able to aggregate damage substances contained in car samples.
However, the establishment of a whole network of such tonnes is only a part of the maximum measures that Britain authorities are willing to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to tunnel networks, English will be able to expand the networks of electricity stations, to implement a number of car reduction activities on roadways, to expand the use of commercial transport on electric furniture and to mobilize the park of hard vehicles.

The poorness and death in the Indian Soil Earth
Reading dinner, Bardin Degei does not use a plate.
It's even hard to use.
In his village house in Enrotali, the capital of the Panya, in the Middle Indonesian province of Papua, the household is usually located in a sweet card that is here called “noto”, right in the shock.
Following a half of the clubs, they have been eating inseparable, immovable hands.
Degei sits on the ground, but she doesn't have it, and it's here, it's the work of the house, such as the smoke of the water clothes from a far-related bottle.
The guilty serves ware in the room without crying.
She was younger of her husband, and she didn't allow her to work in the field.
Many people are distributed here.
Of course, working later may be dangerous: many men of this village are unemployed, many drinking and still soldiers.
“ No one decides to walk through the village after the fifth evening” she said.
This was a rare opportunity to see the daily life in the high-level pool, the former Dutch colonie, joined to Indonesia in 1969 after a suspect relocation, when only 1026 elders were voting to vote with the hands of the occupiant arms.
The existing movement, on the independence of the Netherlands, has rapidly turned its wrath against the Government of Jakart, which maintains hard control over the region, without allowing foreign journalists and human rights.
In 2003, the province was officially divided to Papua and West Papua, and the independent State of Papua-New Guinea takes the eastern part of the island.
Anorotali is the city that is the same as is removed; the road here includes a half-time flight from Jaapur, a administrative centre of province in Nabira, and then a five-time trap on a car.
There's no common transport here.
The city with about 19,000 people are of the village houses offered by bombs; the crowds of the huffed have been increased in the variety of rocks.
There was a few of the Indonesians, not talking about journalists, and almost no foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian missionaries of Papua had a pleasure to worship God named Uga Tame.
There were other changes.
“ We were unfair to bear this clothes, ” says Degei, showing on our green, with the handy prisoner, the dawn and the bright rock.
“ We've been on the television only letters.”
Papua is the poorest province of Indonesia, 28 per cent of its populations live for poverty, and the levels of child mortality and sociality in Asia.
But it's the Indonesian gold land.
The most widely world and the most profitable gold driver, Grasberg, situated in Fenix of the McMoran Firma, is all about sixty miles from Panya, a high province of New Jersey, where 153,000 lives.
Only in 2015, the Freeport company reached approximately $3,1 billion.
The addendum of Papua may be covered by forest stocks, which are estimated at 78 billion dollars.
These riches, however, have been an unfortunate for the Papuas, guaranteed that the powerful armed forces of Indonesia maintain their air presence here.
According to the research of the New York Times, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport companies paid the local military officers and units of almost 20 million dollars, including $10,000.
The needs of greater autonomy by the Papuas are threatening the existence of this gold living and are unfortunately disappeared.
According to the adoption of the Defenders, the Military forces of Indonesia had been killed from 1969 over 500,000 Papuas, and there were still thousands of victims of torture and freedom.
According to the Asiatic Commission on Human Rights, the massacres in the green radic people of the high-level people of Papua in seventy-year-olds can be considered by genocide.
Only in the past year, the Indonesia police arrested more than 3900 peace protestants in the region.
“We lose everything” reported in 2016 by the Britain Eposite contains the evidence of the animals committed in the previous year, such as penalty without the court, torture, particularly parts, as stated in another report, violence and an elektrical fraud, and a cruel decline of peace-democrates.
“ It is difficult to make the number of victims because the results have a place every week,” said Andreas Harsono, who conducts research in Indonesia for the Human Rights Watch.
Gaiki were detained, since Papua’s resources have brought the survivors from other areas of Indonesia.
3.5-million population is 83 per cent of Christians, but demographic indicators change the arrival of musulman economic migrants from the Uganda Indonesia islands – Java, Somatri and Solovakia.
Jaban’s labs, “borns”, sell the smoke and the smoke of the fruits of the “gardo-gado” that is made with a sweet sweet.
Local inhabitants are trying to make competition.
“Immigrants began to sell smoke and fruits from the indigenous inhabitants of Papua”, explains Abeth You, the twenty-four-year-old of the Panya moved to Jayapur, the Administrative of the Province, because of the work.
“ Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua, the mother of Damascus, lost their markets.”
The President of Indonesia Joko Vidodo, known in the people as Jokovai, has sworn to commit the irregularity and violations of the rights in Papoua during its President campaign in 2014.
At his journey to the presidency palace in Jakarte, the former carrier paid support by 27 of 29 areas of Papua, including Pania.
But in Papua there is almost nothing changed, and the local people feel that they are betrayed.
“ Our hearts were broken, because in 2014 we voted for Joshua, waiting for him to fulfill our hopes for justice,” said Joh.
In fact, two months after the Jakovai’s anonymation of Jacuwai Manai survive tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was on the street and drained the birth gems in the coast of Annórtal, when two indonesian soldiers were thrown out on the motocycle.
Defended children told them that they should be included.
As the local pastor Javet Tebay reported, one of the soldiers was moving to their tons and after some time he returned with four soldiers.
According to the victims and testimony, soldiers drunk followed the children and slain them with the examples of shopping.
Then one of the soldiers shot the group of children.
One child, a sixteenth anniversary Julianus Eymo, was so shot that he fell in.
A couple of hours later, a government building of the electoral committee has gone away, and the next day the situation was discovered.
A number of thousands of Papua, women and children were gathered to the football field before the local police party and the military command centre to require justice.
They brought with her selling guns and performed war, the pogame of the Papua tribe: they fled around and reflected drinking.
Some protesters began to throw stones in the police office and the military base.
When the surrounding, the soldiers on the internal radiosounds were said: “If the tongue is contrary to more than three times, kill them,” he sounded, as said in the Official Document that had seen the corrections of the TIME magazine, but that was not published in the local SMEs.
The fifty-year-old Jeremias Cayama, head of the Coto Zone of Enortal, felt a danger and called for peace, turning home to a call.
No one wanted to listen to him.
“ When I turned back, I came to the left pit back, ” he told the "TIME" magazine, standing on the flow of my ring of a vineyardly disappeared house.
Kaima hasn't known who had shot, but he says that the pool was coming from the shange of the soldiers gathered.
“It was a taste, a lot of arrows, ” he adds.
In Alphius Job’s inhabitant, there were three times, as he told his two -born brother who became a slaughter witness.
“ I fled to him and looked at his body to make sure that it is, ” said Yohannes’ magazine, which, as many Indonesians, uses only one name.
“I saw he died... I kissed him. ”
General Jotge Mendah, the elderly Police Inspector of Papua, said to the rapporteurs that his officers had only been protected, because it had been an atomy.
“We must be protected when people threaten us to kill,” said the representative of the police of Papua Commissioner Pullo Solisio in 2015.
“It is the question of life and death.”
According to the Human Rights Watch, five young protestants were killed, and much more was killed.
The news of murderers arrived to Jakarta just the next day.
Three weeks later, Jakovai made a powder speech in Japore, which expressed the sickness of the victims and sweared to take the history of his stomach of power in Papua.
“I want this situation to be owned immediately so that it would never be repeated in the future” he said.
In October 2016, Viranto Minister of Security said that it would establish non-judicial organization to put the end of historic violations of human rights.
But it's almost gone away.
“ The poor part of violations has happened long.
Some of them were placed in nine or at the beginning of nine.
It is that we want to take these violations, but there are procedures that should be gone."
Then Viranto refused his words, speaking with the " TIME" magazine 5 June in Jakart, and said that it was not planned to establish the organization to consider complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "All will be decided through the judgment."
The auspices of which the United Nations had been accused in “Against Human Rights” for the death of more than 1000 persons during the bloody vote for the independence of East Timor in 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua were already deprived, including in Pania.
The seven victims of Panya met similar statements with a dream unbelief.
“ In the last three years, I asked four times, but there was no change, ” says Johannes.
"I'm risen up."
He says that the years later are still in fear.
He says, "I'm afraid,"
“ I'm afraid that military arrested me, I'm afraid they're gonna kill me. ”
His brother James also said that the inhabitants of Panya were afraid of discussing the result.
He said he was killed by soldiers after he helped to bury four victims.
"Before we buried the body, the soldiers have come after me," he said.
The shield hasn't stopped.
On the Tuesday, the Indian Police slaughtered in the villages in the neighborhood of the Pania area of Daiya.
During the context between the forestians and the construction company manager, which refused to bring a man without acknowledgement in the hospital, died one person and 17 were killed, including children.
A man, the twenty-four-year-old Ravianus Doww, who had hidden fish in a storm, died by the road in the hospital.
The destroyed villages provened before the building area of the company.
According to the police, the village people throwed stones in officers that were in response to warning stripes.
But local people claim that the mobile brigade (Indonesian expenses) has become shooting on a tank and killed one person.
“ We were in such a patent, we were afraid of renting, ” reported the TIME magazine of the twentieth year of the Doming Badi, who lived in the hospital and saw how we had been shoted.
“ I saved my house two days. ”
The Deputy Parliament required that the officers had called for reply, and the Mobil Police Brigade from that region.
Panya was always a sick place for the Indonesian Government.
The lack of significant development is the lack of the meme, monna, data and damage thresholds over all the Territory covered by the Central High-Green Regions of Papua.
Many were joined to the Foundation for Free Papua (OPM), a retained army that claims to protect Papuas ' rights because of the advice attaques and flights with the defence of people to Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the highest leaders of the OPM are from Panya, including Tadius Yoga and Daniel Yodas Koyoya.
As a response measures for the past few years, thousands of people were arrested and without detained military forces under the provision “the protection of national independence”.
Some haven't come back.
In the middle of the population of Papua Panya, it is considered to be “forgotten and forgetted places.”
The poorer strengthens the disaster.
The small portion of the quality sold in Annóral is too precious for local people.
It is not the same width that is exactly not available.
People are here growing everything they ask: mainly, notes, and some fruits and letter fruits.
The Selland is the work of women, each of which can listen to the four-fifth fields of the sweet card.
They usually maintain a large number of loans for the family, and the others are sold on the local market.
The ten club notes are about 10,000 Indonesian roads (75 cents).
During time, an increased economic disagreement between indigenous Papuas and new migrants that arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new airports in Naire airport.
Many vacants present usually have been more educated and more status of migrants.
The Popees are strictly lacking money or the necessary ability to make the own competitive business.
“ Young people don’t want to stay in the village... because there is no work nor money, ” says John Gabai, the President of the Panya plenary Board.
The isolation is far from the views of the rest of the world.
Furthermore, the restrictions to international SMEs remain close.
Previously in this year, French journalists Franc Escudi and Bazil Londra were detained from Papua for “accounted agreement with relevant organizations”, although they had a regular permit to conduct videos.
According to Felima China, Vice-Representative Director of Asia, the Houman Rights Watch, promises, data during the pre-selecting campaign of Jacobi were not implemented, with a view to facilitating transparency and development.
“It is now foreign journalists who seek to make reports from the Middle East Indonesian Provinces, Papua and Western Papua face new dangers: the disasters in the visa and the black list,” he said in the statement.
The lack of attention from the press means that the international pressure to the Government of Indonesia is mainly limited by immediate neighbours of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States – Tanga, Naru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Island and the Solomon Islands – requested the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate the “different and wide dispersed violations” in Papua, including the stripe in Panya.
The same countries in the past supported OPM.
The representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia of Nair was rejected from the statements of the group, reported to the journalists in Jakart that “Indonesia still operates the democratic system and there is a free pressure, so that the testing of the episodes of human rights would be difficult”.
Local people want more foreign Governments to take attention to the situation.
When the official delegation of the Netherlands, entitled the Netherlands Human Rights Ambassador, visited Jaapur on 4 May, the local people had violated the silence, praying: “We want freedom”, as he stated the source that was also present at the meeting, but they wished to stay anonymously.
In Indonesia, new presidential elections were held in 2019, but the Papuais said that the government would again vote for Japan.
“ Djukov is a man in whose good intention but he is around the people who are partakers of the strife in the Panya” says Gobai, the chairman of the tribe’s counsel.
He wished to know that the inhabitants of Panya, except they live in the shadow of threats from the side of the alcohol army, are threatened in poverty, and education and health are in a lack of state.
Gobay says that the people of Panya, as well as the other Papuas, consider their voice given for Jokova, a long time that he should pay.
"They don't need money, they just want righteousness," he says.
Despite threats and pollution, families of slaughter victims in Panya have brought the last symbolic act of unlawfulness: they have protected the body of one of the victims in the part of the land directly against the police and military party.
I know that justice has probably never been turning away, at least they will not allow forgotten to forget their crimes.
“ They killed a member of our family, ” says Jacob, not having lifted up his head.
“ What else had we to do?
The second time the Dubai sky is covered by the Faxel sky.

It has been aware of the reason for the massy drag in the Ural Military Centre
The Elena training centre, where the mass dragon has occurred, arrived a group of older officers of the Central Military Force to investigate the circumstances of incident.
Some details of this disease have already been recognized.
According to the Package of Mash, which appeared on the Contractors of the Urbanian Military Part 31612 was hardly disappeared because of an unsubmissed bed.
It was started with all that a series named Sayan demonstratively ignored the order of the officer to send the transcript.
At the side of the officers, military officers of the sixth.
Sheanah supported the first mouth.
A half of 140 young guys shot up in the bed and shots, shot the steel.
More than ten people were lost in the mass trace.
The WHO informed the information on the exchange.
The investigation showed that at least one five passengers in the United States have been prohibited by aircraft.
The investigation showed that more than 20 per cent of the aircraft was awarely or accidentally transported to the aircraft through the view of the United States Safety Administration, prohibited objects, including at least 6 per cent of the aircraft, had been in the aircraft without consideration of prohibited fingers or other objects.
Several 1 per cent reported that later they discovered that they had fire weapons, boats or explosive substances.
Research carried out by the fourth company of Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. and covered over 1000 people, also showed that young passengers were more inclined to violate rules.
Of the republics who recognized that they had awarely tried to land with something prohibited by ATB, 19.7 per cent were Millenniums compared to less than 15 per cent of the X generation members.
The ATB staff are most frequently providing food and water.
More than 3 per cent recognized that specially had been provided through the supervision of the objects, and 2.2 per cent of women ' s republics and 3.7 per cent of the repatriationers had been recognized that they had been recognized in the aircraft.

The jurisdictions are allowed on internal vehicles, but not on international.
Chapter EPA is rejected by the intention of decline the implementation of the Regulations adopted by Obama on the reduction of emissions
On the next day after a 15-style study, the Head of the Environment Agency rejected its decision to deal with the implementation of the Regulations adopted by Obama to reduce the emissions of substances threatening the air and bringing to education.
The Treasury explained its decision that it was now more than the previous administrations needed to regulators of the environment of individual States.
He had not mentioned the steak against his previous position as provided in the Federal Court of Appeal.
It has returned around the period of 1 October, to which States must ensure compliance with the Orientation standards of 2015.
In June, the Presett announced that their compliance for one year would be observed to give more time to study the plan and to avoid "related local decisions or obstacles to economic growth."
The president of the Treasury for its current position was the general prosecutor of the State of Oklahoma longly known as a follower of environmental standards.
Following the movement to Washington, the Pritt was unremovablely blocked or distributed the standards against chemical or gas-weapon industry.
The unexpected change of the average is a regular legal fraud of the Pirate Bay to return to the former standards.
Last month, the Federal Appeal Court in Washington decided that the Chapter of EPA had overlooked its powers, seeking to grant the implementing of the Ombama adopted regulation required to disappear and disappear out and disappearate methana.
In the middle of the middle of the evening, the Pretty proposed that, in a strict change of the course in respect of the ozone standards, it was just the responsibility of EPA to cooperate with states in an integrated timely implementing new standards.
"Our previous administrations, EPA, often could not be placed in notified periods, after that, waiting for the stages from the active group and other persons and discussed the time during the regulation of the case," said the Principte, who made more juveniles against EPA at its previous post.
"We do not believe in the regulation through judicial processes, and we are seriously related to the deadlines provided.
We are also seriously relating to our statute and the authority he gives us."
Nevertheless, the EPA statement said that the Treasury may again use its "population for the disclosure and other data by the law of power" in order to ensure that the standards "jcyjdfys on a clear course and on all available information".
The Republics in the Congress have a broader review of the ozone rules.
The draft law approved by the Plateau for the past month is seeking to repeal the implementation of the Regulations of 2015 as a minimum for eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this issue.
The prosecutor of New York Eric Shenederman, who was authorized by the coalition of states provided for this week against EPA, said that the group was intended to continue legal pressure.
"The change of the EPA course, after our tests, is an important gain in combating health and security 6,7 million New York and more than 115 million Americans, which directly affect their cities," said Shenederman.
New York was joined by California, Connekticut, Delver, Illinois, Aiwa, Man, Massachusets, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvia, Rod Aileland, Vermont and Washington, as well as Colombia.
The ozone on the earth will happen when usual pollution substances from cars, electricity, nephetes and chemicals and other sources are attempted in reaction with the sun.
The result of this can cause serious problems with enthusiasm in those feelings, leading to thousands of pre-temporary deaths a year.
The health and environmental protection defenders welcomed the unexpected change of the Privy rate.
"Thankly think about how much pressure was needed to achieve this completely logical step from a man that is worth to protect the air we disappear," said Larry Hann Brad from the Biological Diversity Center.
"We must continue to resist the ideal campaign of the Trump Administration and the protection of those affecting air and their special interests."

On 1948, the Ford Merküri went through the village of Montro in Georgia, with the river, to the small valley of Mors Ford.
When the four black passengers and white drivers went to the street, a group of white men with red rocks prevailed her the way.
The main man in the middle of years in the cosme in the dark pool was hygary and looked through the wind steel.
Those who were inside disregarded from fear.
"We need this nest, Roger!"-Chucked a man.
"Stop him out of the car!"
Independents have shot the sister when a young black man was driving out of the front seat.
Hopefully, this terrible scene, played on 22 July, is only an intelligence.
But when the Roger's thrown up a pig, almost all the dreams and really smoothed.
Since 2005, the activeists return to the Most of Mors Ford to play that night when two black pairs of Roger and Dorotti Malco and George and May Morrey Darsey were held in 1946.
No one was convicted for these murderers.
"Only that no person has been arrested over all these years, although we see them close to themselves; even though we know who they are," says Tyron Brooks, who helped the organization of a decision.
"It's a fifth on our story and it's a stone on our souls."
71 Year Brooks is a former member of the Georgeia Congress, who is all the life of human rights.
The spectrum for him is a dramatic call for action and an annual reminder of the people of Monro, that injustice was not corrected so.
"We want investigation, we want to complete, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we must reach justice," said he.
"We can't go to healing and reconciliation until we get justice."
Coroner covers the simple body of one of the victims of license in Mors Ford on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBR materials received by Ann-Bie News, more than 50 people in Montro and neighbourhoods were suspected in the participation of the license.
But no one was accused.
Although the decades understood remained free, the defenders said that the city was always aware of two related leaders: policy and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ' s decision allowed the black citizens to vote at the expertise that had to be held in that year.
For example, in the same elections, according to the FBR, the black explosioner Roger Malkum wounded the barnett Hitter, a white landlord, on vision, from the woman.
Brooks says that Hester was sleeping with Mallem Doroti's wife, and that the child she had to be born wasn't from her husband.
According to the FBR, 25 July 1946 Loy Harrison, the great white owner, paid 600 dollars for delivering Malkum from prison.
He went in prison with Doroti and their cousins May Morrey and George Darcy.
But when they went out of prison and went to Mors Ford's valley, the band of leaders around the car.
" It is explained that he has organized and commanded murders by Harrison," this conclusion is made in one of the reports of the FBI.
"That is obvious that there was a conversation between law enforcement bodies of the State and the cities that had not only participated in murders but also detrued the identity of witnesses and covered the personality of witnesses."
Brooks calls it the queen.
"It was a trial to the electoral rights," he said.
"All killed to send a sign to the city: if you register and vote, it will be the same with you."
Before 10 years, Cassandra Green leads a annual spectacle to the mount Mors Ford.
Its spectrum is observed, he hides the slaughter and advises the deep racism that many would like to consider no more in America.
He's hard to look and get back again, but Green thinks that it's the main.
"We don't want to speak about the courts of Linch, because they show us our own nature," she said.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't hear me or you won't hear that I'm over."
The reflection of the spectrum of this year began in June, and the first day of almost 30 white acters, the rest of the black was gathered in the accommodation and listed to the feed review for the year.
Wayd Marbo was a supervisor together with Green.
He played the role of the chief member, but he said that the role was not easier.
"I think I'm hurting, because it's not the man I'm," said Marbo.
"But I think it's important to remember this story because we don't want to come back at that time."
The actors of Darius Bradshou and Nick Roger Mallem and Barnetta Hether are playing their roles.
The Factor begins with Malcolm, explained that Hester's wife sleeping, crying and touching him.
"I said, 'Now, get out of my house!"
Ruskin's crying in response.
It seems to be a smoke.
And at the same time all (al least all black acts) are expressed to the desire.
Green's mourning.
'What' asks Acosna.
He is worried and troubled.
I'm going to play it?
'No,' said Green in his laugh.
"I just don't think the white then have spoken low."
"Yes," one of the black executives is moving.
"You must bring a strong 'r'."
In the same way, energy changes in the room: the discrete changes the feelings of the company.
Everyone must do right, not only for drinks, but also for memory of four murderers.
The scene begins first.
This time, when Rocona speaks the word on the letter 'n', it's clear and clear.
No man laughs.
The factor is closed and quickly completed.
Crick, shoot, and then quiet.
The woman in a dark black clothes stands on the body of the actors and performs a hard song of Billy Holiday "Strange Fruit".
Her voice stops through the word.
In the hundreds of her rings, half hundred thunders are thunders and potts.
In the middle of the rabbits, almost equal number of black and white.
One couple came from the fact, New York State to see the presentation, and many lives closely.
They suffered almost eight hours of Georgia’s hard spirit until Brooks was driving them on the tombs of Malcolm and Darcy.
Before the moment of murder remained only stories, but now they stand at the same place where people were lifted, they seem to get out of the air.
When Green has stopped the last song, he invites people to come closer and see the body.
Children are moving to their heads, touching the red painting blood, and the unmounted bodys and shrinking something else.
"They aren't dead in the rest of the dead,"--it fights a little boy, like to remember yourself.
After a few minutes Green thanks the storms, and soon all ends.
The actres are gathering the skins from the skins and throwing tears.
Brodshaw, a man in the cotton who played the main kitchen.
Nick Roscona shares two other actors and the second weeping falls in their disappearance: the emotional loading of the spectrum finally disappeared on it.
"That's okay," she's shopping one of the women.
"We know that your heart is good.
You had reasons for that."
Later, the storms are going to eat with the actress.
After one table, a white couple from Atlanta has been discussed with a black cop that they only knew.
Delay Dappiness is hard to describe that she feels after the spectrum.
"There is to listen to these terrible, terrible words, and actions, people who look like you, and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"That's why I think the license is still going to happen," she adds, "and now it's called the police's stretching."
In the second ring of the room, Tayron Brooks had a general attention, which remembers the work of the human rights defence.
He said that it has already started planning the presentation of the next year.
"The poison encourages us, because she doesn't just describe the terror of what we overlearn, but also teach us," he says.
'Why if you don't get out of this lection, it may happen again.
Those who don't study their story who don't know their story are dealt with her again."

New test results have been issued to assess the age of asylum prosecutors in Sweden
The latest results of asylum testers in Sweden, which undergo a new medical assessment method of age, show that more than 80 per cent of the protested were assessed as persons older than 18 years, but not all trust the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency of Justice (Rättsmedicinalverket) has started testing previously in this year.
They were developed to assess the age of asylum as a more accurately since the Swedish migration Agency (Migrations Verket) had discovered that it had not been able to determine the present age of some refugees who claimed that they were incompatible.
At this time, Migrationsverket sent 6 880 cases to test, and 2 481 tests for the period between March and 31 July 2017 have been published.
Sixty-seven per cent of those tested were estimated as persons of 18 years or older, and in addition, 25 cases of the judiciary were evaluated that “believable, age of 18 or older”.
In the case of 432 cases, the conclusion stated that “believable, less than 18” was said.
The tests are carried out only in cases when human age has caused concerns.

The high share of cases that people were assessed as the 18 - years were not necessarily indicated that the survivors had lied because of their age.
My Agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that, in 442 cases, “the age of 18 years has been tested.”
However, considering 581 issued results, the Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases a person was clearly stated that 18 was fulfilled in this year.

One of the squeptics – andocrinolog from the Carolin Institute Clark Marcus, part of whose work is the assessment of the biological creature of people in order to determine whether they have been through a semi-constitution before or later.
“ I had reasons to think about this, and I don’t think it was necessary to use the dimensions that are now used.
The biological age is so indirectly defined.
If we can't determine it with confidence, we should not do what we can't," he said the Metro magazine.
However, Hersensen from the judiciary, he said to the accuracy of tests: “In general, there can be a risk to take an adult child.
With the greatest risk, we're going to be when a person will be shortly 18, in this case he's about 10 per cent.”

As the financial rules of the football are affected by the Neumara transport to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited traffics from the European Fotbol clubs are not prohibited by the lacking World Record of Neamara from the Spanish Bursillon in the French “Para San German”.
What any consequences could be made on the scene, for the Pearl S.German by the UEFA, the leading body controling the European Fotoball, whose authorities will prohibite the teams of the prestigious Turchian Leyga.
The financial rules “Firm-Play” entered by the UEFA in 2011 should, at the end, be shown that the Namara Transfer had been released without great losses.
“Barselony” payed 222 million euros (262 million) only to release Brazilian from the contract, and Nemmer will receive an appreciation that will reach decades for the year.
This is some financial aspects of the Naimara transfer to France.
“PSJ” may be decreased to take Neamara and add it to the galactic of other stars if the financing of the team is given by the rich energy of the Katar family.
The applicants have the right to paid large amounts to acquire players, but they have to be compared to them according to the legal income sources to reach the timely rentality in their business.
“FFP” entered Michel Platin after its election by the OEFA in 2007.
The former French footballist believed that the clubs that were in great debts in their efforts to success, in reality, judging and risking disappearance if banks or owners had stopped financing.
In 2011, the FFP stopped focusing on debt clubs and instead of the relevance of their benefits.
As a result of this change, the business model used by Roman Abimovich in Chalsey in 2003 – to buy a club with a good capacity and then to get seriously to improve the command and create a world burden – has become a difficult plan.
During this three-year period, the clubs may provide losses of EUR 30 million.
Although Platin had been taken from the President's position in 2015, his predecessor in the UEFA Alexander Cheferin is still in a strong way to keep the excessive traces.
“The FFP lives, and we, when moved forward, will have already been set up the rules,” said the last week of the Asocied Priss Agency, Andrew Travers, controlling the EFF in the UFA.
Although the “PSJ” is paying the contract of Neamara together, it may provide the amount to the total of its contract.
Near signed the five-year-old treaty, so that the transfering value can be shown in an annual account of $ 44.4 million for the next five years.
During the first threat of the FFP sanctions in 2014 to the PSP, as well as Abu Dabi, Manchester Siti, the most difficult sanctions were applied.
“PSJ” was set up in 60 million euros (for the course of this $82 million), which was decreased to 20 million euros and was prescribed to limit its composing of the teams in the “Caepian Ligue” during the 2014-1015 session of 21 players in place of the ordinary 25.
WEFA is aware of clubs that can try to prevent its financial inspections by distributing their income according to the companys related to the club owners.
Although the Catholic company could propose PSJ, but if the funding amount had been overcoming the standard market costs, IFA would not allow it to be considered a legal income.
This was in 2014 when OEFA decided that the funding amount of the CAT was dismissed by the Catar Tourism Office.
It was reported that a part of the Nimara work in the PSJ could be paid as a paid by the organizational committee of the 2022 Peace-Party Peace in Catala.
But “PSJ” and Catar-2022 refuses that Naymar would be as a peak of the world, and such a manager could easily discover UEFA's indicators.
Further sanctions set at the PSJ means that OEFA will still be attractive to any attempt to overcome rules.
As reported in Thursday, the EEFA had not conducted preliminary discussions with the PJ on the Namara Transfer.
They were communicated with the Asocietyed Pressedide Agency in terms of anonymity as they were not authorized to discuss the PSJ.
According to the latest publication report, in 2015-1016, more than 10 million euros had arrived in the defence of 542.4 million euros.
The accountability for the last financial year is not yet published.
It is expected that the arrival of the Nimara would be a pleasure for the sponsory workshops, sales of attributes and footballs from the command logo.
The club is expected to increase as a minimum of 30 per cent as a result of the new player.
Unfortunately, one of the best fotbolists, the Spanish Line tried to avoid the transfer of Neamara, stated that “PJ” would violate the financial flags.
“It's a clear case of the Financies, with the club and the State,” said the Spanish “AS”, President of La Lygie Hawger Tebas, meaning that the final owner of the PsJ is Catar.
Arsen Wonger, whose club is an American sporting magazine, divides the doubts of La Lyga on the financing of the State club.
“ This is all the consequences of lower participation, and it has completely changed the Netherlands Fotbola in the last fifteen years” said in Thursday.
“ When the club belongs to the country, it may be.
It is very difficult to respect the financial factors, because the countries may have many ways and many reasons to be submitted by such a serious player.
The provisions and locations of the jury shall be defined by the President
Where and as the new Russian citizens will jure to the FF, the President will define such amendments to the second reading in the relevant law has developed the Governance and Housing Committee.
Another week ago, deputys planned directly to set the order of jury to the law.
From the admission of the currency, children will be released to 18 years, as well as non-complete, from the proposed text of amendments in the draft Act O nationality of RF (the Equity) which the Committee 11 July will consider before the second reading at its meeting.
The idea of the admission of jury at the nationality of RF, instead of the formal signature of documents, President Armyмир Puntin supported on 6 June during the meeting of the Hospital Hospital by the Virgine.
Deputys have made this idea as amended to the second reading in the draft law, which provides an acknowledging decision on the removal of nationality after the offence of a number of terrorist or extremist crimes: for public calls to terrorism or its public justification in the Internet (see 2 pages 205.2 of the RFC), and for the aircraft, travel or water transport, but only in the case of the act related to terrorism (section 4 of 211 of the CCR).
According to the law, his logic was as follows: The person was signed under promise to keep the Russian legislation - to raise a way of extremism, and he violates the promise.
The draft law, in April, was introduced to the Gosdam of the Penal Criminal Virgin Basilvs ("Ethic Russia"), Gender Sugavan (CDP), the Virginia Regime (LDDP), the Sergey Mirones (First Russia) and the Spinner GD Viehwald Wolodin.
On 19 May, the deputates took him in the first reading.
Last week, the HD Committee for Hospital and Legislation adopted the text of the draft legislation to the second reading, but now it was re-examined.
It is now said that the jury order will establish the President of RF.
The previous parliamentaries were about to describe the procedure directly in the Nationality of RF law, indicated that the ceremonies should take place in a periodic term before the State Gerb and the Russian flago in the presence of the representative of the MDD.
However, the draft legislation had not been understood where such measures should be taken - a list of places where the rstyle could be placed, regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
They include the courts, heads of the sub-agency bodies, municipal training, judges, prosecutors, federal authorities, etc.
It might be also ZAGS.
Provide a new jurisdiction that wishes to obtain RF nationality will be after the officers are checking their documents.
But the Russian passport person will only receive after the jury was granted.
The week ago in the draft was reported that the jury should prevail the signature of the order.
The updated text states that Russia’s jury will be from 18 years and not from 14.
The rules have been retained from the grant of jurisdiction will be released inseparable or limited, as well as those who cannot make, read or sign the text of jurisdiction manually.
Furthermore, President RF has the right to release from this procedure and " persons,"
Also, in the updated draft legislation, the adoption of the Russian citizens of Ukraine considered by Russians.
They should be officially rejected from the Ukrainian nationality, provided a statement for that to the full body of Ukraine.
A notice of the statement should be transmitted to the Russian officials.
The response from the nationality, as well as now, is not required if it is provided by the International Treaty or if it is impossible "in the power of the reasons of the person."
A compliant amendment to the law proposed a Deputy Group, including the first Vice-Speaker of GD Iwan Melius (CDPF), Natala Polocco, Paul Crënners and Airrat Ferrari (All the United Russia).
I think many of you know that I'm not real, it's just impossible.
Many people are at the same time waiting for decisions of their nationality with regard to the nationality of RF, explained the designated chapter of the Opinion Committee on Hospital and the Act of Paul Crisinans (ER).
In addition, the text was explained that the restrictions to the employment of certain foreigners would not be extended to those who were written from the " other nationality" and made old passengers to the Russian, but "for reasons not depending on it" it had not stopped considering a citizen of another country.
Foreigners are now prohibited to be taken at the municipal service to work on objects and organizations related to the security of Russia.
Also, a person with two nationality or a form of residence of another country may not become a deputy of Hosдум or the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force since 1 September 2017, at the time the necessary legislative acts must be prepared.
The Nostalgia is lower in the American Year and the Detective Laboratory.
The recent iteration of the story of David Wayn and Michael Shawlter had been recalled at the time of the greatest day of the 80th; of the epothecs of the 1990s (e.g. when the master of Wayne and Michael Shelter had made the Communication of the MTV), and it is 2001 itself before her stars, as Elizabeth Benx, Emiler and Paul Rad, to the more serious discussion.
As a culture's fact, this is a timely increase and enhance our epoca with its permanent memories from the Faisbuck.
But she seems an anachronism.
The "On day of camp" was a good surprise, not only because of the absolutist humor (including the original history of the bank of the fruit known by H. John Benjemen).
The result is the main shock: average age actors play sexually concerned children that have only reached the complete age; thanks to this impossible to return to a part of the shocks.

The main roles of Gregor's seeing life and the idealist Joseph are performing Florence Pearcik and Cornelius Whills, and learned their dialogues in English Channing Tatom, and Josef Hordon-Leebit.
It's a funny idea.
But just idea.
There are several visual shots (the police takes time to look at the shoes like Americans could see the football).
The team of great voices for the staff -- among them Jennie Slat, Nick Oferman, Mahrshala Ali and Claua Seveni -- allows to play in "good voice."
But the "Detective Detective" is so sure that it's a disagreement of the non-propagist Dram -- there's even killler in the Ronald Reygan mass, which is often looking at it.
Six long episodes have been deployed, and it wouldn’t be so often.
If it were to do so, "Detective Detective" could better be done with his activist spirit, for example, every time, when Gregor and Joseph comes to the American area, there are two threads of the people who drunk the hamburgers.

England's bank will keep the percentage rate of 0.25 per cent
It is expected that the Bank of England later declares that the percentages are not changed since weak economic growth and declined inflation had been able to help hear the possible improvement.
The Bank of England predicted that economic growth remains inevitably and left the percentages unchanged among the growing pressure at family income.
The Committee ' s money-country policy (MPC) voted on the result of 6 against 2 for the preservation of values at 0.25 per cent, and the lower number of members of the Committee was extended because weak economic growth had increased.
The bank inflation report has limited its provisions to increase in 1,7 per cent in 2017 and 1,6 per cent in 2018 and predicted that the pressure on the family income is continued, while it is still expected that the age inflation is rising to approximately 3 per cent.
However, the Bank predicted that an increase in the neighbouring years would be required to control the inflation brochure and stated that business costs were probably to be stronger than the financial markets.
The Committee also voted that the public integration of economic development measures had been rejected by the pressure year ago.
Starting from February the bank will close urgent financing plan for which he provides banks lower credits, although he reported that it was now in the framework of this plan to provide for more than 15 billion dollars to 115 billion dollars.
The Bank's decision-making protocol said: “In accordance with the main MPC prognosis, the growth of the domestic product (BDP) is nearly slow, while the pressure on real income of the family continues to affect the consumption”.
On the matter of the stages, he repeated that ‘inflation needs for any extension of financial policy’ to be more than that of the market.
At this time, the first increase in the next fourth year and another in 2020.
But the bank emphasized that all improvements will be “consolided” and “restricted”.
Bank projects for increase in this year and the next year below than the provisions made in May, which were equal to 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The bank left his foreign pronouncement by 1,8 per cent in 2018.
After these news, sterlining was caught to $$ and euros.
The cost was 0.5 per cent to $1.31 and $0.4 per cent to 1.11.
The decision was not changed since recent growth indicators had increased the increased expectation; GDP increased by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter against 0.2 per cent in previous three months.
According to the representative of the Bank, the growth of the jurisdiction in general remains at 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, although it is not a little increase in the end of the year.
The last report of the inflation bank has not been delayed for the joy of households in which high inflation has affected, and a totally significant increase in the wages of the bank: the pressure will be increased before the decline.
The bank added that the financial policy “not can’t prevent” for the late years, but expected that the payment would be significantly resumed to the end of its three-year prediction.
The economy is also designed to increase as a result of the growing demand for British goods resulting through a lower rate of the feed rate, which compensates the part of lost consumer costs.
The decision was adopted a year after the past of August, to 0.25 per cent of the sponsoring refund results of Europe's outcome falling.
The bank estimates, more than four years, needs to have full impact on price and economy.
Before its last decision on the roads, it was a noise around the proposed increase, since the inflation has increased the highest pressure of the household: three specialists in the Committee were requested to increase a 0.5 per cent in July.
In the past month, inflation fell to 2,6 per cent of July 2,9 per cent, although, as reported by the bank, this fall was expected and again compensated in the next months.
According to the bank, the higher rate of compared to the planned 2 per cent is completely the result of the lower rate.
Andrew Monttleck, the company's director of the Epothectical Crown Browns, said: “When you have recently taken into account the shopping courses, it will be more competitive, as creditors need business and calculated for a good year.
The cost is particularly welcome for those who are close to the end of their existing treaties, as well as the refining of credits, often in the absence of the Commission and in a high position, becomes popular as ever.”
The State Health Service is described by 10,000 people ' s pollution of HIV
Since September, patients will receive access to the Revolutionary Patent for the Prevention of HIV at the High Court on the Financing of Training from State Health Services.
The National Health Service announced that the pre-exhibition of HIV prevention (PREP), tablet taken before the sex, which, as proved, reduced risks in the risk of those in the group, at the average of 86 per cent, would now be provided for health service during the beginning of the third year, at about 10,000 people.
It agreed to proceed a test after the Appeal Court had supported the Decision of the High Court in the past year that the National Health Service had the opportunity to pay PRE, despite its statements that it should finance the local authorities.
The step made by Thursday was named by the President of the National Health Service of England Simon Stevens, and the National Control Management Office (NAT) called it as a “door moment”.
Before the full start of the England programme to April 2018, winnerological disappearers in London, Briton, Manchester, Liverpola and Shelfilde are starting to register people, and more disciplines will be joined to the programme in October.
The proposed prevention (PrEP) is the course of HIV preventions to reduce the risk of HIV abuse.
As shown in research, the PRE significantly reduces the risk of HIV abuse among the risk groups.
In the receipt of the PREP before the sex in human body, there is sufficient number of prescriptions to prevent HIV infection.
Such portraits can be accepted daily or later than two hours before sex.
Patients who have the right to receipt of the transport are subject to homosexual and biological men, transgener and people whose partners have HIV and have no successful treatment.
Dispansors shall choose approaches to attending research, including men, women, transgeners and persons whose partners are not known whether their HIV status is of anti-retroviral therapy.
People living and registered to a general doctor in England will also provide a request for a potential participation in the close global disaster participating in the programme.
The programme will cost $10 million and the National Health Service of England has signed a treaty on the safeguard.
Research is thus built to assess all the possibilities of the PPT based on the collection of clinical data on the target of the portrait audio, its ownability and use in greater scale.
“It is an important renovation to complement and strengthen the widely and more successful efforts aimed at preventing HIV.
This is another age of more than three decades of success in combating one of the greatest threats for humanity.
Deboration of the Golf, President of NAT (National control management for AIDS Distribution), said: “It is a turning moment to HIV.
PREC, if it is socially to encourage people needed and risks, allows to change the situation of HIV epidemics in England.
Since September, people who are in HIV risk groups will receive access to the new means that the person can control himself, without discussing it with the partner that leads to improve many lives.
We will welcome this news.”
Ian Green, President of the Terrens Higgens Fund, said: “The first time it is necessary to take care of that the test is rapidly disappeared throughout the country, and no one of the risk groups of HIV should be gained.
Now, when we are ensuring the experimental treatment of the PRP, we go to protect more than 10,000 people in the HIV risk.”
The Single Minister of Population Health, Sheron Worzson, said: “We are very welcomed the beginning of PRE’s testing, and it was very late for months of delay and delay from the Government.”
The data showed how revolutionary this prevention can be a part of our approach to prevent HIV and stop the transfer of this rock infection.
This test will approach us to a step to fully understanding of the premiums of the PPT.
It is now important that the test is soon developed throughout the country to protect those in the HIV risk group and to continue to stop HIV dissemination in society.

In Russia, there were difficulties in the receipt of international suppliers rights
The HIVD units are tested by the deficit of international driver confidence (IHS).
To obtain such rights, a few weeks should be waited for the actual problem of lossers who want to go away from the border to his car or to take it on.
It should be noted that the situation with international driver confidence remains contrary.
The IMO was introduced to be easier to understand that it was written in the national security, as it was explained in five languages.
The requirements to international rights are registered in the Vienna Convention on Road movement in 1968, but in the countries ratified by the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized.
However, it depends on specific police or procurement containers: some require ICB and some have sufficient national rights.
In order to encourage the drivers, international laws are still received, but it must be taken into account that in non- ratified countries conventions (e.g., United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia), the authorities have no right to recognize any national rights or ICT.
It is now monitored the problem of AIDS blogs in all AIDS units, reporting "Commмерant́" in several regions.
Yes, in Moscow, the plastics in HIVBD units are not just removed, but the bulletins are not missing for four months.
You can write on the hospital site, but there's already going to the middle of August.
In Crossourc, the HIV cannot be “for technical reasons”, without detainees in the Samaritage, they say that there are no bullets, analytical situation in other cities.
Many moxtics have already been addressed, more often shown the following messages:
Iran Burmystrov: "Remember why in Moscow is not able to get international rights?"
Right, because all GIBD offices have been completed.
Elena Podkolazina: "Ask for those who know."
We need to get international rights very urgently.
In Moscow, all the time it was killed far forward, the tails are not removed (the cell is but the plate can't give).
It's like a portrait shows that the Spob is timeless to feed.
Did anyone get in another city?
You're working?
As stated in the IAD RF, the requirements for international driver confidence have been changed, so the Hosauto Inspection Unit has been put into new bulletins.
This may be related to deficits, indeed, unwillly what changes are to say, not previously reported.
The Blank buys the Centre for Road Safety (ICS BDD) of the FIR and then sets them into the HIVD unit.
In the past few years, all the contracts were of the OO: in 2014-2015, nearly 200 VAT blogs were produced, in 2016, 15 tickets were blues, 2017-90 tickets, but the last contract was arrested 18 July and 18 July and OOO, for the production of 70 tickets.

In Spain, a manager who did not work for 10 years
What an English suffering (or absolutely spectacular to public service) should be the chief of the Spanish leader Carlos Resso?
The permanent duration has increased for 10 years.
Nevertheless, Mr. Resyo was denied.
But not his direct manager.
Whatever the buurcrates are not going to happen in the world.
The prosecutors, like, have been highlighted to all the people's offices for a time.
And, however, the officers are always able to surprise those who are not bad to live.
This time the sensation was regrettable from Spain.
There was a architect of the Valencia Carlos Resso's architectural officer of the architectural Carlos Resso, who did not work over ten years.
It was so that he had regularly appreciated.
A total of $50,000 per year.
And here's the wonderful time, Mr. Rezio's finished.
He was allowed to decide the legislative congregation of Valencia.
The investigation discovered that the bad prosecutor had come to the office at 07:00 to note the electronic system.
And here he went home.
Again, he appeared on the workplace at 16:00 to reveal the system that he left.
And so 10 years old.
It was also known that all the free time of the prosecutor had dedicated the quality of the home commissions.
Now, the Deputy of the Legislative Meeting of Valencia thinks how to demonstrate and direct head of Mr. Riso, who could not know how "actively work" is understood on his workplace.
The courts are proposed to protect the Chairpersons
The Chairman of the Human Rights Council (SHS) on the Head of Pontino has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judicial jurisdiction.
The HIV proposes that the powers of the judges are limited and that they are elected.
For the Courts of Appeal and Cassation of AIDS, the AIDS Institute wants to enter special circumstances that will not be bound to the Administrative and Territorial Ordinance in the FF.
The Supreme Court should also submit its proposals under the President's mandate.
The HIV has concluded the development of proposals that would enable the independence of Russian justice.
The work of HIV conducted by the Army Pentiny on 3 January 2017, which had given the Chairman after meeting with members of the Council.
At meetings with members of the Council of 8 December 2016, some cases were discussed, including the cases of proceedings, as well as the problems of public supervision in the field of civil prison (see " on 9 December).
The main work of HIV has been 25 proposals regarding the independence of judges and identify judicial errors and financing of judges and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Crime Defenders is to limite the power of the court presidents to increase the independence of the rest of the courts.
If a candidate to the judge has been successfully pursued and received support of the judge community, the Chairman of the Court, according to HIV, should submit it to the appointment, without having the right to demonstrate how the law is now allowed.
It is also planned to leave the Chairman of the Right to distribute cases for consideration between judges.
This may be specially written by the computer program.
The HIV also believes that the Chairman is not right to "determine the results of the qualification of the judge attitude, to initiate its accession to disciplinary responsibilities, to take decisions on the establishment of additional material payments".
The Chairperson Council considers the need to go to "the elections of the judges of the judges of the courts" and "related their powers to a compliance with the obligatory mouth."
The Chairperson of the Court (in the Republics to the Regional) is now appointed by the President of the Supreme Court for six years.
In order to harm the courts from the pressure of regional administrations, the SHS invites newly to organize appeal and commission in general jurisdiction courts.
Their structure is now linked to the administrative and terrorist division in RF.
The SSH states that "we need to ensure the organization of individual courts of appeal and asylum Institute not at the level of the area of judicial bodies in the RF actors, but in the courts."
The experts take the practice of arbitrary courts.
They are "juridictional environments", not with the administrative affairs in RF, but guaranteed by this great independence from regional officials that are difficult to use the "telephone right".
Peace judges of HIV are invited to strengthen peoples to consider some "catégories of civil and administrative affairs."
For example, the delay of parents' rights, the restoration of work, the protection of honor and dignity, regarding the delimitation of the rights of drivers, etc.
"It's only our proposals," she explained "SH", a member of the Constitutional Court of Justice in the residues of Tamar Morocco.
She also recalled that the terms of the President was not only related to HIV but also to the Supreme Court, which had not yet revealed its proposals.
There are still time for the implementation of the WFC (in addition to the Geneva and Human Rights Ginevration) in the FFF.
Againse the Government of Pentina on how effective the FF is ensured in the independence of justice, the Chairman of Vicelor Lebev must be made up to 1 September.
Living high life: Pools and disasters have become this small apartment in Erls Cort in a spacious habitat
Joan Li, the former banker who was engaged in an unmount revolutionary, moved out of a spacious house to Netzbisbrage to the apartment of Erls Cort in 2014.
The quarter is at the first stage of the typical house in the Style of the Queen Anna, and the new design says that Joan had not gathered its things and has not moved again.
“ Meanwhile I lived with my former in Nastsbrigah, ” says Joan.
“ I was looking for something compared to my money.
I've shown this apartment in Erls Cort, and there's the same high pools.
I loved her and proposed the price that day."
Since the first review of the area apartment in 1000 square feet was transferred to full reconstruction.
It was significantly a room with a comprehensive planning room that had to go through the kitchen, and Johanna wanted to add space for saving things and plates to spend the maximum benefits of the flood height.
“ I wanted high clothes, big windows, a lot of light.
Those were my requirements," she said.
To this end, she took Erfan Azadi from Notting-Hille architectural architecture Duck & Shed to be used for 12.5 meters of highness and creating habitation that would not only be a successful project but would be Joan for life.
It was not sufficient to build two locations on the other, so the architectural task was to create a poetry where it could be fully grown.
Erfan had to think creatively to make a breath.
It explains that the photograph with the room buildings is very complex.
“ We had to have so delayed rooms so that they should be found one on another, and they had not to lose.
It was needed not just to build a simple platform, but to burn the buildings to be on the right height and allow the use of buildings above and downwards.”
This decision allowed Erfan to establish two full-speaking rooms one over the other in the outdoor space, and a lot of interest.
From the middle of the winterly light window of the Retroveius is opened in the shocked guest.
The Ecclesiastes of the Gold Division, Silver Assets and Cultural Research devices from Serge Moya are the style of the project.
The use of the cercle plays a role in adding creativity, space and light.
The short coridor smoothed the cercles so that he seems longer.
In the kitchen, the self-defence bar seems to be a window in the other room.
At the entrance of the Serchal Chaffs, they serve to keep all Joan's vessels.
In order to create a more smooth space, the beauty of the guest may be a kitchen when it is not useful.
There is nothing new in the kitchens.
That kitchen is that it's moved up to the door like in the garden.
“ Ingenieur art has been implemented, ” says Erfan about the armed table of the wooden-wassy door.
“ It is covered by an opposite, so when you touch the door up, it is very easy.”
With the reasonable use of space and places for storage, Joan received additional 16 square meters, additional room and improved planning.
“It is what you will sell, in the end, that's what you're going to sell, that's what your immovability is estimated," said Erhan.
“The company said that the non-modern trade agent will enter and provide accounts on the basis of the road area.”
Here they were able to increase the hole area using quality materials that provide a rockspace.
“ The mathemalics are what we trigger, so they help to create an emotional connection with the house”, says Erfan.
“ Nobody will love the electricity in the walls.
It is important, but it doesn't give the stripes of our hearts."
This is a witness that, according to a good design and increased method of apartment, the usual way can be converted to something astonished.
Actually, as Joan, you can decide to stay.

Bearing in mind that the international community was one-time qualified as a terrorist organization, and UNSCR resolutions call for the opposition of this structure, IAD RF noted that "when it would be said, it would be understood that the terms "user" should meet an absolute and decisive conviction, and in the assessments of the expulsion against diplomatic representations should not be any doubts".
However, as described in the diplomatic communication, “the third time for the month, the United States, the Great Britain, France and Ukraine, on the United Nations Security Council, had, on the contrary, dealing with the absence of the information necessary, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt the standard statement of the Security Council for the condemnation of terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic representation at the Syrian table”.
The desire to demonstrate diplomatic solidarity with us would remain in conviction with these delegations.
"Over all that the Security Council's incapacity to condemn terrorism them to new prostitutions and terrorists, gives them to feel unfair," said IID and added that "I wouldn't want to create these barriers to be convicted in the Security Council."

Brothers are fighting for the imperiality of more than $500 million
Two brothers fight for one of the greatest in the Statute of Imperial Inmobility for more than $500 million, and forty years after their Italian prenses were based on dinosacy.
The former director of the Barlton Club of Carlton and the building of Colen de Luis lives in Turkey through three doors from his young brother Paul, who was against him in the Supreme Court of Justice for the division of authority and activities.
Paul wants to get out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still a complaint on the circumstances of disappearance.
Nevertheless, their mother Annan’s brothers have 87 objects of the cost of more than half billion dollars since their family bought a store for the Smith Street in Colinungud in 1973.
There is a Family Westco Jeans firm, which has grown in a network of 160 trade points.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
Days were put into movement, and the list of the De Luis family owners includes official buildings, parts under construction in Brunswick and Sorrprento, the Gold Wolf and Maut Bouller and Trade Centres in the benefits.
By agreement with the peaceful father of California, Paul described as a "made movement and mining personality" family De Februaris has approximately two thirds of the company's activity, and Paul is about one third.
According to the Court, this means that the property of the Indian is 316 million, and Paul is 176 million.
The range of goods and money was made for Paul's rocking stone.
"He wrote in his first shows in 2015.
The first hearing of the Supreme Court has been held on Friday after several unlawful attempts of reconciliation.
The brothers are now talking about who will control the existing business of which Paul has decreased it.
The Clinese claims that it is not so, but he accused Paul in a non-comprehensive manager of certain objects.
In the indications that the ancient has been given at the beginning of the process, he said that it was hoped to release disputes.
"My Italian cornes are forced to consider the family higher priority," he wrote.
Judicial expenditures are growing as a black com: for hundreds of sites of indicators, electronic letters and reports such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer; both of the two sides have acquired the most known lawyers, including the Queen Allan Mayer, and the best stripes.
Ms. De Luis and her quiet marriage Luiji were immigrants from Italy; from the end of the 1950s they were managed by milk bars and guests, and at the beginning of the 1970s they bought a store in Brunswick.
The financial guarantees they bought a store in Colliningvade, which had opened the first family store of Djines.
Colin says he left Westco when he was "in recent school classs, and Paul was then a boy (e.g. 10 years)."
Hanna De Luis said that they and Luigi died in 2012 hoped to transmit their authority to children without conflict.
"Leggy often told me that he wouldn't want the brothers to be gathered in the court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, have no longer entered into the De Luis company group; the Virgin says that Mark received 10 million when he went out of business, and Luke 26 million.
According to Paul and Luke, and Mark were "depended financial conditions for their office".
The Indian was not a public philosophic, although he was the former AFL Board of Club Directors and, in accordance with Eddie McGira's biographie in 2015, the best second telecommunications.
"Ferfax Medium" in Tuesday, he was connected to the Paranom and Paul and their lawyers.
Only Colin answered the text message in which it was said that, since the case was not yet considered in the court, "My truth is particularly nothing to say."
"I'm very sorry that my brother Paul decided to put me out and triumph at the judgment of our family," he wrote.
In the middle of 2016, the Indian wrote that he tried to meet the requirements of the brother.
"Our father wouldn't want to see how we and Paul are in the court," he added that "against the rest hopes to solve conflict."
This hope appeared to be divided on Friday.
"We're going to be sent by the court soon," wrote Queen.
The new Chapter of the Trump Apparet plans to limit the access of the information to the President.
Others tried to do this and suffered anger.
Maybe John F. Kelly's gonna really get it.
In that case he'll be first.
The Politics reported that the new Chapter of the White House was planned to limit the flow of information to the President of Trampo, including news from the SIM, in hope of holding a head in a more peaceful state.
That's what reports the reporter Josh Doozi.
" At the meeting, who held a new head of the white house of John F. Kelly with the leading of the Apparty on his first working day, he described the main problem in the White House at the President Donald Trump, which he hoped to decide: the bad channels of access to the President."
Kelly said to the officers that information should be done through it - in a brown form or by the British - because the President would be better to decide if it would receive correct information.
The diagnosis of Kelly is completely sure, but others have already suffered unfortunately, trying to die the Trempe, with a view to access to him.
The relations of the President of Trompe with the television were made a few decades ago and now, when he is in the White House, his intention to watch the television still strong.
"When Tromp, being a candidate, had been injured by an unfair campaign, it was useful to show him that he had received a fair light in the publications that could be oversight," said in February "Politics" Sam Nanberg, the former electoral adviser.
Tara Palmery was then written in the Politics that "with the words of six electoral members to keep the customs controls of the Trump to write to Twitter, it was necessary to follow that the personal information to him should be a steadily flow of enlargement. "
Okay.
But I'm the idea that Tremp's behaviour to write to Twitter's ever was "sound of control," it's just funny.
Maybe these members of the electoral head know something we don't know, for example, that, if not they, the Tremp's tickets would be more educative.
We may never know about the patches that Tromp has not published.
If his officers had taken him from difficulties, their efforts were not resolved.
But no one had always been able to keep the trampa from the rain of the oil.
Often, the problems are that in the White House, divided by coherent fractures, people are continually trying to extend their agenda by putting the Trump material — a reliable or not — which reaffirmes their views.
Politics - as once before this story, he wrote in my complaints of the advisers to continue to submit to the President a suspect information.
This is one example described by the reporter Shin Godhamer:
"Trampa officials and the former staff say that the Tremp may react very strictly to the negative reports in the press, particularly containing dangerous information waste, and will not be endorsed until he finds who stands after them.
This happened at the end of February when someone understood the president of the article with GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Promotor Charles K. Johnson, who accused the Vice-President of the Appartement of Kate Wells that she was a few escapes in the White House.
It is important that Johnson is for aggressive behaviour for aggressive behaviour that he did not represent specific facts or that in the past he launched false accuses and then rejected them.
The Drump read the article and agreed to ask for Wellsh staff."
He added that the then chapter Rains Pribus and the Secretary of the Rober Porter " tried to build a system to manage the boom that gets the Trump and to document it."
How did that work?
Three months later, Kelly's trying to do the same.
It may be an effective manager than Pribus, but there is still an impulsive nature, and his assistants still fight against each other because of the influence.
These permanent factors are very difficult to do the task of Kelly.

Italy has a tonne in relation to NGOs saved migrants.
Italy announced NGOs who belong to salvation courts in the Middle Sea that they could not continue to work unless new rules were undertaken to their activities.
"If NGOs are not undertaken by the new behaviour code, it is difficult to say whether they can continue," said the Minister of Interior Marius Minnita in the Turkish Day Times.
The warning of the Minute was the next day after the Italian authorities had conceived the court of the German humanitarian organization " Judgend Rettet," as a suspect that his equipment actually cooperates with human trades and facilitates non-legal immigration.
The Gumany organisation held all the year was rejected by commentaries for the existing accused against the Italian Prosecutor Ammorjo Cartozio.
"We have human life salvation and remain a higher priority, so we are very sorry that we can't now continue in the search and salvation area," voted the statement of organization in the social networks.
"We can assess all the accused now, just after we gather all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities follow "Judend Rettet" from October.
His ekiphage is suspected that the total rescue of migrants had taken on a boat of migrants who were sent directly to them and allowed the counterparts to go together with the boats they could use again.
As at least one such meeting is expected to be held at 1,3 million from the Olived Population, it is stated in the accused materials which have been published in the Italian SMEs.
Ekiphage is understood in violation of the requirements of Italian boats that control rescue operations in this area, rather than from humanitarian breach than other reasons.
The behaviour code provides mainly that the Court of Justices will be at the battle of the Italian police, which will follow their activities.
As long as three of the nine NGOs participating in research and salvation operations agreed to be undertaken to the code "Detay, the Malta MOAS and "Pro-Activa Extended Spanje".
The last stated in Thursday that it considers new rules that are unnecessed, but accepted by the condition that they would not take any " significative changes or places" of its salvation operations.
Among those who refused to sign, there is the improved Norwegian Premier Organization 'History Unlimited' (MSF).
At the same time, the Minute said that a rare reduction in the past weeks of migrants in Italy resulting in salvation operations showed that the efforts to support the Liban Trade Protection and Cooperation with local marines are produced.
"In the last days we started to see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the minister.
He reported on further negotiations with the Olive Marks on Economic Development and Chad, Niger and Mali initiatives for the reduction of the number of migrants left by these countries in hope to return to Europe.
"In Libya we don't want to associate any of the parties of the conflict."
The RF authorities have recently actived their policies on the oil, and in Moscow, the delegations of the Anti-Oil sides had participated.
Chapter of the Russian Contact Group on the Inter-Internal Resolve of MIDR and Hosдум, the Chief Republic of Lev Dngw said, " whose objectives Moscow has been pursued in this region and on whom it makes a stand.
On the contact group in Libya, which you call, almost don't know anything.
Here, we're saying, the contact group on Ukraine knows everything about her.
And here's a secret thing.
What are you doing specifically what are the goals you are going to pursue?
The contact group was established on IID RF initiative and the public thoughts.
Its activities are smoking by the Foreign Minister of Foreign Affairs, Michael Goddan and Adam Delimhan (Deputy Duma from Tchèni).
The latter has been able to work on the liver direction of the Hospital Gospital by the Virtual Guardian.
The point to the establishment of a group was a detention in the Russian Manaquin Chebotar (in September 2015, 11 people were in boat.)
We thought about how to help oxypague.
Then a contact group was created from military specialists, representatives of Hosдум, supported our work head of Chenny Ramsan Cadior.
How did you get it exactly?
As I work in Libya since 2008, I was proposed to vote the work of the group.
Our activities have not been limited to the release of marines with the Michacan Chebotareva.
We have been able to establish contact with representatives of all major groups against each other in the Olympic conflict and from the Triple (the United Nations recognised Government in Chapter Fais Sarajah. - On the Tobacco, and Tobacco (the resolution of the Parliament against the Government and supports the Marshall Chalf Hafftar, which is controlling the Eastern Libian regions.
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metiga (Vice-President Libia, "a), we have been able to agree quickly about the release of Russian Sea.
Then it was decided to use these contacts more effectively, creating a group of contacts.
Its task is an analysis of the situation, identifying key factors and players, dialogue with all parties of the conflict.
I would like to emphasis on the fact that we don't want to contact any of the parties of the conflict, but we're taking a dialogue with all of us.
How many are people entering a contact group and how many of them are constantly in Lebanon?
It is now five people in the contact group.
Among them are people experienced in force structures, including in the Ministry of Defence.
We also want to enter the group of specialists on the region, representatives of the Institute of the Watch East.
No one of our staff remains in Lebanon until there is no need.
There are now Russian military advisers, instructors.
And if yes, on whom?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libye.
All discussions and publications on this do not match reality.
But in your contact group the former military enters...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit the gentle point.
Or such that were closed to a certain moment for us, such as the Missor (they are based on the explosive spectrums playing a role in the leader of Mumara Caddafi in 2011 and notably active in the next years.
We came to Mishara in January of that year.
We've been crazy, said you're all the islamics, terrorists.
But we were important to assess the terms, analyze the real military capacity, who is responsible for why they are listed to the real role of the Islamists.
In Mixto, we met with all representatives of officers who had been destructed in Syria (in December 2016, this city in the middle of the country campaign was dismissed in Russia 'Islamic State').
We wanted to see them to meet these people, to check the information they have played a decisive role in the destruction of IH in Libya, and not Halifa Haftar, which had been written to them.
What's the conclusion you came?
The Islamic State in Lebanon won't Haftar?
That was not him.
Hafter conducted operations on another front in Bengazi.
And IG in Syria faced the structures undertaken by the Government in Tripoli.
And, finally, we invited people to Russia to conduct this anti-terrorism operation.
They came to visit from 19 to 23 April of this year, the delegation of Olives adopted in the Federation Council, Dum, MI and Rosgvardii.
You, as we understood, are in all the Olive regions and you probably represent local Elit and field commandors.
What do you think it will be to implement the agreement on the ceasing of fire, the elections reached at the end of July in Paris Halifa Haftar and Fazi Sarah?
Or once again, how will it have been in the past, will the agreements be paid, and the battle actions will be renewed, will the parties try to protect only authority?
For us, a good signal was already the fact that Sarah and Haftar agreed to a regular meeting, it was not so far impossible.
Last time, both leaders were extremely negative to each other.
And what about Russia's position...
Often, it is written and said that Moscow is actively supported by Haftar, many believe it.
We focused on this situation when they were in Mishua, and Hafftar was on the Russian Airport at the "Adminal Kuzniks".
It was a agreement.
But they weren't believed in the Misurato.
We said, "You are surely very courageous people who have come to us today."
But our task is to show that we are not only supporting the Hafttar, but we have a dialogue with all key parties of the conflict in Lebanon.
You and Hafttar have reported.
Does it easily understanding with Russian partners at the emotional level of the fact that he had learned two times in the CSR?
And, eventually, Hafter knows the Russian language?
He's russy if he knows, it's relatively relative.
But what he learned us, of course, makes it easy to dialogue with him.
And between the others not just with him.
When we are talking to the military in Tripoli and Missor, we meet generals who have learned or in Russia or even in the Council Union.
And here they're talking greatly in Russian.
And come to Russia, some degree of the nanopolities about it.
Are you surely reading the rapid cancellation imposed by the Libye of the Army Imbarg?
Does your Russian arms be interested?
It is concerned, of course, but, as I already said, we do not take somewhere in this conflict and we wouldn't want to arm one another in harming.
We would like to be all likely in equal positions.
With regard to the Army Ambarg, the Olives continued to call for Russia to be able to help him.
Libya is now actively moved by the constitutional process.
We hope that the parties will go to compromise decisions, reach internal consensus.
Then, the elections have to be elected about the meeting of Sadrach and Haftar.
If the elections are endingly elected by the legitimate authority (and no part of such status has), the United Nations can be addressed to the removal of the arms embargo.
To address this issue now without sense and danger, it will only lead to the exchange of the conflict.
During the days of the ICS, it has been information that Italy, faced the problem of African refugees from Lebanon, feels like a complaint on the complaints of the EU.
Should Moscow assist Italian partners in this situation, using their links with feeds?
How are, for example, realised that the Hafter's officers will establish control over the browser and will put the end of the contrabandot business into Europe?
It's a very time question.
We are actively on this.
The Italians need supporting Russia because Moscow conducts a dialogue together with Hafttar and Sarah, and the Misraea and the south country.
And this is a great role in the south of Libya and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
This is about the southern flows of migrants to further steps?
So, in the meantime, dismissed the buses in which the Nigerian migrants eat?
We're doing that.
But it's not simple.
Some clothes and groups are concerned that these flows continue to go.
We hope to assist the south in the negotiation process between Sarah, Hafttar and the south.
But to begin, we would like to see the unity of the opinion on this issue between Haftar and Sarah.
The Chapter of Government in Tripoli Fazi Saraj is considered as an islamist who is involved in the country of the Baliath standards.
How many radiical views are he kept?
Will this not be a prevention in relation to Russia or West?
I'll tell my personal opinion about him.
For my view, he is, of course, opposed to the radio islam.
But the islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself holds the position that Lebanon must be an absolutely normal country of the Islamic, open peace.
And he is actively fighting terrorists.
Where do he have such republication?
It has created the topics of countries that are not interested in Russia to communicate with Triple.
Through the triple is a capital, there is a legislative, executive and judicial authority.
There is a national neighbouring corporation, national bank and other public structures.
Of course, some countries were concerned that we wouldn't go.
And we've all smiled and started talking to Tripoli and Tobacco.
And we are already devoted to the fruit of this work: Rossoft concluded the agreement on cooperation with the NEC State of Libya.
The Director of NOC Mustoff Sanhalla, who was head of Rossofta Igor Seach, was directly from Triple.
And two weeks ago the first download of the Olympic Neffet company was the Rosneffet company.
What will Russia do with her?
I guess I'm going to transmit.
What else has Russian economic interests in Libye?
In plans to subscribe contracts arrested at Muammar Cedef.
This is, in particular, the former contracts in the transport sector (cooperation of iron roads), energy (electricity) and several others.
And the leathers have what to pay?
Well, they've got a flower.
This is what is, as in the case of Iran, the "Nefth to exchange services"?
I don't know what the scheme will be. I don't work directly on these matters.
Really, the economy for Russia in Libya and not mainly.
We're actually doing peaceful work there.
For us, it is mainly to stop blood proliferation, help olive persons to agree between themselves so that they could establish their order and Libya stopped being an adequate environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, this is the main task of helping the Libanian people and dealing from terrorism.
Have you data on the presence of Libya (actually or previous) radio-based combats from Russia or other countries of the former SPSP countries?
One of the tasks of our contact group was explaining this.
I met the representative of the Olympic Security Committee, who said that there was no exit from Russia and other countries of the former SCSC.
He said he had approximately 50 tonight records of the telephone talks of the Islamic and Racial Groups (in Libya).
And of what States then these bobbys?
I wouldn't want to get these details.
Then we formulate a question otherwise.
How many of the battle-islamists in Libye's most olives?
The Libyans are not practical, not more than 5 per cent.
Others are coming.
Can Moscow conduct internal negotiations on the example of Paris?
There are such plans.
We are conducting active negotiations, several delegations from Lebanon have already visited Moscow and made ready to come to Moscow or to Gustain.
When can such negotiations go?
Now it's hard to say.
There should be a few visits, and I hope that the time and place of negotiations will be clear.

Convention of Michel Carter for the Communications building to the Conradiation of Roya
The inhabitant of Massachusets had condemned two and half years of conclusion that she had been through text messages and telephone calls to the self-assassination of her Conrad Roya.
Michel Carter, which is now 20 years, will be 15 months after the decision and 5 years of the test period.
Carter in June was recognized in an unforeseen murder of the Conrad Roya, which ended on 13 July 2014.
The father of Roya said to the hearings of Thursday: "My family is killed by an enemy.
My son was my best friend."
Carter was allowed to stay free before appeal.
She has shot the maximum time for 20 years, but her lawyers said that she and Roy had suffered psychic disappearances.
Carter, clothed in red buckets and smoke, listened to the condemnation of standing, shrinking his hands and laid his eyes.
"By her actions she killed the Conrad Roya," she said to the prosecutor.
She stopped his life to improve her own.
She didn't recognize the responsibility," she said.
"It's not shown the paradise."
But the lawyer Carter said that it was the "trategic case of which it is deeply sorry."
However, the judge Laurence Monis said that her "relatedness, or even psychic diseases have not been not awarely affected by its action."
The accused read the statements of the mother of Rosa Lin Roy said: "No day I wouldn't have paid for the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to boast me and how I'm doing -- I'm trying to support his sister, although all the pain that's going to be with us forever," says it.
The sister Roy Roy said that she's not yet able to be a marriage or to become the tea of his children.
"To leave a man who was always with me from my birth -- it's a pain that will stay with me until the end of life," she said.
The case, seemingly, would be a legal president, since there is no law that would be responsible for the counsel of the person to commit self-assassination.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in the car, with harvest gas symptoms, Carter was 17 years old.
The case focused on the whole country when it was known that Carter was undertaken to self-assassination.
"It can be glad, shot out of the crowd, and I don't know there's a lot of ways," she wrote in several communications sent by two weeks before he died when he was disappeared together with his family.
She wrote, "You have to do this, Conrad" and "You just have to include the defence, and you're gonna be free and happy."
The judge of Monis said Carter wanted to take care of the death of Roya and forbidd her to communicate with the press so that she wouldn't get the desired.
The opinions of the lawyers in this regard were divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Nox, who was condemned in 2007 for murder in Italy of his British neighbour at the apartment and was justified two years later.
The 30-year-old Nox published in "Lossy Times" his particular view that he said, "Mishel Carter serves sympathy and help, not prison."
He said, "I left Langford as a bird of the high land."

They said they should change their customs.
Two older journalists discussed that it seems more safe to take children with herself in the office that had already been thrown out or leave them home in 2009.
Safety experts wrote on the dragon in the room three words: enemies, neutral people, allianceists.
They requested journalists to call names for each column -- evidence is not sufficient, suspect and internal senses.
These are drugs, policies, businessmans, journalists that are suspected that they are containing the Government or cards, the total list of subsistents, which are dangerous in Mexico's housing work.
The violence does not give advantages, and among the groups that are multiplied in the country, more and more logistics: on the basis of the Journalist Committee, not less than 25 since the President of Enrico Péto took his post in December 2012; 589 persons after attacks and threats are being subject to federal protection; and at least seven people have died in seven states in that year.
Among their last, their encourager and inspirer, the Riodosse founder, Hair Walden Cardens.
"Samy large error is to live in Mexico and to become journalist," Walden wrote in one of his numerous books of violence crimes related to drugs.
His absence is very amazing, although his presence is totally - a great picture of Waldessa, which shows the average finger, with the title of the "Reidos building", and two reporters of 30, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramis, have the footballs on which his slowness is reflected, the face in the cells or his fiend manama.
The seminar passes less than two months after his death; the journalists discuss their general herd, their kiss, the unsanity, the paradise.
Although the federal prosecutor was organized in 2010 to investigate journalist cases, only two cases were investigated by the Journalist Committee.
As for the majority of those committed every year, thousands of murderers related to the drug and organized crime are rarely presented to the court.
The Riodose journalists argue that they're going to write about violence in Sinala, although they're killed by the mountain, even though it's more dangerous about now.
No information about murderers, without justice from security discussions for meetings, said Ibara.
"That's crazy to take time for this seminar," he said.
"When we don't know the reason, we're all suspected."
On Tuesday's morning, May 15th, Waldes went from Riodose's office at the Society of Kuwait.
He could only pass a couple of quarters before his red Toyoto King stopped two men; he was driven out of the cars and had probably shot it 12 times because of the name of the newspaper, which means "Twenty River".
The shooter went on his car and shot her away.
Walden was 50 years old.
He has a wife and two adult children.
Hearings are usually fast to Cuban.
But all about Waldens are practically speaking.
Since Gusman was arrested and delivered to the United States in January last year, Sinaloa became one of the most bloody battle camps in the country, since conspired fractures are fighting to fill the wakuum.
We will not say that every day, on the streets of Sinalo, they kill one or more person or that the pit is full of two-soft or more than the houses of many living people.
Let's forget that the state of peace is just when one of the cards takes into control with the important ports and the drug paths conducted in the United States.
Despite this, and that Waldens knew greatly about the dangers of his work, Ismael Bohorks, the 60-year-old Consumer and Director of Riodose, had made a sense of guilty because he had not agreed to protect another.
He thinks murder helped two mistakes.
First, there was an interview with Damascus Lopes, the leader of one of the carriers who war against the Gusman sons.
The publication was able to disappear the sons; those who were preferably members of the bands have bought all the examples of the publication, just as they were assigned in the oxygen.
The second error was that he did not set Waldens for his own security to leave the country after the second newspaper which wrote about the same story.
Walden was a leader in Mexico and beyond the border, and his murder was calculated as a clear vessel in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He went away from the danger, his friends and colleagues thought he'd always be.
He was an experienced reporter in the Neuroest and in 2003, with the five colleagues, founded Riodose, sold its 50-dual actions.
In Sinaloa, "The newspaper couldn't be taken by a magazine without drug theme," said Bohreks.
With the time of the newspaper, the reproduce of slow and honorable publications, sales and advertising revenues have grown.
His journalists felt that they could publish strong reporters, not fearing the census, but the readers argued that they could read about what no one had been enthusished to write.
Eight years after its basis "Riodose" received the prestigious premium of Mary Murs Kabo for theporting work in Latin America.
In that year, Waldes won the International Price Freedom for Permission Research to Mexico, wherever it would be.
He was evidently recognized that he was afraid.
"I want to live further," he said to the CPJ Prize.
"It's a form of life," he said in October last year to the Rombrinton TV interview.
"You have to take the tasks that are lied on you as on the journalist, or you're just taking a dog."
I don't want to ask me, "What have you done when there was so much death... Why didn't you say what's going on?"
The Riodose officers lose Waldens, who destroyed as a carrier in the port, the second, the courageous for the advertising and advice, the teacher who knew how to work in the living.
They trusted for their order.
He'd always bear his gun.
He had to go to "El Guybo" bar against the office and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: Did his love have lost one day in order?
His death has made them to be convinced in their accounts how to do and stay in living.
"They don't like when you agree in their female, children, legal business, and under-term aircraft for drug transport.
"There were the stuff," said Bohreks.
The result, even in the best time, was the highest level of self-reservation and attempt.
I need to believe your instincts.
Be carefuler than that's badly fucking.
The problem says the Riodose Editor of Andrée, that "the idea can lie... and then happens what happened to Haveyer."
The former rules, said he and others, are not more acting in Sinalo, such as in Tamouluz, Warkrus, Guerrero and other States, where there are a disagreement of winning roads, low public institutions and corrupted officials.
Lanshapt is constantly changed.
In the room where Riodose was gathered for the security triangle, a second time it was prohibited to introduce hundred phones: for a few days before it was known that the school programs that were sold exclusively to Governments were used in Mexico for visitors for journalists and public assets.
Two police seats are covered in the shadow of the 104 degrees (40 °C) in the light of the 104 degrees.
They have made the Government to protect the Riodose office, which is in the fourth building of the turdish quarter of Kulianacan.
Some journalists asked whether these police officers had 50 percent of the orders, the Governor said that they couldn’t trust.
A few months ago, the journalists went to the guest place, which is under the control of the drug drugs.
The next Riodose number was calculated at three main topics.
This is a murder in Sinala brother of the former cupion on the side of Hulio Sezar Chasov.
They still have the development of government expenditures concentrated in the country of the Governors.
And there was a group of disappearance of people in one of the most dear restaurants of Kalianacan, a quarter from the prosecutor office.
Officially not announced who was defended or how it was done, so it was necessary to observe care when the time came to write that all in the city knew that it was a favorite restaurant in the same time of drugs and powers.
One of their journalists found out open databases that the restaurant was registered on the name of a policy appartening to the institutional revolutionary party (PRI), which has minimised at all levels of authority for almost the past century.
Recently against several PRI Governors had been convicted in the corruption.
Wilhel requested the journalists to write on previous incidents in this restaurant, including when the "El Chap" Gozman was shot out of the military area.
A few months ago, the readers would find the column of Waldesa with the most reliable information on the defence.
"We would have known what happened," says the 46-year-old Wilhel, for our artistic body, called El Flaco.
"Today, all the channels are broken with our sources."
Cabinet Waldena is now used as a composer for flowers and protests against the murder of journalists, because they were the officials of whom they never thought to be: assets who are speaking on behalf of the press.
The journalist of Miriam Ramis took a few roads and sent to the next morning to demonstration in the local procureur dedicated to the second journalist.
El Salvador Adam disappeared in the Michamar State in the Western country after three days after the murder of Waldes.
There was a coherent body and the authorities stated that it was based on the tests of DNA.
In the whole country, the journalists continued to express the highest, organize protests and write “SOS Press” on the tropical and home walls.
On that day, the director of Bohorkes was in Washington to seek international support for justice in the case of Walden.
The next day, after the murder of Waldes Ramis, he accused the authorities that they were spys out for journalists and the murder of those who said the truth.
After this, she urged not to give it more orders for the Government's promotion by ensuring that the wrath would reduce its objectivity.
Waldens said many times that the journalists in Mexico were " corrupted" by organized crime, its participants in the Government and the unfair society.
He wrote in his last book "Narco-Jurnalist" that reporters are not just killing drugs; they do this according to the instructions of policies and security services which are in the conversation with organized crime.
The Arthurkola 19 Committee believes that the half of the attacks on journalists in the past year was committed under the order of police and government officers.
"In Mexico you're gonna die because they want to touch you," said Ramis.
Of course, murders solve people.
It is all remember that the loss of Mary Elizabeth's blogger was more than six years ago in the north border of Tamouluz.
It was found on her body a notice written by the card of Zetas, "I'm here because of my articles."
Computer keyboards and scientists were laid closely with her head cut.
Some publications were expected to close as the newspaper El Norte in the north border state of Chihuahua, after he killed her in March.
Others continue to remain as "El Manyana" from Noeve Laddo after the murder of her leader in 2004.
In 2010, the Diaryo de Shode Huases was publicly referring to drug carriers through the editing article on the first page "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists left their family states or in all parts of the country.
It's a crucial decision.
It is difficult to find jobs in the outdoor, and it is still extracting the dangers on the streets.
And sometimes they kill, as obviously, had been the photo of Rwanda Espinzo, who was killed together in 2015 with four women in the apartment of Mexico, three months after the escape of Warhurus.
Those who remain and continue to work daily are balanced between risked decisions.
Ibara, who ever dreamed to be a poet, recognizes that he was fearful to write about drugs.
"Meksy's going to shot, so I'm become a journalist," he said.
On Tuesday's Friday, when the last outcome was ready to print, the "Riodose" exhibitors sat on the trial next to the office and drunk when their phones immediately called.
A series of strikings between combating bunds and security forces left away from the Maskatlan smooth city after her, as confirmed, 19 bodies.
The war continued to spread, as was promised in the series of carriers found in this area.
Sitting on the trotuary, they put news on the Riodose website.
On the next day, the first page should be transferred.
Alongside, there was another shooting in the districts.
Bohorks looked at whether they are ready to defend their police.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under a large portrait of the loss founder of their newspaper, the middle finger had been made to disappear all the Sinaloa, the Riodose operators continued its case.
"How can you think about closing," said Bohorks, "and if the day that Haveer was killed, the practicant asked me to send her on the street?"
Dinosaur was used to escape the enemies
At first, it seems to be a status, even though it was a terrible fear.
Researchers said that the first remainings found by an unbelievable substance with the narrow found by the Canadian shoes were so well stored that experts called it "Mona Lisy among dinosavors".
It was so good that they could even figure out that the colour of his hair was red-cornity-- and say that he had, in some kind, “the same past”.
The report published in the Contemporary Biology magazine was described as “the whole well stored from Tireofor for the whole history of income and one of the best examples of dinosaver in the world”.
This is a copyed – recently found a Nodozard Exemplare, living in the middle of the period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His unbelievable good state has been conducted researchers who call it “to be wonderful.”
This grassy tireofor is the best scope of such an invention history, according to the articles of the National Geographic magazine.
He was found by Shane Fanke when he worked at the Millennium company of Sancor away from Fort McMurrey in North Albert, Canada, 21 March 2011.
He touched something that seemed to be different from the environment and decided to see more attractive.
It was sent to the Kingdom of Tirrell Palestinian museum that had been recovered.
The next six years had worked on the discovery of animals within the ground density of 2500 feet (1100 kilograms).
Now, when all this hard work is done, final results can be demonstrated.
“ It's just easy to be taught, and it is practically possible to believe that he was sleeping,” said the leading author Caleb Brown, a scholar of the Queen Thorreal Palestinian Museum, where the creation is demonstrated.
“ It comes into the story of science as one of the most beautiful and the most goodly stolen examples of dinosaurus — Mon Lis among dinosaurs.”
Researching his hair, researchers discovered that this was heroed, although it was covered by the masters and recalled the walking tank, in all visibility, caused considerable dangers from the side of the platodium dinosaur.
This closed master of dinosaur used a red white combustle to be hidden from the disasters and applyed a protected technician known as a protected oxen, which also uses many of our days.
This would allow him to run fasterly with the environment and to avoid meetings with the enemies, as experts supposed that greater disastrosis have been encouraging him.
This is an essential age of 110 million years, relating to the Nodozav family, widely appeared in printing in May, and now is on the exposure to the King Tyrell palentic museum.
The students have already learned the animal and gave him name Borealopelta markmitchelli to the museum Laboratory Marca Mitchell, one of the groups held over 7,000 hours in his museum lab.
The surprised conservation of the example allowed the doctor Mitchel and the international team of scientists to adjust the image and form of chess and patch plastics on his television.
They discovered a protected breathtaking spread by the protective method of protection in the Kingdom of animals, which means that the top of the substance was darkly lower.
Although the protection of the ocean and goodly distributed, the opening was unexpected, because Borealopelta’s diagnosis is significantly exceeding the size of living animals today with the protection of the ocean.
It could be suggested that the dinosabra had so actively pledged plastic diamonds, that evolution has predicted the mass of conflict as a means of survival.
But most of the modern animals from the island protection — for example, oils, weirds or browns — significantly less size and are more accessible, which shows that nodozara has been seriously combated for survival.
“The serious threat from the side of the disasters for the massive, covered by the powerful master of dinosavar shows how dangerous the damages of the Male period were,” said Braun.
The chemical analysis of organic connections in the cheese dinozard also shows that his hair should be redunded and core.
Scientists continue to study the animal, seeking information about his life, including retaining the contents of his food-related treaty to find out that he had been eating during his last stage.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, he fell into the river and was leaving into the sea where he fell down and back a lion down the ocean dance.
At that time, Albert was so warm as now in the south of Floride, and the rivers and the oceans, more likely, have spread a lot of swimming pool than now.
“ This is a nodozard really noticed that they will be fully covered with a smooth hair, and at the same time he was fully stored in three dimensions, keeping the definitive form of the animal”, said Brown.
“ Consequently, the animal appears almost as it appeared in the Ranzo’s little period.
It is not particularly important to turn to an image to create it, but it is easy to be taught, and it is practically possible to believe he's sleeping."
The small period is the epoca when hyganic terrorists, platodium diamonds standing on two feet were shot on the ground.
Although the most wonderful one of them, Tirannozard Rex, lived for millions of years later than Borealopelta, the Tireoform was able to hurt some of his huge prejudices.
Their number includes an acrotanzuur, the greatness of the length of 38 metres (11.5 meters) of six tonnes.
Scientists, whose last openings are published in the Time Biology magazine, believe that Borealopelta was taken after death in the sea and musifiked into the alone.
The substance was found by Shan Finch when he worked at the Millennium speed away from Fort McMurie in North Albert, Canada, 21 March 2011.
According to the museum staff, this is the most well-bearing carrier in the world, together with the kitchen and the masters, and it was, from the sea to the wound bones.
In the middle of these substances, approximately 18 meters (5 meters) were averaged to 3000 feet (1300 kilograms).
Their nature sign was two twentieth shocks from the pillar.
Researchers believe that this grassy tyreofor was hardly acting as Canada is now until the floods had not brought it into the open sea.
However, the dinosazar defended his master with accuracy to small details.
The rest of this specific example was so well stored that the rest of the hairs have covered the bugristic patch plastics over the crop of dinosaver.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the article for the National Geographic magazine, this is the slight preservation of “record as played in the lottery.”
As long as I look at him, it seems more vulnerable.
Academic cell remainings are covered by bugristic patent plastics that are swearing the beach of the animal.
His right front feet out of the side, five fingers fell on it.
I can cut the shocks on him.'
Mikael Saakahvili has been able to come to Poland without documents
Mikail Saakhavili, a former named Georgia, and then the Odden Area in Ukraine, came to Poland.
He did so without documents that confirm his personality and nationality.
On the arrival of Saakhavile reports the Political Telewizja Republic, which was located on his channel in YouTube videos with his statement.
Saachvile took steps in respect of the Warshaw’s birth anniversary against the Hitler Armies in 1944.
Because politics do not know the Russian, although he tried to speak in this language, he had to speak to the English through the Police Translator.
At the time of its report, the political process was affected by Georgia's cooperation with Poland, as well as concerning Ukraine.
On the fact that the migration service of the Ukraine has led his nationality, the optimistic police was found in the United States.
He was able to perform transatlantic past without documents until it was unknown.
The former Governor of the Odden Area Mikail Saakasvile said that his signature was signed on the accent for the nationality of Ukraine.
The politics emphasized that he didn't fill any axes.
The period of follow-up on the Viensicher and Olhovac case has been extended to January
The period of the preliminary consequence of the Society Society of the Olucharca Eugency and Head of Energohold TPlus Boris Vienzicher has been extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Court of Justice was considered to extend the prolongation of the accused home arrest.
The representative of the CCC at the meeting reported the decision for the last time to extend the period of preliminary consequence.
"According difficulty and length of consequences is the need for expertise and implementation of the large number of documents, as well as for follow-up actions in the territory of several EFA actors," said the investigator.
He added that the suspects regularly provided the guidance of Komy.
Their total size is estimated at least a billion of roads.
As a result, Viennashire, Ulchki, and the former leader of the OAO "Complex Energy Systems" was Mihail Slobodin, which had been entitled 5 September to the highest officials of the Republic of the Comis for the establishment of a maximum profitable tariff on feed and electric energy, as well as the establishment of a pleasant conditions for business.
Winzheimer and Olhovack were detained and arrested for two months, Slobody was hidden from the follow-up and was declared in Federal Disturbation.
How did one assets learn the answer to the “The Street? ”
On August 9, 2014, Britain Ferrell was disappointed to the depth of the soul.
Only a day after you arrived to New York in the tourist trip of St. Lewis, he sat at bed in the apartment rentaled by Airbnb by telephone.
She knocked somebody from the medium school.
There said: “The police only killed an eighteen years old, and he still lies in the middle of the street.”
In view of the fact that no more of its necks had met this information, she had closed the phesbok and opened the thirt.
In her ring, there was a lot of transmissions with a nick@TheePharoah.
The reпер from the Great Saint-Lewiss, in real time, reported in the territory of the death of Michael Braun, a black eighteen-year-old, killed by the white police officer in Ferguson, the Mission State.
He published the photograph of a unlifeful braun body, expanded between the street where it will be four hours.
"It's wildness," thought Ferrell.
But death wasn't something new for her and her round.
She left the phone, and after evening she returned to the thirsts that the people were gathered to Kenfield Draw.
There were the photographs of a signal and crying people and a man who claimed that he was a father of Braun, a state platter: “The Police of Ferguson only killed my son.”
She looked directly on translation, as the police officer stands in front of the group of dog protestants.
In another video, she said, "I'm all going to kill you, animals."
“ This is an unnormal situation, ” said Ferrell.
“ It’s not a murder to whom we have joined and that we can call typical.
I felt aware at that time.
I was laughing and wept."
She took a ticket on the flight and went home on the next day.
It took her six-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that they were both going to Ferguson at the next morning.
What happened with Ferrell and Ferguson in the next three years has become the new documental film "With the streets," which will be on the screen 11 August.
This is a narration of survival and protests, love and loss, force and continuity of people living in the community and full roads requires reply.
When Ferreel went to Ferguson with a daughter dressed in a color swimming bed and a heat under the color, they remembered the talks that had brought the unnumbered number of times, “for the experience of nocturns and their situation.”
She remembers how she said: “Do you remember how I told you how the black people had to fight for what they believed?
We're going to Ferguson, because the police killed the eighteenth anniversary, and it was wrong."
'I couldn't take it,' said Ferrell later.
“What happens today is the culmination of what happened before.
She has to know about it, to see it and to advocate it.
It should not only be well dealing in the active and organization, but also understanding the different levels of experience of the nocturna and of their provisions and what we should do to become free to be free.
Even if I'm going to ensure her environment in which she's not personally affecting a clear racism, it's not different from any other dark girl.
I feel that it would have been an evil service, if it would have rewarded it from this."
When they arrived to Ferguson, they made the first stop at St. Florencent-Rood, on the street situated by the police party that was something like a Palestinian camp, until the activeists waited for an accused denial of officer Dr. Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter were joined to the local business officer who prepared the gun-paquets.
They gathered packages and helped the protesters to distribute them.
In the knowledge of Ferrell, a new type of assetism was laid down.
“My activity has been completely changed after 9 August,” she noted that being a student by the University of Mission-Stan Luis, she was the President of the Association of Students, representatives of national minorities, and had been conducted by food justice and unfair health in the field of black communities.
“ I had no experience of an organisator.
It came to himself."
A few weeks later, Ferrell's demonstration was met with Sabaa Folayan, one of his cousins.
The Folayan said she and her chief operator Lucas Alvado Ferrero 'd' want to adjust the event.
Forrel came to the head: “You want to adjust or try to find a story in which you can play?
This scepticism was news many, often white people who entered into the community in order to benefit from his pain and patience.
As she explained in the recent interview, “We heard that the voices of people who were born and grown in Ferguson are not falling into the centre and wishing to do so else”.
Folaans have already been connected with his fellow Damon Davis, a local artist who was known by his activeism on the causes of death penalty.
Its participation has continued a symptom to the project in Ferrell and still six local residents with which the project “With Street” supported connections during the years after the murder of Braun.
“ In this documentary film, no one speaks for us or for us, we're talking about” said David.
“It was the most important for me as these people will be presented, because it was how I'm presenting myself.”
And although the purpose of the project was not to focus on the experience of Ferrel – in the smells of showing that the movement was not on a leader, but on how the community is combined, as said Folaans, she was the most open of the film participants.
As a result, the roads are shown unexpected personal aspects of the life of Ferrell, for example, how she loved and concluded marriage with her wife.
“ I felt cold, ” said Ferrell, with laughing to tell how I saw the ready product for the first time.
“But I understood that when you do such a job and you're black, there's a certain level of vulnerability.”
In addition, the history of Ferrell again discussed and focused on the role of the black-homosexual woman in the broader context of the “News Life”.
Two of the three movement basers – those who created #BlackLivesMatter in social networks after the murder of a black age of Treivon Martin in 2012 - are composed of homosexuals.
“ Homosexual women on guidelines support all this movement, ” says Ferrell. — And all because we are always fighting on several fronts.
Children's homosexual women have to bear all this burden."
Folan agreed with this statement, noted that “the movement is actually supported by black women and many of the Hmosexual Black Women”.
Nevertheless, she argued that “there is not an accident of positive discrimination” and that Ferrell was not elected to the central personnel film because of its excellent features.
“It was the man who lived this energy.” She said.
“ On the other hand, it is not a consent that it was found on the first plane, because when ”
It can feel energy through the screen."
At the same time, there was no films in Ferguson long, but there remains comprehensive racial relations between the community and the police.
Forrell will be two and half year at the test period for the closure of the shoes during the demonstration.
It describes the social-political atmosphere of the place called house, just "Bardak".
She still holds the thing she learned when she went out to the Ferguson street three years ago.
We have to fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We have to love and support each other.
We have nothing lost, except our chains."
Two satellite philosophistics have disabilized the injury of the United States
The El Salvador El Salvador Henri Romero and Darwin Seren received long discussions for importable behaviour.
During the fourth Fifficial Soil Building Café, Fotbola North and Central America and the Caribbean countries (CONICAF) Salvadors were injured by American players.
The first defense was different from Hanry Romero.
The El Salvador shot his attacked Josi Altidor, and then he shot him out of his breast.
Then Seren's prosecutor, with an angle in his own area, endangered the US Omar Honsoless.
As a result, Romero was disabilized for three mothers and Seren was six.
The same meeting ended by the United States winning with 2.0 accounts, transmits Goal.com.
Removal: the artist creates portraits with DNA Chalsis Maning
In the Middle Hall, the Fridman Hall in New York, with a flood on the roof, are the people - white, black and core - all things doubt to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by the Heizer Duey-Hairborg artist from the brain of the hair and hair cuts presented by her Chalis Maning.
Maning sent a reference from the Fort Levenworth prison where the former analysis of the 35-year-old decade for a signed transfer to diplomatic telegrams on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition of 2 August is called "Offiation of East".
This is the result of the two-year referendum between Due-Haarborg, whose arts are combined with technology, information and art, and Maning, a woman-trasexual and a signed discessant, which Barak Obama has dismissed the sentence for three days before the end of its presidency.
Analysising the computer DNA programme received from Maning and used it to create three-dimensional portraits that could be able to be people with such a genius, Dui-Haborg has created deep, although it was not easy to take a moniff related not only to the plastics of the DNA data, the various ways of their interpretation and the interesting determity of these interpretations, but also to the concept of identity.
Maning, born named Bradley Edward, was open from the age of adolescents that she was considered a woman, in 2013, 20 episodes were condemned, including six violations of the Act on the School, computer miniature and disappearacy.
His photographs were not available in prison, so that only one of its photographs was known: the grain of black white saff, on which Maning was a pair of plates, apparently feeling unfair, sitting on the road of the car; with its photographs and began to associate.
In 2015, Due-Harborg has completed with great success in 2012 its project "Administration of Neighbourhoods".
The artist had created portraits of unknown people with the provisions of the type of accurates and a voluntary recession, selecting the DNA furniture and creating forms of how these people could look.
And then she received an e-mail from paper Magazine.
"They took an interview at Chelss Maning in prison and wanted a portrait to illustrate the article," explained Dui-Hangbourg at the pre-exhibition of a new exhibition for the press.
At that time, Chelsey could not be visited and photographed, so they were connected to her and asked whether she wanted to get the portrait created from her DNA.
Thus, the artist and her sitting in the museum became friends of the list and exchanged several letters for two years.
They have even written the book of the Summary Comics, the formulated Shali Canungo, which has imagined how the Chalis sentence was in the future and could be able to visit the exhibition.
What Obama really decided to release Maning all over a few days after the outcome of the book in the light, was a nice surprise after seven hard years in the military prison in Canada.
There is something deep and strong, and that the exhibition is now open when Donald Trump declares the war of people who discovered secret information in the Government and finds new ways to divorce in the Thirt's influence that he has called to escape.
When Due-Haarborg asked about this all at the time, she said, "Nothing happens at all."
In the statement of the artist written on the wall of the gallery, the large sign of Maning down (in the heart of the "i" in its name) calls for the end of the "Automatic division on the basis of sex, race, sexual orientation and culture."
At the opposite side, its methohochlordical DNA, a long chuckle of C, G and A.
When he included 200 letters (or ×kleotides, as an artist is expressed,) Dji-Haborg hoped to show how we all likely, in any case on our biological structure.
"I hope to explain people that our genius does not define how much we are open genetic data for interpretation and how subjectable it is," said Dui-Karborg, "the Possible Remembers' video is also found here.
"Date DNAs can tell us very many different stories and 30 of these stories here."
The last part of the exhibition in one room is a roman mentioned above in the comics.
Maning in the King-Kung style appears on the building of the United States Administrative Casar with a loud speaker in the hand.
"If they kill your words, they'll win," it's written there.
"Don't ever fuck that."

Returns that will help your company will not become direct “Avery”
Amy Errett wished to assess the level of satisfactory of their e-commerce staff but did not work.
Answers were often discontinued, useless or worse.
Even though she promised anonymity, some officers did not trust this process.
“ It was never a consequence and objective,” said Eritt, managed in San Francisco with 75 “Madaon Reed” e-mail trade for hair.
That is why she turned to third persons for help.
It is now a new type of startups in the area of staff that help companies to figure out how their staff feel.
Developing and licenseing the programme, which is the design of staff ' s involvement, allows companies to make the expertise, address the specific teams and demographic groups, to propose anonymity and strict lines for complaints and, in some cases, to allow the information to minimize fuel and directly directly to the directive.
"Then we have some tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, and where's Fitbit for your company?", says Jim Barnet, the Founder and President of the Glent from Redwood-Sti, whose analytical programs are used to measure staff involvement.
Eritte said that a more understanding of what they think and feel it over three years of use of Glint.
In addition to the expression and anakes of the product teams, the company proposes a calm card and shows in the supervision, which units are more complaints and which managers are low approval, which allows it to choose why.
The communications are soon aware that they need to control the situation in the workplace, otherwise they will be a clear “Obber” who has been denied in the scanner when the former officer published the post in the blog that described the aggressive situation in which those expressed unlawfulness were punished.
For the startings like Glint, it is the desire to control the situation of the business.
According to the Internet import assessment, “Commit payment”, the financial technologies, the global management, regulation and compatibility could cost more than $118,7 billion.
The Convercent Start of Denver, Colordo State, helping companies to prevent and discover bad behaviour, noted the small growth of interest and activity previously on the basis of the Western Republic.
In Convercent, almost 600 clients, including “Airbnb”, “Microff” and “Thela”.
Recently ones of the clients appeared as the Water.
Like Glint, Convercent, the company allows companies to send those implemented by individual personal opinion demands, collect confidential responses in real time and spend the warranty cards of the problems of areas.
It also provides an bitter line for anonymous text messages that allows staff to report the bad behaviour.
And if the throat manager is kicked, the faults are right in the direction.
“ The public opinion has overlooked the authority in the inspectors”, said Patrick Kwinn, the principal and President of the Convercent company.
If it is explained that the company is badly addressed to staff or acted inevitably, even if the inspector is not prohibited, the company may face the costful consequences in the form of clients, officers and judicial stakeholders, it reported Quinnlan.
“Ruby Tuesday”, a restaurant network where 500 jobs worked more than 25,000 staff used more than a year to make sure that the officers in the course of rules and procedures and propose a simple way to return to the company's main office.
Before, if the officer wanted to report about the problem, he or she was looking for a phone number or a main office, to give an official request and hope that it would be seriously issued.
It was often an emotional and unfair experience, reported James Vitrano, head of the legal management company Robby Tuesday, who said that there was no normal way to disclose the complaints of staff.
But now, when the company uses the Convercent service, the problems that have been hidden from managers in other cities or states – such as discrimination, charming and unfair work payment, can be quickly discovered.
“I can be close to the complete, comprehensive understanding of the staff,” said Vitrano, who leads the group of the risk management group on the network “Ruby Tuesday”.
“We protect our shareholders from judicial proceedings with staff.”
According to Quenland, the company began more seriously with the ethics, values and participation of staff in 2002, after the Artur Andersen firm had suffered from the ethnic violations of the result of Del Enron.
But only when social networks had received a massive dissemination, companys recognized that they could not keep their dangerous belge from virus distribution.
“Before starting using technology to monitor those people used hope as a strategy”, he said.
And “Glint” and Convercent” propose their programme guarantee as a service of regular payment for the use of their products.
This is business models and the possibility of endorsing inventory investors that supported both the startup.
In February Convercent, $10 million received funding from such companies, such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, as a result of the total company capital reached $47 million.
“Glint” received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, as a result of the general company capital was $60 million.
These investments are surprised if they have a comprehensive nature of companies, culture and венwular capital.
The growing exchange of research shows that today staff are waiting for more workplaces than it was before.
In markets with fair competitiveness, such as the Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects, it is only a minimum needed minimum.
The employees want to feel that they are accepted and valuable, and they provide their time with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to work in the company, they feel that they hear, and that the work they perform results, they are more trying to make such a company successful”, says Nina McKain, the Vice-President on Global LinkedIn, where they are used and Convercent, and “Glint”.
Inveters will receive income when businesses from their portfast are good; businesses are good when officers are granted and involved.
If analytical instruments of the third party promise to increase accountability and participation of staff, it is not wonderful that they are being supported.
As the culture specialists said on workplaces, it is important to consider staff ' s accountability.
But it's not useful until the company's officers takes measures.
In fact, if the company requests back-to-related communication staff, it may create an impression that changes have been changed.
And if the changes are not enough fast or are not pushing around, the disappearance may be disappeared and the staff lost interest.
“If you are going to ask 4000 proposals, you should be ready to make 4000 conversations,” said Russell Rut, President of the Adviser Carter International Carter, which was to see how the company is doing a mistake, in the position of the data collection.
“ Why, if you don’t come to the end, the officers will say: ‘ Did you hear me the truth?
You're not all right?
And if you're all right, why don't I have to be equal?
According to Errett, the Mandaon Reed company, which is now conducting monthly staff investigations, is able to take measures on the same day when someone reports the problem with Glint.
And, after returning connections from staff unlimited speed of decision-making and communication quality, it was able to reorganize a number of teams within the company and to engage communication trial to address problems.
The Robby Tuesday campaign will receive new knowledge of his staff and hopes that, in long-term perspective, these knowledge will help them to keep staff in the area known by high-standing staff.
“ If you're not trying to create a culture of transparency, you'll lose people” said Vitrano.
If you lose people, you're losing clients.
And if you lose clients, you're losing a company.
Barnaull is covering a new staff for the Cross-Armenic Perspective

The Breinz team should be taken further because the National Student Sport Association has rejected triggers twice daily
The time is close to the eleventh evening; the floods of the California University in Los Angeles are detained to deploy the new teams located on the computer.
Some of them have thrown their footballs, discovered the stops of the potato after the first day of the sporting camp.
For many players the teams, these minutes will be stopped in the middle of the day.
The players registered at the age of employment will be sent back to the generality to be prepared for final exchanges, and the next morning you will return to the Basserman centre at 6:30.
A long time prior to the Sunday, the team of Briinz Jim Morra said: “The next three days they are waiting for the flesh. ”
Thus, the National Student Sport Association rejected three-folds on the day, which was planned to reduce the load for the players, actually deployed their working day – at least before the end of exchanges in Friday.
The first three trials of the University of California in Los Angeles were therefore designed at 7:15 evening to be placed without the meal of players.
The evil effect of the lack of two triggers per day has become more than one three days with a trip, and Briinz moves the beginning of the camp nearly a week compared to the past year and conducts trial during the first school for six sessions in Vienna.
According to the record, they should be held 18 trials until 20 August before starting the formal preparation for the first game in the session against the Texas University of A/M in September.
Mora said that it supports the change of the rules by the National Student Association, although the players had appeared a further paragraph.
“ During three or four days, we will give them this great load, this is a serious test," said Mora.
“ And they just overwhelmed him, they work, they're marvelous guys.
I think that when we live until the Sabbath and we'll have more time, it'll be really good."
When the camp ends, the California University in Los Angeles will make the triggers closed; it is a little task, since its fields are in the direct visibility of the dedicated parking and the neighbourhood of Lawcenter, the dear earlier who has already been bombarded with flavouring balls, overseasing the protection network outside the doors.
The brainz players must take the hotel starting from these outcomes, but Mara allows that when rooms are free during the season, there may be a problem.
“ We will have a protection, ” she reported Mara.
“ It's a serious problem, and I don't have an increase in the danger, imagining someone can take the room, sit there and write a trigger on the video.
If you have a 3-year video record, it's very serious.
But we're gonna have a protection there and we'll be protected at the 8th park.
We'll do everything we can do with what we have.
I'm not gonna survive too much for that.
We have a plan."

Create a Roman-Coyx: one note in English history
The recent Scotney scotney was disappeared in the musical "Squeeze" video, and in the 70s and 80s he served a restraint for Margaret Tetcher.
But 700 years from his famous place in the Big River, he observed a storm story around, and now he inspired James Rods, a hair of a hair and his historical documents, a Roman-Comics.
"I think it's so nice -- look at a man who died 300 years ago," he said.
"You feel that very personal when you hold this letter in your hand."
"Back in England" covers a period from the Middle East to the Evardian Epoche and tells about the families living in Scottni; each history has proliferated one of the young British artists - Azek Lenkewich, Briony Mey Smith, William Exly, Becky Palmer and Izabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book of Rods, based on Archive data: in 2014 he wrote "Subs of the dead person and other history" - a collectioner of the documents of the British library; this project was unfortunately forced to the depth of the soul.
"My finger could grow up just a fingerprint on the side of a letter written in the 1700th year by a dual agent who worked on the poetry," he says.
"It's his finger speed."
And letters are always invisible because at that time the light is burned with fire.
And over 300 years later, in the future, you think you're there too.
Oh, how am I like Archives!"
For a man who has such a loss to the old papers, it seems to be too good to be true for the National Fund and the England Research Council and to stay in the lock of four months.
Rods studied the "new" vistoriana bathroom, walked on the archives and considered many treasures of name and old things, for example, the heads of pit on walls or bottles, the capitals of the pool.
He went through the park and the slaughters of the old lock, talked with forests, gardens and sometimes with artists working on illustrations to his book.
Then he was "driving the wine and he was writing."
The history of the Scotney lock is not very studied because the National Fund had received full access to him only in 2006 when the last heritage died, Elizabeth Hasse.
After ten years, Rods came, the officers were just starting with the archief, which he described as "the artistics of the centuries have disappeared on the scene."
Daydays, letters in the British Empire, cards showing who might have said: "You think that the earthly disputes are crazy, says Rods, but there are two families for this marriage.
It's like that, guys."
In some stories of the bucket is a lower point for the broader search in the English history: for example, the Heroin is gone out of the only built lock to join the Crossian Revolution of 1381.
"According information about the boundary occurred in 1380 in the book called the Queen and Sassex family," says Rods.
"The Cristian resurrection started in these places, and I thought that the bunt was the approach.
Maybe they were bound?"
Others are strongly linked to the story of the lock - for example, the priest, who has been mentioned of the priest-Yissuite, which the Darreaux family had seven years reserved himself during the English Reformation.
Or the Contrandist of the XVIII century of Artie Darrela, who increased their own tumors, killed stones (they was discovered a few years after the tomb was cast out).
Darrells, the lovely family of Rods, of all those who had been in Scotney: "The gentlemans seem to be a perfect juggy, have been a debt forever and have been paid for money that they couldn't allow themselves.
In different generations, men-Darrells have solved their problems with debts and married rich older women -- I'm representing them as a company of sympatic guys who have an earning for heritage of great states."
After the end of work, Rods will seek other opportunities to get a unique writer experience.
He lived two weeks in the Finnish pool, where he wrote the Graphic Newsletter about Elamamik, where the beginning of the XX century was a sanitary, and then it grew again with the forest.
But Scotney remains a special place for him.
"I was crazy to go," he said.
"I felt like this, shit, I gotta go back to real life."
Fifteen large banks choose the Russian
The conflict in the Russian Bank Association (EFB) is developed: following Sberbanc, ATB, HTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombian, Rosselhozbank, Bannko and FC, still seven credit organizations are going to leave the public organization.
The amount of the above organizations will therefore be less than 80 per cent of the market.
But it is not just along with all banks claiming to disappearance with the ABC, which will be negotiated with another public credit institutions, the Association of the Regional Banks of Rosa, which is the namely politics of Athalia Axis, the Chairman of the Finance Market Governance Committee recognized, at the final session and the most effective manager of the Opinion Committee and the Deputy of the Comprehensive Law Projects.
At the beginning of conflict within the ABC, the Federation Council was held during the discussions, when the Interregional Bank Council considered new legislation projects, in particular the proposing a new classification of banks depending on the size of the statutory capital.
Then Haregin Tosuinian, President of AB, said that, in view of the Association, the draft law was adopted in the interests of the larger banks, which were thus trying to limit small and medium banks in the regions, overwhelming their client.
Among other claims, the Center's response and critics, which, according to the opinion of Tosuana, did not always be justified to calls for licences to some banks, that, in fact, continued to reflect by the representative of the CBC: many bank leaders, in particular, were in the Foreign Provisions, entered into the ABR.
This exchange of mutual views in very sensitive relations with the main bank regulator and was visible to be the 15 larger banks, stated that the EFB policy was inadequate to be prepared in the Rosa Association, noted that “the effectiveness of work of the ARB will be at a lower level, and the constructive dialogue within the bank community is not actually done”.
The pagers will be better
What will the matter be completed?
In response to the main question that comes at the smallest boundary or conflict in the bank area or neighbouring with it: the loans will not worse, moreover, the confidence of the bank system.
He entitled "Rossia" of Athalia of Axaq, known by its solidarity in all regarding bank interests and their clients, high-level professionals in the Centre: practically all GDP leads to annual association activities, and all significant legislative initiatives of the Register are held through expert assessments of the "regionals".
In the former organizational plan, obviously, there is no prejudice to special threats.
Obviously, the ABB is in an indirect financial situation since such a strong and influenced participants have been left with their contributions and lobby opportunities.
However, in this old institution in 1991, the organization of the banking interests of the Community has little capacity to continue to improve bank legislation and money-country treatment in general.
You can't say that in the Rosie Association, the Rossia Association was prepared to take on any conditions of new members, the court on the reaction of her leader, an Anatolia of Axaica ("the possibility of too much wishing) which still 21 July in the Presidency of the Parliamentary Journal, said that "the next day of the representatives of the above ARB banks asked me to consider the possibility of enhanced potential of our Association "Rosia".
Their proposals are to enhance the voice of bankers in the Association Council and to give more attention to new bank technologies.
The negotiation process is now being studied by the proposals of both parties is prepared for the extraordinary association session which will be held in the Middle of September in the International Bank Forum.
There we'll be defined.
Also Anatolay Axaks also emphasized that it was not holded by a new manager of the updated Rosie Association, held by the Chief Vice-President of the Centre, highly warranted its business and human qualitys in September.
18 August Athalia, which is now relaxed in Crimea, plans to stop the release and to come to Moscow, at the extraordinary meeting of the Association Council, where it was not to consider the agenda of the extraordinary meeting of the Russian Council.

The report of the sex of workers is real, and it should be worried about us.
We haven't been able to think that 2017 could not be worse, but a new report on technology success in the production of sexual workers.
Maybe.
Six workers are now at the centre of attention.
The Fund for Responsible Workers (FRR) has recently issued a report on the development of sex workers in the neighbouring 5 to 10 years.
On the view of Noel Sharki, the professor of workers and the artistic intellectual of the University of Shefffield and the FRR, we must be put to their university.
Users can choose the color of the workers, the shapes and the footstandard type.
"Their people are angry about this, but the firms are already sending them to consumers, and soon we will see them much more," said Sherick to present the new report.
Contemporary sexs have evolved from their dreams of workers in the workers with a smoke cow, and almost human reflex that manages the artist intellect.
Users can also "streaming" their work on their taste, selecting all from the eye and the shapes of soft work to the form and feet.
But the fact that many workers have a "cality" compared to which the Stepford Women would have been very progressive, it is more worried about.
Contemporary sex-cuts were converted to work with a forced kitchen.
For example, the "RealBotix robot" firm allows users to monitor quality work they are attractive, for example, sustainability.
There are still a sex of Roxxxy Gold designed by "True Compansion", which are provided with an already programmed individuality -- for example, the Honey Forra produces an impression of a stink, and the "Decay Vende" has a "small" character.
"The Roxxy Gold has a nature that's wonderfully coming to your" - he carefully reports the "True Compansion" site.
So she loves what you love, not loves what you do not love, and so far.
She's changed to be a fault during the day, like this man!
She may want to sleep or be disappointed, or she may 'being in the building'!"
The sex of workers is a lot of concern - not last because they are replaced real human relations - but it is more concerned that the subject of women, association with violence that causes cold ' s authority (leaving: against) Fare.
The "True Companion" Roxxxy is compared to the elector only for men.
"If you have a woman (sic!) may be the elector why men can't be Roxxxy?"
But these sex workers are not only fiction or just new sex games.
Their view and all the difficulty of our culture shows something more dark and deep, to disappear from gender equality in the part of the sex wishing to be an optional addendum.
The majority of men, of course, will not buy sex workers, and while FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain in the passenger of consumer culture.
But what is related to us from the Perifer may be very learning about the meanings of epothecs in which we live.
And many are not stupid and not aggressive until the free market will give them an opportunity.
This is not a consent, that these complex sex workers appeared exactly when the rights of women over the whole world were threatened when the White House is President, which was encouraging women.
The terrified one in the television of the Rosshow servants is not the graphical images, the body and the sights, that's what this vision seems to be realistic.
The Republic of Galad is an enlargement, but now it doesn't seem so much.
The aim of sex-employed industry is to achieve such physical alike to real women (as only proportions of pornouse), which allows technology.
They want people to speak to the shadow to copy the movement of the human body.
But that's what they're doing is not like these women.
They can't steal with their partners or leave them.
They have no life, nor biography, what could indicate on independence or something that could destroy the full dependence.
Otherwise, they're beautiful slaves.
Or as they said in 2017, the servants.
The Los Angeless Yugoslav (Puh) who has been speaking for Ukraine since 2013 does not help our national team on the bactizing of Europe, which is the fundamental part of which is launched 31 August.
On this, in the portrait of BeBasket reported the "Basket" general manager.
We tried to agree with Jeter, but, unfortunately, he won't come in family circumstances.
We're going to Euroskhat without a naturalized player, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"It's going to have a possibility to develop our young players," said he.
Recommendation: In the direct participation of Jetera, the congregation of Ukraine took the sixth place for itself at Euroskeket-2013 and the first falled on the bactele peace kitchen on the bacteball, which had not been able to overcome the group, and the United States wandered the medium of the playing 15.4 cells, made 3 collections and gave 5 transfers.

The big movement of Tremp?
Imagine Metta Romney seems very smart
In the general epothesis, there was a fact that political disputes that have been paid by the American electoral have destroyed some families.
At the Wedding of Thanksgiving and Birth of the American journals, the pillars of how to do with the terrible parents who voted for the Trempa.
It seems we're all pressed so we're soon.
Thramp is more about the ability to connect the family.
I write about this because my cousin, the left views of the poetry from Chicago, who had been on foot with republics in his family, came to me this week to New York.
She recalled me that the unit against the general enemy could have a strong effect.
In the White House, all she knows, including the brother-response who had discussed the policy of decades, extraordinary and strangers on the one side.
For dinner, unfortunately, well, but I can't think that in a broader context it may be quite dangerous.
The tramp has enhanced the force in the left flacon, but the deforming effect of his government can all go to the right.
When we talk about Trompe and Normalization, we mean a little reliable opportunity that once we're stopped to hurt him out.
There is, however, a more conscious scenario in which Tremp is the most right republics who are unexpectedly demonstrated by the form of a fair meaning.
I felt that I'm very lacking today by the old democracy of Mett Romney, with the dog on the flow of the car and the 14-procent ground (but at least we knew how it looks like his boolean declaration) - compared with the Tremp and the other seems very small.
When the Tremp goes, the next Republical candidate will be sufficiently in his mind to see a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the children to the Central Park, the largest cartel in the Department of the Parks of New York and the best way in the city to lose three dollars if you don't need coffee.
The rain and great, the pictures of the stelobuck on the central baraine, players and animals who are burning out, in a terror, look at back, are extremely badness, and the music, as a stranger, leads to the street.
Thus many known things in this city are disappeared: the forms of heaven-speakers arise, the powers of buildings came too much to call a trip, and the reality of the city does not be sure of dream.
Thirty-five years ago, and I'm still surviving that day when I learned that the area of Suis-Cottege is not actually the Swiss ski skills. It's not the "Ye Olde Swiss Cottage" but the great round override in North London.
And the crowd in Central Park is until now an unfruitful, highest place where a child is two years old, a child of eleven years and two women can take a good time.
If I could put the carpets, I would have set a fifth, but of course, no one asked me about this.
And this week I've been asked to get a card on the Termonal, to assess their "such asylum" buy from one to five stars.
The same option in my street is 15 per cent in the corner of my street.
Consequently, it is not only a neutral interaction, but also a personal relationship in the situation that does not suppose it.
The female producer in the university laughed up until I assessed my experience of giving him a credit card at five stars.

Before the celebration of the cancer, he promised the Prosecutor of Ezekiah.
I remember your "Party".
A special teacher in the "Guards", Gloria Guinor pitched for a owner who sat over Moscow Rica.
You're supposed to be kicked by how you wanted to keep your next five.
The thoughts happened?
If he said about the profession, it was a successful period.
I worked a lot, three times walked with the whole country, giving 120-130 concepts per year.
I left two bad albums.
Of course, now I'm not what we're saying 20 years ago.
The biological times will not lie.
Get as I knocked in my 30, it's all hard.
Yet, I'm going to fight, I don't want to stop.
And I and the new people, I think I'm going to go out at another level.
You're recording a new album with them for the first three years.
Yeah, it's on him now.
In fact, we've already recorded my study and now send it to Los Angeles.
It is called "You are what is so serious?" by a unique song written with Timothy.
She's not yet ready, so we've got no place wherever it was.
Let's do it later when the clip is getting on her.
And the album will be presented in November to the series of my legal concepts in the Moscow Cross of Siti Hole.
To your new plastic, he puts the classic American barrier Cris Coloulman's hand.
You think you wanted him to bring him in your smooth composition?
I think, Coleman today's one of the most removal barriers of the world.
He came to me in the study, recorded his partys.
I proposed him to enter into my group, and Jeremy Colson (the well-known barrier who participates in different projects).
But for the continued work in Russia, they moved, slowly to say, extensive conditions.
It was about the princes from €35 to €45 per month.
Then I thought I was going to find a worthy musician.
And he found a good barrier Max Majoeva.
It's better to raise their own.
At times I want to get some of them, not for what.
For example, the gitorist Feddor Dosum is highly stipulated at international level.
About him, western musical magazines are invited to various hydrical festivals.
Steve, listening to his game, said that "the new generation of hits came, with another executive technology."
Your album comes to Los Angeles, American musicians cooperate with you, but you still can't come?
You're gonna try to take this detention?
Now, honestly, I don't do anything.
There are a number of lawyers to address this issue.
As a musicist, I'm really sorry I can't go into America.
I didn't ever tell you there.
What more you're talking to true professionals is more useful.
We don't worry about them, but we don't have such a experience, school.
Before our experts of popular music for 70 years, the tasks that were always decided by American musicians.
They tried to make a maximum quality sound.
And I'm trying to follow the same principles.
Now some reason and Britain replied me for ten years.
But even every year I'm gonna put documents on a visa in the British office to allow me to go back there and the main way to work there.
The Olympic Europe is well-being to me.
And you've already planned a concert in Monaco, not a lawful, but an official, right?
Yes, in Monte Carlo, there's a good sports hall I've spoken there once.
Now they've been invited again, and, as soon as I know, all the bullets at the concept have already been distributed.
"Randue Layma Waycule" who starts 20 July in Southmale, will you go?
She invited me, and I, of course, refused.
Layma is a wonderful pearl and a beautiful woman who can make herself and a beautiful eye, and even a shot.
After the hospital and the legal concepts, I know you want to turn to the Majesty of the High.
Two albums with his songs are already in the discography.
When will the third go?
Maybe the next year.
But he'll be done perfectly differently.
I want to write the order 80-90 high songs like the same gift as he did.
It's just the voice and the gyrate.
Nothing else analyze.
I'll be our known musician Tyrus Venderers.
I'm trying to join the album and Alexander James Roenbaum.
I spoke with him this topic, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy person, so we'll see how it's going to be.
You and the Boris's songs of the Grevencer's reapertour to get into your repertoire.
Maybe then you'll write it to the album of his thing?
Boris Bosnia is a beautiful man and a great musicant.
I went over with him a few times, and I asked, can I sleep that or another song?
He said, "Gregory, I will write the songs that they may be fulfilled."
Please try, come.
It's probably interesting for such an album.
Until I have no such task, but in the future, in two years, if Boris Boris isn't going to reflect, I may do such a project.
If you don't focus fully on the cases of your Producer Centre.
I think until you've still implemented his capacity, signed contracts with all the artists you're interested?
There's a number of executives I'd dream to have under my flower, but they're self-stated people.
Do you understand Sergey Lazarev?
I've invited him.
I can not agree to anything with his repertuary, but he is a professional and his development strategy.
And in my center now there's Alexander Paniats, which I've conducted in the Golosse.
We closed the treaty and worked with him.
In our pop-music pumps, these cancers are exact.
I'll be sorry if he won't reach the heights of which he's worthy.
I'm trying to make him a repertuar, take the clips.
I hope it's a good result.
I'm also trying to move other artists of my center: I buy them songs, weeping of poet, sometimes their dreams fall into the mouth of the television and radiocanals.
If they have not reached greater height, I will even bring our cooperation to the logical completion.
They will get a recorded album, a few clips.
And further, if they want, they can go through their way, and I'm not going to get back to their money.
Although I'll be pleased if someone of them gets a commercial success and will pay me the percentages we agreed in the contract.
But if it doesn't happen, I'm not going to cover anybody oxygen.
Let's all work, try, prove how I'm ever tested.
If you're proposing tomorrow to make a turtle in Ukrainian and guarantee you to go to the country, do you go?
I'll be invited to this time.
The main view is of the closed activities.
And what about the big turtle...
I'm a man of my country, Russian, who was in her own conviction, flighted to Syria at the same aircraft that was then disappeared.
If you're saying tomorrow, you need to be flighted to some other point for the interests of the State, it's a field.
And I'm doing what the blogs and the other criticians are thinking about me.
I am certainly sorry that such a situation we have received from Ukraine.
As I think we are one people and must be together.
I'm sorry that this is going to be at least near.
And before I gave a year to Ukraine to 40-50 concepts.
They've seen the low.
Thank you very much.
And with several Ukrainian artists, Anna Lock, Law Lobodoy, Artem Loic...
In the Ukrainian mass of donor people, and I regret that they are not able to pay their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music must assemble and disappear people.
I would be pleased to invite any classic Ukraine executive to Russia, such as Slovak Vakarka, and made a joint concept with him.
But, I think it's little like now...
Andrea Ocholoptics moved out of the cosmodal
As known by the technical director of the Eastern Others, the Occlesicopes had reached the work in the National Science and Production Centre (CNPC) on behalf of the Christmas.
He had previously been engaged in the construction of Eastern Space, but in different words with the Guideline of the exploitation Centre of the Land and Space Infrastructure (CNUCE) was transferred to a business in Moscow Flows where the co-ordination of the production is co-ordinate.
The deputy in Ocholoptics will not be: the technical director is, more, more fast, and the functional are dismissed by the CNUCE units.
The technical Director of the East and Employment Director of the CNUCE for Technical Development; the Occlopes had been working in the CNUDH on behalf of the Christenak, the "From-Ministers" reported a number of businesses of space industry, as well as Government officers.
"He's working for a new post for a few weeks."
The operational commentary of the ICP in Thursday was failed, and Mr. Ohlopps for comments was not available.
However, the information was officially confirmed in the HCNPC.
He took a decision on the transition to the Director of the Production Coordination, stated on the company. - AU OHlopps set before it to ensure the minimum for the first start to the eastern coast has completed completely.
Mr. Ochlooks moved to the work in CNACY in 2013, having the full of space military service, particularly in Baykonur, and in Pissica, the northern cosmodrome took the first Vice-President of the Commander in the vocation of the Colonel.
In 2009, Árawa Oclopes became a criminal affair.
Following it was accused: as the regional competitors received for the restraints of guests, but did not comply with the commitments to the removal of separators in the Argelan Area and the Republic of Comy.
In 2012, the court of the jury recognized him unlawfully.
The CNUCE ' s responsibilities for technology development have been distributed in different projects, but most of them have become a rock of cosmoderm in the Middle East.
The Federal Space Agency, who then was signed in the Interview of Ole Ostaping, said that the situation in Eastern " was critical already in October 2013."
The fact is that the strategic error has been launched in planning: the completion and implementation of the first start of the Union-2.1 was planned for the same time to the end of 2015.
In order to implement the leather until the end of the year, the road decided a half-year ago and the time of December to July 2015.
To accelerate the process, the NECI specialists began to bring a parallel of technology equipment to untrusted objects.
The chief side of this idea was an alternative of Ocholopes.
Despite the existing risks and all the transfers (only December 2015, the United Nations has run only on 28 April 2016), this idea has justified himself, said the source of "abound" to the cosmodal: "After we wouldn't have done any pocket from the East, but would have taken a rock."
The Vice-President Dmitriy Rogozin, who smoking the cosmodal creation, called Andrea Ocholoptic his " Cosmic Sussanne" but almost always requested information on the scene.
He recalled Mr. Ochlocks and directly: for example, in the interview of the Federal Agency for Special Building (Spister), he proposed to leave the Statute of the Unique Executiver on East and Directly with the Subsectors: "Why should we all be made in the Foundation Waste?"
This idea found support in the Government.
Since 2017, the CNUCE has been responsible for the General Assistant to complete the constructive monetary work on the development and technical integration.
According to Mr. Ohlopkock, the new job movement has been differentiated with the Guideline of CNUCE on the ways of completing the road of arms and cosmodal components and the methods of work with subordinate organizations.
"It was decided that it would be better for all," said one of the ministry who participates in the eastern audience.
The Government's officer, on its basis, calls for a decision to a stranger: "He was one of the best specialists, finding an equal replacement will not be easy."
According to this, it is not necessary: the post of the technical Director of the Spaceline will be revealed and its functions will be dismissed under the CNUCE units.

Red meat, milk products and chocolate can help facilitate HCR.
Red meat and chocolate are agreed to consider a box for your food contract.
But recent studies say: Ditheater, rich local white and milk products, can help facilitate symptoms of those who suffer from depressive kitchen diseases.
This is an unrealised disease that suffers approximately 1,3 million in the United States and 300000 in the United Kingdom, leads to skins and drunks of animal, chronic or blood, loss of weight and extreme stability.
Normally, to avoid disease symptoms are recommended to avoid meat and milk products, but researchers from Washington University stated that the main ammuniculation white of the triptoptophan produces immunal cells that increase the tolerantness of the kitchen.
Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the kitchen followed that the mixture of food had not been in the body.
The cells that can start the pillar process are compared with cells that increase tolerantness, protecting the body, and there is no more senseable tickets.
If the equation is too strongly violated in the side of the repatriation, it may lead to the drying diseases of the kitchen.
The experts showed that the mouse containing a certain bacteria in the cell was higher than the cell tolerance.
And this bacteria needs a triptofan, one of the construction elements of the white - to start the appearance of these cells.
The professor Colonna said, "We have set the link between one species of battery Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the normal mixture of the cell, and the development of the cell population that rises to tolerance.
How many more triptoptophans were contained in the Mouse, so more these immune cells had."
He suggested that the same will work in people: the comparison of L. reuteri and rich triptoptofan can help more tolerant and less decorated to the mixture in the cup.
In fact, Dr. Louise Servantes-Barganvas, studied the diversity of immunal cells higher, found that one group of the subsequent Mouse cells had been, and the other group, which had the same line, had not been particularly contained.
It proposed that the difference could be caused by the mixture of the mouse community by the bacteria, virus and players that usually live in a black and kitchen traffic.
The DNA Mouse Clips were sewned, and there were six species of battery presented in the mouse with immun cells, but there were no mouse containing them.
The muscles in the middle of the mixture without good microbim and who have not developed this kind of immune cells received L. reuteri, and the immune cells of them appeared.
In order to understand how the bacteria affects the immun system, the researchers L. reuteri grew in the middle and then have transferred small spectrums of ivory, without battery, to the non-expansioned immune cells selected from the mouse.
The immune cells were converted into the cells exalting tolerant.
When the active component was separated from judici, it was a huge processing product known as inland-3-monola oxygen.
When triptoptofan was doubled in the museum, the number of these cells increased by approximately 50 percent, but when the triptoptan was declined, the number of cells also fell in two times.
Dr. Servantes-Barrag explains that people have the same tolerantness of cells as we have, and most of us have L. reuteri in his fair and ticket.
It is unknown that the huge tripthofan products from L. reuteri development of clips in people as with the mouse, but people suffering defects in the gentle related to the triptoptane were discovered.
She said: "The development of these cells can be strengthened, since these cells depends on the internal shock surface.
The high levels of triptoptophan when available L. reuteri can lead to their population.”

Requivice for the White House has been paid to troops in thousands of dollars
According to the records of the armed forces provided to the TIME magazine, the Law House decided in the past month to raise the flood of the Sea's flood to the south-speaking of the measures dedicated to the American industry, to the total of $24,000.
Below-Green Sicorsky VH-3D, known as “Marine One”, when it is a president, became the central element held on 17 July in the White House of Actions demonstrated by American construction programmes.
The President Donald Trump, Vice-President Michael Penns and the former officials of the White House were reviewed technical products from all the fifteen states.
The aircraft issued in Connect was set by a bus from the State of Man, a fire car from Vicconsin and a Misidium car.
In accordance with the records of the First Sea Four flights (HMX-1), a Division responsible for the leadership of the Refugee, the White House Office has assigned the presence of a flight in a private order or FRAGO, over 36 hours before the aircraft arrived on the south of the “necessity” events.
“I just wanted you to make sure that you are at the course because it is an unnecessarily wide advertised in the press of action”, wrote the commander HMX-1 in the e-mail to his chief, the Prime Minister of the Audition of the Sea Pechot Corps.
The letter indicated that the aircraft would be arrived at the south of about 7:00 in the morning, 17 July to participate in the action appointed for 3 hours of day, and remained there until the gas will be released between 6 and 9 evening in the same day.
The letter is added that if the shipment from the White House is detained, the second oxygen for the back flight is required in accordance with restrictions for work hours.
The first equipage was leaving a flight during the activities, and the security officers remained close to the air ship until it was on the ground.
The records received by the TIME magazine remained unwise whether the second ECU was required.
The Heach Act prohibites federal officials to use public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 explained whether the measures would not be contrary to this decision.
“Including anything we asked whether this was a violation of the law of Heach, and we answered what is not”, he wrote the commander.
“ It seems you to be naked at anywhere, ” answered the Chief Representative.
It was announced by the White House as an official measures, and the Act of Hatch did not distribute it.
But even in official activities there are political notes.
During the activities, the Chairman made efforts to move health reforms which had previously been made in the development of the senate, and had disagreed attempts to regulate government decisions.
Use of air courts known as "Marine One" and "Air Force One" for political purposes, whether it is a new view.
The Chairpersons are prescribed to use them for travel.
But to invite them the only thing in the interests of the photopower is inadequate.
The Tremp has already been discussed in February when the President's aircraft went back in his first pre-selection ministry in Melbourne, in the Floride State, and his complaint was arrested by complaints to the President's former aircraft.
“ A small house in the area from the exhibition “Sted in America”, which was presented from 50 states made by American workers from American materials, said the Vice-President of the White House of Linds Walters.
The HMX-1 equipays often implement triniture flights around Washington and Southern Light to make the United States's President's transport in the White House with accuracy to the interior.
When Tramp was at the beginning of July, the G-20 Summit in Germany, HMX-1 led 58 triniture plants to the White House.
According to one of the officers, a flight carried out for the activities “Amerika” was ready to the equipague as a monthly account of the necessary three-month flights.
The agency rates in that day also have been 11 additional times under the “in-president support tasks”.
According to the White House, there were no expenditure for one of the other expenditures presented for measures.
The representative of the Sicorsky company reported that the company did not participate in the organization of the demonstration of a flood in the southern slaughter.
HMX-1 will not take account of the budget for the President flights and determine the precise amount paid to the measures of the action is difficult.
However, in accordance with the timely periodic rates of the Ministry of Defence for 2017, the expenditure of VH-3D of the Ministry of Defence is $24,380 per flight.
The unit's records indicated that the air vehicle was 30 minutes every side with its base air base at the Kuantic Sea Pechot in Virginia.
The white house claims that the real value of the aircraft is far below.
“ To assess the value of the wanders based on an example of remuneration, perfectly wrong” says Walters.
“Their examples include personal composition, service and many other unemployed expenditures included in annual allocation.”
According to the investigation carried out in 2015, the RED Corporation does not include the cost of the personal composition, but, in fact, take into account the value of harvest, services and expenditure set out in the treaty.
At the time the former secretariat of the White House Shan Speyser was expressed to protect the use of a flight for activities.
“The idea is to demonstrate things made in America,” said Speser.
"And I know that the Sicorsky and the Connect company are very angry by the fact that they contribute to national security, and what they exist, I guess, hundreds, if not thousands of people whose job is depending on this.
And I think, as most of the Americans, we all are warmed by this flood and another military technology, on the creation of which so many Americans have been worked.
So, of course, it is very wise to take attention to this."
It was uncertain if Tremp was engaged with a flood by the south of the sud of the activities, but he was accurately sitting in the fire car.
Inside the White House, Tromp turned to the representative of the Sicorsky company, with the press on the subject of its own flat of company products.
“I know greatly "Sikorsky," said the President.” — I have three.
