The Parliament does not support the amendment to freedom of Timothy
Today, the parliamenter of Ukraine has rejected the Criminal Procedure Code to reject the article which was condemned by the leader of opposition, Julia Timotheus.
The amendment that would lead to the release of the former Minister in prison was rejected during the second reading of the draft law on reduction of convictions for economic offence.
In October Timothy was sentenced to seven years of prison for signing a gas parking with Russia, which was recognized inadequately.
The sentence is not yet final; the court will consider the appeal of Timothy in December.
The condemnation is a political local term; the Western process also understood the prejudice.
The proposal to cancel article 365 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which was condemned by the former Minister, was supported by 147 members of the Parliament.
For its ratification, 226 votes would need.
Libia Winters
Libia has already lost in the story of liberty, or resurrection.
Mummar Caddafi has buried somewhere in the wilderness, without him the war is over.
It was time to determine the winners.
Usually, the islamists are in the country; the question they are dead or radially.
The transitional Government declared the follow-up of the normal law of Sheriata, which we have already heard.
Libya will become a country without crime, since the punishment for the rock is the rescue of the hands.
Women may forget the emansipation; potential recurrents will be punished; etc.
Instead of the designer of the community of coherent clans, the Coran will be assembled.
In Libya, there will be a order that we can't imagine, and what kind of desire we would.
Anyway, our form of life is not the only kind of life, nor the best, and it would soon be, for example, the population of Libya.
In fact, it was wonderful that the Islamic fighters received help from unbelievers.
Their only justification is that, according to their view, the NATO guided not the American general, but Allah, whose glory they glorify after every fraud.
And if in Libya's search for winners, Western does not get their number.
We were engaged in the rows, we served Islam, and our policies were freed from the detective, their political unioner, without any guarantees of benefit.
As we had recently experience with Afghanistan and Iraq, we decided to refuse the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, must not be worried about the exhibition of the "stringers".
Although without occupation, will Libye’s black gold get practically for shots?
Nevertheless, it's not going to get, and the Western will finally be able to get off the unfair protection of civil rights.
If only Sheriath's followers will not end this.
Starting a new disturbance of Crisis
France and the rest of Europe are currently in the centre of investors.
Statistics have occurred on Europe on Sunday.
Separators have recovered data on HIV in 3 quarters.
In comparison to the previous quarter of the Tsjech economy, Germany and France demonstrate growth.
Yet, a long market is now fighting records.
Investers are not only looking at Italy; they have now focused on Spain, France, Australia and other countries.
Statistics of European countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have renovated their preliminary economic development assessment in the third quarter.
The Germany has increased at 0.5 per cent; France was 0.4 per cent.
Both countries have also corrected the second quarter, in which Germany was better than expected (instead of 0.3 per cent instead of significant 0.1 per cent).
In the third quarter of this year, the Tsjish economy showed the pre-group of 1.5 per cent.
However, in comparison to the previous Quartal of HIV, the Czech Statistics Office has confirmed the trend of the progressive economic growth.
The results occurred worse than the analytics had pronounced.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Tsjech economy showed an early growth of 1.5 per cent, but it was in the state of east compared to the previous quarter.
Based on pre- and seat data, Germany ' s economy increased by 0.5 per cent in the third quarter.
From July to September, both the European Union and the European Union have demonstrated growth as compared to the previous quarter of 0.2 per cent, compared with analytic prognosis.
The Greece economy has demonstrated the pre-decrease reduction of 5.2 per cent.
The benefit of its 10-year-old disappearance is 28.45 per cent.
The arrival and Italian, as well as Spanish, is close to the critical note.
Even Australia, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, as well as difficulties.
Although the situation in the region is disappeared, there is about 4 per cent of Chass.
In Germany, ESC is the last creditor who can save the situation.
Czechya's collective election in the U.S.
In June, they gained a 1:0 and the feast of an unexpected amount of 200 million.
The National Team has successfully done the most complex task of the season!
Through the great Head and the beautiful head of Peter, they gained a 1 / 0 account.
The Second Chass Team was happy to maintain a significant benefit after the home-handed mother, and it will again participate in the European Chess.
IHNED.cz observed the stage and made a detailed report.
Practicely nothing in the first secret and great luck in the second.
The Tsjech national collection, partly because of the battle of the command at the end; the Great Chah; and the heroic Jericho; gained 1:0 in June and felt out in the European Championship.
The Czech Command Defence allowed the Single Command to create dangerous moments only at the second half of the game.
The Dominicans and teachers became the most unfair guy after the late two great opportunities.
The Great Peter Chech is one of the reasons that the Tsjish national collection will not lose the Championship of Europe in the next year, and the Chess football is the same for about 200 million chips.
From the first minutes of the game, it was very close.
Both teams had tried to have been conducted by combination; a large part of time was in the center of the field.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the side of the hosts in the first secret, and the thresholds for the line of defence have been hidden by Tsjish defenders.
Iranian students are ready to die for the nuclear programme of their country.
They created a living shot.
A number of hundreds of students of the University have created a living shoot around the atomic electricity in Iran.
However, they wish to express their support to the nuclear programme of their country before the possible attack from Israel.
During the middle of the prayer for students before the entrance to the building, he followed the molebite for loss, both the United States and Israel.
In Ispahan, Iran, a few hundred students of universities have created a living shoot around the U.S.
Thus, they demonstrated the readiness to protect the nuclear programme of their country with the cost of their own life.
In its last report, the International Agency on Nuclear Energy (IAEA) indicated that all evidence that Iran had not left an attempt to get nuclear weapons.
The possible attack on nuclear objects in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday, at the south of students' prayers before the entrance of the Uran Exploiting Laboratory, he followed a prayer for losses as well as Israel.
In the case of attacks aimed at the maximumization of the Iranic Nuclear Programme, the objectives will be, in accordance with the Israeli press, installations as well as Natanza, where the burden reward is carried out.
Question of children suffering from feeding: no dinner and dinner
More than the third ages of 9 to 13 are more standards, while 9 per cent of school schoolers have low weight, 5 per cent suffers from feeding.
According to the last study, children suffering from food are usually conducted from families who have a healthy life form.
We reaffirm the importance of environment and behaviour of man's behaviour or its healthy development.
For example, the rabbits appears on the tables of children suffering from food, almost two times more often than in families with children with normal weight.
More than 19 per cent of the children suffering from food, feeding the fry card card to dinner is not an accident of the educational action under the Ombudsman.
Furthermore, children suffering daily have no sports, but this is the majority of modern school schools — only 15 per cent of children said that their parents were time for sports as at least a week.
Research was conducted among 900 children.
Research was conducted at the end of the past education year, and almost 900 first - class students were attended throughout the divine.
This was not an accident of the second year, with the support of Všeobecná zdravotní pojišovna and the Univers company.
At present, more than 12,000 school students were joined to the project.
Regular food and sufficient sports load are the main factors that are sought to grow in the number of children suffering from the lower weight or from the weight.
"Of example, only half of the deposited said they were eating five times on the day, according to the dinner-traffick-Thank-Traffens-Traffick, and it is one of the unexpected conditions of correct food," said one of the findings of research.
No Fingers and Coasts at the evening
Experts warn that healthy development is an even relative detail as the continuing time of dinner for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23 percent of the schoolers are tomorrow together.
Most families are dinnered by separation.
The better opening was that each decade of the families wouldn't have tomorrow.
Yet, tomorrow is the foundation of the right daily ration.
Research showed that rare food was often used in families with children suffering from feeding.
Besides each - undependent, weight is drinking sweet drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40 per cent of children are regularly dealing with sports, this figure declines more than twice to 15 per cent of their parents.
Leave your own menu.
Another part of the study of the elected children (204 and 172 girls from 13 schools) was proposed to prepare their own menu based on the proposed products and on their tacks and training.
"Christ children aged 12-15 years far from the idea about healthy food."
Their loved food includes a large number of muscle, local and sweet balls.
"According concern causes great popularity of sweet drugs," says the final part of the research.
As a major daily busy guard, the birds won with a small shot.
However, children have not been interested in the divergence, fish and fruit observers.
Strengthing to healthy life
The investigation also showed that children were ready to change their privileges in the daily condition that their information would be provided.
" Many participants of the supervision group of research have shown a significant movement of healthy food when ankto has filled after the hearing of the Survey, it is not an accident," said the projects.
This was particularly notable, for example, in the case of fresh drunken drinks, more children have been pregnant to them just water.
The addendum as a main observer, the children had frequently noted the birds and fish, limited the number of sweet cups and feeds.
Steel must also be a good psychology, claiming professionals
In the first article on steel trainings, I have visited information for entertainment jobs.
I didn't know what's going on.
The lection of three experts in this area; the election of clothing for non-finite fibres; and the seminar of how it works in real life.
More - more.
How close to the final exchange, more information and practical tasks are expected to us.
Trenning passes every Sabbath and Saturday, but he's really on information.
At this time with Allenica, director, we discussed how to cover a woman whose body is not an ideal symmetric.
The majority of women is not completely symmetric.
In one short chain, another small figure without appropriate forms, another measures more standards.
The Steel must know how to reduce widespread balls, spread the hair or add low levels.
We have given advice to emphasis on women such as Jennifer Lopes, that's the owner of the pearls and pearls and the powder of the Taliban, and there is no clothe of them too higher.
For example, if the difference of the table and the wolf is so large that it can't be able to take the oven or a bucket, although one thing is hidden by the order.
You don't be sorry for the resources putting out because the ideal clothing is unvaluable.
In the thumb, you'll feel a lot better than in the one who is continually going to go, find the statistics, etc.
The equipment of small fibres, on the other hand, can bear clothes with robes, appliction, extent or compounds.
I'm glad I have a whole week to understand this.
And yet, I'm afraid it's too much, taking into account the more home job we have received.
Each part of the courses had to be considered two opportunities for any signification: for day and evening.
We need to consider their modern extent, their styles in clothes and the type of figuries.
I need to cover Miranda Kerr, which you can know about Victoria's Secret campaign.
I'm glad about myself because she was clothing much easier than Britney Spirs, Christian Agileur, which recently sent to a tone (laughter, I mean I'm enlarged), or it's totally young Zeena Gomes.
We must cut out the newspapers, or find it on the Internet, spread and processing through graphical programmes.
Mudbord is called the result of work, then reflects our own style and relation to the graffic image.
It is important to keep the graphical style in the head.
The style is not just covering real people, but it creates product pages in newspapers (in addition to special indications, for example, moderate sums, palto and etc.).
That's what he told us the skist and the designer Mariao Camic.
But it was just on the Sunday.
Style needs common knowledge
The bathday audience of the philosophic type has been held on three guests of specialists in this area.
Stylist, Honza Pocorn; Modern designer, Jacob Polanka; and the model photo Ben Rench.
Howbe it remembered us that the model is illusion and the slider should use the fact.
A good stylish can use one clothing object differently.
In this case, differential is the key for success.
For example, the pillar-thirn can normally bear on the top of thicks and plots like the pool; but it can also be put on the head, without a gun as a pit.
Another opportunity is to cut the hand or leaving the tower, and the whole image is fully changed.
"Get with him," he cried.
In any case, I was mostly appreciated by the following Council: "For your work you should ideally know the rules."
Then you can start hurt them," said to us, "Toba.
This is my final understanding why we can see all definitions and rules that are to be compared with what and why, while in model magazines we often seem different.
Don't talk about model indicators.
From Bena, the photograph, I learned that the steel has to be more than the number of photos that he had to do.
Yes, for a model review on ten pages (equivalently ten pillars) I must be ready to create for at least ten images.
Now I also know that the picture of clothing is often looked and worked in comparison with others just as in reality.
We must mean that when we create a image.
Honza Pohorne confirmed that often is the half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have a huge eye, but her immage and marketing made it into a world star.
Relation to style services in the Czech Republic is still predominant.
Even known people are often thinking that is lost (and believe that it's enough to be specialised in something, and how they look at second.)
And if someone finally allows us to create their style, we must wait for them to call us another size than the one they are really taking.
Then we turn to Google and explain whether we didn't write tableds about some kind of signification of the pocket/pogly and etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mary made an accent on the fact that the styleer was not sufficient to take the model and to be able to make a warrant.
Our work mainly consists of communications with the people we cover; therefore, it is important to be a good psychology.
In order to appreciate people, not make them and keep their opinions.
"If the manager asks you to see her clothes and add a few beautiful things, you can't throw all her garden," she told her her that her clothes are terrible.
"When you find a few things you can praise, and help you to bear with them," said Mary.
He also showed us that it should specifically contain the amount of work.
This is the sum that you're linking the plate around to take all the necessary.
Besides clarified materials, such as peaks, feed rock or English, it should be a nice change (styles use it with some objects, such as the swimming or slope), special clips to strengthen the ticket on the back if the clothes are too large (whichs and similar objects are prohibited because they have to bear clothes) or shopping.
To disappear from the audience and get some practical experience, we learned to do correctly insufficient tickets.
Even during the studies where the skin of skins can get damaged — not talking about the smokes on the street.
And here we've got a kitchen.
You don't have to be a tuffee of feet so that you don't export them.
This requires the present mastery.
I was glad that Mary loved my work.
I haven't come to the soul mentioned.
It's only part of what we heard during the second part of the outcoming day.
I'm starting to understand that being a professional style isn't so easy to talk.
V Need for Speed: Railway happens in America.
Overview
What was to be unemployed, it was turned to a ruinary morning trip to work because of the series of inconsistent and unlawful errors.
The ambitions were satisfied, but it was not important because no one was obvious to work.
Before the start of a new version with the Foundation Chapter, great hopes were linked.
It was expected that she had the previous series of Need For Speed in a new direction; the demonstration versions proved that the game would take a decent place in the genre of the guest games.
We've been interested to see parts of the game where the chief hero out of the car and flee.
As it is often from NFS, many are different from what we expected.
The game represents a quite bad crack, but the general impression is to bring a few unnecessary errors present in this game for several years.
This is indeed not a mistake, but a non-complianced light of the developers.
The approach begins very good.
You are a part of the history, the main hero whose Jack decides to address some personal problems through the participation of the illegal course through America.
You're in a car at west campaign, San Francisco, and your task is first to go to New York.
This is a few interesting features.
Marshrot consists of ten stages divided by more than 50 lines.
This means that each road passes on its mercury, individual stages are different and interested in the environment.
So there is no feeling that all the time happens the same.
Although the graph is at the same level that in the previous parts of the series, some trains are pleased to look.
Yet, the game does not cause strong emotions.
Although it is very nice to drive the storm through the desert, in a sensitive reward or highly in the mountains closed.
Furthermore, the race of time lives in an unnecessary detail.
For example, in the wilderness you're going to fall into a dry moon that is significantly declined.
On the other hand, the mountains should be careful so that they should not fall under the labinet.
Separators are pretty good.
There's a few differences, but it's enough.
Some time you're trying to burn a number of pillars, and then you're trying to improve the time (standard race with a second), or you're disagreemented with one opponent.
Besides whatever you have from time to touch the police that makes your task more complicated.
The composer's discovery is new.
It's just an interactive an understanding where most of the time Jack is away from somebody and you have to help him at the necessary buttons at the time.
It's nothing difficult.
Although it's surprised that these fractions are much less than you could wait (all three to be accurate).
In fact, it is good for the game because it does not need it; taking into account all the above, it is one of the things that make play more carefully.
The original model follows the previous models.
This means that it is no longer representing something special, but it cannot be considered in a lack.
If you are looking for real life, you'll need to search for another place.
However, this model is very important for dynamic courses, although it is possible to find better options on the market.
It's fine.
But after some time, there are problems.
In other words, the ball model is not so good.
You're not waiting for comprehensive transformations and captainings, but if you don't think it's a object as your car leads something wrong.
Normally, smoking or flooding cars in the car river, you're sometimes easy about another car and sometimes in practical situation of your car starts to disappear.
Or we've been killed.
This is not so important because of the restart system, but it's enough to export joy.
Restarts are made so that if you're disagreed or far away from the trip, the game will return you to the point where she's stopped.
Nevertheless, only five restarts are available.
If you're using them all, you'll have to start a race from the beginning.
It's useful if something doesn't get, but you can't do it fully.
Sometimes the restart is not enough, and you must learn the ownership of a individual part of the course.
The important lack of game is that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns need to go through a certain way, otherwise you don’t just write.
In other cases, you will meet civil machines in a certain place in the same way, independently of the same configuration, you will come to the first, five, five seconds before or later.
It is particularly angering in situations when you see your coach is easy to walk between the two cars moved in opposite direction, while when you're there, the cars are already located so that or you're going to move or drop the speed.
It's important when you're turning around with them, so that the situation is always happening as once before your nest.
There are other benefits.
In the game you find a few places where, unless of time, the same spot will burn you on the same place.
It's particularly obvious at the end of the game, at the long brain where you go to the opposite direction.
Apparently, your coach must stand before you, although nothing.
It's that when he eats before you, he's driving you a review that offers one or more abortion to this party.
You can understand the attempt to play a more interesting and completely a game, but it is so clear that quickly starts to call anger.
Weather, because you have no time to take attention to the outcome around you, despite the simple spectrum, the game is busy and sometimes is so busy with events.
It's not important that you don't miss you -- the concept of the 50-in-unital traces, the follow-up of the course or something else.
The idea of the change of the car during the race is inadequate.
You need to take the edits on the road because it's why your car can be changed, although most of the cases you already have, it's enough.
The machines are divided into three categories.
Sport cars are subject to cities; the powerful American cars for direct speeds; and the ecost sports for technical warming, for example, outdoor mountain traffics.
The main story mode mode is closely linked to the challenge mode; this is the run of the individual parts that you will find on the game.
Here you're engaged for your personal, meal and eye, generally for challenges and history.
Many opportunities are available to obtain a higher profit level: starting from car and finishing profiles.
Furthermore, a profile is linked to the Autolog Autolog, which compares your results with other players and provides a connection with public.
This is another lack that is difficult to understand; this is an example of the last course in follow-up.
You and your car fall into the tunnel metro (then we think that it is) where you're going to floods in the dark (then we'll think it).
Your postmeter shows the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (and we'll think that yes) when you're going back to a metro car converted your car into the brain of metallool.
During a few days, our editing discussed whether no one was thinking at the creation of the game, or its creators really believe that we were such a tank.
The technological composer is nothing particularly, but the general impression of video drivers is mostly pleasant, sometimes even very exciting.
Although it is unfortunate that in some critical points the quality of the record, sometimes it is too strong.
This is particularly related to the results of the large number of participants where the good account would not be helped you.
The sound is okay; the seat is on the favorite.
In order to enjoy a more wide youth audience, the section 'stake out of different styles', but, though, many people buy games from their music.
General impression of Need for Speed: escaped quite unjust.
If a game was run clearly unnecessary, we could certainly say that the flight is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
The game makes the feelings of incompatibility.
Of course, it's a good disappearance, but prepare the lack of the airport.
The Queen's University Harry is going on the "Standards in the barhat" concept.
The Third Year under festival Festa Academia suggests that the international day of students and the anniversary of a baroat revolution with music event.
It will represent approximately twenty school and universities.

Enterprise message in the EU:
The republication of non-profits and rubbers on euros.
"The Lisbon Treaty has made significant differences between individual organizations."
"I didn't wait for such a cruel war."
"Five or six years before the situation has been stabilized, and all players will be accompanied to their new roles," the EU Milana Vizenov has hardly started his treatment in the legal factory.
She showed how to be retained to her girl 'Is clear and open about Europe' in the first part of her audience, where she described individual EU institutions and relations between them so simply and understand that many electors from the legal factory of the CU would be disappointed.
Furthermore, Vicen commended the work of the new permanent Chairman of the European Council, Herman Van Rompea:
"Thanks said that he was an upper-off-based Mouse that couldn't do any role; I should say that all were hurt how well he was doing with his role."
"It is a person who can listen to one of twenty seven participants at the same time to talk with them and has a clear presentation of what part the EU must be developed."
She explained her new position to the representative of international relations and security as a response to the question: "Who is the European Union? For what number should I call?"; that is how important step is in the direction of unification and greater transparency of the Union's policy for such countries, such as China or India.
Nobody's gonna prohibite ours.
The result was further focused on the EU key program in the past, present and close future.
She called a successful presidency of Chechia in the past year.
Checa had a case with the moved financial crisis; they overlooked the crisis and organized the East Partnership itself.
She said that the deduction of the Government was a negative view to which a small harm of the Czech Republic had been harmed.
The representatives of Chessy in the EU are now very occupied.
As said the Ambassador, and the presidency, and the following financial crises, have granted the continued weapon.
Furthermore, the new seven-year budget of the EU must be adopted, taking into account the modern crisis.
Whether the budget will be slow and economical, which areas will be advised; which countries will receive more support, and what less; all these issues are in the present programme.
He remembered the key lounges that she brought to Brussels: "O Europe, captured by the language."
"I really don't like reductions, foreign words and irons that no one understands.
As citizens can understand that in Brussels people are not trying to sell criminals or rounds, banks of different sizes, or somebody is going to prohibite our warrants.'
It is also going to be more effective to use the EU environment and to bring more cheques into European organizations.
Europe is our future
The Assessment claims that Chechs consider Euro-Keeptics, as well as those notes more negative than positive parts of things.
She wishes that more representatives of the Czech Republic are involved in the European organizations.
It believes that there are several factors: for example, the humbleness of our candidates and their inability to write motive letters; the small support of the chess.
She noted the strongness and cooperation of the Highgrade Group as well as the successful presidency of Checa.
"Do you believe that when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and the speaker is joined to us, the French next to me says, "Hey, for what is the meeting again the Highsgrade Group?" and he doesn't like this.
In the future, the Vice-Weace Union is expected to be a new set of rules for the budgetary policy of States parties.
In comparison with the new European Federation, it considers a two-year-old idea, if not a more realistic Europe.
"We've got the country inside and outside the borders of Europe."
"We've got a Shangen Zone, and we've already got a set of co-operations."
"The first was said that countries who want to be joined, while those who don't want to stay in the side."
"The number of such institutions will be grown; it will be the last two-year-old Europe," hopes Vicence.
In this regard, she emphasized the role of the Czech Republic, as well as Herman Van Rompea, in the movement of regulations, which all issues concerning the EU should be discussed by all parties, not only those in Europe.
Brand history:
The IBM newspaper enters into the second century of its existence.
If someone wants to find a word that's better to express the IMB strategy, the most closely, it's likely to be "proper".
For the wide public, IBM is a symbol of technological revolution; the company is considered very timely, although it was found more than 100 years ago.
The long time of the company was laid down by the first boss, Thomas J. Watson's dream.
He believed in his girl, according to which many world problems can easily be resolved if people wanted to think.
Its Law Dumay, therefore, became a stamp around which a future hygant was disappeared (and the name of his domestic magazine, which IMB began to release in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of the corporate culture that Watson had severely stressed.
" For us in IBM, long-term thought means constant movement to future.
IBM lived and prospered a hundred years, because his significative values remained, although he was not afraid to change all about it.
In our first centuries, it allowed us to transform technology, business and company.
In the second centuries, we hope to achieve even more," said the current manager of the company Sammuel J. Polimizano at the jubilee case.
Complex system
In the 1930s, IMB officials were one of the first US officials with payable release, employees' insurance, electrical university and comprehensive burden systems for the best producers and entrepreneurs.
Those extended are long-term IBM relations with consumers.
It was one of the first world enterprises that eliminated all discrimination that gave her a great choice.
The anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan, in accordance with the following year, is agreed with the anti-discriminatory strategy and the current plan.
She worked in IBM thirty-year-olds; she is currently director for sales, marketing and development.
Last few years, IBM organized online brass meetings, during which many future innovations have occurred.
There is no wonder that many ideas in the company work about half a million people.
Organization of good republication
The powerful position of the company is ensured by a strong internal and external immigration.
"Otherwise, IBM's concept was quickly organized, not the technological company," said the Economy professor of the Harvard Trade School and the author of the Book on IBM Robbeth Moss Kover.
"IBM - not technology company, this is a company that helps to solve business problems with the use of technology," add Joj Coloni from Forrester Research's consultation company.
As they say in the company, there is a difference between the market and the creation of it.
In the centuries of the IBM, or "Houlbourg," as it was called in the United States because of its legotipa, becomes one of the greatest world companies.
It seems that this is the most universal technology company that is developing approximately and programmatic security; infrastructure; calamity and concentration services from servers to no-no-no-technology.
It has the largest number of patents among all American technology companies, its five staff received the Nobel Prime.
Its findings include, for example, banks, bank cards, financial lobbys, shopping codes and diskettes.
From $220 billion, under the market capitalization, IBM in this year became the second on the technological company (the first place in Apple company), burned Microsoft first since 1996.
Look forward
Not all its products came to the purchasers and recorded in epoca. For example, IBM has suffered unfortunately from its operational OS/2 operating system; online Prodigy and computers IBM PCjr.
"If your business is defined by movement forward, you can't be emotionally linked to the past," said Sammuel J. Polisano.
That is why IBM easily puts the basis on several platforms -- if they don't work, it is rejected from them.
This is different, for example, from its Microsoft competitor, which is based and overwhelmed on Windows, its operational system.
Perspective technology
The main income of IBM receives from services, approximately one fifth in each case of computer programmes and equipment.
While in 1990, with the capital, it was the most strongest equipment manufacturer.
Since 2000, IBM has sold low-proceedings for $15 billion, and it has added 58 billion to the buy of prospective technologies.
It continued to have investment even since 2008, when the first time the current economic crisis was in the world.
IBM should be an example of his first director, Thomas J. Watson, who has increased the number of investments in the Great Depression year.
As soon as IBM had not caused the current crisis.
Since 2008, IBM’s operation price has increased by 120 per cent of recorded; the purification of the company is constantly grown.
The corporative IBM girl is to change everything, except their own values.
It is therefore possible to expected that even if another crisis is dismissed, that deluged gain will be done with the situation.
History of IBM: from the red side to the space fields.
IBM (International Business Machiness) was founded in New York for a hundred years ago. Its initial name "Creation, Tabulary, script" was quite complex.
It took the name of IBM in 1924, named Brenda, used for company offices in Canada and South America.
The foundation of future IBM was designed by four companys whose history begins in the 1880s.
They owned technologies such as the Legend Times, i.e. hours when staff comes and leaves from work.
The architecter of the new company was the businessman Charles Ranette Flint, who also entitled the company's Board until 1930.
Flint took the director of the company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him manage the company.
The leader then discovered the IBM founder in the shadow of Watson’s ideas remains a threat to corporative culture and individuality.
Watson called the company before 1952.
IBM, as clear from the name, started from the production and sale of different equipment for business, from the swimming powder and the fuel to the cassy apparates.
In the first four years, the Guideline of Watson was deployed to nine million dollars, and a large company's expansion began in all continents.
Watson was so important for the company that nearly forty years his place in the director's chain took his son, Thomas Watson's youngest.
Under its manager, IBM began to develop artificial intelligent technologies and created the first programmeing language.
In the 1960s, as well as the IBM computers, helped NASA control space fields at Mercurius, Saturn and 1969 human flights to Luna.
However, in 1964 IBM developed the first computer family IBM line System/360.
The classic CC, which defined computer standards of that time, named IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
After twenty years, IBM sold the production of the Chinese company of Lenovo computers, buying a consolidated PricewaterhouseCoopers Office, so that it was fully concentrated on the concentration and services with highly added value.
In the last three years, IBM has achieved great success from its Smarter Planet concept.
Its goal is a reasonable use of technology in areas where it has not yet been planned and improved road situation and urban management.
IBM recently presented the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businessers to control the whole trade cycle.
The IBM Trade is strong even in our country.
In the former Czechlovakia, as the first country in Central and Eastern Europe, IBM founded its office in 1932.
IBM CZ today also manages the strategic atmosphere centre in Bron.
The Central and Eastern Europe Chamber is located in Prague, where the World level Research Unit also works.
Review of his unbelievable husband:
I'm not needing anymore!
Dana Richarova (53) said that it's over!
After her husband, Jozph Richardh (53) became a body defender and lover of Ivoire Bartosh (45), Darina still hoped he was open and returned home.
However, she no longer wants to wait and has defined clear rules for her future life.
"Papa can come home, but no longer like my partner," she explained.
When Darina Richtorage provided to her house in Bartosh’s house, she probably had no smallest idea of what would happen to her marriage.
And although she made the Witness to go from Ritchen after 30 days, Peppa hadn't left the dog.
Moreover, he was publicly recognized that he loved her.
After some time, Darina had made a kind of immortality with a man's man, and now she was finally excused him.
I'm not going to have his wife to sleep.
Even if Richarge and Bartova are ever detained, his wife won't take him with a disappearance.
"He's a biological father of my sons and if he wants to keep his last days in our house, nobody will get him out."
"Only he ends his days not as my beloved, lost and found old dog, but the man with which I bind something," said Richardhi, adding that she had already been freed from the husband and only stands on the cousins.
As far as Joshua has nothing against his wife rejected.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll be with the Lord, I'm not gonna change it."
"My wife has decided to get married to the boom, and I respect this decision."
"Our Union is still operating; I answer the remons, garden, house and shopping."
"Daryna and I'm talking perfectly, just we're not doing a bed room", said Richard Blesk.
He claims that if Richardhi would find a new love, he won't prevent her.
"We're not sleeping together and even where she's going, with who and if she's got a friend.
I know that it's my guilty, I loved Ive, and I'm gonna have full responsibility," concluded Josef.
The female behaviour: are they worth you?
When you ask men to call some typical female behaviour, they usually count it all right.
Women’s, will you find yourself in the next lines described several female behaviors that have men to hurt?
Shopping
Your second half is grieved that you're always walking on stores?
Do you need to buy at least one thing every week?
You like buys for great payment?
If so, your shopping can be considered a stupid behaviour.
Some women recognize that they need to control their loss to the shopping.
And yet, who of you will denied from clothing stores in the search for perfect sitting clothing and exampleing it (see in different color options) in example?
Maybe the shopping and the hobby is for the majority of women, but for the men it may become a copper father.
Just remember how many times you talked to your second half waiting for you to find out...
Total disability
"I'm too cute?"
"I have to get off at least five kilograms -- maybe I'm going to do mysnist?"
"Are you still involved in me?"
Do you know these sentences?
Yeah?
Then you go to a group of women mixed in your outer view.
Not that you should stop following yourself, but many men in literally mean the alergy on the continuing complaints of a partner in their outdoor species.
The strong sex is also agreed with the fact that more women are often envyed.
Overall order and cleanness
It's like an infinite story.
My steel, the powder of dust, my pool, the opposition of the dust, a clean bathroom -- just as at least two times a week.
You're criticing your partner because he's coming on a clean caffeine in the huge bottles; kids in the cleaner garden and fingerprints on the window of the guest that was so easy to clean?
In the case you suffer from this "abortion," try to know that it is not good and that your family order and cleanness should not stand on the first place.
Independent efforts to cleanness can be threatened by your relationships, as well as by the whole family.
Command Streaming
"Back the white in the waste."
"You're going to hope tomorrow's hurts?"
"Mooods for vessels shouldn't lie on the pool."
If you're doing comments to your partner a few times a day, he can be very nice.
Of course, you have good intentions, you just want it to be perfect.
Maybe if males understood it, the women wouldn't have to command them so often...
Snippets
Some women like to flood, hurt the tribes of intrins against others.
Women are focused on relations, so they like to discuss who, with whom, as well as why.
It's likely that every one of us gets his bed.
We'll be discovered, such as the nature of all women.
There are more serious bedrooms, women who often flying and prejudice the rest, especially in women's college, a greater danger for their environment.
Igra and Warchecks have assisted Philidelphia to win
During NHL's mother on Monday, two resulting transfers of the chocolate Iraqi attacking Iraq have helped Philadelphia win 5:3 at the Queen's liver.
In both cases, Claude Jirra used experience of thirteen-fourth stars; he added another transfer and was announced by the best player of the mother.
Two outcome transfers were also included a player in one team with Yakubu Warchk.
After the mother of Irish, he told foreign journalists that he was a great evening of Jerus.
"I told him to the mother he's killing a cheat-thirk."
"I felt it."
"You're sometimes feeling such things," Ig," she explained, after the action of Jüro killed a hair at the first opportunity that Flyers gave.
A little later the second hair team also had a chick follow.
Harrickinez Worchek was driving a shoe and delivered it to Max Talbou, who killed the rounds.
During the first second time, Patrick Dwayer was decreased by a number of benefits, but the second secrets again brought Philaris again.
Specially Gene.
After the results of Yagra, he killed the third head, and his slaughter was also transformed into the fourth Wayne Symmonds.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean he's the best line player, but he's exactly going into the three best ones," said Igg, praiseing his center.
"I never thought that at the end of my carrier I'd play with a chocolate player like he."
"It makes me happy."
"I want to support him."
"All these years in NHL my team partners tried to help me, and now I got my way back," added Ig.
Karolin made a more dramatic mate using Tomo Rutu and Dwayer penalty, reduced the break down to one head.
The further complication prevented Matt Ridd, which increased the spread to two points.
"Penger did well in our area."
"He hit the scene, I'm fastened, and Rid has gone through a long border."
"I was glad about it and I'm glad that it's done," said Warchek's his impression from his last mother's hair.
The victory had transferred Philadelphia to the first place in East Conference.
The manager of Montreal Chech Yaroслав Schpach did not complete the match with Buffolo; he left the second time from the upper grain of the body.
Nevertheless, Canada's expertise lost their two-year-old benefit and lost 2:3 after the period of pensions.
Touch Plekanner couldn't kill one of them.
More than lost cells, the home trainer was inclined by a larger number of grass in the back, since the mother was completed by five protectors.
"The bad situation is."
"We've finished the mother only with one experienced player, the others were young people."
"Whatever it was, we can't do nothing to do this, you just need to martyn," said Chuck Martin.
"Substitute for replacement, it was explicitly and we couldn't resist."
"We had to simplify the game, put a gun out of our area."
"What was our weaker side," added the defender P.C. Subban
After thirty aggression of Chess Holiper, Paul’s fell as well as Winninipegs to win Tampa Bay 5:2.
The Guinea of Jets, who had stopped the five-year-fth series, were killed by five different players.
Travel Dinamics since 1989
Before 1989, five Turkish State Agency could work in the former Chemise: ◆edok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Since western travels were hardly limited, the tourist agencies of time were mainly sold to tours in the social block.
Thus, the Czech tourists went into the German Democratic Republic; the Council Union (Sochi, Crime on the Red Sea); Bulgaria, Romania (Other countries on the Red Sea; and Hungary (Balton).
The only exception was from 1962 to 1972 when we were able to travel to Yugoslavia. Then the Yugoslav regime returned to Western, with significant limitations to the Cheese tourists traveling in Yugoslavia.
The major social period was that the civilians of the social block (e.g. and Czechlovakia) were not allowed individual travels to social countries.
If a civilian of Cherubics wanted to go to himself, for example, in the Council Union or Polonia, a letter-in-law, was required, otherwise, individual travel was impossible.
At that time, tourist agencies proposed travel to West, but it was necessary to stand all night, with a swimming middle or to have good friends in the agency.
And it wasn't all yet.
It was necessary to travel to Western, and it was not removed political unfair people who were not allowed to travel.
The Czechlovakia Valut was not converted; without a reasonable authorisation was not possible to get money (West Value) for travel to Western.
Of course, their home leaves, which brought to the large number of cottages and older houses, remained this exhibition on this day.
After 1989, the tourism in Chechia overvive this revolution.
While the release to HDD or Bulgaria was the culmination of our trips in the past 1989, four million releases in the world were held over the past year.
The great paradox, which we no longer recognize, is that until 1989, we could not be able to visit the most popular now in Croatia because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
At the beginning of 1990, the need for visa was renewed in the neighbouring countries of Western Europe, which began a huge threat of short paths in Vienna and Germany.
The Chessaws couldn't win the Western trips, and all wanted to go there even if they were a moment.
For example, in Paris, the Tsish tourists slept in parks, as their arrivals were not lacking for guests or masters.
The typical characteristic of the Tsish tourism during that period was seeking to bring their own food (conservation, sals, etc.) to assess money.
Another important moment is the introduction of a free conversioned chess. After the decade of our tourists, at last, can buy a west wage.
Our lives and average income have increased that approximately 1997 has resulted in another important circumstance.
Since 1997, the adult request allowed tourist agencies to prepare regular transmissions implemented by aeroplanes and, in comparison with the past, aircrafts have now become unbelievable through the possibility of delaying optimum.
Until the end of the 1990s, Chechya was not needed to visit almost all the developed world countries, except the United States, and our travels were still easier.
The next significant event in the history of travels after the revolution occurred in 2000. The great demand brought to the historical first trip river from the Czech Republic into the Economic country, Thailand.
From that time, the direct square flights provide chess tourists in the warmest economic countries, and the winter fields from the Czech Republic will be sent to twelve ecost directions.
At this time, some 100 thousand cheques visit the economic countries every year!
Another important event of this period that symbolizes our development after the revolution has occurred in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the United States rejected the need for chess tourists, and our country has thus been joined to the most developed world countries.
First in the history of 2008, more than the half of their releases were over the border (50.3 per cent); and first in the story they lost more than 150,000 kirons for human leave, including their costs in the destination paragraph.
The General Meeting should choose the President, the dad threat returns
For about five months in the Czech Fotobola, there is no President that the President of Iwan Gashak, head of the Chair of the Czech Fotobly Association (FA月R), will not be named even after another extraordinary meeting, which will be held on Sunday.
There is still no agreement in which the rules of election should be followed.
Without this vote, one of the three candidates will not begin.
Irish Rail, Pelett, and Tom Paschik, want to call the Chess Football.
Gaschek went away from his stage to June, and he went out, calling his colleagues to join and find a strong person who would call the football in the future.
Nevertheless, the Ray Hashka re-laid the football between two patches of association that cannot select a single candidate.
It was clearly 16 September when the new President had to be chosen.
The delegations of the General Assembly had come to the National Dome in Prague, Smith, since the negotiations remained blocked, not only the process of elections.
There was no consent to those who had the right to vote at the General Assembly - only legal representatives or officials that have granted powers.
This moment has been partly regulated by the recommendations of the Institute of State and Right, according to which the representation based on the powers provided is impossible.
Along with the election rules, however, continues.
The Executive Board is not too helpful, although at its meetings, both indirect and extraordinary, it is mainly involved in this matter.
The submission of the methods of vote has changed a few times, but the key matter remains the same.
The question is the following: How to move to the 3th round and avoid the dad?
"The Spower is to follow whether or find another model," said one of the Vice-Presidents of the FA月R Dushan Sublid who represents a professional football in the administration of the Association.
Based on the model provided by the statute, the triple of the round is a candidate who endorsed the larger support of the pale from which he served by the candidate.
As stated, Mozambique agreed to consider a candidate elector of the electoral, with the larger number of the numbers voted in both pallets.
The Czech party is a condition that the profiter should take two third votes in general.
"Again, two previous rounds would have lost their meaning; it would have completely rejected the concept of two patates," he agreed with the claims of Moab and said that it would be better to change the rules and vote in accordance with the existing rules.
A number of unexpectedly agreed to his opinion, although in the evaluation of the election regulations set by the statutes, the Pelot is more than other candidates.
"I would like the elections to go through the statute."
"I want to avoid the powerful representative as at the previous general meeting," said the owner of Victoria Plenz, who first is candidate; and in his statements he was contrary to Pelet.
Pelta remains optimistic.
He believes that the new President will be known in the Imburgh; he also hopes that the candidates will be constructively cooperating in the future.
"All emotional weapon will be satisfied after the expected outcome of a national collection in Championship in Europe."
"The Fotbol will be more excited, people will work more well," said the representative of the Ibloonic. Of three candidates have more experiences in the fotobal management, as well as at regional levels.
Rachil's still stopped.
"I hope to agree, but the situation is very uncertain."
"It's not among the representatives of Godiday and Moab, but there's an attempt to adapt the rules."
"It can call another break of the general congregation."
"I hope the good sense will win," said Rachel.
There was no longer time for the parties to reach agreement.
Some details, individual negotiations were directly held in Montenegro; but who knows whether a football unit will be achieved to the mother.
A additional vehicle, which should be added, among others, the Vice-Presidents of Dauvoir Kucher and Raihala, had not been run out of the morning because of technical unfairness, and were searched for alternatives to add part of the Executive Committee to the place of the trans-border mother.
Finally, the Minister ' s meeting at the middle level may be a decision-making meeting.
The Minister for Education, Youth and Sport, Joseph Dobesh, would like to come to the parts of the most stronger sports association in the country.
There are many: Government subsidies; football creditability; and the general SSTV meeting planned with the new directive of the Tsjish sport after the financial problems of Zazkia.
The Palestinian enters into the President's fight because he does not see the proper candidate
If the extraordinary general meeting of the Fotobalist Chapter of Tom Pazki would see a strong candidate that would comply with all its requirements to the President of the Czech Republic (FA月R), he would not even have claimed a high position.
"If he was a candidate, I'd fight for him, and I'dn't participate in the fight."
"But such a man haven't yet found," said Pazilla.
The model for the peacekeeping and peacekeeping of Peeltoy and Yiндрj Raychlam is to try to prevent Pelet, the preferred design of the elections, to enter into the FA月R management.
Furthermore, the Palette stressed that in the case of victory, it would remain only by the President until 2013 when the ordinary meeting was planned.
In the future, he would like to take an experienced fuel manager that is not too related to the fotbol life.
"I talked to several people who could mean."
"I've been terrible to hear some of them said that at the moment they don't even want to have a relationship with the Chess Fotball."
"I would like to change this opinion," he said.
At this time, the main difference of the Pallick with Pelltoy is linked to the relations of the latter with Roman Berb, the President of the Regional Foodle Association in Plazne. Berb is a person of opposite republic, known as a affective lobby, which is able to address the vote of delegations of the whole congregation.
The Palestinian is therefore inadmissible that Pelett becomes President.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain without change, and the football won't move forward."
"In support by Berbery, a powerful businessman, it would be more damage for Fotbola," said Pazilla.
He stressed that several years ago the name of Petta was written during the hearing of telephones during the corruption investigation, and Pette had been able to avoid the conviction.
"I don't know what the princes of Pellt's winning would be brought to football."
"And how we'd look at UEFA and FIFA's eyes," said Pazkick.
If Pazik wins on Thursday, he could present the cooperation with Peeltoa in the future.
This view is divided by another candidate, whose Palestine supported the whole meeting in September, which ends the Phoasco.
"He would be the first to whom I would turn."
'He's very powerful.'
"I can submit him to the head of the congregation."
"But he can't manage association."
'I'm not also in what I don't want,' said the Patch, who took a great number of attention to myself in September when I supported the removal of the court Brigade, entitled by Ludox Maceloy, which changed Dagmar Damascus.
The patch claims that it would risk the association to manage.
He refers to the experience of the management of private companies, and from the past year he managed the Flown team, which was leaving his first triumph in my league.
"I have the force to make a football environment change, support it to better."
"Deliver the influence of some groups of persons who have an impact on the disciplinary and appeal Council, which leads to the refreshing situations," said Pazlik, "when he does not cover his anti-personship, for example, the Director of Daniel Krjethtin.
One of its priorities will strengthen the relationship between the FADERR and the Tshirt Olympic Committee, with which it will be helped at the highest political level to select more money for sports from lottery collections.
"It's one of the key points to be taken by a new president."
"If the cracks are dealing with the craft games, as the political parties claims, I understand their arguments, but they must clearly state where the money will go," he said.
The patent does not consider its connection with the Blue Lensus club, although he claims that the President of the FA月R should be independent.
Peelta is related to Ibulonte, and Raychll with the Prosecutive Ducle.
"It's not an ideal option."
"And I don't see the meaning of my acts of the Flower Club at any other time I'm going to return there after six months," says Pazilla.
Petta promised the new rules of FA月R to avoid the chosen Path
During two days before the Middle Agency, one of the candidates in the President, Pelett had promised that if it had chosen, he would fight for the new rules of FA月R to avoid disputes in the future.
To negotiations in the Thursday, the Jablonian functioner remains optimistic and believes that the attention of the preventive fight will be reflected by the expected success of our football collection today.
To the short elections in September, Petta promised that if it was gained, it was focused on both the representation and the receipt of financial resources.
He decided to participate in elections at the last moment before the last meeting, and the two-month detention could therefore be useful for him to keep his ideas on football in a broader context.
"The people at all levels have been a football long, and they are waiting for the President to be known in Thursday."
"They feel that now is time to call somebody to the Association," said a person who is mainly linked to the Ibulian club, but he had a lot of years in the Department and the Executive Association Committee.
This gives him a reason to imagine that it is sufficiently experienced to manage the Chess football.
He believes that the current problems are named by Ironia, King in the period of Iwan Gashak.
"It's sorry, the rules which were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the general meeting in June."
"If different ways of representation were not adopted, we would have already been presidency since September," said Pelet.
It was referring to the key document of the Civil Association as a false goal for delegations.
"If I am President, I'll consider my personal task, and I'm going to take me personal responsibility if this attempt is unfair."
"It's a fundamental question without which we can't exist," said Pelet.
Besides this, he says that he does not try to select himself on the background of the fellows.
In the past, he already stated that he could present its cooperation with the Irish Rachhol, which he appreciates for the legal education; he fully recognizes the fact that his candidate partner should become his first vice-president.
He did not attack Thomas Pallick, who continued to criticize Peutt.
"It has been more than a year and has reached some success."
"How, his attacks were inaccessible, and many people were surprised the methods of his preferred campaign."
"Again, some of them now are sure of his true personality," said Pelett on his competition. "The same Peelt claims that he was faithful to the declarations that he declared in September.
He considers its main weapons to the knowledge of the football, from the low to the national collection.
The National Assembly should represent the whole football.
"I would also try to stop all the incidents, starting from the case of the gods, or the effect of the last year of the Corruption Scandal."
"Again, I would focus on negotiations with private and public sectors to ensure sufficient amounts of money for all the football," said the 40-year-old candidate.
He then promised that his election at the post of the Food Chapter would not be a voluntary staff.
"I need to know officers of individual staff's instructions." It was his letter of terror, where the inter-presentative period is a clear neglect.
Despite the present catastrophical scenarios that support the planned general congregation, he believes that the delegations will not have any harm in Hisburg.
"If the only controversy question -- how to take elections in the third round, we can do this."
"Fotter needs a trust that he can receive, just choosing the end of his leader," said Pelet, who remains optimistic for two days before the key day of his carrier.
Raychl promises that the FARENR will start actively to work
If at the Thursday of Yiddj Raychll, acting by the Vice-President, the Chairman of the Czech Fotobly Association, many people in the Association will be inevitable.
Raychl promises that if they choose it, it'll be a hard work time.
He wished to establish changes in the system and to make members of the Executive Committee responsible for individual areas in the football.
He also promised to address the problem of the gods; improve the relationship with UEFA and FIFA; bring more money to the football; and continue the work of the previous President, Ivan Gashak.
"Come President, I'd like to focus on a football in the whole."
"International contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to the national collection, professional football and football activities for youth."
"I don't mean what I'm doing to myself," said Rachel in my interview for the TK.
"I am a commanding player, and I want to distribute the powers in the Executive Committee so that each member has focused on specific areas."
"I'll make the tasks so that each of these fotbol segments make a great step forward."
"It will probably not like many people because it would mean hard work, but not just the critical of other work," he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement was preferably convinced in its candidature.
"O me know I'm working 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know whether there's any sense in this, and that I will not be around the people who lifted up my legs into the wheels and the ones who doubt me every step," he explained their doubts.
"It's all the way, many people told me that I shouldn't get down, others will come."
"It's a faith I can't leave," said he.
Moreover, he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gashak.
"The greatest number of jobs were done for these two years, and I don't want to resolve all this."
"When the starts of processes that may result in a few years, and I don't want someone else to stop them," said he, ensuring that if another candidate, Pelett, the peace will be elected, the situation in the Association could return to the one who was to Hashka.
"I believe in the systemic approach, and that's what the competent Mike Pelett does."
"It's an environment of people who would be a football so that he's only available for the chosen ones."
"I'll be accused, but it's not exactly in subjectivity."
"I'm trying to be objectible."
"I want to make a football available to each, because then all will take a good time, not only the chosen minority," said Rachel.
Furthermore, he asserts that he would be the President of Checa.
"That's a lot of people trying to say again, I'm planning to make a maximum for Mozambia."
"Emy, for example, time to think of the second line of the Chash and Mobile Parts, which gainers would continue to fight in the first line."
"There is preventing the current situation when there are only three mobile groups that are a problem for young players in Mozambia," said Rachel.
While the President's fight had introduced a manager club of the Flood Patch, Raychl is not encouraging to assess his chances of gain.
"I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected my Vice-President, and I see that I have reached some clear success," said Rachel. In his success, he will bring the economy of ten million krons on non-profit contracts, negotiations on television and negotiations on carrier law.
On the other hand, it is partly accused that the association is not one.
Acknowledged that Pellta was "exclused from the recruitment process to the Czech Fotbol," he considers another partner, the Palestinian, the strong candidate, which has the proposal.
"It can be sure that he was well working in Plezen in this year."
"If they choose it, I hope he will continue the beginning of Ivan Gashk, without significant personal changes in the committees."
"He wouldn't be looking for facts for his benefit," said Rachel about his fellow.
The most beautiful banks of Europe
Go to the water
Julia State
Child bacinos with universal wild optics and status bars in Budapes. Posients may try to get a incredible water in Europe and disappear the steel body after the excursion of the city or the provisions.
One book can tell you where the best water is.
Without one thing, Aris Merder couldn't be seen during his research trips last half of the year: without his buying coast.
She looked on the back in the water, looked up with a smoke-formed shot, springing to a mammoral cherubims waiting for it at the border of the Basin and loved fertilily restored flood bathrooms in the Ar-Nive style.
It was surprised to add each building's favorite bathroom with important details on the construction and the history of the building.
History of the Architectur architectural Mediterraneo has reviewed more than 200 navigative banks, and now she has collected in its recently published Bad Efreuden book, the acquisition, where all came from the public banks in Munich to the historical Building palaces in the Black Forest and the "Fodal Bitonic buildings" in Tauwan.
Its "paid in Central Europe" has been through 13 countries. Besides Germany, Australia and Switzerland, she visited buyers in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Poland, and one city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year author is the true acquiring culture enthusiaste.
She tries very little intuition for sports, says Merder, but in water all the other.
The only lack of flood worshipers must be peaceful with a blue coffee plate and hot chlore, while the flighters can throw in a smoke of silver forests or listen to the joyful cheric birds in the park.
"Today I asked me why the floods must always be so terrible," said the Vienna Merder.
"So I began to gather the beautiful baths."
When the surface duplicates Architecture
The grounds and oils in the sauna- health factor in the buyers are thus meaning that Merder is all of the feelings.
And the floods may be true pleasure for eye if the builders take such a job.
"The surface is very transparent, but also reflects the beauty of all the buildings."
Everything is brightly reflected: high pools, colorful flowers and tramps.
On 190 pages, the illustrate "Reality of Building" publication contains a precious information about the architecture and cultural health history - and you wish to push in water.
Meder's water collection collector found a few exhibitors during the research in Hungary.
It found a rich water nitrots in the corte powder (Fourry Building in Mishкольc-Tapolis) and a topic bathroom filled with water in the building built in the form of bottles (Városi Termalifürdö in Jasern), and great thermotic purchases such as the 100-year buyer of the Seattle in Buapeas.
There are many open open banks in Switzerland and Australia, on the other hand, a huge appearance. You can see the whole Business of the pool, or consider the locked Arlberg from the open bathroom in Sankt Antone. And there's a park that can see a window coming on the back.
Maybe the most unnecessary design is waiting for buyers in Langenfold, and the Aqua-school in Etthale looks like NLO, just the landscape in Alpah.
The winter of it is a couple of three open raccovins, which are fully small on the background of the Estotal mountains.
Algary in Shawnwald
The Bassian Merder wasn't in each bathroom of choro.
Many of the term samples will cut a grieve, and the Kupals named Arrangs in Beckishba are so much stolen with a nut that you might be easy to believe you're in a healthy source.
The water is almost black from the hair, which comes to the hair when you're loading in the baceine - a healthy experience of a certain type.
Aris Merder, however, at a certain time she was discovered in her search for a beautiful place to buy. When she tried to visit the open chess buyer in Lukas, she discovered that the territory was opened.
The Kupalians, proposed by the Dushan Southern Architek in 1902, were closed.
When Merler looked at the appearances of the windows of a red-wheel white building in the ar-neven style, she saw the rocks growing between the coffee plates.
One of the places where the destruction has been stopped by the warming follows, a wonderful navigation bathroom in Svarzwald - the Term Water Torre in Bad Wildbad.
The Basiyans have already passed three stages of construction. You will find not only non-romany elements after the building in 1844 but also the Morithan Hall in the Algamby style added about 1900.
After a warm reconstruction in 1995, the Terreal Palace is the lovely flying baceine of the Bassin Aris Merder, not only because it was a species of Svartwald.
"It's a real achievement -- so masterics to assemble these different architecture styles," says Merder.
In the term bathroom, it is clearly an increased employment in this palace.
Agricultural Production Speculation
Doce Bank will investigate the trade of agricultural product.
Christian Tivs
Will Doeche Bank stop trade in agricultural product?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Jozef Akkerman, the Working Group, has made a task to investigate the impact of shocking for the poor in the world.
The Executive Director plans to change in January.
Gamburg -
For German citizens, the situation is clear. According to one study, 84 per cent of the Germans believes that banks are inadequate that agricultural production, such as wheat and cucuross.
Third payments require Dojich Bank and other banks to stop the trade of agricultural production, since trade affects poor people in the world.
The findings were carried out in research by the Institute of Social Research and Statistics Forsa from the Foodwatch Prosecutors organization.
Research is based on the report submitted by Foodwatch in middle October.
The report author, Harald Shawman, shows that the playing playing of world-keeping goods is higher than prices and banks, so part of the world of hunger.
The campaigns of consumers' interests are directly against the Head of Dojich Bank Yoezf Ackerman, although large bank houses, such as Hodman Sax and Morgan Stanley, are the same.
It was important that trade protection was considered as a means for collective prices.
The most experts are now agreed that the players have rejected the proposals and requests, and have been used by the poorest.
On the other hand, Akkerman answered the critical and promised to investigate the accused and stated that no trade is " is not worthy to cause the risk of the good reputation of Doek Bank."
In accordance with SPIEGEL ONLINE, the international working group is currently investigating the accused contained in the Foodwatch report.
Research should be completed until the end of the year when the results will be submitted to the Office of Directors of Down Bank, with recommendations to action.
The Chapter of the Bank is then planning to announce the changes followed by investigation at the end of January.
The traffic can decline or completely stop.
Akkerman's working on his immatics.
The Chairman Foodwatch Tilo Bode has discussed news, underlined its critical relations to the financial sector. " Foodwatch Tilo, who has been enhanced by the fact that the banks now act against common interests."
As the main bank lobby in Ackerman is a certain responsibility, according to Bod.
"Dich Bank must remove all investments that make money shipment to food prices," said Bod.
"It's not important to say about hungers or the republication of Dojk Bank."
The close response of the Akkerman first is surprised, but the Director would like to have an absurd emisor throughout a few months before the end of his stay in the office.
Dake Bank declared on Monday that the Chairman would not go to the observatory Council as planned.
Acknowledge the shocking sports on the market of food products could improve it.
He must not also be careful about expenditures with the consequences of his predecessor.
Every second would be rejected from investment in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure to the manager.
Today, more than 30,000 users have been joined to the organization campaign.
The research was published on Tuesday. Research was carried out for the Institute of Social Research and Statistics Forsa 7 and 8 November and 1001 people participated.
Not more than eleven per cent believes that investments that make food prices are acceptable for Dake Bank.
Many bank clients would also take concrete steps if they found that their banks are involved in such trade and that each second would have the contributions that are finally produced to the sake of goods.
43 per cent recommended that the bank would be departed, 49 per cent said they consider the closure and transfer to the other bank.
Head of the 21th century in Vienna
Paulion in a new place
Ingeborg Vienna
The architectural story with volcanoes, falls and happinesses. Paulus Australia for the World Exhibition of 1958 in Brussels became a museum in Vienna, was desolated and protected.
It is now revealed as a set-up center.
Popilion Australia, proposed by Karl Schwanzer for World Exhibition in Brussels in 1958, is a well-known example of the modern afternoon architecture with its simple forms of steel holes that expressed faith in technical progress.
Powellon Swancera made a Gran-pres on Architecture in 1958 for its easy buildings of become and steel.
The building is considered in the modern architecture.
This was made by the architect that he also built the Popilion of Austria in the next World Summit.
Finally, he was glorified to the world in 1973, his four -  legendar bathroom of BMW and her sister as a cup form.
Paulion, planned as a building for temporary exhibitions, was transferred to the Swiss garden around the South Coast of Vienna, transformed and opened as Museum the 20th century, and often mentioned as "The Day of the 20th century" for this reason.
The building did not approach technical and space museum, there was no walls on which an art could be made and bad conditionalization of air could be made.
However, it continued to be used until the modern art in Vienna had received a new house.
The house was disappeared since 2001, and his situation was worse and worse.
The architect Adolph Cristinat has now arrested Paulin, who was called "The 21th century" and will be used as a modern art museum.
This museum is the Museum of Belarus, which will open the first exhibition on Tuesday, in all meanings of a joyful event.
Agnes Housslain-Arco, who became a new director of Australian Gallery in 2007, has contributed to the new beginning.
Huslain-Arco, the Faculty of the History of Arts History with a smoothy Figurist in the youth who worked in Sotheby's museum, Guggenhaim and, in the end, became the Foundation and Modern Museum in Westburg, overseered policies and conservators to continue reconstruction, brought public resources and private gifts and decided how to be used.
The new museum had to be put into the permanent exhibition of the Frère Webruba, Caffee and book shops at the time of the art, and the official building should be built.
Strategic control and limited budget
The Cristal was then an ideal candidate for the implementation of the project.
He was recognized by the restoration and enlargement of the Vienna Sexton Joefa Olbriha, and he won the competition, but he was also learned at the Vienna University of the University of Vienna, and Pavilon was "exclusively important place" where he visited the exhibition "in each week".
He knew the initial design and knew the challenges set before the building, the building, which had already lost part of his magnificence and easy when it was transferred to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that have occurred in the last reconstruction have been far more serious, and the building was the “populator of energy”, says Christmas.
The window profiles on the stackfast were replaced, a rocked safe steel was inserted, and the stack cancer was replaced by a highly safe steel.
The main translations of the thermal monster are disabled or replaced, and the office was elected from the boxes.
Two underground camps have created space for the new building, the shining light corner between the building and the roads, practically a new building, but still the Swancer powder powder.
The original outdoor doors were stored and the building was abolished in an old red-country color of protection against the core.
Hell's just like that was before.
All these are in close control of museum management and limited budget.
"We were often to find the material that was a good, delicate, and would be approved by the museum manager," said Cristinat, showing the unrealised ground.
The building remained deep and easy, despite restrictions, problems and conversion.
The Cristinant noted recently that the powder of Brucele was a huge - typical story of the "capital in the city".
This architecture is not always on his own place, but does not, however, want to "promote this knowledge."
The 21th century house is located in a very right place, since the town planning has occurred an unexpected success. The reconstruction of the main vacuum, with offices and unmountness grows around the Swiss garden.
The second successful event may happen. The 21th century home may be completed by the second building of the Cristina, the French Foundationer of Gabsburg, acquire the Temporary Galle of Berlin, and, as reported, he conducts negotiations with the city on its neighbourhood in the Swiss garden.
Deutsche Bahn plans a multi-million winter anticritical package
Deutsche Bahn renewed an anti-crisis plan to avoid the removal of the winter.
The number of staff must be increased by two.
The expenditures are millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will pay more than 70 million euros in this year to avoid winter renewment and travel.
On the internal anticrisis plan, Deutsche Bahn reports that a total amount of EUR 300 million has been planned until 2015.
Investment is designed to improve local and iron network capacity, even in extreme veterinary conditions.
The number of own and attracted staff operated in the snow box with road and platform will be increased by twice to 16,000.
The aim is to purify the platforms from the snow and mild until the start of the work and 90 per cent of the needed arrows from four to five hours.
Head of Deutsche Bahn announced the possibility of cancellation and relaxing the winter trip to meet the Government leaders and industry two months ago.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn tried to significant difficulties with the passenger transport because she was not missing reservations at the decrease of the погодal conditions.
Many of the new regional travels were waiting for the approval of the Federal Railway Service.
There were also certain delays from ICE travelers.
The Germane Bahn has also been very frequently to check the ICE trains as one of the ICE trips was on the main in Camelne.
Dominica Bank will pay a lot of millions of dollars in the United States
New troubles were followed by the concerns around Joseph Akkerman, the Director-General of Dojich Banca: Duke Bann has a lot of millions of sterlinders in the United States.
According to Doeche Banc, there were some problems on the family that had been passed by the past of the industrial eruption in the United States. The Duke Bank of the Square Chamber in France will pay $145 million to the rest of the disputes which have come after banking during the financial crisis, five major credit Unions.
The problem occurred around sales of ipothetic pollutions.
The National Fisheries Management (NCUA), financial regulator, accuses a number of major banks that they used false promises to put credit Unions to buy their financial products.
The cost of the disappearances has disappeared during the financial crisis and has led down credit Unions.
"We are glad you have decided this problem without treatment of the parties in the court," said the representative of the Down Bank in New York.
The Bank has not recognized its fault.
The same thing is for Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
The President of NCUA Debbby Mattz welcomed the operational reaction of both banks.
The National Fisheries Management (NCUA) is responsible for the US credit Union and is involved in banking processes to protect consumer contributions.
NCUA is fighting for the compensation of loss from milliards.
This is the first agreement of such kinds.
The regulatory also emphasized the other largest banks and year-olds against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Independent ipothecs are the prices of the papers provided by the ipotectical loans.
They are strengthened by internal business.
This decided to be a number of financial companys when the in-smoking market was led to the United States in 2007.
The American Investment Bank Lehman Brothers made a long time to live in September 2008 on a green financial crisis.
A few years later, the banks in the United States still fight.
Investers and regulators have made a large number of claims to pay compensation or to charge the offenders.
The Federal Fund for Women's Financing (FHFA).
It is accused of 18 larger international banks that they have obtained in the American credit organizations Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac loan agreements about $200 billion.
The Duke Bank is also addressed to the threat of prosecution by the FHFA in terms of numerous general value agreements of $14.2 billion between 2005 and 2007.
The regulatory requires that the bank with the Headquarter in France is responsible for the "privary losses" but did not yet indicate an accurate amount.
Doke Bank rejected the claim as unrecognised and reported the intention of resolve them.
Worren Baffite contributes 10 billion to IBM
The Finance Gourn Baffet is actively investing in IBM IT.
Since March, he bought a total amount of $10 billion.
The largest American investor, Warren Baffeth, has always declared that it does not invest into computers and IT-company, since their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, the annual report IBM changed its opinion on investment in this sector.
According to Baffet, he had to be aware of that IBM first offers services and buys computer systems for other company departments.
In the financial world, the investment of Urin Baffet was estimated as a series of actions.
IBM, Winter of IT roads, has now received a title "Sir IBM".
In the interview of the CNBC Business Telecanal, the Bafetet reported that since March he received IBM actions at $10.7 billion.
His investinghold Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest IBM-activists from 5,5 per cent.
Baptite said that even IBM had not known anything about his participation last time.
He commended the manager that could be reached even during the financial crisis.
"They have done a great job," said Baffeth, in the meaning of the manager strategy.
The significant time of IBM was focused on such high IT services as date centres.
The computer officer, which has been proposed for more than 100 years, offers extra programme security and advice, as well as business-based computers.
Bathet has fled from technology.
He said he's only investing in the company that he understands.
and investors, for example, in iron furniture vehicles, in the production of symmetry materials and in the vehicle.
His Holding Berkshire Hathaway has a long list of larger companies, such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (related Municher), along with about 80 own daughter companies.
A 81-year-old acquired a small textile company of Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and made it one of the biggest world companies.
His image of life, however, remained modest,
He made it a peasant figory for unnumbered investors around the world.
He's almost unrealised instinct in the money makes him the name "Oracula from Omahi".
The cost of IBM actions has increased to one per cent before the opening of markets after the advertisement of Baffet investments.
"Gugant" as still called IBM, stands on the foundation board more than $220 billion, which makes it one of the biggest high-technological world companys in front of Apple and Microsoft.
But Bathet said it wasn't going to invest in Microsoft.
She's the founder Bill Gates is his close friend.
Uniqued danger
The Turkish SMEs have been suspected in the law authority in Germany.
One of the newspaper speaks of the "search ideology," which is now re-examining the surface.
The murder of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 have been the result of the right extermist idea.
The fear and concern of this communication in Turkey and the German Turkish community.
For many towers in Germany, this news had been forgotten for a long time for fear, and such legal attacks on Turkish have not been since the bonds in Melon in November 1992 and in Zulene in May 1993.
There was never any doubt, however, that xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the now discovered legalism network has such a scale that is not fully recognized.
"Creation of blood ideology?" was the title of the Internet version of the Haberturk journal.
On the other hand, the Bay Saha notes that one of the offenders was a secret adviser of secret services, and expresses concern that German authorities may have been invented in the law-extremist pain.
The Turkish community in Germany (TGD) was quiet, reacting the victims of racial hatred a silenced piquet against the Brendanburg gates in these outcomes.
A week ago, the Turkish Berlin community at the ceremomony with the participation of German and Turkish policies noted the fifteenth anniversary of the Dual Trade Agreement on the most working force.
Cooperation between two countries was submitted in a positive light as a history of success.
In some Turkish SMEs, it was a ground. "The Provision from Germany for the Fifty Year" is the name of one of the articles on the Internetport "Haber X", the commenting circumstances of the murder series.
The German publication of the Uruguay was also allowed to conduct this parallel.
It's the name of the Ahmet Kolachji column.
He notes that people who have been killed have been paid and their work have made significant contributions to the transformation of Germany.
The conduct of the police and the successful area has been a clear crisis on German-turn forums.
The authors asked the question why the German authorities had not thought before to follow suspected persons in the legalism rounds.
Some authors have reached a quite straight straight rictory. "If they will continue to operate in the same way, migrants will not be another choice, except an armed self-employed."
"It'll be the best selfborn."
"Mir in Germany is very depending on how to be covered the whole network and the justice of punishment," says "Selen."
The meetings in Melena and Saling in the 1990s were an example of the danger of the peace in Germany.
The photograph of confronted roads in Zalling was deeply relaxed in the memory of the German and the tower.
No other event has been so evidently shown by the Turks here that they have been dangerous, but the Germans -- that infection and equality could be effected in real violence.
However, these crimes have increased the feelings of the turt unit.
Do not repeat past errors
The Turkish press during that period condemned primarily the allegations of the German police after attacks.
He sent to the telegram of patients by the President of Turkey after the jacket to Zulena, but participating in the memory ceremonium in Kelen, he adopted him Minister of Foreign Affairs Claus Kikel - Kickel in his words underlined the burdens that Turkish pay in Germany,
He just defined the value of a person by the taxes that he payed.
The recent light in Turkish SMEs revealed how the incredification of many German tunnels to the current German State has been degraded.
It is clear that it is necessary to do now, not only in the efforts to identify and revitalize the legal terrorist organizations in Germany.
Banca Scandal on the Turkish Ocean
Most risked banking policies are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
The UBS has not been announced during the financial crisis and has soon been fighting with one, the other crises.
Now you're going to get him back to the faithful course, the German.
Alex Weber probably didn't be sure he would have this role.
In July, after its effect of the duty of head of the Federal Bank, it was declared that in 2013 he would start at least an effective post - President of the Board of the Directors of the Great Swiss Bank; an unexpected and unprofit carrier course.
Alex Weber was evidently in terms, glorifying Switzerland for her beauty, UBS for the re-explaned pureness and made a few friendly comments in the address of his future colleagues.
"UBS has been able to change to better."
"I'm waiting for an opportunity to work with Camper Philigger and Oswald Griebel."
But already in September, it was clear that all would be very different.
The UBS Trader was overcome the bank security system and lost approximately $1,7 million.
The Executive Director of UBS Oswald Hurbell, banker not only known in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the President of the UBS Board is considered sick, and all want to know, when will Alex Weber finally come to his post?
Webber must consult the bank since February 2012.
And, as the Bank said in Friday, the Chairman of the Council will already take place in May and not in 2013.
It's not easy for Alex Weber.
He is a professor of the economy and a specialist of the Centre, not a traditional banker, and he is unfortunately needs time for adapting.
It was immediately responsible for the Bank Strategy, which revealed that it had been called the "Band Scandal in Europe for long time."
The UBS, on the one hand, has been very large to recently managed by the world's largest activities, and does not go out of scandles.
It seems that the fiery Swiss bank does not hurt anything.
All started during the financial crisis.
Before 2007, UBS was a great reputation.
The Bank has connected a hidden and sustainable image, but in the same time a manager-managing activities with immigrant objectives and efforts to become the larger player in investment banking.
In 2007, UBS has managed 1,6 billion, so in the management of more status clients than any other bank in the world,
and as an investment bank entered into the world's larger banks.
That was impressive.
Hans Hager, the former banking officer and professor, who has long translated to the University of the Bank Affairs, explains: "I have always introduced my students to the UBS as a former of a good bank."
"I know what we know now, you can ask how I could like to mistake."
He really mistaked.
Only in 2007 it was clear that something in the UBS was not wrong.
In the middle of the year, the executive Director Peter Wolfly, who considered the extension of the intellectual and the flexibility banker, was unexpectedly departed.
A few months later, we could imagine why he went away.
The Bank's investment unit has been attempted to play in substantive price papers and has been required to write milliards.
Do you want to believe that you wouldn't, but UBS reported that the capital increased by 13 billion Swiss francs to oppose the crisis.
The Bank was indeed intended to find investors - but investors from which many bankers would have been recently rejected - one very untransparent Asian Sovereign Fund from Singapore and a sovereign Arab Fund is so hidden that even the name of it was not reported.
It was just the first slaughter.
In April 2008, it was much worse.
The Bank was to announce new billion losses and the Chairman of the Directors of Marsel Ossel, the second payment level of the Chairman of the Directors in Switzerland, in 2006, was delayed.
In October 2008, a catastrophe was attacked. Since the lack of investment during the UBS financial crisis was made before the damage and the State had to save it.
The National Bank has bought to the UBS to suspicious billion cards, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for the conversion of the obligatory conversion to become bank officer.
The whole Switzerland was in shock: the country had recognized the dramatic consequences of the fact that large banks were in the small country.
Finally, UBS final balance was five times more than all Switzerland production (see graphs).
"We can't save UBS at the second time," says the bank Analysis Higer.
The second catastrophe came shortly after the first.
A few months after the UBS was hired in a dispute with the United States and stated that it was ready to transmit the state clients who might be able to leave the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million from the remuneration of non-related income from the business, more than $780.
UBS therefore recognized more or less that it was an instrument of disappearance.
At the same time, UBS lost his privilege in combating rich clients — an overseer of secretity.
After this, the Swiss bank secret was no longer the same thing before.
The Executive Director and Chairman of the Directors of the Governors were delayed after this, and
The result of the clients started.
Over a few months, the bank has lost confidence on both main directions of its investment because of unfair skills and the management of assets resulting in help and promotion of disappearances.
And it was just quiet, and it was shown that UBS was able to overcome the situation as this was with a treasurer. One one trainer left 1.7 billion euros before the bank noted that something was not okay.
One is the risk management in the investment office until it is not working.
"Abbeoli's Institute has clearly shown that the risk control has not been changed," said Martin Janessen, professor of the economy and financial institutions in the Swiss Bank Institute of the University of Survey.
The Finance Director of one of the largest German banks is also concerned: "UBS work is that he has no risk control tool. "
It was long careful that the Swiss bankers had made by the largest world-active warrants - not a decrease, but the security of money, without dependence of whether the peace was disappeared outside the Alpine Republic or not yet.
The Swiss bank selfs have become a symbol of uncertain confidence, such as Lindt and Sprengli are symbolized in chocolate.
The UBS apartment in Turkey is still the image of the worthy of the Swiss private bank, but it is a little more.
It's the place itself classic.
The Main Bank office is situated in Turkey in Banhofstras, which leads from the main vacuum directly to the Turkish island, in the environment of the Swiss Swiss Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are smooth, and the shipment for stores is one of the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss swiss store stores, you can find such legal firms like Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been distributed here hundreds of years from the National Bank to the Cross Suis and the Elit Private Banks, such as Julius Berer.
The close door is on the UBS driver.
The ground of the wall covered by the wall stands greatly amazing stars, and a large season with the emblometic bank.
UBS knows what his clients need, hope.
But both the largest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Swiss, at some moment, refused the Swiss opinion on the bank-related affairs, or, as the head of one of the small Swiss banks, were delivered them.
He wouldn't want to see his name in the newspaper - as all the Swiss bankers, it also cooperates with two larger banks.
He believes that UBS became too large, especially in investment banking, where it is very active in English.
He thinks that Swiss has nothing added here to the Swiss.
"And if there's something that means, they've been adapted to English. "
In fact, such as the English Investment Banking changed the UBS and brought him the first greatest arrivals - and then Fiaco. Nobody other European financial Institute has lost so much money in the jungles of substantive activities as the largest Swiss bank.
Catastrophe became manifest on 15 October 2008.
"In the middle of the legal coalition of a small country with a population in seven million, a larger rescue operation in the history of the country," says Lucas Hesssig in his book of Cart of UBS.
Politicians agreed the selection of 68 billion Swiss francs (only 45 billion euros) to save the bank from banking.
How could it come to it?
If you ask the Swiss banks, they will say that the problem is mainly in the UBS size.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks were joined to one large group in June 1998.
There was a bank that was already too large for the small Switzerland, and the bank who continued to grow.
This helped both UBS banks complement each other.
Internationalized investment banks have received access to the large amount of money that they could use to cut the whole wheel.
Two names are related to the growth of UBS: Peter Wolfly, the Executive Director of the UBS Group from 2001 to 2007 and Marcel Ossel, Chairman of the Directors.
"I've always seen that Walfly and Ospel is the dream team," says the bank Analytic Hans Hager.
"Wulfly, who takes out the intellectual, humble and deep understanding models and statistics, and Ossel and his internal institution who went over the way up, starting from the bank's stage."
But Ossel finally put on Walfly.
"He decided that his models were reality," said Jeger.
"It's tragic."
Maybe it's tragic.
Earliness is prevailing to beat.
UBS servants are well remembering the government meetings on which Walfly had always repeated the same lounge to raise Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At that time, he called the "Tower Table" where bank success was made.
UBS wished to come to the top of this table.
He could get part of this way.
The UBS was the largest player in the trade of monetary and public price papers.
The full management advisers, however, indicated a low place. As a parameter called "permanent income", UBS was far behind the largest banks.
The UBS was slow in American isote products.
The UBS was bound to an autumn who had no life.
In ensuring growth, the bank itself and its chage-phone invested in the United States substantive papers.
This has been developed in a large mechanism that has assembled the prices based on American Empathy credits and sold them further by continuing risks.
Even when other banks have been looking for a way to get out of this process, the UBS has not stopped.
"UBS has pushed up to the year 2007 when the American non-mobility market was already in fire," said the bank analytics.
The growth above is more deeply.
One manager for others had to go as an attempt to make the bank's order was harder than the first time.
The potatoes in the UBS have turned into child game with stories and have remained hatred until the present day.
Before any one who calls this huge bank, it is almost impossible.
He must find a bank strategy which returned back to all existing business models.
The Gager’s bank Analysis has already the idea to reject investment banking, to foster asset management and forget their Swiss corns.
But the bank isn't ready to go so far.
Nevertheless, it is clear that investment activities need to be crucial.
The new chapter of the Sergeo Ermôti bank plans to submit its future strategy on Tuesday.
51-year-old the Swiss bank was in fact considered only as a timely decision when the bank was unexpectedly distributed with his former Uruguay.
During the past, he was delighted to show the character and now, as the Turkish Bank has stated in the Sunday, the UBS is constantly mandated.
Earnotti plans to reduce the investment bank to the status in which he was within the mid-90s.
It increases 3 500 workplaces.
But that's not enough.
UBS needs development concept.
What's UBS?
How does he plan to buy money?
This is probably the question of Axel Weber.
He has only said that they're looking for a apartment in Turkey.
The next year.
Received in Europe will be down the United States Funding Bank
The reception in Europe has disappeared the establishment of American investors at the beginning of the week.
The change of Governments in Athens and Rome did not have great effect.
In the case of industrial production at the continent, the hope that a long crises could be overwhelmed in the degradant.
The general solution, pursuant to the changes of Governments in Rome and Athena, did not have been strengthened.
Euro was caught with the dollar.
Last week the Italian and Greek stakee were still considered full, and not a half empty -- but now the problems are again gone again at the first plan," said Mark Lucien from Janney Mongomery Scott.
Finance banks, inter alia, were settled in the lists of sales.

Mass murder - Human Dimension
The pressed and very good new book of Peter England: the personal history of the First World War, starts with a long list of the acting persons whose heart dies.
This is the advice, how to read the following: Take carefully on this page and use it as a bookmark.
You'll meet these people very closely as Mr. Angelnd advice, and this list of acting persons will be your GPS, your master at the moment that, like one of these men and women, you're going to get out of the way and you're lost in the dark war.
Mr. England, Swedish History and journalists.
It is also a new permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, who condemns the Nobelpremium on literature.
The book he's written now, it's uncertainly, it's described it, quite exactly, as "the anti-story work."
It had little known names, important treaties or marked battle; there is almost no mess, magazine journalists or discussions of tactics and war technologies.
It is not so much of the book of what was, he explains how many "the book of what it was like."
The book "Creat and tribute" has been military experienced 20 more or less than inconsistent men and women, both the frontlines, from schools and students to alpinists, doctors, drivers and servants.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Someone falls in captivity, lose hand or feet, go down or die.
Their life are measured here as the churches: news are added to many others, and some are now caught.
Mr. England's book is the standard of history books.
This is the amendment to the presentation that the first world war was only a hard war at the Western front.
“The Red and tribulation” may provide the master of other military theaters: Alp, Balkan, Eastern Great, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldier in this book falls clues; one of them meets the Birthday in Egypt; the uncircumcised problem is a painful body.
It's an exciting book, almost since the beginning.
The war covers the lives of these people as a natural catastrophe, such as the Uran Catrin, who has an immoral push.
When you heard the canonada, you're a woman and you're at home with your kids, will you stay in a place or escape?
Or else who's going on?
No one knows what's going on, and it's why we have to fight in this war.
"Inadequate of facts," said Mr. Angeln, "a compliance with addictions, proposals, hopes, fears, associated ideas, theories of the debate, dreams, chambers and listening."
"Cravita and trouble" depends on the courts of people such as Florence Farmboro, the English sister in Russian Army, and Richard Stumpf, the young Dutch Sea of the Open Sea.
Their stories are mainly implemented by the memours, letters and other materials already published.
The talks of their lives may be horror or exciting, but they are higherly living thanks to Mr. England with small points and details.
Many of them are about loss and how to do with them.
He says the history of the German school, "Erzac, all the arzs."
"Substituted Aluminium, non-continencies, bummy bands, trees of potatoes."
He continues to tell you about the borrower in Germany.
He describes the "masse of the pressumed quality of the grain in the barn (and the false corner made from the trees), the taffee made of soil corns and the soft card card; the bowl that was shot by the trees.
It notes that there were "837 registered substitutors of the flesh allowed for the production of the coffee, 511 registered substitutors."
Some stories say about honor and respect.
One of the Americans notes its own burden to the cruelness and said about war: "You feel that finally, it is why men have been created, not to sit in a proper stiff with cigarettes and glass, a party of newsletter or a free segmenter, and to say that this show is civilization and under your narrowed rubbers is not covered. "
The British soldier notes that he would more die, and no one will not note it and will be disappointed.
"When a man's married with the thought of self-offer, he would like to think that's going to happen before the public," he writes.
But it's, it's a horror like a "congressed man who is hidden."
Other comments relate to the old Europe, which is disappeared and to new forms of fear.
"Conflikt has become more economic orphant," Mr. Angeln writes, "military charges."
He notes the coming of the one who calls "the new form in the season of the beginning of the world: a beautifully expressed and ideally convinced murder of the Mass murder in a good scene of the cosme that holds the ring, sitting at the written table."
People do not precisely: low actions are as much as heroism.
Mr. England told the soldiers who were always trying to support the prostitution of the winner disease in order to avoid service on the front.
"Sum Great expression can be seen in the trade of a horizon that soldiers bought and dismanted himself on genetaries in hope of a hospital fall," he writes.
"That's all those who felt him in the eyes, which often brought to the sweat."
The Swedish Prime Minister Greece was deeper, but it is a nicely approach to his homanist task.
In the tens of small walls, he shows how the war has been freed completely uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.
People start asking why their leaders are forced to fight them.
The best books on I World War of the World were often unrelated as the Great War and Contemporary Memory of Paul Fassale, or such as "In the Western front without change" Erichia Remarque, not an extensiving historical work.
Mr. Angeld's book enters into this unfair master.
His book has the most amazing pinal, which I can remember in a no-literature literature.
I'm not gonna tell him.
But it was just out of the book to the page with the personal list, he cut it out of your hands and throws it out of your hand.
Following previous error, a fairly calculated ride
There were hundreds of police officers, some in protected schools.
The new hours from Sunday for Sunday have been selected because in Zukott-Parket had to be less than all people.
The operation was in secret of all, except a number of high officers, the other first said that they were going to learn.
Commissioner of police Reymond U. Kelly was in the center of events, and his presence stressed how many values had been made by the Department of Police.

"The only ones who knew they're going to Zukott Park were the highest posts in the department."
One of the reasons of secretity was a lesson that led the city.
On 14 October, the authorities wished to purify the park, but turned from the hundreds of protesters who had disappeared inside before the appointed time.
In the Tuesday, staff of various police offices, including forces from the neighbouring forces, who usually used to control criminal areas.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost at work, are coming and get out of the park during the day that makes one hour of the night approaching time for the offence.
"Only it was to do when the park is less than all the people," he said.
The saving machines with the prosecutors and the high speakers were gathered to Paik-Slip and France Roosevelt-Draw, near the Manhattan Most Forwards.
The prosecutor and the recently recorded statements from the high speakers seemed to be removed by many protestants.
When the officers of the administrative units entered into their black winds, many protesters simply gathered their things and left.
The police reported that the cops had not triggered up to 1:45 night by giving the protest time to gather things.
Other police groups, according to the testimony, were gathered by a perimeter to enter into the case of arrests in the park.
The journalists in the park were delayed to leave.
Paul J. Brown, representative of the Chapter of the Police Department, said that it was made for their security.
But many journalists claim that they have not been able to see the police and that the police were worsely turned to them.
Mr. Brown said that the cars with the telecams on the Quarch Street, far from the West Park border, could take the picture.
When the police went to the West through the brain of personal protestants, including the weights, the plastics and the polyethics, full clothes, the Sanitary Department's teams followed, collecting what was taken.
Some of the protesters who refused to go out, pushed up the road, the photographs of this in the Internet came soon.
The main group of protesters took position around the kitchen camp, in the center of the park.
Some have made barricudes and the police entered inside, methodically arresting them.
Besides 10 people in the epicentre of the camp were shot together by hands.
And two people touched themselves to the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
In order to cut the locks, they were requested by rescue officers.
No park arrests were held about 3:30 p.m., said Mr. Kelly.
The police reported about 75 minutes.
Mr. Brown said about 142 persons were arrested in the park.
The majority was arrested for "unlawing the public order and resistance at the detention," he said.
The highest officer was Josef J. Esposto, head of the Department and Chiefs of Appeal at the Department.
Phil. T. Polash, head of the police of the sponsor, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, although he was present, "not managed the operation," said Mr. Brown.
The second group of the police was expected to be at the eastern part of Broadway, between Liberia Street and Sierrar Street, if necessary to enter inside.
The borders were set to Cortland Street, to the north of the park, and to Pain Street, to the south.
The observers saw the police extended a perimeter even further beyond the border of Zukott-Part.
At one moment, observers saw a group of police, many of the shots, who were disappeared to people.
It was about 28 people in the north’s Perimetre.
Some of the most serious events of the night came to the south of the park.
On the fiveth morning to the south of Pain Street, one of the protestants pushed on the crowd of the police machine, and others, according to the views, had escaped the air from the sex of the police.
Another moment from the bucket flighted the farmer's pocket.
One police and one of the protestants had been studied.
The training of the school staff will provide a city for release
The prosecutor, representing hundreds of school staff who have lost the place in the past month, planned to put the court into the middle of the city, claiming that losses were not required and discriminatory because of non-proportional impact on the school, where poor students are learned.
Judicial proceedings are likely the last means available by the Environmental Council of 37 seeking to cancel.
Sixty-seven and two school officers, the coordinator with parents and other officials who were among the lowest employees in the city, lost their places on 7 October because the leaders of the prosecutors had called political impact on their refusal to the city of access to health funds managered by the working groups to close the budget of the last afternoon.
The city officers categorieally rejected the accused.
In the hearings of the Governing Council in the past month, the Consortler of the School of Daniel M. Walcott said that the releases were part of the budget they signed in June.
One of the members of the Council was shared, told him that there was no way in the budget that the subsidiary staff would be deleted.
Representatives 37 of the Environmental Council reported that they had been sent to a notification on claims, announced that the Department of Education was against it; the Press Conference will be held in the middle of the Press Conference to announce the formal salary in the Supreme Court of State in Manhattan.
Mr. Walcott and the Department of Cities Education will be reported as a response to the respondents, and eight timely authorized workers are all black or Latin American women, such as most of those who have lost their places.
Elizabeth Thomas, the representative of the legal department of the city, said that the city had not seen the Country and therefore could not comment it with specific provisions.
In accordance with the preliminary version of the complaint shown in New York Times, the prosecutor focused on a number of free schools in poor cities to support the claim of unfair treatment, declaring that poor schools have lost more officers because they are chronicly unfeed.
He pointed out that 17 subsidiary schools were lost in the area of 23 in Brinsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were going to Ocrogah 8 and 9 to South Bronx.
Noteing the loss of five of the eight school officers working in Harlem, in which 68 per cent of students live in poverty, said: "There are not the stated parents who can find money to fill the budget."
P.S. Budget 36 was estimated to 3,26 per cent in this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the basis of additional funding for each poor student who was at school.
The Professional Committee also claims that the Director of School could be denied by the notification that allows the release of coordinators to work with parents.
The notification used the word "exclusion", although more often said that the teacher of the school is moved into the list of available workers that pay the central office.
"Six-six-six coordinators on the work with the parents have been retained," said the black ish, "and they were not just moved."
Mission ended, Congress is ready to the Libya Agreement
It seems that the Republics and Democrates at the Café Colume are finally ready to agree on a relationship with the resurrection in Lebanon.
Everything that was needed is to disappear, the former disaster Mumar Caddafi was hired and killed, and the American interaction was completed.
On Tuesday, the Senate Committee of Foreign Affairs should consider the resolution issued by President John Kerry (Democracy, Massachusets) together with Senators of John McKyein (Republic, Arzion) and Joseph I. Liberia (independent, Connect), which commends the Olives for the pleasant resurrection and the American Military for " Ombuds".
"The meaning of this resolution is to establish respect for the respect of the people of Libya when they start to restore their country," said Carrie.
"It is the support of their democratic solutions from both parties."
The language may be unnecessary, but there was no discussion on Lebanon.
These two stakeholders of the lawyers of the parties have been prevented each other and the White House on the formulations of the series of resolutions approved or constraining the role of the American army in the NATO mission in Lebanon.
In June Kerry and McKine represented a resolution allowing limited use of the American armed forces in Lebanon.
The draft law was rejected by the Palestinian representatives by the majority of both parties and not to vote in Senate.
But the same day when the draft law was held in the Palestinian, the Palestinian was not also supported by a proposal that would be funded by the United States Operations in Lebanon.
This has left the American mission as a legal cleaning -- when Congress is very furnished to critify Obama's approach to the mission, but not so crazy to throw up her out of its feet.
Following events, the Determination of the Congress
In August, Tripoli was killed by the Olympics and Caddafi was killed by 20 October.
The NATO Mission has completed officially 31 October.
Now the Senate may be ready to action.
The resolution of the Committee on Foreign Affairs " is protected by the people of Libya for its unrepeful closure and inevitable persistence in the challenge of freedom" and would thank men and women of the United States armed forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations for the protection of the Alitian people for their uninterprettable disappearance and professionalism."
Resolution also "reaffirmes the national interest of the United States in successful and inadequate transition to democracy in Lebanon."
Will new measures be taken full support of the Foreign Affairs Council or will the legislators deploy as the Juvenile Law Project?
The last version made the Senator Richard H. Luger, the leader of the Republics to the Committee.
The representative of Lugger said that he had not yet seen the last version of the draft law.
On the other side of the Chapter of the Palestinian Representatives of the week, it should vote for the constitutional amendment required by a balanced budget, the main legislative priority of almost every Republic and for some democratics in the Congress.
This measures proposed by the Palestinian representatives of Bob Godlath (Republic, Virginia) will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other that will be made to the plenary vote of the Congress.
The other lawyers had not yet been able to amend their amendments to the plenary meeting but not because they had not tried.
Gudlata's amendment is only one of the 68 constitutional amendments affecting wide range of issues made in this respect.
Some doubts - the same draft law was included in the Palette of representatives and Senate, and others were not significant errors.
It is at least 15 versions of balanced budget amendment only in the Charter and some of the "control of federal expenditure".
Some of them are also identical, but they give their authors, mainly elected republics who want to accelerate their summary, is the opportunity to get out of that proposal.
The Budget Control, held in August, requested that the Deputy of Representatives and Senate voted on the balanced budget.
In March 58, Senators voted for the necessary resolution supporting the idea of such amendments.
In addition to the budget, some congress would like to limit the number of periods of the full members of the Congress and the members of the Palestinian representatives of Hosa Serano (Democratic, New York) to reduce the limits in two periods for the President.
The Congressman of Jaxon-Muman (Democratic, Illinos) proposed a variety of amendments guaranteed, except otherwise, the right to quality education and health.
The amendment prohibiting unilateral marriages has been proposed for many years, such as one other prohibiting the flower flower.
Some lawyers also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if two third States are opposed against them.
As the members of the Congress were endeavoured to propose amendments, they are not faster than over the past years.
In the 111th meeting of the Congress, lawyers had proposed 77 amendments, and the 110th was introduced to 66.
This stage would be measured compared to the beginning of the 1990s when the Congress members, under the Library of Senate, had regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But success has been made more than now.
The last amendment adopted, 27-year-old, was approved in 1992, but she was actually amended to Congress in 1789.
"Take, but it's not win," he says Hiphford in his first television interview after the trial.
After ten months after a armed man had slapped in the public action in Tuson, a member of the Palestinian representatives of Gabriel Gibephfords (Democratic Party, Arzison) appeared on a federal channel in the week-end, had disappeared the melody from the Broadway Section "Soloce tomorrow" and said that he wanted to be healing more than to return to Congress.
By visiting the "20/20" Abi-S-News and Duyana Seyer, Gaffford made proposals and needed help in the movement.
The programme showed her a difficult path to restore after the grain brought by the trip, which made a trip and retained the left side of the brain, passing from the front to the back of the head.
Three months later, she had returned to the Palestinian Representatives, and she had triumphically announced the draft law on the debt.
In his first television interview after the January Street, who killed six and killed 13 people, Gaffford smiled, laughed and dreamed - and called "favorable".
On the question of Sier, she feels that the 41-year-old Hiffford said, "Tree good."
Interview with Hiffford and her husband, Marco Kelly, was part of the private special exhibition "20/20", which was demonstrated by the outcome of the new Business book "Gibby: History of Manual and History."
The explosive talked about the rehabilitation of Hiffford after the 8th January.
On videos taken by Kelly in the first few weeks, it's located on a hospital kit with a breathing head and a long shot on the lobby.
She can only raise one or two fingers on the request of a man.
A few months later, we've seen how Hiffford's sitting in the kitchen, and the physicians teach it as to do simple actions.
Bring the head.
Expand the lips.
And then her first word, "What."
After a few days, Hiffford made the second word "tost" by request to change the tomorrow menu.
The video shown by Abi-Sy shows that music played a central role in the health of Hiffford: we see how the congress can assure together with the "Children's just want to enjoy" Syndy Loper and the Free Dog Tom Petty.
In the interview of Sier Hiffford, two hours a day, he said he wouldn't remember the day of temptation.
Her husband told her that he readed Hiffford's article in the 12th time she stopped him to ask for the six of the killed then.
The suspected attacked Jerd Li Laffner is in the missionary prison and is subject to an imprisonable treatment in the expectation of the court.
"My people's lost," said Hiffford Siger.
"Yes, hard, hard."
One day when she was healed, she said, "I'm winning."
"And I said, 'Gebby, you're not overcome'," said Kelly.
You're just killed.
And you're going through this, you're healing and returning stronger than ever.
The wars feel more miserable than respect
It was a festival at Wall Strit, which gathered millions of dollars for homeless networkers in New York.
The Kid Rock has shot the balance of immovableness, disappearance and loss.
A number of hundreds of soldiers, marines, volcanoes and marine pechonians were made around it.
The auditory in the smokings had a stand.
"The soldiers looked like the heroes," said David Salzman, who organized the marriage collection.
The former military officer at the concept, on which he also was the Chairman of the Head of Heads, Michael Mallen, had seen the role of the military on the other.
"They look like the syrups," wrote the officer in the electronic letter.
I'm sure the organisms wanted the better.
I know it.
But it wasn't really a respect.
Comprehensively anti-popular impressions illustrate the unfair relationships that have been established between the army and often an equality, sometimes higher American publication.
The warriors are loving for their victims.
But the princes have their price, the military servants say.
The brochure is still more than that, and it is likely to be misfortunate to people in form.
"We're not a victim," said the Brigad General Shawn B. McFarland, who commanded the troops to Iraq and just departed to Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way to show some support is to turn us as with unfortunately."
This is a senseful topic for soldiers who do not want to look inherent or incompatible with the society they serve.
They also understand that the anger with which the returning troops in the past years of war in Vietnam was much worse.
The majority of miscarity talks happens quietly and only among the vessels.
After his two sons returned from wars to the sea peak, the captain in the resort of Mark Kenshen warned them that they would not look at their service with two points of view.
Some will look at them with encouraging, because they have heard the slaughters and were in the ecost places.
Others will be thinking whether "on the hard bad winter," said Kenshan, who warned in Iraq and returned to take a high government post in Washington.
As he was looking for work, he said, he felt that some interviewers carefully asked whether he could undertake its own work in Washington immediately after the fight.
Kenshan remembers how he said to his sons: "When you tell your service, you must count on a negative effect."
The iniquity of military trial is partly from the American disagreement to wars.
Boats in the battle are rarely endorsed by a country that was little known to the army and seems a little direct benefit from war in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, have no more value of military herois, as usually was in the II World War," said the general-latinant in the resort of David Bernou, who commanded American arms in Afghanistan.
Instead of this reduction of policies and publications is mainly focused on the depth of the military sufferings.
The wars are estimated for the number of costs they have done, according to the number of fellows they lost or lost.
Army is focused on growing pressure of the parties against violence
At this week, the historic court hearings should be decided whether an appeal of 28 men and women against the Army to accuse against violence.
If not, the hundreds of the steel will be in line with the next.
The first class of Elizabeth Layman, 25 years old and 11 week of marriage, by its appreciation, was engaged by his fellow worker by night.
This was in October 2008, she returned to her carrier at Miramer's aircraft north from San Diego after dinner and met a dinner who had 12 drunk pocket.
He asked if he could come to her into the room.
"It was a red piece," said Laman.
But the birth of Texas had their threats.
I thought he was 19 years old.
"He's out of Texas," she said.
"Well, I didn't listen to my instinct."
A few minutes after they went to Layman's room, a man came back to her, shot and crashed, she said.
At this week, 18 November, Layman and yet 27 of the present and former military officers will have to wait for the decision of the court to the historic hearing which will be held in Arlinngon, Virginia and which decides whether they would go to the court, which they have issued against the former Minister of Defence of Robert Hits and his former Donald Ramphilda.
It is stated that Gates and Ramsfeld were not able to do with widely wide violence in the army in violation of constitutional rights.
In February, Ik, a lawyer of Susan Berk from Washington, D.C., was initially included 17 percent, but up to 28 in the next months, 25 women and three men that all claim that they were undermined violence or threats of sexual violence by the servants and that the Army did not necessarily investigate, not pursuant to the court or did not prosecute the proper justice after an attack.
Berk says she's inclined in the highest army officers because the problem begins with them.
"Army is a vertical structure," she says.
"Who are those who can destroy violence?
Berk also said that, since February, there were about 400 other victims, many of which could participate in futures.
Its strategy: instead of collecting all the systems in this case - classifying all the eggs into a single waste, so it will open a lot of things if it needs to support pressure.
The defence team from the Ministry of Defence under the Leader of the Federal Procureur Nila McBraid took steps to stop the case.
Judicial documents received by Newsweek have discovered the protection strategy in the main state that the former or present soldiers could not submit military claim for damage to armed forces.
According to the doctor called in the decision of the Supreme Court of 1950, the Federal Government does not have the responsibility of the damage caused by military persons.
"The perjudication is related to the risk of the military service, as stated in documents.
The Minister of Defence refused to comment this story.
The situation has changed from the 50s.
Although women have been officially prohibited to participate in the fight, this division only exists in words: modern wars have a clear line of the front.
And in Iraq, and in Afghanistan, the forces of women with soldiers play a more important role, particularly in contacts with local women in the warfare zone.
Results: During the period between two wars, 150 soldiers died, two third of them in war.
The Army is also going to become modern, says Berk.
She is not alone in her struggle; it will be prepared for three others.
In the Yeile Legal School, the Seminary of the Veterinians has prepared a case against the four major military academies to promoting the female atmosphere.
The non-Competitive United States Guidelines in Viet Nam prepares the exchange against the army in which the " personal change" diagnosis are victims of violence to disappear them from service, generally, in terms of assets such as Han Bhagati from the human rights group of the Organization of Women ' s Defence.
Its group was in December injured to the Office of Related Affairs, accusing it in discrimination to consider the treatment of pensions of persons that claim that the threats of sexual violence were threatened during the service.
Nine individual legislation projects proposing a number of measures were introduced to the Congress of the Senator Group and members of the Palestinian Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, 3,158 attempts were reported by the Ministry of Defence Warnment and Discrimination.
But, as known, the attacks are often not reported, and, according to Pentagon, this figure is approximately 13.5 per cent of the 19.000 cases occurred in that year.
The report issued in March also investigates the percentage of judicial cases: in 2010, 20 per cent of the known cases have been reached to the court, two times less than in the civil justice system.
Berk's experiences are only the first ones in a number of other grains.
In the case of Layman, she declared violence in military police less than after it happened.
She said that night, she asked to tell the details of violence by 11 times the police, doctors and teams.
She gathered the evidence of violence, and the blood of the attacked on his hand was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Layman sat before the judges at hearing, in which she asked whether she had been sex with her friend prior to the day of attack.
Six persons gave the positive character of the accused who was finally justified.
"I remember the day when he was ready a verdict," says Laman.
"I thought I'm going to say now, I've gone out of the court hall with a cry."
"They have put me in the psychiatric office, and when I went out, I remember that my commander said, "It was not a judge of him.
Layman had commanded to turn to a military psychiat, which finally diagnosed the change of personality that had done it inadequate to the service.
In January 2010, she was deleted with an unlawful formulation that she had not allowed her to get any benefit.
Is this a complex question, says John Terley, professor of law at the University of Justice named George Washington?
But he notes: "In my view they are able to go forward."
In the middle of them and the drugs, the doctor that criticizes since it appears.
I criticised the whole life to Doctrina Ferez.
Army left for a decade because she had no stimul and maintaining resources that is responsible.
He adds: "The chances are greatly against them... but it's important to try them."
These things are changed only when ordinary people want to fight.
If the hearing will not be useful, Berk, the lawyer, will gather hundreds of others for future cases.
"We will continue to fight with the army on this issue until it is reform," she said.
Or until we're gonna die, depending on what's going on before.
There's a wall's eyes: how researchers study you at Facebook.
Before the new person of the right extremism in Europe, Andreas Bering Brivick was the ordinary guy who extended its anti-immigration views to the Internet.
The weekend of Brivick, known as the massac murder in Norway in July, which had been made of 77 people in life, appeared to his first open court hearing.
Although Brevick could work alone, he was not far alone on the network. He had been a long time prepared to attack the computer with millions of nationals who support the right groups in social networks.
After the old tragedy, researchers wish to learn more about these people.
How do you find them?
Legco is just gotta go to Fisbok.
"We understood that it is very difficult to agree to them," says James Bartlett, who recently published the European Cyber-Ciber-Populate of the Britain Research Centre of DEMOS.
On the basis of the personal data on Facebook, Bartlett said that researchers could easily use an advertising tool to choose the necessary democratic group with scientific accuracy -- that the marketing and doing a few years.
The Bartlett team found a million factors of the legal groups throughout Europe and then submit them to the report, but instead of showing a new group or diplomatic product, the report proposed the user to investigate the level of education, violence and optimism on their own future.
With the Facebook Bartlett and his colleagues, more than 100,000 participants were able to investigate 14 the most legal partys in 11 European countries, even not out of the office.
"It's perfectly a new way to conduct research," said Bartlett.
Some results are not so vulnerable: online and multilateral groups are most young men of the sex sex, indirect immigration.
But it is expected, "Those who conveys his online activity with a fooline-activity, more wise, more democratic and less aggressive than those who are just going to be awake."
DEMOS's work is only one example of how Facebook becomes a new popular tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centres, researchers and policies use the site to study all of the world from health to social tranches expressed in Layaka, wall posts and status updates.
With more than 800 million active users added to the average three records on the day, the Faisbuck's super-active information calls for the research bum, increased the number of scientist articles named by the title of 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, he has the opportunity of studying people in which it is impossible to go on the street with the blond.
"Well, if you want to ask people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them."
"They would have come into the party, and they would never take you" said Bartlett.
"Fissbuck excluses all this -- you turn directly to them."
Others say that this site could be identified and investigated social health problems.
The last study of Dr. Megan Moro from the University of Vicson, Madeson, and her colleague showed that students who discussed their drink movements at Faisbuque were significantly undermined by the risk of alcoholism than the students who listed on this regard.
Morocco considers that students, for example, could monitor the site and interfere to help students who are too often updated with drink status.
"You can't solve the problem, not discovering it," said Washington Post Dimitri Christkis, Sauditor Moroa and Director of the Child Health, conduct and development in the Child Research Institute of Site.
"We found a way to discover children from the groups of risks that would not be found otherwise."
The Faisbuck is also a different kind of data about its users.
The site processing group has discussed the status statistics and the day of the Holy Valentine, the view of the electoral in the middle of 2010 and the National Index of Happiness (for the main use of the access to which only they had, the cyberians of liberties had long to make their wide collection of data available to research).
But the Facebook users know that the website is watching them, like it or not - in exchange of the opportunity to play in the Story with a friend who is in thousands of miles from you, the site can process your personal data.
But how would it be when the Facebook users become part of the research that they don't even know?
While researchers have shortly certain provisions of Afglyne Research, online-developed general access.
"I don't think many users would have thought that the researcher can observe their profiles," says Neil Selwin, a socialist of the London Laboratory, the research that he had conducted in 2006 with the use of available student pages in Feibek.
"How they represented themselves, that was just between them and their friends."
Then there's a question of methodology.
Even the Afglyans have no guarantee that the research object is worthy.
The Facebook can't know what the number of information in the profile and the user's page is true.
"What you're talking about to Facebook, and what you're doing outside the Facebook borders, two absolutely different things," says Selvin.
This is why, despite the years of its technical research, Selvin believes that blocks and roads are still the best research tools that can be used.
"Nothing can replace outcome into real peace and communication with real people," he said.
"I think social research is on social, and the majority of the social is still aflown."
"Food and Inhuman": Anders Bering Brivick is publicly presenting the court first.
Andreas Bering Brivick, a person who was aware of the organization of a double attack who had made the life of 77 people in Norway in this year, described himself as a battle of " resistence" during the first public statement in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the reign of Tamars Norwegians," he made 500 presents in the court hall.
"I express the court because you received your mandate from organizations who support the idea of hate and because it supports multiculturality."
"I recognize actions, but I don't recognize fault."
The court of Turchiel Neshaim stopped Brivick during this monologue, because he said, "He didn't want to give Brivich to use this audition as a area to express their own views."
In the same reason, he refused to allow Brivika, who brought with himself the most recently written word, to turn to the parents of the victims at the end of hearing.
He also commanded the police to keep Brivick in the prison for more than 12 weeks, prohibited him access to the SICs for four weeks and said that the authorities would take careful control of all visits and lists for eight weeks.
As well as 30 survivors and parents have visited hearing.
Some have hoped to see Brivick in the eyes, and others have been convinced that it is under lock.
All came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought he looks like cold and inhuman," said the Norway NRK channel, one of the survivors in the West.
"It was not comfortable, but I personally have become a little bit easier after I saw and heard him suspected."
The dark coast and a blue captain Brivick kept peace and professional for all hearing and looking at journalists and survivors when he went out and went out of the building.
Despite the strange idea of Brivica, he was part of the great " resistance" movement, the judge decided that he was not abusive and said that there was no evidence that he had acted with communities.
Some may appreciate that the attacks, 22 July, are a work of one extremist, not a group of radiocalls.
But this does not decline automatically pain and disappointment that now makes the whole nation feel.
"I would like him to look like a monster, but it's not that," said the parents of one victim.
"It would be much easier if it was so."
7 lessons from the loss interview of Steve Joseph, shown in the Theater for this week
After the death of St. Jabes 5 October, some compared him with Henry Ford, described the technical genius as the Great Unit of Modernity.
But the fact that Apple's factors may have the greatest openness in recently revealed interviews that have been mentioned in the prevention of preliminary indicators on the main markets at this week, that is how many of this crucial mind understood in business processes and production technologies.
He was of course a designer, a dream and considered himself hypsy, but he also was a proper institutional organization and a modeler of the production process, who believed that many business leaders suffered from "creased idea that the actual idea is 90 percent of work... [a] a great idea of the great product is divided by a large number of artistic workers.
Returned in 1995, Bob Crisingley created a televisor of the Neurph of Personal Computer and held more hours with James for a unique conversation.
It's been about 10 years ago since James was out of Apple and he already worked in his new NeXT computer company at the time of the Internet media.
While a small interview was used in New York, he said that the original interviews were passed during the transportation.
Only after the death of Josephs, a full VHS copy was found in the garden of the recorder.
This outstanding material, a little widelined, was the foundation of the 68-minute film, Steve Jabes: the persive interview that goes in the countrymark Theaters in the middle and Thursday.
For a person known by hatred to detailed interviews, James seems to be ready to explain its technological philosophy and business strategy.
And it's incredible.
In four different moments during the interview, there are great interactions between issues and answers, the thinking of 10-15 seconds, where James clearly affects their thoughts to say accurate.
There are also moments where the perfectionism of Josephs is on the surface where it seems to be an ill-related Cryingly issues which are faster than moved to issues or appearances of greater importance.
In the middle of Pixara, irons and irons of the Potter interview, there is something worse prophecy when James appreciates that, as he sees, different companies do loyal and unfairly, and proposes its own vision of future information technologies.
One case to read about the death assessments of Joseph's work, but there's something angry and inspired in James, which we're seen here, a huge dream in the neighbour of the Majesty.
He has a vision of what things could be.
Soon after he said all here, he went and did it.
A small note on the seven significant conclusions of the Sustainable Interview:
On how he learned to lead business:
"Why are you doing this?" and answers that you're unresolved, "Oh, it's just doing that."
No one knows why they're doing what they're doing, no one's thinking very deep business.
That's what I knew.
Jabs continues to describe its attempts to rationalise the reporting in Apple.
The extension of the costs often starting with the "normal costs" that were taken from the pool and then prepared by the "Access", he created a automatised structure, which guaranteed that they could be able to reduce business costs to a little.
Wow, you know, Dad?
It's detailed about the "Sink Coffee" which he has shown with the Steve's note, the device that allowed people to improving the phone company and call on a large payment.
A lot of the devices were written before, but Joseph's irony is here when you describe the blue cows as an act of trust to power is current.
He says how he and the records tested a box, using a phone automobile and then connecting from one AT-T network to the other until they have been linked to the more possible stations.
"We've hidden a landscape southtime, and you've been crying in the phone, and it's been a minute later in the neighbour phone", says James.
"We were young, and everything we agreed is that we could demonstrate something that could control billions of infrastructure around the world."
We both knew a little, but we could demonstrate a small thing that could control the great thing -- it was an unbelievable lesson, and I don't think that without that it could ever appear Apple.
Jabs continues to describe a wonderful outcome that he had been practically performed by calling to Vatican through a blue bottle in full and requesting Pope phone, all of which he tried to copy Henry Kissinger.
When different Catholic Irish members were designed among the nights to speak with the American diploma, these two were disappointed the laugh right before the Pope himself was raised to respond to the phone.
About love in technology (and cold call for Bill Hilett):
In the age of 12, he found Bill Hilett in the phone phone and called him.
Soon after their 20-minute phone talk, James got an annual development in Hoolet Pakard.
"It was a strong impact on me, it was the only company I saw in that age, and she formed my view that such a company and how well they relate to their own staff."
Afterward, James became one of the HP staff visiting the company research laboratory in Paul Alto, where he saw the "the first current computer".
He was a kitchen size, he was a small monitorer with the best electronic tube, and I loved him.
I often traveled to HP adolescent and shot around that car and wrote for her.
About innovated innovation:
In several places, James’s interview tells the exquisition of new birthrough products.
On the end of his card when he went to sell a monetary payer, one buyer asked him to gather a whole computer.
In the work of a period of 30 days, it should be considered and collected and provided ready devices.
Afterwards in Apple, he remembers the difficulties that he has touched by developing the computer mouse:
"I remember the fair disputes... they cried to me that it's gonna take five years... to take the mouse that's going to be $300, and I'm going to sit down in the garden, and came out and found a designer."
9 days later we had a mouse that we could gather for $15, which was unbelievable.
Of large companies losing energy:
As long as he had noted Apple's recurrence, James said exactly how many leaders were crashed in the situation and lost the market's control.
"Well, you're working in IBM or Xerox, so you're doing the best copy or printer, and what?"
You have a monopolie on the market, so the company does not become more successful.
The sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these types of people] who come to the management of the company and those who make product are disappeared from the area of decisions.
The genius of the product that brought to this monopolistic position is exacerbated by people who don’t have any idea of the difference between good and bad products is the mastership required.
That's what happened with Xerox...
Xerox could keep all the information technology industry.
He could be ten times more than 10 times, could be Michael 90...
They have been hurts from the victory.
innovation as art form:
"The great idea of the great product is divided to a large number of artistic work... when you're making a great idea, it's changed and grown."
You'll know a lot of her weaknesses.
There are compromises on which you need to go - some things you can't make electrons, steel, robots or tickets.
You need to keep your head 5,000 ideas -- these concepts -- connecting them all together...
Finally, it's all going to stuff -- it's all trying to express himself in the best that you've ever produced people and then try to bring it to what you're doing.
Picasso said that good artists were copied, the great artists are hurt.
We've always been hont to harm great ideas.
The part of the things made by the Makintosh was that people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, stories that have happened to become the best information technology specialists in the world.
If not information technology, they would have done a huge thing in other areas.
Scalia and Thomas are selling with opposers of the health law until the court considers the case.
On the day when the Supreme Court was gathered by the doors closed to discuss political disputes, whether he would listen to the discipline of the Law on Health of Obama, two of his judges, Antonine Scallia and Clarence Thomas, had been conducted for the dinner established by the Legal Prime, which would be retained before the Supreme Court.
The case occurred in the past Thursday, when all the nine judges met to discuss the pestilences provided for.
One of the items for the agenda was the request maintained by 26 States, which was a revision of the health revision adopted by the Congress in the past year, the law which assembled conservative assets from the whole nation.
The judges agreed to consider the process; actually, the long-term debate was expected at 5 1/2 hour in March 2012, and the outcome will be overlooked in a presidential course, which will be the same time when the decision was made.
The advocate who will stand before the court and state that the health law should be rejected, moreover, it will be Paul Clemen, who was Vice-President of the General Prosecutor during the presidency of George U. Bush.
The College, Bancroft PLLC, was one of almost two agendas, who helped the annual dinner of the Federal Common Society, a long-term group that has constantly retained conservative legal principles.
Another party, who has dedicated dinner, represents one of the trade associations that has participated the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the philosophic hygant Pflizer Inc, which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of gravities.
Defence was held in the hotel Washington after a few hours after the court meeting.
There was, among others, Mitch McKonnel, the leader of the republics in Senate and a known counterpart of the health law.
Scalia and Thomas.
Nothing new: two judges visit the Federality Communities for many years.
And this is not contrary to ethical standards.
In fact, the courts of freedom of behaviour from the Code which regulates lower federal courts.
If they were understood, they could fall under Principles 4C Code, which states: "The Soviet can visit the proper activities of legal and other organizations, although the judge could not be a rapporteur, honorable guests or mentioned in the programme of such action."
However, the clear neighbourhood of Skalia and Thomas to two legal firms in this case, as well as the company with large financial interests, had been an adequate signal for the powerists in the Government.
"It is an unfair violation of ethics and unrespective to the Code against the statements of some judges that the court remains the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of the Common Dela.
"Subs were drunk and drunk to the official collection of money and lawyers who are now considered in the court."
Their views and support for the collection of money for this activities are deprived and is inadmissible.
Scalia and Thomas are not aware of the criticians that say that they are very deserved to smile the cases of the customs groups as the Federal Communities.
And Thomas's wife, Gennie, is a known conservator.
Furthermore, the reservators claim that this is regarding Elena Kagan's judge and is ethical, not Skalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the main legal service in Obama’s administration when the first court repressions were made against the law at the level of the court of the first instance.
Their criticisms were requested that Kagan would be rejected from the hearing on this matter because it was too involved in the protection of the law so that it was now unfair.
Kagan didn't show her that she was gonna do so.
Boeing receives the 18 billion record for the aircraft
The Emirates Airport provides 50 widely layers of Boeing 777 and may say more than 20.
Boeing also sold six Boeing Dreamliner Oman Air, the size of the parking - more than 1 billion dollars.
This is the only news that the company gets 50 units of its product.
But this is an important event when this company is a self-consumer Boeing Co., and the prerequisite price for all these 50 airports is $18 billion.
It is very important where Boeing received a command: the Middle East growing gold lived by future settlements.
The Czech Company, which was published in the summer, suggests that the Middle East in the nearby 20 years will need 2.520 aircraft value of 450 billion.
Boeing anonyms in these outcomes its largest in dollars for commercial aircraft, 50 transition airports Boeing 777.
The unbelievable order made Emirates' Emirates in Ducua.
In the Arabia, there are also an opportunity to buy more than 20 aircrafts that will higher the overall price of $26 billion, said Boeing to Abiah Dubai 2011.
After weekend, Boeing reported, Oman Air said six Boeing 787-8s, so called Dreamliner, who could hide significantly the best fuel economy and passengers.
The price for six aircraft is more than $1 million.
"It's really very good for Boeing," said Morningstar's analytics.
"The quality of these specific buyers is pretty high."
Many Nepthodous Airlines have Nepthodous Countries.
As a result, they have not only money to pay for aircraft, but also the growth of fuel prices, which usually affects airport damage, as one of their largest expenditures is not so deprived because the country pays money for high prices.
It is important, since they are less likely than other aircraft, when the prices are grown, said the Director.
"They have natural protection," said he.
The mandate of Emirates strengthens Boeing leadership on the market of wide flower aircraft and helps not allow the airbus SAS to attend his domination with its A350 aircraft.
Boeing's wine has occurred four months after Airbus stated that it would be the largest A350, which is over 777-300ER.
He reiterated the duty to increase assets after buyers needed to increase shipment and the duty of the field.
The Boeing Co operations increased at $1,5 per cent to $67,94.
The sister of the President of Mexico, apparently, has lost the elections in Michaki
Lucas Mary Calderon claims that the drugs helped the Opinion of Faust Waleho from the IRP in the pre-presentative course.
The sister of the President Felipe Calderon, seeming to have not implemented its statement on the place of the Governor Michaan, during the elections of the State, and she stated on the Monday that the drugs had helped declined one of its adversaries.
In the preliminary results of the leader on the place of the Western State Governor called Faust Waleho from the institutional revolution party or the IRP.
"The interaction of organized crime during the whole process of elections and particularly yesterday is concerned, not only for the Michaanan, but also for the whole country," said Louis Maria Calderon in the radio on the next day after the resurrection of the vote.
They've been hungry by our candidates, our workers at the election.
IRD had managed Mexico seven decades until the presidency was lost in 2000.
It is prepared to return, and the winner in Michacara is an important step in this attempt.
IRP hoped to win presidential elections in July.
Waleho seems to be just a little shot of Calderon, who was rectangled before the election day.
Calderon, a candidate from the National Action Party, or the NDA, undertaken by her brother, refused to recognize Waleho winner.
The U.S. Solved Aureoles, a candidate from the Left Democratic Revolution Party, or the DPR, which is now belongs to the Governor Cross, has been a third serious fraud of the leathers to separate and unlawful before the presidential elections of 2012.
Airlines also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Waleho, the former manager of Morale State, refused the link to drugs and called for other candidates to recognize the results.
In Michhuania, there were many drugs specialized on marijuanas, heroins and metaftamines.
This is the parent state of President Calderon and he elected Michkey to launch military operations against drug drugs in December 2006.
Violence continues to be now.
Mr. De PNAD was killed for a week before his elections, when he acted with Luisi Claderon, and a few candidates went out of the local pre-sensitive course because of fear.
However, as the elections in Michamar, the wine will be moved by the party.
The man who should represent the IRP in the presidential course, Enrike Neto, speaking from Washington, welcomed Waleho and said: "I think that the gain should be very excited in the next year."
ABR encourages Asia to save Europe
The Asian Development Bank has forced India and China to be ready to help save Europeans from the long-term European crisis to avoid long-term heritage that stops the growth of Asian economy.
Mr. Nag, Director of the ABR Office in Manuel, said that the two most rapidly developed economies should be "all that they can" to accelerate the restoration of the monetary block with the assistance of the International Value Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He advised that the Brick countries are taking into account the difficulties of Europe, and said that Asian financial assistance on the side of the European leadership and resources could help to avoid long-term heritage in global economy.
"To all this relates."
"When anybody can help Europe to get out of the crisis, he reported the Financial Times in Interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to some degree, but it can't be inevitable."
"So if China and India can help, it needs to be done."
The European Value Union has been strongly affected by the long-term European crisis in the past months.
During the last days, Italy has grown more dangerous and the primary ministers of Italy and Greece have been retained.
The long-term crisis in Europe has made fear that it could bring a world economy to the recession and has brought the calls for leading development economies together to help Europe find a decision.
Mr. Neg suggested that any Asian assistance would be carried out through the ICF, but it said that bilateral cooperation was the nature of buying EU financial assistance fund, funds to ensure financial stability in Europe, provides a great power in the negotiations of Asian partners with Europe.
Hann Sharma, Minister of India, said that "India will do everything it could" to help Europe, since its own economy is now declined to export and reduction foreign capitals.
"Nobody wants the Euroron to remain instainable and unfortunate," said he.
"We have a gravity of tasks and we have to support the high growth level."
"It's a possibility, it's a obligatory condition, because where we're gonna find work for the tens of our young guys and girls."
Others say that for developing economies, like India, there is no meaning to help rich Europeans when they face their deep economic problems.
Before Warshney, professor at Brian University in the United States, said that it would be very difficult to assist Europe for Indian Indian 1,2 billion people, of which approximately $2 million per day or less.
"In some moment they know that the Greeks go to pension in 50 years and go to sea feast, and it will not be fine," said he.
Le Howell, the Director of the World Economic Forum, also asked why India ' s reserves should be used to contain greece-mentioned and well-betaking public workers on the work in bad organized, gained enterprises such as iron routes.
Mr. Neg said that the European crisis was threatening "related direct consequences" throughout Asia.
The ABBC proposed that 7,5 percent growth of the economy in Asia in 2011/12 has now focused on “reductive risks” because of Europe’s threats.
He said that vulnerable developing markets needed to be "respective plans" to protect themselves from heritage and significant capitals from their economy.
Feather prevention of Pentagon on potential defence reductions
The Minister of Defence of Leon Panett had made an approximate provision at the Congress on the Congress, announced that the automatic reduction of the budget will result in national security and will cause the financial impact from Pentagon's corridors to the battle in Afghanistan and the Civil Assembly.
Pentagon has already been reduced to $450 billion in the coming decade, but now it is afraid that additional reduction of 600 billion or more can be unremovable if the Congress could not come to the expenditure agreement.
"The consequences of these reductions will be disastrous for the Ministry," reported Pattern in a letter to the Senators of the Republic of John McCyana, Armenia, and the Republic of Lindsy Greham, South Korea.
He said that the Congress could not accept budget agreements and resulting from the so-called seminars initiated the total reduction of 23 per cent and the cease of many new projects.
"That's the strong reduction of our projects in the shipping and construction of unqualified -- you can't buy three four ships or buildings -- and cause a serious damage to other attempts of modernization," wrote Patterta to Senators.
"We also have to be able to lose many of our state workers and, as the reduction will be done so fast, we will probably have to remove states to achieve the objectives."
"It will help those who support our army and cause serious damage of warfare."
Finally, the military parties are detrimentated, said Patent.
The Military Financing in Foreign External Operations is not directly affected by the Seventors, and military achievements are seriously requested for serious budgets," announced Patent.
"The Contract staff will be concluded that the abolition of contracts and the supervision contracts supporting the military."
"The Statute staff will be stopped and will be violated by the wage of military suppliers and the right and political support. "
Two Senators wrote 10 days ago, requesting the possible effects of the automatic reduction in the Ministry of Defence.
“The result of the seminar in the Ministry of Defence will be a short attack of the United States as a leading world military.”
"We are constantly opposed to this dragcon act," they reported the Senators in a joint statement on the summer after they renewed the letter of Pattery.
"It's not the way we can live, and it's not the way we have to bind us."
"Secvester is a threat to the interests of national security of the United States, and it is impossible to make it possible."
Whether a letter of Patent or the latest warning of Senators to the Budget Exploitation will be brought to the Liberation of Pentagon from the reduction, seeing later.
Patent was absolutely appreciated about the possibility of reduction, although he had come to the manager of Pentagon after many years of the budget expertise in the Congress and the White House and recognizing that he was not easily elected.
At the Press Conference last week, the Minister of Defence had described the picture of what might be followed -- a military with a jacket but without an iron.
"It's a boat without marine."
"It's a race without pool."
"It's a flow of aircraft without enough prepared plates."
"It's a bumphod tigre, army with guards, buildings and bombs without sufficiently prepared soldiers who are able to carry out the mission," said Patent in their entry observations in Pentagon.
"It's the power that suffers from the uncontinenciful spirit of war, bad ready and unable to fight with the potential enemies."
"In reality, it's encouraging aggression."
The annex to its letters to McCyana and Grekama Panett has shown new details of how the reduction of " significant operational risks prevent: the reactions on crisis, conflicts and catastrophes; the possibility of to be first in the deployment and in reaction in the world; and they have to be unacceptable risks in future war operations".
And Patent said that some of the largest defence projects could face obstacles, including the tests already passed, and some only at the early stages of planning.
This list includes the only f35 slaughter planned new bombards, the Ballistic ship of the New Generation, the new war ship of the coast and the new land-based vessel vehicle that Army and Morocco needs to replace the household.
The ceasing of further F35 development and testing may conceive 80 billion dollars for 10 years, but its parties said that it is a vital step to improve and combat potential threats from China and other adversaries.
How to Lies
Belarus views on the last title shows how serious and comprehensive lies and lies in daily life.
The candidate to the President of the Republics of Herman Kine is concerned with the complaint of the accused of sexual assistance from several women; each party is accused by the other one in the lies.
The Administration of the University of Pennsylvania was an accused in a lie witness because they had hidden that the Fotobol Trade had violated the children ' s pension.
Last week, the President of France Nikola Sarcozi was understood when he said to the United States, Mr. Baraku Obama, the President of Israel, Benyamin Nathanyahu, a liar.
The lame destroys the carriers and makes a shame of the country.
The New York Congressman and the Internet Exterior Antony Wayner made himself drugs, deniing its outcomes that it had been rapidly proclaimed to an unsatisfactory evidence.
The former candidate in President John Edwards was awarded to accuses in financial machinery during campaigns related to the covering of extraordinary links.
And again, nobody of those living at that time will never forget the medical cycle with President Bill Clinton, who has lied on his sexual relations with Monica Levins during his second time of time.
The story of mineliness for exchange in school and college is a general case.
There were cases when teachers gave answers to the students to make themselves a good assessment of the results of their activities.
The teachers who should teach the opposite are sent to the fact that lies and offences are accepted.
With what number of lies are we standing?
For one day, as the research shows, you can lie from 10 to 200 times.
It is now expected that the significant part of this is lie to salvation.
Another study showed that strangers had blacked three times in the first 10 minutes of knowledge.
Lying or enhanced lies are necessary to each understanding both for personal and professional objectives.
A distinction of the room game that is likely to say, the balades, where it is to be called "Please!", the discovery of lies is the serious direction of knowledge based on scientific data collected in the past six decades in prestigious universities engaged by universal research projects, particularly on psychology and physiology.
One research result is that most old myths have been developed.
The lungs look at the eyes.
They're not always stopped, kidnapped, wrecked or drying.
It is not important to find out that false men are difficult to notice and to develop.
The investigator of the lies may go to the truth by monitoring the structure of approval, migration, structure and timely characteristics.
I have been able to find a number of years, investigating scientific openings in the wide and constantly growing segment of lies, and clearly that the lies is the modern understanding that easy to learn, and that helps the orientation of our complex world -- particularly if your professional responsibilities includes recruitment, accommodation, negotiation or management.
The good lies are surely able to read others, giving them to feel inadequate, manage their own emotions and feelings intuitively as others accept.
We know from the research that extremists fall more often than introverys that men lie more about themselves, while women of others, usually to protect any feelings that married persons are less damage to their partners than married (although the lies they say, most often injury).
We also know that if you are a liarer, others will feel less accused by lie to you.
How do you understand, someone lies?
First, look at your normal behaviour.
This is called "determination of the original state".
This helps to ensure the post-point to assess the changes further.
Watch the late, weeping and voice characteristics of your object.
It's good to you to know if a person is constantly in the normal state, then you won't make an unjust accused when you see your feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then enhance the group of false faithful and unfair acts.
Relax these groups as a red flowers, not the proof of false.
Managers can fill the top part of their body when they are trying to remember their story, they can put their steps towards the door, drew out, change their pockets in a certain way, or demonstrate "deleasing after the interview" - this excellence of easiance and change of the results when all difficult issues are behind.
The followers are often philosophicing the signs of the end of the request to simply see this easy after the interview.
So look at your object.
It is known that Scott Peterson was attacked and used the past time, claiming that his killed wife lived that had brought her search throughout the country.
The privileged people may also use distaining: "I haven't had sexual relations with this woman... Mrs. Levinsky" or repeat the complex issue.
The typical vertical indicators are loud.
Someone can use "Qualification language," when he answers a complex question, "Good... in truth to say... how much I know... how much I know."
It makes the answer more emotional than actual, and often is a red flago.
There is no massive means to discover lies, but it is possible to be able to find lies.
Those thoughts will increase the opportunity of each to make a victim of arts in professional and personal life.
The Summit Plan for Nefti-Production needs to revise after threats of the United States to grant its approval
A few days after the Administration of Obama was threatened to grant the approval of the planned neffee proceeding from Canada to the Mexico Wolf -- the anger of prosecutors, but encouraging the environmental protectors - a company that will be able to re-examin the project.
TransCanada reported on Sunday that it would choose a planned neffee-product from the ecological sense of the Middle Hood Zone in Nebrak and make sure that the project would be endorsed.
The company has learned that decision at the press conference of the Nairobi State.
The Official Representative TransCanada Alex Puerbas said that the company remains sure that it will finally receive the approval of the non-product, although also with another mercury.
This happens after the statement of the State Department for the past week that it will decide on the draft at the federal level until he has studied new possible marriages that have not affected the region of Nebrish Chambers and Avifer Ogalala, the large water stock.
"It's a real step forward," said Fox News Congress Le Terry, republic of Netherland.
The new environmental expertise defended by the State Department will moreover require decisions to 2013, after elections in the next year, although the authorities refused that the policy was prohibited.
Obam, in a written statement last week, decided by the call of the State Department and expressed support for him.
A long-term ratio of 1,700 miles must be leaving from Canada to the Mexico Oil.
He must transfer 700,000 barriers on the day from Albert's province to the Nepthoge-Backs in Texas.
To do this, he needs to move six states.
It hates environmental protectors, but they love proficiencies that hope about about 20,000 workers related to nept-product.
However, the Nerlandese lawyers who speak against the plan consider the draft law to accelerate the movement from the Peacehold Zone and the Aviation of Alhalla, the main source of drinking and arrigancy.
The recent study of the State Department on Environmental Influences showed that the project would only have limited negative impacts on the environment, but the source of energy industry stated that the audit of the Department had given specific expertise to the examination procedure, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the library received TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a consultant at the Hillry Clinton campaign in 2008, was a conflict of interests for the programme.
Another was the choice of a firm, which was taken to carry out the initial research, as was related to TransCanada.
At Patty Labelle gave the court because she was likely released to the child from fear.
The family from New York claims that the discovery of Patty La Bell began to boil their home in Manhattan, fearing their young daughter to that degree of fear.
"Lady Marmalade" struck the 18-month year Genevaus Monk so much that she was transferred to "change of personality, disstruction of sleep" and "related pain of strangers," she said to her family in the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
This occurred 10 November, when the work wall of Kevin Monk, his wife, a child garden, Rohana and Geneva were going to the family trip.
As soon as Kevin Monk took the car, Roann Monk fell into the building bob of Riversid with their garage, Geneva.
Rosena Monk said she stopped at the door and left her daughter for a minute.
'Either came to me behind and said, 'You know what your daughter does?' I said, 'I'm going to take it,' she said.
Label Serditus made a marriage woman.
'It's aggressively declared,' you shouldn't have left her daughter by the door," said Rosena Monk.
I said to her, "I don't care what you say or think."
She came to anger and began to use ruining -- the word to C and the word to F -- on the highest tonnes...
She had a bottle of water, and she began to steal water from the buckets on me.
She said Geneva had started hissteric.
'I said to this woman,' see what you did with my daughter," said the mother of the child.
La Bell was throwing up to the mother -- who still holded Geneva - and her leaders had to hold her and driving her in the expected car, said Roann Monk.
She wept so much that she was weeping, she added.
Afterward, the family sent a note with the excuses, but did not receive an answer.
Avocate and representatives of Label are not responded to the calls for commentaries.
The amount of compensation for the damage was not reported, but the lawyer, Sam Devis, said that it was taken freely and that the family plans to provide any money that would receive for children who are sick to cancer.
"The goal is to let Patty Label answer for his action," said Debbie.
"This behaviour is absolutely invalid, particularly in relation to the child garden age with a 18-month child on the hands."
Climate problems have disappeared the economy
In the first year, Mary Lopes in Sinula grew unemployment and the unlawful labour market, foreign funding was reduced and the economy was reduced.
2011, which enters into the economic story of Sinloa as a first year related to the Government of Mary Lopes Walden, also called the change year, which made great hope for economic development, but, taking into account the unlawful climatic conditions of the beginning of the year, the growth was not registered by the reduction of the main indicators of economic development.
The lower temperature of February has not only resulted in the loss of millions of agricultural sectors, but have limited the possibilities of growth of public economy by reducing economic activity to 3.6 per cent in the first half of the year, mostly due to historical fall of 31.16 per cent in the agriculture, which has increased by other economy sectors.
According to the report of the areas affected by the moor provided by the Mexico Council on Sustainable Rural Development, 835.582 hectors, which were 78.03 per cent, and the remaining 21.07 per cent of the main cultures were fruit, curussy and nervous.
Unemployment in the State, under the National Statistics and Geographic Institute, in the first three quarters, the growth of unemployment has been identified until November, from January 55,053 inhabitants of the Sinaloa, from 4.53 per cent of the active population, in the second quarter of the total increased to 5.28 per cent, and from July to September, it has continued to grow up to 6.19 per cent, with more than 74.000 inhabitants of Sinalo, which were more than 18.969 persons compared to the first half.
Decrease of liquidity
The unemployment in Sinalo has been made many factors for the economic of Jardo Loude Servantes, the Director of the Economic and Social Science of the Autono-University (UAS), the growth of unemployment could be explained in line with actions under public policy.
"What we now seen is the growth of unemployment related to several factors, including the loss of market liquidity in order to restrict the resources provided by the law adopted in the Congress to combat money waste, as those who have illegally possessed dollars are not easy to work with them, to invest and to use them in something," he said.
Reстаd immigration
Lopes Servantes said that the growth of unemployment was also a demographical factor.
"The number of people who have left the State in the search for borders has been limited in the United States, in the first way, because of the difficulties of entry, and in the second time, as they have already gone into, they have a lot of difficulties in searching for work, so that the group of people remains and requires jobs here, in the State, a result of growing levels of unemployment," said he.
Infringement of formal requirements
The analysis of the work market of Sinalo is worse when the major number of violations that have been banned under the conditions of the NEGI, 60.38 per cent of the State ' s active population, not mentioned as employees in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and violations in the form, another reminder of work in the State has been provided by low wages; in the country the lowest wages in accordance with the records of the Mexico Institute of Social Safety and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of the Sinalo was to September 5.352, much lower than the country, which is 7.375 powder.
IDI reduction
In addition to economic activity and the highest rate of unemployment in 2011, the highest rate of direct foreign investment over the past 10 years, from January to July to July of the State, was estimated $630,697, which shows $87,74 per cent compared to $ 5.143.3.312 for that period in the past year.
The Government ' s Government ' s Ministry of Economic Development has totally fixed 17,280,000 per cent of investments for the year, which mainly arrived on services campaigns.
Number
On the background of the economic heritage, the Government requested in July, at the Congress of the State of Approval of Credits at 3 billion Pfund, which would be used for infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to live the economy at the local level, which was approved by 2.600 million peaks, and until November, the primary sector of the State economy was not expected.
Reactions
For trade representatives of the first year, the Government of Mary Lopes Walden shows the lack of Government's opportunities.
Miguel Loddo Lopes, President of the National Industry Lake, said that in 2011 there was no agreement on the desires of different sectors, including the Government of State.
"The effectiveness of the economy in Sinloa in this year was really low, and we must work a lot to reduce the positions lost in this year, in 2012, we should be able to help our efforts, and, above all, to agree the good and synchronized work of the new Government team, we hope that the next year would be much better," he said.
Economy displacement
Loredo said that the events as early as the damages have stopped the State economy and its efficiency and growth in this year have been limited.
"Increased economies are the result of several events, including the brass, one of the main effects was a slow economy, which is not enough fast to create economic dynamics, which allows us to have an acceptable level of process, goods and services, and therefore at the end of the year we close it under our expectations," he said.
Review of the direction
Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Federation of the United Republic of Mexico, said that the State had to continue the dynamic production activity.
"In general, we found that we worked on this, we believe that a long-term programme that will re-determinate the cost and economic rate of the State must be mobilized by all material and human resources that are in Sinloah," he said.
Sustainable work
The Chairman Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing the future direction to improve the Government's efforts.
"In general, I would say that the Government is trying to success in different areas, in terms of economic development there are little progress, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," he said.
He noted that the current Administration has shown progress in its own public policy manager.
"There are the facts that allow us to say that the Government is starting to work, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the Government is aware of that many still needs to do," he said.

The contributions to work must be made
Common work relating to such programmes as the Rodian, the Safety of Public Space and 3x1 for migrants are risking to remain incomprehensive or long delayed because of the lack of resources, Miguel Angel Lops Miranda said.
The Director of the Municipal Social Development indicated that, although work programmes have been developed, they are in danger, since the Government of State was not able to make the appropriate contributions of the sum exceeding 11 million funds for all three programmes.
He noted that the total financing of all three programmes was approximately 50 million peaks, from which the State should be deprived of 25 per cent, and only Federation and Municipality have provided resources for work, so it is still possible to be completed.
"They have to put almost 12 million, and although a year ends, they didn't give us any copys when they had to give us a part from the beginning of July," he said, "for no payment, we started work and they're very prolonged, but we need money."
He recalled that in the past year, during Hess Agilara Viille, the State had not made contributions that it had to be brought, so that at the beginning of the municipality government had to bear money to cover more than 7 million, the amount that was not provided in the case of the administration of the State.
"It has happened to us in the previous administration, since the State has not been financial opportunities to participate, but the programs continued to develop and in this year to get access to these programmes, we need to find resources to cover the remaining State," he explained.
While the State authorities have an obligation to provide these resources, he said that the request was made on behalf of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Vilreal, to increase the efforts, so that the per centages of them were soon as possible.
"They have to bring nearly 12 million, and even though the year's finished, they didn't give us any copys."
The Court shall approve the " digital television transition" in Mexico in 2015
Replace similar signals for digitals is one of the most important changes that have reached the world over the past few years.
The Supreme Court (US) rejected the constitutional claims issued by the Senate and the Platt Representatives against the Presidential Declaration, which was transferred as a " digital television" from 2021 to 2015, since there were no eight votes required to alter it.
The minority of four Ministers, including the Chairman of the Court, Hahan Silve Mesa, noted that the President of Felipe Calderon had not overlooked its powers, described a detailed description of action to cross the digital land television.
As a result, the constitutional claims made by the Senate were rejected by the absence of a majority qualified by eight votes required to be sent out by the Constitution or Inconstitution of the Decree, and remains in force.
The draft statement prepared by the Minister of Ollgoy Sanching Cordero was proposed to announce the declaration of non-constitution, since the regulation of radio and television the right established by the Federal Commission on Telecommunications (Coffeeel), in violation of the principles of Iraqi sub-Coordination and legislative reservation.
Only Salvear, Horh Marrio Parado, Margaret Luna and Sanchessa Cordero voted on the project.
On this subject and Senate, and the Deputy Deputy Debates held two constitutional debates to proceed the declaration and support the complaints, Minister Sanchessa Cordero stopped the application of the Decree and all the actions mentioned in it regarding the transition of the digital meeting.
At the meeting of Ministers, it was also decided to reject the requirements of the Deputy Palette, not in the discussion of the project, also under the responsibility of the Minister Sanchessa Cordero.
In his term, the Prime Minister said that it was not agreed with the arguments of the draft in the meaning that federal executive authority could not define the general rules to which the State Administration should be prepared.
"I don't think that if it had been done, it would be affected by an auto-regular body," and recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas, such as telecommunications sector, has a Federal Implementation Authority, which has a constitutional mandate, the State management.
The replacement of similar signals in digital -- one of the most important changes that have occurred in the past years has resulted in the best use of the radio spectrum, the best signal quality and more channels.
The transfer, said, would mean the benefits of transformation in a digital form, which includes compliance with public needs that are not only technical dimension, “as it covers economic, social, political issues and national security issues”.
These questions, he said, "requests the work of the whole system under the principle of public economic management, includes the group of authorities that the Constitution assembles a State executive authority."
He recalled that a large number of countries in the world had already been overcome to the digital meeting, and that was done with the Executive authority, despite the available explosive technical institutions.
It is not possible to conclude that the Government, taking the discussion of the Decree, which, in any case, affects the competence of the Congress, ensures the administrative compliance of the laws adopted by the Legislative Meeting.
In Michakia, analyzes the possibility of the "Russ voice" account

In the light of this, the Chairman of the General Council of Michaacan elections Institute, Mary de Los Angeles Landeral Saragos, recalled that a few days ago, 9 November, the electoral court approved the package of principles to agree local rules with federal electoral reform.

On the same day, 9 November, the Supreme Court of Justice (USS) adopted a decision on the constitutional claim issued by the local legislative meeting and called the 'inactive and illicit' voice of the State representative on constitutional reform, as he did not have the right to 'determine or support them'.
In the interview of the possibility of vote by Mary, wols Angeles Layderal said that, with the adoption of the approaches to the General Council, IHM would be able to present a part or full account of the vote by the local electional body.
Thus, the partly review of one or more electoral urns may be made under the terms that: the results of the Protocols are not compared; there is no vote and account of documents in the horn or is not in the President; or if there are significant errors or corrections in the protocol.
In addition, the general redistribution of votes in all elections may be placed when there is a sign that the difference between the proposed candidate for the elections and those who received the second place in the vote, less or equal to one percent, with the condition that the party ' s first session has been sentenced from the representative of the party and/or coalition that had made the second place of the candidates mentioned.
The general review of votes will also be made if, at the end of the usual account, the difference between the winner and the candidate who takes the second place, less or equal to one percent, with the condition that a political party, whose candidate took the second place in the case of excluding electoral oranges that were involved in partly recognized.
It should be noted that there are elections in Moralia, where, according to UNDP, the difference between the first and the second place only 0.16 per cent, notwithstanding 129 votes from the general number of the 923 Protocol.

The new Italian Government will be formed in the environment
The Deputy Minister, Mary Monti, meets tomorrow with the President of Italy to submit a new Government, which is close to the crisis putting this country to a game of economic catastrophe.
The named Italian Minister, Mary Monti, was met in the middle of the President of Italy to present a new Government, which is focused on the crises left by Italy on the game of economic catastrophe and the damage of the whole Europe.
The statement from the President palace stated that Monty, appointed on Sunday, would meet the President, George Napolitan to confirm that it could form the Government.
It is expected to present the office principally from the technical processes, although it is unlike when the new executive authority will take its positions.
Montty said he would represent the President of his negotiations with political parties in his attempt to form the Government.
"I want to confirm my full confidence in the ability of our country to get out of this complex period," said the former European Commissioner.
Monty did not directly say that he could form the Government, but the tonnes of his commentaries showed that the obstacles were overwhelmed.
"The Structure is now well clear," he said.
Monti has completed the form of Government less than three days, which is far less normal, since Italy was fighting the political and financial crisis, which made their debt at critical level.
The Administration under the manager of the former European Commissioner Monti must approve the hard economy required by European leaders to reduce confidence to Italy.
On the basis of the pressure on Monty to rapidly, the instainable markets have set income from the CBT of Italy 10 years more than 7 per cent, where Greece and Ireland had to be saved.
Emma Marchéla, the Chief of the Italian Workers Federation, reported the reporters after the meeting of Monty: "We said we will actively support this Government."
We believe that this is the last opportunity of Italy to choose from this critical situation.
The Success of Monty ' s success was based on the support of the LDP Silvio Berlassoni party, which had been forced to leave the sabbath on the crisis.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monty should lead to a good finding," said the reporter Angelnon Alfono, the secretariat of the centre-right party.
The LDP support, the largest party in Italy, is important, because many of its members have resisted the Government's majority of the technicians formed by Monty.
Parliamentary Support
The new Government of Monty should be a strong parliamentary support for reforms which will likely be incompatible reforms of the hard economy.
Any blocking or stoping of these attempts may lead to a new and disastrous attack on the financial market.
The Italian External Bank Association has increased the pressure, predicting that Monty could become a disaster.
Monti started his consultations with political parties, agreements and business groups as well as youth and female organizations.
He will end his meetings on Tuesday evening.
Monti was appointed at the Tuesday of Napolitan, which allowed a very fast movement to response to the crisis.
After a short transition at the end of the week last, when it was clear that Berlassoni would go to the delay, Italy's long value has now reached a critical level on the background of uncertainty, whether the new Minister would be successful.
The salvation of Italy from the State of €1,8 billion would be too long for modern European financial defenders.
Monty said that his Government would exist to the next elections designed for 2013, despite the provisions distributed, the policies would only give him time to reform before the designation of new elections.
Monty said that he would like to include politics in his office, but the major partys argue that it should be made only from technical specialists, the evidence of their disability in the process affecting financial situation.
Political sources reported that mutual unbelief and non-related parties were trying to include political figuries.

Quinette included the Turk country in honor of the carrier twentieth year
The trip to Costa Rica is a dream.
In the explicit interview of Viva Basist Jeff Ament from Pearl Jam, the group was ready to give one of the best concepts on the next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It was more than 20 years of expectation, but the group said that it was also a dream of reality to play in this country.
This was the approval of the Basis and the founder, Jeff Amen, which gave the explicit interview of Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is in the South America territory, in the form of the age of the twenty-year work and on Sunday, 20, will be the only rest in Central America.
Today, they are going to the National Stadion, starting from 7:30 evening, together with the Los Angeles The X and the La Robertas local group.
This is an explanation of the conversation, a full decryption of which is available in The Nation.
For your factors from Costa Ricky, it's a dream that Pearl Jam plays in Costa Rica?
The trip to Costa Rica is a dream and for us.
This is our only second visit to South and Central America and until it's fine.
I was in Costa Rica just one time -- it's a beautiful country, and I think we could stay there for a few days.
So we're very glad to bring our music to it.
I ask it because there is some of the groups, and the photographs live in tension days before the concept.
What will you tell your most dedicated factors?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
We needed almost 21 years to come to Costa Rica, thank you for that time, and we're sorry we needed so much time to come here.
Some people, at the expectation of your concept, appear to him as the greatest year.
Does this add a bit of tension to your visit?
Some of the largest shows that we played over the past 21 years were held during the last two weeks.
We've made a few great shows in San Pool and we hope that it brought us into the form for this concept to Costa Rica.
Actually, we want to play here.
We love this country, we love Serfining and Gentlemen, regarding these two things, Costa Rica, one of the best countries in the world.
How did you know about Costa Rick and her breasts for Serfeng?
We have a lot of friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and worries are incredible here.
My friends are always going to take the serphing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua and Mexico, and are a good place for Serfeng, as we learned from people who love serphin.
Look at the tour, you can say you've made a gradinal show with a lot of cane.
What have you planned to speak in Costa Rica?
Because we never played there before, we have no limits to what we can do.
We're trying to make the best show of the possible with the most different songs; we're trying to play a few songs from each album and to present our factors a great diversity of repertour.
You're never repeating the repertoire.
How does that get?
I think we have nine plastics and we can play more than 120 songs, and each like different songs, so it's easy to choose what songs play each evening.
When we have two or three songs that we didn't play some time, it keeps us to touch and surprises us, because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved these songs and that we could forget.
This makes a show more interesting for us, and so I think it makes it more interesting for people.
You're noticed 20 years of carriers.
Looking back, it's easy to believe what you've done?
Yeah, of course.
First, I think no one of us could ever imagine that we're in a rock group and that we're doing this over 20 years make it like a dream.
We are glad to our luck and we are very excited that we can continue to create music together.
We all love one another and love creating music.
We're happy to go into the world where we always wanted to go.
Everything is very happy for us.
What do you mean to be a significant part of the grant rating?
It was always honoured to be part of the large collective group.
We're good friends with Songarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's great when the movement grows from the groups of friends, and it's inadequate.
From time to time one group is appeared from one city, but it is far more strange when five or ten groups are appeared in one town.
We are privileged to be part of the Site team.
I'm playing some of them from time.
Last year, we were at the festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada and Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden during their tour, so we were happy to be friends of all of them and to be a part of the sound of Sitel.
It's also strange that the group of yours remains together in the same time.
Yes, four of us were together 21 years, and Matt (Kemeraron) joined us 13 years ago, which is much longer than many groups.
First, I think we're lucky that we're still alive, and second, we're worried about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to this, also, open musical ways that give each experiment freedom.
We trust music one to another, and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship to the word of glory was not easy, but because of your success you were able to do what you wanted.
How do you find a balance?
When we grow up, it was easier to find a balance.
We're worried about not to be too long in the turtle, because it's easy to go to this game of big tolls and people who love your music.
Until you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you should respect music and what it has done, not decided to be a sign and to be a rock-shake, no one of us is worried about.
What do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're going to write good songs, and it was great at the beginning.
We were a group of almost three years, and we had no album left to die Andy (And. Woods).
It was a lot of disappointed because it was so long, and the most important that we have been close friends with Bruce (Fervezer) and Gregom, who started with us in the group, and when I hear a song or see a photo, I think about the unbelieving person who was Andi, and as he made me feel to laugh, it was always pleased to go to work, laughing, talking about music and fotwell and many friends.
It was a great man, and we missed him.
The La Robertas local group will be responsible for opening a show in Costa Rica.
It's true you know her job, especially Eddie Veder, and why did you choose it to open?
Yes, the producers sent us a few video presentations, and this was a group that loved us more than all, so we are not attempt to see that Las Roberts could propose a live, and that should be very excited.
Why do you always change the words in Yellow Ledbetter?
This is the question of Eddie Vedero, so I don't know.
He's gonna get her and I think he's gonna use the first thing he's coming into his head.
Who pushed you on the bathroom?
They're so much.
Among the first ones who come on the mind, Gerser Batler, John Antвисl, Siy Ja Ramon, John Dow, Paul McKartni, Chuck Ducks...
They're so much that I can talk about the baskets I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in maintaining the eventuality, although he's no longer in mode?
I think we're all feeling some disappointed from the words of the match.
When I think about him, he reminds me of the groups I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all that appeared at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's wonderful because it's music that's worth to hear, and the teams of Mudhoney are now creating music better than ever.
At the beginning, your music was more funny, and now she became more positive.
How do you explain this change?
It's interesting, as I think, there's some songs that can appear easier, but there's the End or Just Breathe's songs that are thinking very sweet, although they can sound a little positive.
And when Ed played them, I wept when I listened to them, these songs were very dreamed.
I think when you grow, and your life was some grass and you lost a family or friend, these events start affecting your creature and music, and these two songs, of course, reflect it for me.
So, I think you can be happy to be a man, and you know how to create a dream music.

The East Water Prosecutor will be three-dimensional with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Sovereign Mary's over 25 years has been overcome to save Princess Pich from the evil Lap Boizer, but never before he did it in three dimensions: "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of girls in stereoscope technology.
The exhibition in the world's shops in this month was created, taking into account the character of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows to play in three dimensions without need to use the points.
"Maryo is a hero who must report how to work without the eyes," said the Head of the Ninting Premier in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the presentation of the game in Madrid.
Alvares said that "Super Mario 3D Land" is the first video game of Nintendo, which is particularly developed under this platform, because the successful products of "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D" were adaptations of existing games.
The representative of Nintendo said that although there was 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is "available" video game that allows to be a fast and moved game.
Alvarez said that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part of the "fair" to bring less experienced users.
One time, most of the experts will go on the second round at the level of the game that is now more complex.
In addition, users can choose real time between "D aggressive" or those who only affect the deepness of action, but they need to play in three dimensions to overcome different obstacles and "not to optical illusions".
This surrounding in three dimensions also marks the return of hero to a portal console, which has not occurred since 2005.

Colume guarantees the Portuguese Extradition in the United States
The Chairman Alvar Colume said on Tuesday that Alfonso Portilo was starting to respond to the United States for the displacement of $70 million.
This is the process that Guatemala had responded to the request of a north country that had requested Portilo to judge it there.
At the Press Conference, Columbus said that his decision was linked to the independence of judicial and executive authorities, taking into account that the court of the first institution has already signed extension.
He stated that during his mandate he had not "laid hands" to legal decisions and took all the extradition procedures he had ever known.
However, from Portilto Serchio Ruanno Marrokin will be extracted for murder and severe corporal disasters, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Parades, both for drugs.
What Colom has been done, shows the executive process after the expulsion of all legal and constitutional courts to pursue the State from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and of the Constitutional Court (CCS), Portugal will be extracted one time with a decision on his legal situation in Guatemala and its guarantees of human rights.
Portilo was recognized by unlawful in the costs of Q120 million in the Ministry of Defence during the presidency period, which was a process of extension, but the Ministry of Public Relations made an appeal and has revealed the case.
Trinijove helped young people from risk groups
Organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education
The first 25 years of Trinijove social support organization was important: 6,000 young people underlying social illusion have helped overcome complex situations during this fourth century.
This should be added to more than hundreds of workers established for the social group.
The age had been conducted for ceremoniums carried out in the ancient Fabra I Coats building, where more than 300 people came.
Trinijove occurred along the Trinitat Wella in 1986 to help youth people with a lack of education, lack of work and problems with drugs or marginalization.
The first day in Sant Andreu was gathered a large number of responsibilities and institutions that cooperated with the Association in these 25 years.
Different political presentation during elections showed the unique character of the work made by Trinijove.
Following the Chairman of Generalite, Architecture Mass, and his former Chairman Hordi Puhola, the ceremonium visited the Ex-Agency Adviser of Social Education, Erneste Maraul, and the ex-Lentant of the man and the present economicist, a member of the municipal Council of Richard Goma.
The present adviser for social well-being and family, Hosp Luis Cleris and SEO on the social work of La Caixa, Ham Lanapa.
He said that Trinijove was a very difficult time and that the current period was too hard, but added that the work made up until now is "a good base."
The Chairman made Trinijove as an example of fighting the evil circumstances and the unions of hope in people that were difficult.
"Crisis is not new for organization and work made by her," he said.
Conservated building where the massacre feasts were organized, evacuated
11 of the 13 building stations on the Balmes Street, 51
12 Accopats left the building yesterday south without fight
It seems that the cosmeer overlooked by neighbours living in the house of 51 on the Balmes street came to the end.
Twenty persons in the middle of the middle of sudden, have left the building that they had unlawfully occupied and where they had organized mass festivals that were angered by neighbouring court without interfering to the police.
When the operation was completed, the door locks were changed to prevent the situation again.
"That's going to be a loss control here," said the manager.
The 11 of the 13 buildings, the rest of the buildings, have dedicated all electricity and parts of water, have disrupted walls and have left a different kind of follow-up, particularly banks from alcoholic drinks.
The first three stages were a space for the massacre feasts that had been held until two days and angered the owners.
The building is immediately a night club, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Mary Pakistan, reported Europe Press that since the house was occupied, the revenue was declined to 80 per cent.
The owner of the club said that the building skills had put it in an injust sense, since they sold drinks for three euros, while in the club for 10.
Furthermore, the owner of the disketa should have responded to the complaints of neighbourings, although, as she noticed, the noise was called by the visitors of the club, and, above all, those who visited the partys that were organized, often and intensity that had grown as said the disappointed neighbourhoods.
The lord of the club said that the disasters were so great that she even reached agreement with the owner, and that's now nine months as he forgets her for the payment of the apartment.
The town police also reaffirmed that the last week has received more complaints from neighbourings on the situation.
The President of the municipal group PP, Adviser Albert Fernand Dias, requested the past week " to evacuate the building to address the problems of coherence and the general spirit appeared in neighbourings and degradation in this area."
The Populary Leader explained that only one stage of building had been occupied, but in the last few months the shots had been caught into all stages and practical in each room and that some of them had been accompanied.
In this sense, he added that "I need to put the end of immorality and to oppose the unculturality created in the building."
So yesterday, the police members evacuated the building in New Barris.
In 15:30, the police went out to Monttrell street, 35 after receiving a neighbor's call, he noted how four people were entered into the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architecters agree with the possibility of competition after the contribution presumption
Municipal competition at 16 doors renewed debates on the role of Colessrola in Barcelona
During the middle of 80s, the Barcellon Society of the Barcellona (CBC) is the administration of the printing of a forum flower for Colesrola.
The bucket described the mountain as a capital park of Barcelone.
Moreover, this was a comparison in pictures with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CCB, the park again took place in recognition of many as the higher point of Barcelone as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few which were not directed to the north-South, and up (to top).
Position of Colesrol as a natural park is contrary to this idea.
The Prototype was not the Central Park, but Yelloustoon, with a wild castle in the Jogi’s Royal.
It was so, until in September, the Council had not announced huge warnings from 16 concurrences to the multitude of other gates in Colesurola.
The idea of the park is under the doors, unfortunately.
Or if anybody wants to put a tour on the ground.
Question is one: Colesrola, park or mountain?
The establishment and their organizational parties, and their impact on the city, are the subject to discuss all architecters of Barcelone.
This is not the only reply topic discussed when the two members of the elected persons will find one another in the letter.
The fact is that one of the few agreements between the three architecters of Barcelone and the scientists present.
Miguel Rolddan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayon: Decrease is reasonable
For Rolddan, after reaching the sealine, it is "necessable" to discuss the "head of the mountain", when the proposal of Iddenphon, the mountain with green irons, was not implemented.
"I need to let that the greatest Barcellona park is sweet.
Besides everything, thanks to his beautiful accession.
The coller's more difficult, said the architectur for which the title of the Collestrol Tor contains a "sleep shot," we don't have to think about them "as the entrance in the park, but as about the limits of some zones where we have to work."
Like Roland and Banion's experience in the city building, he called the proposal of an intellectual task with "no danger."
The Ricks who are deprived of the "indetermination of public space prevention" after the experience of the 80s that ended on the Forum of his League Songs.
The first fear is the own border where you can build.
"Delimiting something is the preparation of the next step," means the transition.
"We must think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [the current] in terms of the capital plan (GSP) can lead to real disaster."
Nearly, Moldova believes that the cleaning of the Colesrola valley might be considered as a park, Barcellona, not as a pure bombography question.
It is likely to recall that there's already a work done outside the border of Calsola, which "although he's not supposed to go through the possibility that the manager offers his profession to enter into the project "after the beginning."
Moreover, it understands that the nearness of the mountains to the city is a provision that allows the architects to enter into debates, but "no doubts" is whether this technical profile is that the interdisciplinary commands should be managed.
Byon suggests that the response to the question that calls for this part, as the rules of competition does not have a general view: "There was 16 overseased competitors," he said, "in the meaning of the sea, but there is no enough reading to see and understand the area as a whole."
It is at least due to 16 competitors.
On the other hand, a project for one gate could be overwhelmed by the programme and defined by the project of neighbour gates.
From your view, the Council is encouraging to ensure that the roads directly on Ronda-de-Dalt should ensure in its entire area equipment for the establishment of a flood cross between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrababal and he will be released.
After 72 days of regulation, the Representative Red Casino forgived the brother of Monterrey in the process of prosecution against him.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrobaal will be released after the legal representative of Red Casino gave him remission to the Second Criminal Court, which leads the proceeding process against the brother of Monterrey.
After Casino Royale, owner Red Casino, Serchio Gil Garcia, published a series of photos and videos, where like Manuel Yonas requested him to pay the economic contribution to the powers of Monterrey to allow the secret operations in an Hungarian house.
After public conviction, the State Prosecutor opened a criminal case against the brother of man and 2 September was arrested and held in prison for 30 days.
Four hours before the Office of the State Crimes Office, he was sent to a temporary prison placed in the former capital of the State.
In that place, it remained 49 days, following the requirements of the second order of prohibition after the prosecutor excluded crimes against experts and organized crimes.
On 19 October, he brought him to Caderith for half-minute dogs to the owner of Red Casino, but he was only a few hours in prison with the middle of the prison island because he was threatened by death.
The authorities allowed him to continue the burden in the municipal prison of San Nicolas in Harz.
On 25 October, the sentence of the Second Criminal Court was issued by the Secretary of the Second Criminal Court, Horh Janez, who said that after almost two months the investigation was sufficiently proof of Jonas, such as the expenditure of 1.5 million of the Bukmeker representatives in exchange for the release of operations.
On Monday, the Legislative Representative Red Casino, Victor Aldo García Gomes, presented before the judge of Hose Luis Pesis, to ask for the brother of the manager of the region, so that the next time he could get free.
During the trial, the public prosecutor at the court, Ramiro Arias asked whether he had damaged, and who were of the gorgeous house partners, although the lawyer tried to not call on the name.
Based on writing 197/2011, the legal mistake was granted by Jonas Larrababala, and then cannot be made any statements on the process planned against it; and no damage and punishment was required.
After the hearing of the legal representative, almost 15:50, Larrabal Bretton was ordered to release immediately.
The prosecutor, Horhae Janes, went into the municipality of San Nicolas to Harz to report Jonah that he was legally forgiven and his case will be closed.
He will also inform him of the immediate sentence of liberation signed by the judges.
The Minister of Dinnio Transs House tells the details of the catastrophes where the Ministry of Internal Affairs, France Blake, and still seven people.
The Ministry of Related and Transport (ICT) reported that the results received by unfortunate cases in which the Ministry of Internal Affairs had lost Frances Blake Mora and seven other persons have shown that the ventilator had been touched directly on the land in full integrity without attempt of a payment of airport.
During the Press Conference, Dionizio Transs Hake, Minister of Links and Transport, said that before the aircraft was up, the pilet found that the погодal conditions were intended for the field.
"The Electrics who seem to show that the ship had a few contacts with the earth, the wings came into contact with the trees at 25 meters where the flass was lost."
He also reported that the ship was designed for 19 persons accordingly, it agreed with the necessary requirements for the transport of people.
He also said that studies conducted in the aggregate area were not reported on the land's parts.
" The research reports that there are no ship components in the other place, the impact of the structural integrity has occurred.
" The aircraft was designed for 19 passengers that satisfy the relevant requirements of the passenger transport.
The earth in this place has seven to 30 degrees.
At this time, the Secretary said, the main--reaching results are as soon as possible; however, the research may take a few months or even one year.
However, Gilberto Lopes Mayer, Director-General for Airports and Assistant Services said that, during the attack of the President's flood, he was managed to the cross-search speed and what was done on a slightly higher ground.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of the usual birth manager at the time of the attack," said he.
At the press conference, the SCT owner, Transs House, renumbered six important elements in investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the Aviation Rules, the airline has been implemented under the visual rules, which means that the team should be visible during field and landing.
Annual terms:
AICM members have shown the proper conditions for aircraft when the aircraft moved to a border territory between the city of Mexico and the Mexico State, where the bulletins were observed at low heights.
Selected flags:
It may be because of the terms of the team's area, looking for a lower height and more visibility in the Kuernava valley.
It's a slaughter place.
The Coordinations of the flag and the latest records of the aircraft may not have been lost or changed in the field.
Float displacement in small area:
Available information shows that a bucket has occurred on the front and side line.
The disappearance of the bulletins has noted that the ventilator has infringed the land within the structural integrity.
There was no clear signs of race or extinction found:
In the area, there are non-empty evidence in the boats of the ship, some kind of explosion or rain.
The results of recent research show that many contacts could be landed.
During work on place, the aircraft was found at 9,200 feet above sea levels, the land has 7 degrees to 30 degrees.
On images, it shows the follow-up to which it was destroyed by the way.
Information contains facts that seems to show that the ventilator could have a number of grounds.
Following a greater investigation on a larger territory than the removal of the place where a catastrophe occurred, no parts of the aircraft were found, which strengthens the suggestion that aggressive has occurred in the structural integrity conditions.
MSS announces the research programme
The Social Protection of Finance Research Research for Children and Young People; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexicon Institute for Social Protection (MSSI) declared that research was conducted in order to discover the genius of nutrition in children and young people, which has received the Protocol " Gender Gender in Child and adolescent," which provides account of the signs related to the resulting weight.
In his statement, Chapter of the Health Unit of the Biochems Research Unit of the National Medical Centre of Miguel Crus Lopes explained that a multiprofessional team was gathered from theaters, the doctors, diagnostics and social workers.
This team supports specialists and members of the National Health Institute (NPH) and the Centre of Science and High Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Technical Institute (NPI).
The population (proscribed or not) is invited to take part in the MSSI sporting centres that have participated in the research valley of Mexico, where every sabbath will be held from 8:00 tomorrows.
He emphasized that the Protocol started a sporting center in Kuautmake (in the West of Mexico) and that from 8 October the activities were held in the Nassaualpalett centre in the Nassauátle (Est of Mexico).
Following the objective of accession from 500 to 600 children, the investigation is continued in the sporting centre of Independence ( South Mexico) and finally in Morelos's sports centre (see Machiko).
He explained that the goal of this research was to understand the genetics and importance of food development and to establish risk factors between children and youth Mexico to prevent chronic degenerative diseases
14 November will be noted by the World Day against the Diabet, and the main goal is to gather three thousand children and adolescents from 6 to 14 years with the invitation of parents and under their view for individual food actors.
They will also ask the physical activity and the story of family heritages to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or independence.
He explained that the Sabbath would be conducted antagonic dimensions of all participants (which, growth and covering) and the measurement of blood pressure and levels of glucose, livestock, cholesterin and insulin and genetic analysis (for identifying genies related to child burning).
Crus Lopes said that this study reflects the concern of health experts concerning the damage of the weight of children.
The medical studies conducted from 1999 to 2006 indicated that overall six years had been grown: in the case of the boys, 77 per cent of feeding, the 47 per cent of girls and the lower weight has also observed significant growth” said the MSSI special.
He said that the accuracy of trademarkers was based on the fact that the population of the country was different from other peoples in their genetic history.
He added that the medium Mexico is 65 per cent of the seeds of the American Indians, 30 per cent of the seeds of Europe and 5 per cent of African seeds, and that circumstances reflected genders related to diabetes and weight.
He explained that the results of the genetics of the organism is inability to raise the results of the energy that we need (calory) and it is delayed in the form of food.
The Research explained that the direct benefit for the participants was a comprehensive assessment of children that could find whether they had any lack of weight or feed.
Even though he said that there was a dark chain (pairs) and preparations means the probability of violations of metabolism and even prevention.
Information is addressed to all confidentiality, the doctor transmits it in writing to parents with which they explain all dimensions and changes in the form of life that should be undertaken to avoid disease.
Kyrus Lopes explained that there are three main reasons for the benefit of the gap, warming and other chronic diseases: the seats of life or the lack of daily physical activity, the greater part of the house before television and the use of small distances in places to pass through peak.
This is also due to the high consumption of collory, and it is also increased in the use of soft drinks and drunks (atmall, bread, pants, hamburgers, etc.) with the large containers and proteins and the genetic provision of this programme.
UNAM is able to escape the trips.
Raphael Erra, the Chemical Faculty of UNAM, has developed a polymer-modified battle to produce the best quality, sustainable impact on the environment and temperature.
If the signals sent by road cover, it would be necessary to remonish approximately 200 000 mm on each rain area in the capital area of Dalland Mechiko, Raphael Errera Nahrer, the chemical factor of UNAM, and adds that if the construction and containing a adapted road cover, the number of cups may be reduced or overly linked to zero.
The technological consideration of the irons read under the International Chemical Year reports that the Laboratory for which he is responsible develops a polymer-discified battle for the production of rays with biomed characteristics, but the best resistance to the high and low temperatures.
Erra Nahre said that this type of modernized biotom could be used in the places where the погод is extremely warm, such as in some cities in the north to improve the quality of the road and, therefore, contrary to the education of it.
He explained that the batteria is the most crucial part of the nefti-like moleculose, some of the high moleculal mass called asflenten, and other low moleculal mass called moltanees, which together make a road cover of its characteristic liquor behaviour.
The bintome behaviour is that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees he leads himself as the heavyness, with 120 its bonds is very high, and at 50 degrees on the Objective he maintains almost strong state, while the very low temperatures of batteries becomes crop, he said.
This means that the contradiction of the helicopter is not permanent, but changed during the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, said the chemical engineering specialist.
The scientists noted that the Mexique streets were mainly covered by dry coverage, which consists of six samples of materials, including three last battle.
Among the highest slots, the battle consists of small stones left in battle and then suspended.
Each stone that covers it was said to be loaded in battle.
In the movement of vehicles and an example of efforts, it helps the forces to be very well distributed on road cover.
If it was a modified asset, they would be better distributed, he said the chemical engineer.
He added the last ball called the ground of the expenditure made from a small stone, actually also the skin of a laid in the athletes.
As this is a ball that will be contacted with the cars of the vehicle, it must be more resistant than a self-detection and provide a road trip.
As part of the road cover that will receive and disseminate the data of the contributions also requires appropriate specification and needs to take into account the material that it is prepared.
Food, particularly the power of the temperature and the oversight of the temperature, also are very important factors for consideration, particularly water, because it has significantly increased the assets.
When the land is black, the water is covered and it's difficult to get out of there, it causes the location of all the grounds of covering and then the education of it.
In the education of it, he said that the first amount of expenditure was discovered and that is only the result of the battle, but the decrease is not immediately done, the process which should be given attention to the first signs of the current record programme.
Also, a member of the National Research System explained that the transport load is another important factor in the education of the board, and therefore the threshold of each cover should always be related to the transport load and needed to ensure the fulfilment of the requirements to prevent the frequencies of it.
Raphael Errera said that a lot of biotom still needs to be studied and to do, for example, battle emulsions that already have been on the market in other countries and even help to make mines easy and without use of high temperatures.
What was the candidate from Wale to become the new Mrs. Columbia?
Analysis of the reasons that allowed Serne Melin Ramis to get the Queen of Mrs. Columbia.
The representative of Vel had received the title of the Principles 14 times.
The first time, Wale-del-Kauca was just wanted to take Mrs. Columbia's Queen.
At this time, Melina Ramis Serna had to be satisfied that it had been caught in the event of the winners with a silver and a lamb which proclaimed her new President of Colombia.
In view of the results of the past evening evening in Cartahan, where Miss Atlantic wind the coron and the sikipeter, the Department was ready 14 titulated princes, and Melina joined the lésion of women from Wale-del-Kauca, which were close to the coron, but were found priorities, among them, the Mirias Ospan in Benoit (1987), Claire Borrero Domingez (1949), the Patricia Belgium Ala (1979), Lorean Alabare (1981), Rouze Marrio Alssate (1983), Olymara Maria Arsen (1987), Lella Blanka (1988), Montana Estern (1989), Maurice Péa (1990), Däelah (1990), Elean Heelah (1993), Ele Haséan (1993), Elesa Elesa Elsa Eleah (Alesa Eleah), Eleah, Eléa Eléa Heréa, Eleac), (1993, Eleha), Elefa, Elefa, Herza, (1993
The question that many are now asking:
Because it was the result of the major factory that showed in each statement that she had all to become a new Miss Columbia, not just that she was elected by the King of Police and the most beautiful person on Vogue's version, the titles of which the Kings, such as Tatjan Wargas or Navarro, had received the Queens of Columbia.
The first factor playing the role in the decision of the jury to condemn her the title of the First Principe was that she was not able to answer a question: "What book characterizes you and why?
She answered the questionnaire:
"I'm a lot reading, I believe in the literature, I think it's a form of culture, and I'm certainly thinking that the book which characterizes my childhood, the Most Prince, is a very deep book.
Today, I read "Prevention and punishment" is a head of the world literature, which would all have been to be clear, and at this time I read the book of Iran of the Nemrosian, Russian writer, a wonderful book named "The Law Jar".
Answer that did not like the jury because of the terms "culturalization" and otherwise because he did not explain specifically, as each of its proceeded books characterizes.
But after the ceremony of Melina said she was quiet and pleasant to her result: "The whole mud, is happening what must happen."
And you're all, please, read a little, "The Moon Prince" is a great book.
In the middle of the hypothesis, Wales had a favoritism.
The reporter from Godota suggested that since it had been mentioned, it was a candidate who had received all the pre-provisional rewards (Oster’s curiosation for the best national coast, and the King-Mate), “when he made the jealousness of other candidates, a street in the Queen, and as a result she did not come to the wall.”
This was noted during her first event in the buyer at the hill area and during its two orders for the feast of the coronation.
While both of them were sure, it was noted that she had noted the power and energy that had demonstrated the representatives of Magdalene and Atlantics.
Ariel Ossorio, the rk home journalist of the RCN, said that the fact that Milan was named Princess, " means that the candidate, who has more rewards during the competition, does not become a Queen."
Furthermore, the Representative of Wave recently escaped with the press and it was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that the representative of Way had tried to convince the jury in its interest in social work, which is finally accounted on the sovereignty of the National Curvancy.
This is why two days before the election of a member of the International Jury Lucia Dotti said they were looking for a woman that had a social need to their country.
"We must look out not only on the outside but also focus on public awareness, before they take part in the competition, they must already be included in the project," she said.
There is also a proposal that the Representative of Wales had sinned by defects on the hedicians and the philosophy that had been identified on her animal, but it was disputely, since the judges noted it particularly as a candidate with " natural beauty," taking into account the healthy body, the good food and the responsible physical work.
King Horhah Ern Oscock notices that Melina had not the best body that were, "but the problems of the fiberry of animals that were not very noted for me have been lost the last day."
In addition, the journalist of Guvio Oyos of the magazine, in addition, believes that a error of the representative of Wale-de-Kakuka was that it was a chirurgic interview.
" Operations are good, but the representative of Wale does not know how to do.
Her body never was her privilege, and here she was for this.
With regard to the deceased first time by the National Room Conkursian organizations, the cruel prediction occurred last night, said that this was a deal that Ryana gave a compensation for her pleasure to get the corn.
Thus or not, the fact that Melina has started a government year today, not as a king, but as a princess, which allows her to represent Colombia to one of the international harmonization specified by the National Conkursators.
However, it is a story, as one of the Queen, who, despite its highest statement on the concurrence of the Cartahana, had made difficulties at the receipt of the coron.
This was the work of a person who recognized the body of Alfonso Cano.
Criminalist from Cali went into the story as a person who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of those servants is key.
4 November, the CTI Kaley Criminal crime entered into his story as a person who confirmed the personality of Chapter FARC Alfonso Cano for the consent of his fingerprints.
Of the seven criminalists working in CTI this week, Elizaar Honlos, a person of Puerto Tehad, who had 21 years in the field of prosecution.
At the beginning of his carrier Honsles worked in the towns of Chuck, where he was often to take more than five days after Juneles to reach the places where the body had to be identified.
In 2000, he moved to Wales and became a criminalist specialist in the field of criminalists, which studied the three kits, i.e. Ladonnes and stars.
On the week of the Elisear's recognition operation, known as Alfonso Cano, he said to take his clothes over three days.
Something was close.
He arrived on Tuesday's bathroom from Cauca to Polarmura.
He knew that he had to be recognized two bodies, and one of them was supposed to be part of a man who had been a ruler of the elderly Palestinian war in the world, so they asked him to take the ten depics of the Gilermo Leone Saison (the actual name).
However, when he arrived with a research team at the place where the body was, he did not recognize him on the outside area; he was very different from the media.
He was without battle, clothes as a local farmer, without eye and greatly hurt.
But the impressions won't fall.
Using a growing stack, black, skin and basinark, Elizaar made the fingerprints of the body's finger with those who were on the scenes.
His eyes weren't lifted. It was Alfonso Cano.
On the same night, the representative of Puerto Tehad requested the Minister of Defence of Huan Carlos Pinson to confirm that it was the leader of RVSC
Find Fingerprints
For the advice of the Sijin unit to Cali a specialist in the field of the donorscope of the Sijin unit, the recognition received by President Hanan Manuel Santola, Elisezar, on the press conference on the operations against Cano, it is particularly meaning.
Many people don't know our work.
The Dactloscope is a crucial science, without mistakes, it can play a key role in the discovery of crimes.
In addition to the identification of the body, the addicts take part in the investigation of crimes such as race and murder, and establish the personality of detainees.
Many criminals have subsequent appreciation or do not have documents.
We're taking their impressions and looking for them in the base.
The investigator said that in the case of the best he had to take the walls of the house because the portal had hands on this place to possess a self, full of precious and money.
"Their walls are hard to work, because they are not an appropriate surface for the removal, but, in this case, we can make a note of the whole ladona and establish the personality of the offence who took part in several battles," he states.
The experts also help to exclude or establish the participation of the suspected cases related to the murder.
Recently, there was a dead man with the buckets from under the climb around it.
The consequence was determined that the crime could be undermined by the parents and, in fact, the patents were confronted on the bottle.
Although it does not ensure that he was killed, it shows that he was on the place of murder.
The ICT specialist explained that the chemical or physical reactor on the place where there is species.
When they are discovered, it's used a gun or a winter to take them.
After this, the patents are sent to the Asif, which is the database of the offenders, or are included in the register.
"There is that we still have a lot of unrecovered Colombians," said the CTI expert.
He explained that not all were shown in the CSI telegram.
Like it's not the gold you're black, it's not everything you're crazy.
However, if it is possible, the comparison will be produced.
"Deployed people" throw calls to the powers of New York
Those protestists scattered the camps in the area of Zukkotti.
Often the protesters listened to the decision of the court of the divorced demonstration from the area and went into the neighbouring park.
Members of the World Street movement were thrown into the Tuesday of New York, when they tried to go back, under the protection of the court order, on the Manhattan area, from where they were evacuated to education in trying to protect another park of the Great Jable.
Those protesters were copied at the Zokott area where they wanted to be sentenced by the prosecutor order that had allowed "defended people" to cast camps on the ground until the other part of the movement answered to the disappearing park in the north city where the rest of the arrests were carried out.
"Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to disappear the camp on the ground, we're leaving a camp somewhere else and continued judicial fight for return to Zukott and the peaceful settlers and demonstration," said one of the representatives of the "Cook Wall-Strit" Mark Bray.
Brey explained that the response of "excluding people" to the evacuation of the Palestinian City, which was given by Mr. New York Blumbergom, was sentenced to the court where the court of Lusse Billings had made a decision prohibiting violence from the area and allowing democrates to stay in the camp.
Furthermore, "exclusioned people" came to the closure of the new park situated in the central street of Canal Stritt and Sixth Aven, along from the entrance to the town of Holland, connected to New York and New Jersey and the ownership of the Trinity Church.
At least they could take this place, but then the police came and arrested some of the protesters, although Brie could not call the exact number, but said Ephes, he saw several journalists that were also in the hands.
The organization believes that several hundred people have been patents in the place where the delegation of religious leaders sent to demonstrate support to the movement members, seeking to speak as a mediator in police negotiations.
Nevertheless, the Zokotta area, which is a private authority, remains closed in the expectation of the prosecutor's hearing appointed for that Friday, which is considered the law of the divorce of the Protestants today.
Some of the protesters sent down and spread at the same time the copy of the sentence and even given the copys of the police, the protective area, which brought to " any small capitals," he said that some police killed demonstrants.
The Court of Justice prohibites the authorities to evacuate the movement members of Wall-Streat and to impose the "legs issued after the start of the detention or to prohibite demonstrators to get access to store parks and other property used before. "
Mr. Blumberg said to the reporters that, because of the decision of the town, the opening of public space and demonstrations had been informed, but local laws do not allow them to disappear paleton stores and swims.
Member of the municipal Council has personally justified the removal of protesters from the area of Zukottti, the operation during which about 200 arrests had been completed, and the decision was adopted in this regard because the protestants “lawed the law.”
Blumberg said that he gave a order to clean the surface, because it became a "meat where people came not to protest, but to violate the law and, in some cases, harm others," as "other enterprises have been threatened" and the neighbourers were concerned "for the heavyness of life."
The evacuation conducted this morning was deprived and showed that Blumbberg's soul is more interested in the protection of the financial interests of the American workers," added a representative of the movement that condemns the “no respect for the freedom of words”.
The responsibilities for " Building Wall Strit" also indicated that they intend to organize "green" actions in Thursday, in collaboration with public organizations and prosecutors to remember the last two months of protests started 17 September.

The second quarter, which was registered in the second quarter, begins in March 2012, also makes the fastest growth rates from January to March 2010.

In fact, the company has increased their investment to 1.1 per cent against the decrease of 0.9 per cent of capital costs observed from January to March, the first reduction of six months after uninterrupted growth.
However, the real crossing in the Japanese economy is not only based on the Kinessian impulses, which calls for use of the crisis for reinforcement or restructuring the infrastructure, using bottles to grow.
Japan was mainly conducted by the development of household agricultural consumption, which is now 60 per cent of the Japanese PIB.
This indicator has increased 1% by increased costs on cars, travels and delays.
Practices
Tokyo provided an internal market when the Japanese Valuta has become one of the chosen investors, who wanted to escape from a long crisis in the euro and negative projects regarding the United States, a privilege that gives, as a stone, under the exporting companies.
In the worst price of the cost production, it is a serious attack for countries whose economic rate is defined by the health of large technological companies.
Toyoto or Sonny, for example, exempt iona in their low indicators from July to September.

Athinians give the air for doubts
The patient said that the correction would be approved, but the reservators will not sign any written obligation
With the perifer prematures for risk and uncertainty in parks, Greece continues to be on the Labirinth, which leads to the outcome of the great long-term European crisis.
It feels that the "consent" of the new transitional Government of Ellass is more contrary to the requirements of Brussels than the real conviction of political forces, is starting to be reaffirmed by facts.
While the new Minister, Minister Lucas Paddamis yesterday, announced that the alternative to structural reforms was not and that the 100-day period agreed at its appointment could be not enough for their application, the leader of the Conservative Party of New Democracy, Antonis Samarus believes that it would not support the new strict economic measures in any case and again repeated its demand on the new elections designed by 19 February.
The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions taken at the same day on 26 October, by opening the parliamentary debates, which belong to the housing of the new executive authority tomorrow.
The package of 24 employment programmes, the reform of the discipline of public officials and new measures to combat the loan of payment will be first news.
Nevertheless, the letter of Samaritah does not explain any doubt about his position: "We are ready to help the transition government, but we promise nothing."
The leader of Conservators made a further step in its EU and ICF devices, organizations that should develop 8,000 million needed by Athinos, and explained that he would not approve any letter on the agreements of the treaty requirements.
However, the European Commission, still attempting the anger against the effect made by the approval of the Patterian Referency's referendum to all or nothing, repeated that her requirements were one-defined: it would not renew aid if the new Government and the leaders of the Greece would not sign "when any doubtless agreement and as soon as possible."
The representative of the Ministry of Economy Amdau Altafay said that the three inspectors can "sighly back to Athene to discuss with the new Government " what should be done to pay for the sixth trading" of 8,000 million, although the exact date is not yet defined.
In the Greek club, there's still a while.
Mrs. Sophia: "There are instruments of progress and hope."
The King underlined the "based" place of Spain concerning this financial type
Hispany "laid a clear place in the world in microfinance."
The King of Sophia recalled that in the last two decades the country was the second donor in respect of cooperation tools whose "the reality," she said, it was that it was the "project of social progress, justice and hope of the best future of humanity based on faith in people.
The Queen opened yesterday the Fifth World Summit on the Mixture in Waladald with the conviction that " there is no doubt," that such actions were " perfectly necessary" to achieve the objectives of the United Nations until 2015, and "in particular in order to reduce the number of people living less than one dollars per day, the level of which is "fair poverty".
Hispany, "all still works" to expand the world's network and take this task with all the "competence", says Sofia, and hopes that the efforts and achievement resulting during the same event that will continue to be held in fourth, will "provide new opportunities and best opportunities for the poorest people, and especially for women "funded recipients of these judgments."
There's a little achievement and a great difficulty that we're faced.
The micro-related Summit is not only a sport area, but also a platform that contributes to " two main objectives".
Its Majesty therefore explained that it hoped to the end of 2015 that 175 million poor families were used for these financial services and 100 million of these households will be elected from the poverty they have been loaded.
The Impulsus to create the micro-related system in Spain and the rest of the world, "God by the beginning of the year ago" by Muhammed Юunis, emphasized Mrs. Sofia as "the act of justice and recognition."
And she described the father of this tool as an "a widespread ideal in the event of fighting poverty" whose work was held for 15 years since the queen went to Bangladesh to study his credit policy.
This year after the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings, such as in Côte d'Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "I saw all overall an uninterrupted development," said EE Majesty, whose link to this project yesterday the title "First Family" collected in Waledolyd.
Finally, the King of Sophia concluded a statement, invited the attendants to participate in the discussion and to find decisions to move forward to the fight against poverty.
"Ectical Imperial"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Trinidad Hamison said that solidarity was an "ethnical imoperation" for each democratic State.
Consequently, she said that it would be an error to link cooperation with developing countries with the time of the economic bum, as it is "continuous commitment".
The Chimison concluded that microcreditation was the "search and firm course to eradicate poverty" and that now "the larger than ever" Governments of developed countries should work in accordance with the solidarity criteria and will not allow it to become victims of cost reduction.
Spanish micro-relatedization is one of the main areas of cooperation for development.
The State Secretary for International Cooperation, Seraya Rodrigos, highly appreciated “saving” in bringing the “satisfied” persons before which all the doors were closed, and Mr. Walidididland Franciscus Haveer Leon de La Riva welcomed all the presents in the city which “aftered their doors with the spirit of solidarity”.
CADS proposes the election of the Chairman of the Euromed Mission to its vote
On the first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress, on Monday, 14 November, in Leipzig, was held without the major problems for the Console of the angels of Merkele, which was also President of the Christian and Democratic Party.
The future Europe has not been planned in the programme but has occurred itself in particular to satisfy assets who believe that the Government policy is not so far as far as it should be, in relation to Greece today and may be tomorrow in relation to Italy....
The draft resolution on the Presidency in the European Commission on the guidance discussion was adopted almost one-one.
Of the 1001 delegations only nine voted against and ten abstended from the vote.
The statements continued a few minutes that served their statements by the angel Merkel and a few hours later Walfang Shabel, Eurofil and Financial Minister have not left place for any doubt.
The main idea of the Concertler and the draft resolution is expressed in Lusasang: the faithful response of the crisis is not less than Europe, but more Europe.
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million workplaces are directly depending on the euro."
"The time is at the console" in Europe.
This may mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty that can improve the control of the European Union on the financial policy of the European Union, but it may also affect the elections of the President of the European Commission to the total vote, “to bringing the European person”.
In any case, it is one of the proposals of the draft resolution adopted by the Congress, which clearly belongs to Walphang Shoble.
Of course, it is little that twenty seven countries are agreed quickly with this decision; Britain is opposing that, and the Heads of HDC believe that Nicole Sarcosis is also contrary to it.
But the ground is prepared.
In the same way, the Deputy Deputys refused the proposal to highlight the voice of each country members of the European Central Bank in the management of the European Central Bank, in accordance with the size of the economy of each of them, which would noticely increase the growth of the german economy.
It was desired to appreciate the situation in its party, the Consorter has increased the number of references to the Adrian Conrade and Helmura Colola, but has not tried to affect the Congress by the " small" European countries or countries in a hard situation that would like to criticize " high-cost" Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe over the whole paragraph is attached to the importance of the German-France friendship, the angel of Marykel did not mention France.
It's just a mercy.
It was remembered that two centuries ago Leipzig became a scene of blood battle.
In fact, it was one of the lowest attacks of the Polymeon Army.
What is the threat to hospital letters?
Following money funds, UMP and the Government began an attack on hospital letters.
The 15 November Nikola Sarkozi will be held to Bordo to visit the family allocation fund and to address the issue periodically undertaken from 2007 to combat social assistance.
And to help this attack resulting from the desire to conceal in difficult situation but also part of the re-release campaign to the President, most wishes to concentrate on hospital letters.
First, in the meaning of the budget economy, the Government intends to bind private companies on the fourth day of unemployed release until the start of payment.
Of course, without a particular consent of the employer, the employer suffers the payment for four days equal to at least 15 per cent of its monthly income.
The measure that is threatening the turbulent of anger, but that, according to Les Ioos, will lead to the economy of 280 million euros.
This would be conducted by other measures with more symbolic effect, i.e. to bind public officials one day without payment for diseases (the judicial officials have not yet been waiting for payment, depending on a three-day expectation in the private sector).
Now, when these questions are discussed, most also re-examinate the subject of violence, meaning the abuse of hospital letters.
The control will be more heavy and added if you'll get it, you'll have to return all the payment you have been illegally received," said Casey Bertran on the channel on the Sabbath, 13 November.
As in other cases, the effect of the statement has been made of a few unrealised real abuse with hospital letters.
They are actually subject to permanent control and political attacks that bring their fruit.
People in France suffer more than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's first see the digits in the country.
According to the National Medical insurance Fund (CNAM) more than 237 million euros daily compensations were paid in 2006.
According to the Institute of Research and Documentation of Health Economy, 11.3 million euros were 5 per cent of the total health costs.
The amount of 46 per cent was related to decrease and inadequate consequences for production and 54 per cent of diseases, which were of 6.2 million euros.
Therefore, 2.5 per cent of health costs was 2.5 per cent.
France conducted a hospital in average 14.5 days in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to Alma Consulting Group studies.
The middle arithmetic, covering some disappearances; the second study issued in 2007 by the Monster.com carrier manager, showed that 75 per cent of the French employees had not taken any day of hospital.
Another study, at this time on medical insurance, states that in 2010 37 per cent of hospitals remained less than 8 days, 15 per cent of 15 days from one month, 15 per cent from one to three months and 11 per cent of more.
If these figures are compared with the numbers of European neighbourings, the French workers are not able to choose a hospital than any other country.
The long study conducted in 2010 by CNRS two researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001 the total amount of lack of work in France (for health or no) was between 10% and 11% compared to 20-28 per cent in Denmark, 15 per cent in the United Kingdom and 16-18 per cent in the Netherlands.
The level of offence related to hospital letters is very low compared to the green employment.
With regard to the level of minority, it is very low.
The application of the law after 2002 has resulted in a systemic testing of hospitals for more than 45 days.
In 2008, 13 per cent of 285,000 sentences on short-term disease were "related" or too delayed," which was 37,050 cases.
In case systemically checking hospital letters for more than 45 days, 11% of 1,2 million were "inconsistent or inconsistent", that is 132.000.
In general, 169,000 cases were "not found" for several millions of people who were hospital letters.
The figures showing very little cases compared to, for example, with the green job numbers.
According to the Deputy of the UMP Dominican Tyana, the author of the report on this issue in June are from 9 to 15,000 euros of the unemployed budget gains in the year, which exceeds the total costs of daily compensation, and, therefore, without end of loss of mine.
Opacity: Greece should follow a new set of resolutions
Greece needs a new settlement programme to save its economy.
On this reason, on Monday, 14 November, in the Chairman, Minister Lucas Pauzis, added that 100 days provided by his coalition government was not sufficient for the fulfilment of this task.
"To achieve economic salvation goals, we need to support our European partners and the new budget correction program," said the Head of Government who made his first public statement by opening a debate on this confidence in the Parliament in the middle of Parliament.
The implementation of the decisions adopted at the Eurosoon same on 27 October must be the "entry" task of the new Government, since the presence of the country in Europe was added.
Peace therefore proposes the reduction of the budget deficit to 9 per cent from GDP to the end of 2010 and 15.7 per cent in 2009.
Rights reject new Government measures
On Monday, Antonis Samarus, the leader of the Rights, made its support for the measures already taken to try to get out of a long crises, but announced that the party would not support additional economic measures.
"We will not vote for new measures," he said to meet the deputys of his New Democracy's party.
He expressed its consent with the challenges of reducing deficit and long-term and combating growth, but also with the absence of any rate that prevents the recovery of the economy.
Oly Ren, the European Commissioner responsible for the economy and the finance, which warned that IF and the EU do not deploy the necessary credit for eight million euros without written guarantees of all parties that they support planned measures, Antonio Samarrey answered that his words were sufficient and that he did not sign anything under external pressure.
The Committee of Experts requires evaporation and self-assassination with a voluntary assistance.
The Canadians are denied in death as approved in the report of the Kingdom Society of Canada
With regard to the polyvalent medicine, the Committee claims that the Government, health institutions and doctors are working together to ensure the best polyality assistance, and that does not consider the cancer cases.
The Canadians refuse to die.
Only 9 per cent of the candidates agree to say to their doctor when they want to die and take steps in this direction.
It is one of the findings of the imposed report of the Kingdom Society of Canada, which took part in six experts from different areas, including ethic, right and medical.
The Committee invites the Government to amend the criminal code to allow self-assassination with a voluntary assistance and an evacuation when the election is related to circumstances, and the patient can be considered competent to take this decision.
For the beginning, experts refer to the recent study of the Economic Expert Office, which compared the quality of death in the world in 40 countries.
Although Canada is on 10 places, the research notes that "Medicialization of death in Canada has become a culture in which people fear to dispute the subject of death."
As a result of medication or no, but 77 per cent of the Canadians have no access to polyal assistance reported the experts appointed by the King of Canada.
And 68.6% of them are dead in the hospital.
The highest rate of the country in Quebek, where 86 per cent of deaths are in the hospital.
On the issue of evatanasia and self-assassination with a special assistance by the authors of the report, the conclusion that is contrary to the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it would not want to change anything in the criminal code for evatany and self-assassination.
Now, in the words of experts that have also learned the position of all countries where such actions were legitimated or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization takes account of malnutrition in the use, the implementation of eutanosia or self-assassination with a special assistance against people who cannot or want to take such decision.
On the other hand, he confirmed at the Joselein Dawney Tele Conference, which submitted a report, most of these cases were exactly in countries where Eutanasia and self-assassination were not legitimated with multilateral assistance.
Eutanasia is practised in Canada where it is apparently illegate.
The same murdership with multilateral assistance is practiced in Canada where it is clearly illegately explained Joselein Dawney.
Canadians for Eutanasia
It should be remembered that 85 per cent of the Canadians are concerned by Eutannesia, because, according to the investigation of Angus Reid in 2010, they believe that it allows people to easily suffer.
66 per cent believes that evaporation will not be a sign of life of older people or disabilities.
With regard to people who helped self-employment, 41 per cent believes that they should not be criminal.
With regard to the duration or ceasing of medical income for sickness, the situation is less significant, the authors are reported.
They also propose, besides their other recommendations that the Criminal Code should establish that the legal cease of health was not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that the health specialists should learn in mind respect for medical care in the end of life without fear of criminal persecution.
With regard to polyalive assistance, the Committee calls upon the Government, medical institutions and doctors to work together to develop the best of possible polyality assistance, not only in the case of the cancer.
Finally, the Committee requires that it should be applied when it does not serve for creating physical pain such as Eutanasia and the same restrictions.
Notes of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already made comments on the conclusion of the report of the Government of Canada's experts.
Mr. Peter Deshhan, health law specialist, described the position of experts signed by the report, since, among other things, it does not limit the use of euttany by death cases.
This is opening the door for the situation where any person who has risen from life and who has more than 18 years may ask for self-employment, says the Meter of Deshan, who had discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
The Metro Desham also emphasized that the authors of the report seem to be the independence of the personality above all other values of society.
He said, "They have pre-conceived signs and prohibitions in the society."
Margaret Sommerville also expresses the " catalogic non-compliance with the conclusions of the report called "Menicity for Eutanasia".
Margaret Sommerville, who itself is a member of the Kingdom Society of Canada, refers, in particular, the reports on malnutrition in some countries where Eutanozia and self-assassination are legally legitimated, such as the Netherlands and the Orgonian.
King Jordan urged the President of Asad to enter into authority
Damascus condemns "convention"
Syria is all available in more isolation
The parties of Bahara Asad had demonstrated yesterday before the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Yesterday, the diplomatic pressure on Syrian Basara Asad was strengthened, which, with support of Russia, resisted and condemned the "life" against his country.

At its time, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Turkey Ahme Dawtogle expressed congratulacy that the median efforts of Turkey, which started at the beginning of this year, had not been achieved.
In the Middle East, who does not live in peace with his people and cannot satisfy his efforts, has lost authority, said, a neighbouring country of Turkey, with a worse course.
From their part, the United States welcomed the "development of consensus against Asad and the Syrian regime," followed by the Ligue of the Arab States and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the League of the Arab States and countries such as Turkey takes a stronger course on the repressions in Syria, noted Mark Toner, representative of the State Department.
At this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 armed forces died in the Danea region of South Syria, he reported the Sierran human rights observer (OSDH).
Two other people died during the crossings and slaughters in Jobar, in the dedicated city of Hams, according to the NGO.
At the press conference, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Syria, Walid Muallem stated that the country was close to the end of the crisis."
Furthermore, he replied the decision of the Arab States to exclude Damascus, which, according to his words, was a " dangerous step".
The Syrian will not be disappointed, and he added that this punishment against Syria will be disappointed."
Following its decision to exclude Syria of the Arab States, Liga has been studied on the “mechanism of the protection of civilians and requires 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of France, Allen Juppie, also was sent to observers from the United Nations to help protect civilians from the repression of the regime, which, in his words, fell into the “Parlan”.
The new emergency session of Liga was planned tomorrow in Rabate to discuss the implementation of the outcome plan adopted on 2 November and proposed, in particular, the outcome of armed forces from the cities where fighting are gone, and the release of arrested demonstrators.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Russia, Sergey Lavrov, yesterday, called the Liga of Arab States, while China called Siria to carry out a crises plan, but was detained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti requires time for the markets and victims from Italians
The future chapter of the Italian Government Mary Monty requested the markets a little time to establish its team and implement a programme that requires sacrifices to restore the credit capacity lost in the last few months of Berlasson government.

The European Union, who is convinced that Rome would not fulfil the observed budget for 2013, despite the plan of a close economy adopted in the past months, required, in particular, new short-term measures.
The Italian Boss Boss Emma Marchelloi, who meets him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need for the restart of the economy, “for the country that has not growth could not respect the deficit”.
Mr. Monti, known by its competence and independence in the arrival of the European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents the "change" for Italy after 17 years of the "blorconomism", "professor", symbolized "reality" and " different Italy" according to the authors of the translated authors.

The President of Napolitan would be glad to avoid short elections, since Italy should be implemented by April 2012 by the Government's long-term commitments for the amount of 200 million euros.
Russian scientists helped the Iranian Nuclear Programme
The Russian scholar Vichlord Dänemark helped Iran to develop a detonator intended for the use of nuclear weapons, confirmed on the afternoon of the American Agency specialized in the Atom danger.
The Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is on the recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA) and other documents of the United Nations Agency to establish the personality of the scientists.

In 1989 or 1991, he went out of the centre to create a company produced by the "no-natalmon" in Kyove.
The financial difficulties of his company brought it to contact Iranian offices in Ukraine in 1995.
He then cooperated with the Iranian programme from 1996 to 2002 before return to Russia
In his report, the IAEA recalls the “considerable signs of the development of the Iran system” of nuclear detonators, “the work of an extraordinary expert that did not only well know this technology but also reported the Agency that he worked most of his carriers on this technology within the Military Nuclear Programme of his country”.

This allows the opportunity to know if they publish messages if they are signed at new accents if they have the selected messages, etc.
This new form of Twitter has been protested "a small percentage of users in August" before a wide use of all the weekly network, AFP stated to the press section of Twitter Carlín Penner.
Twitter, who has long been known as intuitively unrelated and as using quite unnecessary terms (RT to resume the foreign message, #followfriday for the recommendation of other users), in the main part of the pleasure of experienced users, opens himself to a broader audience, representing users something more closer to popular social networks of Facebook and Google+.
The users have discussed this news with the Internet 'net'.
"It's inevitable, binding and shooter to remember Facebook."
The functional activity helps me better follow certain items of my stream in Twitter, written@dannykronstrom.
Austria
Implementation to the Constitution of the Budget Rule
The Guideline of the Great Social and Democrats and Christian Democrats in Australia has decided to write a budgetary "lined rule" in the Constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid the possible reduction of public credit agencies from Austria (A).
The Consorter and Democrat Verner Tayman has personally announced this decision at the end of the Ministerial Council, while the Australian State Debt is 74.6 per cent, which is significantly higher than the higher road of the rules of 60 per cent established by the Maastricht Treaty but below the public debt of the countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Australia has been paid on only one point from AAA to AA+, we should have paid for three million euros more than each year, then has led an argument of a cancerer and the Minister of Foreign Affairs from the Christian Democrates, Michael Shapindeleger.
Austria therefore fulfils the requirements of the Summit of European Member States on 26 October in Brussels; heads of States and Governments required reduction of budget deficiencies to the end of 2012 and return to balanced public accounts through the Constitution or equal law.
The position adopted by the Austrian Government recalls the German model, as Germany was the first European country accepted by it "good".
The structural deficit of the State Budget should each year be reduced to 0.75 per cent of the domestic product (PBC) and from 2017 the structural deficit of the State Budget of the Federal State in each year should not exceed 0.35 per cent of the GDP, and the land, such as communities, should represent balanced budgets.
The aim is to grant the State debt to be lower than 60 per cent established by the Maastricht Treaty, by 2020/2021.
Eskio Noda
threatens the new intervention on the monetary market
The Prime Minister of Japan, Eskico Noda, announced in the Tuesday that the Japanese authorities will make new interventions on the currency market if the values were still grown.
We're desperate how it was done last time when the exchange rate of the truth has explicitly explained Mr. Noda Sent.
On Tuesday, it has grown almost before the historic note that the Governments of Japan had built to the Intervention on 31 October.
That day Tokio sold an iona for the dollar to reduce the value of the Japanese Valut, which set up a new record of force since 1945.
But since that time, it is a roulder that is constantly prepared by investors who take it as a "user" in these disaster times of falling the economy throughout the world and a long-scale crisis in Europe.
In the Tuesday, the $77 fell below, and the euro fell below the symbolic planet in 105, close to the level that led to the last intervention.
The 2008-2009 financial crisis was estimated to approximately 120 euros and more than 160 euros.
The growth of the Japanese Valution is damage to Japan's export, as it makes Japan's products more ways and reduces the income of Japan's firms from the road to the conversion to a national currency.
"Japan fights to restore himself" after the earthquake and the tsunami on 11 March, which disappeared the region of Tohok (Oost East), emphasized Mr. Noda, which is concerned that the growth and the growth are killed by a huge reconstruction.
The third world's largest economic power renewed the growth in the third quarter -1.5 per cent compared to the previous quarter - first time in the first year, through the export growth and the use of households lost from the catastrophe.
But the Prime Minister feels that the high price of the ideas does not reflect the "financial economic indicators of Japan".
The Minister of Finance Dun Adsumi called for the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened the two-day meeting of his Montantary Policy Council, took all necessary steps to deploy.
However, the Vice-Administrator of the Hyrokida Institute of Jamagati announced that the Bank of Japan had already adopted "related steps", he understood that no additional reduction should be expected in the environment.
At the latest meeting, at the end of October, the emerging organization increased 5,000 million euros (47 million euros) to buy the Catholic Relations, up to 55,000 million euros (519 million euros) of the amounts that it provides for the purchase of different financial instruments in order to survey the markets of price booms.
Europe
Further growth, the funding boards are collected
The risk of an offence by a long crisis has disagreed the European indexs.
Despite the designation of new heads of States in Greece and Italy and improved growth indicators in France and Germany, the leading to non-State countries continues to grow
Still concerning the European stability, the European boats have gone on this Friday, 15 November, a little further in the negative zone.
At the 10th morning, the CAC has lost the 1,4 per cent of Paris and has completed the cost of paragraph 3.064.
DAX in France was 0.4 per cent and London was 0.1 per cent.
With regard to new difficulties with the payment of European countries in difficult situations, the funding markets continue to perish part of their recent achievements.
"Terri Pratt explains, the institutional IG Markets broker, quoted Reuter.
The toxic boat was closed by 0,7 per cent under the wages of new underlying market parties to the ability of Europe to hold a long crises.
"Japan, as the rest of the world, has resolved its view on Europe, and the jackets will follow each other in a core of changes until investors have been revealed that the situation has been stabilized," said Mishusa Akino, the Fund manager of Iiyoshi Investment Management
This is the return of concern about the future of the Euroon was fighting by a single valuable value that continued to fall on the ocean.
Euro reached its lower note over half a month.
At 10 morning, the European currency was $1,3570, and fell to 0.4 per cent.
According to the brokers, she falled after the Concert Concert of the angel of Merkel HDS in the week-end that was adopted resolution, in particular the opportunity for countries in a complex situation to leave the European Union without left the European Union together.
Italian and Spanish costs significantly above 6 per cent
The credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at large risks.
Tomorrow in the 10-year arrival of Italian 10-year-old areas reached 6.85%, and the income of Spanish disappearances with the same time reached 6.2 per cent.
These difficulties with percentage rates in southern countries, but also in France, continue to ensuring the danger of participants.
The Chapter of the future Italian Government, Mary Monty, requested the time saving to resume the situation in Italy under threat to paralysis under its debt.
The new Minister of Greece Lukas Pauzis confirmed that the implementation of the decisions adopted at the same time by 27 October will be the "based task" of his Government.
Hispany had been slacked by the markets before Parliament's elections on Sunday.
The percentage of 10-year-old commitments in Germany and Spain has reached a new historical max.
Awaiting growth number in Europe
France has fixed economic growth by 0.4 per cent in the third quarter, less better than those expected to 0.3 per cent, due to the increased use of households.
Despite this, the reduction of the second quarter was revised by 0.1 per cent of the brutal domestic product (PB) instead of the stability.
The fourth quarter is worried about the economy.
Germany, at the same time, has increased 0.5 per cent for the same period.
The first assessment for the whole euros is expected at 11 morning, the European Commission warns the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must be reduced over the dogma
If there is a theme to decide on which it cannot be taken after unproving discussion or in effect of emotions, it is an energy policy.
Availability and power of electricity directly affects the acquisition and competitiveness of companies.
This is a healthy trend that the electoral meetings are involved in the thinking of the peel and the places of nuclear energy.
There will be no fruit until all economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options will be studied.
France should build its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
We are now 7 million people on the planet, demographic development is the deployment of electricity needs to be made up to 2050, if only a large part of the world will not be freed of an important element.
During the same period, the growing deficiency of resources will be required to continue the production of electricity constantly, without forgeting the most important need to reduce port gas emissions to combat climate disappearance, the theme that is disappeared from environmental debates.
Aviation to Fokuma does not change any of these factors.
That is why Germany remains one in its decision to refuse nuclear energy.
This is not an accident of Belgium, which makes its decision dependent on the need to find a source that can replace nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which is intended to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, Great Britain, Finland, Poland, Czech Republic, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil are only few of those who are decisively continuing their projects.
The United States decided after Fokum to add one installation to its election, renewing the construction of the station, which was stopped after the airport at three-Milland.
Although the model of Germany based on renewed energy sometimes is an example, it is actually contrary to this argument.
The election of Berlin will have a result of increased energy value, increased energy dependence that has increased the need for importing gas, particularly from Russia, the combustion of gas emissions in connection with the construction of gas and carbon stations.
After a few months all these unfair effects will be emotional.
The example of Denmark should be considered.
The Europa ' s building Champion for Turkey, from which it receives 30 per cent of its electricity, the largest consumer of carbon and gas from the interrupted wind; the emissions of carbon gas and electricity respectively to 65 per cent and 50 per cent above in the average Europe.
On the other hand, thanks to the condition of our energy policy, our neighbours pay 40 per cent for electricity than French households.
Since the global energy price economy is a key factor of competitiveness and the aggregate of industrial equipment in the national territory, French companies benefit from the declined electricity in Europe.
Following this, any significant reduction of nuclear energy will lead to a large growth of electricity, which will make a beautiful statement on the new industrialization of our country and the protection of the purchase capacity.
The price that most of the French refuse to pay more because they do not reflect the efficiency in principle.
The energy policy of the country has been made possible to create industrial sectors in 125,000 direct workers and 410,000 buildings.
It is strongly orientated to exports, the whole task of specialized on the international trade of small and medium-sized enterprises and creates a lot of workplaces that cannot be moved to another sector.
If France decided to refuse nuclear energy, it should be granted a large number of these companies and lost six thousand euros a year from the French export of nuclear equipment and services.
What electric engineer will be ordered to the EPR calculated to work for sixty-year work if it is planned to close its producer?
In order to decide energy comparison, it should be recognized that there is no divine or devil energy production sources.
The development of the Areva company's decisions with a low emission of carbon gas, nuclear and renewed gas is shown that compliance with energy sources.
Nuclear energy support the highest security level is unfortunately an important issue.
In France we have the security body that carrys out an uncomfortable and transparent control of existing energy centres such as Flamanville.
Our teams whose professionalism is generally recognized are full of the same security.
For 50 years, atomic industries survived three serious incidents.
Only one, three-Milland, has occurred in normal exploitation, but without any impact on human or environment.
The reactor and an unprofit human error in Quenbilla has resulted in tragedy.
Some people in the Fokum seem to be forgotten that abortion has resulted in two natural catastrophes of unprecedented forces that have died ten thousands of persons.
The nuclear race is the lessons from the airport, as it was issued out of the two previouss.
In addition to this step and cooperation between security bodies, operators and French and German constructors, the EPR represents a project that allows to resist such a view.
As it is considered by all energy specialists who wish to build a reactor, the cease of its construction in Flamanville will be a great gift to the railway of the Areva and EDF concurrents, which had opened their way to leading leading in an inevitable development of atomic energy.
We need to find legally the best combining of energy sources for our country, but it would be directly allowing emotions, dogmas and the supplied manager to hold up the dispute, which is so important to the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration - the burden or the good for the economy?
The immigration policy at Nikola Sarcozi was criticized from different parties to the transfer of police, judicial and administrative services under the digit policies and compatibility of this policy with the self-promised status of France as " human rights justice".
Then was the administrative prosecution of foreign students, which had resulted in the outcome of news when the Minister of Internal Affairs (Liberone of 23 May) stated that France was not needed foreign talents, comments and officials.
But it is very rarely analyzed from the economic point of view.
Rights and lefts in this matter in many agreements.
On the right side of the tons, Jake Shikek was described in 1976 that "900 000 unemployed will not be a problem in the country with two million foreign workers" and the left sides of Michael Rocaro, which explained in 1990 that France could not accept poor from the world."
The difference is only in the generosity level
In 2005, the Polish Water Prosecutor was shot and the left and the right.
Both sides are in the immigration of burden for French economy and the French society.
The difference is only that they are able to demonstrate immigrants.
In his program, France Olland has limited bankings, said that "consuming work will be able to solve our problem of immigration."
This is the presentation of immigration as a burden and problem, but it is very precious.
As we remember the economics of Yuan Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron in the recent book, which had been reported on immigration (Oss people: As the migration has created our peace and determined our future, May 2011, the publication of the Priston University, 352 C.), there is a wide consensus on the positive impact of migration streams on economic growth and employment in immigrants countries.
The limitation of immigration leads to reduce growth and reduces employment.
The fears of immigrants are based on the view that they are able to replace local workers, particularly low-liquidated, promoting the decline.
However, experience shows that immigrants are much more complemented than local work forces by carrying out the work in which there is no local work force.
Individual immigrants are working in sectors that do not take local workforce, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors where education is not related to proposals of work.
A positive impact on payment
Like chirurgus would be difficult to work in a country where there are a lack of a donor, interaction between local and immigrants, it is a positive impact on local employment payment.
Johnny Peri reported that the growth of the migration stream has increased 0.6-0.9 per cent of real long-term payments.
This, without account of the fact that the diversity of immigrants has contributed to creating new ideas and economic growth (in the United States of the Nobel Prime, a large share of national immigrants, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants).
Migrants also have a pure profit in the social security system, giving a middle of the European budgets in the average 1% of the common European countries.
According to the evaluation of the World Labour Organization, for example, immigrant immigrant has arrived in the age of 30 years, for its life, would provide a clean winning budget (income of mines) in average 150,000 euros.
Nicole Sarkozi at the beginning of its mandate was gathered by "subsids" to escape in the lack of growth point.
The mentioned dogs used to escape immigrants have made a contractual effect.
Europe has discovered democracy, remains specifying the European Democracy
Democracy is a precious winning, but along the timely and crop.
The European Continent should recall that in Athinah overvive more than two thousand years ago, he survived the tragedy of I World War, the tangitural regimes, the Holocaust, Gugo, and France in Spain, Slazara in Portugal and the Headquarters in Greece.
Some believed that the democracy would finally resist their enemies, sufficiently to vote and make it as right as possible.
Since Napoleon The Mogo is known that it's from the surface of thinking.
The whole vote, although it is an mandatory condition of democracy, is not sufficient and may even become a "advertising instruction", as said a Philosoph-Republic Ethen Vurra.
No, democracy requires many other public spaces, public spirit, values, organizations, divisions and controls of authority, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we survive is economic crisis, but first, it is a political crisis and a democracy crisis.
In this regard, the philindio of the Greek Reference will have a double development effect, demonstrating the need for serious policy changes and the unacceptable feeling of its inconsistent and uncertainty.
That duty needs to think that to overcome it.
The truth is that the overall line of the democracy has now been confronted and, in view of many, the Republician soldiers are now not on that side.
We don't gain any of the national referencies organized in the nature and in the haotic order.
"Cart-Blansh" for an absolute European monarch or a kitchen with related feet to the nationalism - what choice for the citizen!
No, we are not dreaming about the iron, but the implementation is a joint, clear and uninterprettable election and democracy at this time at the common European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and unrecognized how many more they should be renumbered because there is only one crisis in Europe.
The whole Europe is undertaken by the disappearance of markets and recycling agencies, suffering from its weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole Europe is destructed in an international scene.
Many are concerned about the transfer of the sovereignty of Europe, but all Europe is gradually lost its sovereignty and every one of its nations together.
It is urgently necessary to reduce the management of the European project under national sovereignty.
Since only a joint work of Europeans can reduce the density of each person, free from markets and prepare to the future, invest in it.
The outcome from the crisis requires decisions at the common European level, and they can't be adopted without a full democratic legitimacy, without bringing us to a catastrophe.
After a long discussion of this proposal, the socialists and Jaka Delors are now required by the European Economic Government.
Let it.
But to represent it itself without a stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has been made in the lives of the Grasian is a clear shame and a new trap.
We must start the new stage of the European construction.
To establish a Republic in France, it was necessary to create the Republics.
The revolution of interests would not be sufficient.
This lection remains in force.
We must build Europe only at the economic level.
This can only be done through the creation of more democratic Europe at the political level, the present European sovereignty.
To create Europe, let's create Europeans.
Uncontacted chip cards are widely expanded.
The World Safety Exhibition is opened in the Tuesday at the Atmosphere of the Optimism.
In fact, 2011 will be completed by 11 per cent of the growth of the world of micro-proceeders (based cards, SIM cards), exceeding 6 million units according to Eurosmart.
The largest sector of unsatisfactory technologies allowed to pay public transport or buy, just through a card on the calculated device.
The world will be sold 460 million in the world against 320 million previously!
Their rate is increased in 2012 (as 580 million units) and is almost 10 per cent of the world currency market (6.925 million cards).
Europe, for a long time away from Asia and the Pacific region, is now moved towards uncontaminated payments.
Along with 26 million bank cards, Visa has already been paid to this function, and they are 75,000 terms.
France is starting with more modest positions: Visa is 400,000 uncontaminated cards.
But large stores make it dark.
In that year, Carrefour left 2.5 million uncontaminated passports MasterCard.
In order to go to a higher speed, we need banks to make their customer equipment.
"Two major organizations in France have promised to systematically disseminate among their clients of bank cards that were intended for unrepaid use," reported Jar Nebui, Director-General Visa Europe.
The banks test the payments using the mobile phone.
But this is only the first stage of the future payment fund, that's a mobile phone.
Until only a few NFC technologies have been equipped with the Communication of the neighbouring fields that are necessary to make such transactions.
"They were rejected.
"But they're supposed to be leaving the next year."
"We appreciate peace sales from 80 to 120 million in 2012," explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But banks go forward.
Crédit Agricole announced the experiment from December to June the next year in Kana.
The iPhone approximately 200 clients and staff will be retained by hampers that provide uncontainable payments.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marcel.
The General Society also stated that it was prepared to start on the market a proposal that allowed clients to pay it through mobile phones.
Terrorist Front has been spread from Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the connections of the Islamic Magariba section of Boco Haram.
The relations made long ago between the terrorist group of Al-Qaida in Muslim Magriba (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Section Boco Haram were confirmed.
On Tuesday, Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Alger Abdelkad Messahel even said that the Algiers are now sure.
" The expert used by these two organizations and the reports of secret services show that they are actively cooperating, he explained, not in detail.
Paris seems to come to similar conclusions.
The investigation of two French disappearances in Niger in January detected two related names.
The people in the restaurant in Niamah, close to Aqmi, Antoine de Leocu and Vanceran Delors, apparently, were killed the next day together with several of the heritagemen during the operations carried out by French experts.
Among the bulks remaining after the operation, French and Nigeria followers found several telephone sems of terrorists.
Here is the Terrorism
The analysis of the calls indicated several contacts in Mali, Nigeria and Nigeria.
As reported by Radio France Internationale (RFI), followers are particularly interested in two numbers; one indicates the Niger who lived long in Midigory, the city of North Nigeria, the Boco Haram, and the other at a person as stated, close to Aqmi and the sect.
"It's a step forward, but it's unfortunately to have more reliable evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it is possible."
"That many years is known that the semina has received financial and effective support outside and that it is becomes more active, said Quenle Amov, Nigeria Research.
In the last months, this support has become more clear about the actions and statements of Boco Haram and its methods that are now included the use of deaths and the most complex explosive devices of the same type that uses Aqmi.
The international community in the chapter with Washington now provides the pressure to Abuja to take attention to the problems created by Boco Haram.
It is that the Nigeria authorities were traditionally considered this group as a community of educationed people who don't represent interest.
Quick success
On the basis of 2002 in Midigory with the sword, school, and the name-foundmentalist Mohammed Jusef, Boco Haram, which means "western education is a sin" - proclaims the establishment of the islamic emirat in the north of the Muslim Nigeria.
The poor region of the organization has been rapidly successful.
It is politicized and requires a close compliance with the Baliath, and its activeists began fighting the wicked central government.
It is mainly on the church, barriers and authorities.
In 2009, Boko Haram’s activeists showed special activity and made many attacks on the police office.
Abuja's response, as usually, is uncomfortable.
Army has blocked the city and left 800 dead.
Mohammed Yosef, who was alive, was killed in prison.
The seat is now radikalized and governed beyond its northern webs.
In the past of Birth, she was responsible for an action that had been killed 80 people in Joshua and then for another in Abuja.
In June in Abuja Boko Haram organized the first death attack at the reinforced police Chamber.
The local representation of the United Nations will be the first international goal in August.
The creation of a terrorist asylum in Africa, which is from Mauritania through Nigeria in Somalia, is now concerned of all security experts.
Today, when Aqmi was strengthened in Mali and Niger, the somalians of Al-Shabab operate in Kenya, Boco Haram represents a new conflict threat.
Last week, during conversation with President Gudlak John Alen Juppe, he announced the danger of Boco Haram and expressed the ready to share all the available information.
Peace, as it sees the Republical candidates in the President
With respect to China, Iran and Israeli Mitt Romney, Herman Kine and Rick Perry are deployed in excuses and incompatibility.
Should a degraded crisis of America lead to a complex peace through simple and accurate ideas?
If you listen to candidates from the Republics, the electors could believe it.
Mett Romney, Herman Kine, Rick Perry and others have a number of loud, but only details of statements on external policy that are traditionally a strong side of the Republics.
The lows concerning China, Iran and Israel's assistance are often ridiculous.
Mt. Romney, which was the best opportunity to move from the "But Party", affected the Chinese complaints to the WTO and accused them to "manipulation of its curtain is a feeling theme for America, an irritant migration of its entire industry in Asia.
It's worse if it leads to trade war, he said.
John Hansman, the former Ambassador of Obama in China and the only candidate collected in a comprehensive external policy, could not get a position that affects emotions.
He called for a strong but constructive dialogue with Peking (external position of Obama).
But Hantsman, who holds the lower part of the recital, was not heard.
Reigan style
Romney also promised military attacks on Iran if the sanctions could not stop its nuclear programme.
"If they choose me, I'll stop Iran, he's told him."
"If Obama is overwhelmed, they'll have a bomb."
He also promised to strengthen the military assistance to Israel, accused Obama for non-compliance of promises concerning that partner.
Heirman Kine, second in the recycling of candidates, demonstrated an unlawful case.
He recently urged the Chinese military threat, because Pickin is trying to reach nuclear arms, clearly without aware that China has already possessed her since 1964!
The Gouvernant Texas Rick Perri, who supports Israel and seeks military attacks in Iran, says that it is ready to use the American army in Mexico against drugs.
Return to tortures understood in terrorism prohibited by Obama in 2009 also recommend Ken, Perry and the candidate Michel Bahman.
This is all far from the Republican candidate in 2008, John McKeyne, a hard external policy.
The current president responded that Reigan also had simple ideas and that he won cold war.
They recall that Obama himself was a lover and that he had to reduce the tone against terrorism.
They are fairly affected by the lack of his close dialogue with Iran, in the previous conclusion of the Irak, his provisions in the Libya, which brings him a weak policy republic.
But it's not so simple.
The meeting considers the positive balance of national security at Obama, which eliminated Ben-Leadn.
After Iraq, it doesn't believe in military interventions that are bound in the pocket.
And, saying that America needs to reconstruct economics to regenerate her leading, Obama's rights.
The North Past, the new door for the entry of the Russian gas in Europe.
The Norte Fluss associated with Western Europe and Russia, directly on the Day of the Baltic Sea.
It is calculated at the removal of 30 million households.
Gasprom, Russian gas producer, wished to disappear this event with the pomp.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of States and Governments, have participated in the past Tuesday on the Baltic Border, between the speaking of orquesters and shots, in the opening of the northern flow, a new gas supply, directly connected by Russia and Germany under water.
The Consorter of Germany by the angel of Merkel, Russian President Dmitriy Mededvev, French Prime Minister of France Fihon and his Netherlands colleague Mart Rätte, together returned the symbolic Winter, controlling the arrival of the Russian gas in the Western European Network.
In the new gas production, 27.5 million additional kilometres of gas will continue every year in West Europe for the first tube of 1 224 kilometres connected by the Leingrade area with the land of Mellandburg Polarship.
The second tube should be ready at the end of 2012 to provide a total amount of 55 million kitchen metres of gas equivalent to the whole consumption of France.
And the possibility of building the third tube on the same direction is already discussed.
For Gaza, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The draft met a disastrous resistance to the Poland and the Voluntary States.
The North Past will actually allow the gas directly to Germany, escape through the third country (Post or Ukraine).
These two countries lost part of their authority: they will have more difficult influent on Russia, threatening access to Western European markets.
At the most closest moment of the Bershawa Debates had not stopped before compared to the North Protocol with the new German-Sweet Covenant, which was laid down in 1939 between Hitler and Stali with a view to occupate Polonia.
This means that the political matter is sensitive.
Supporting the Russian project, Western Europe has more security of its allocations.
But the costs of energy Europe, because the project created a bottle between East and West Europe.
Russia has been able to be less than five years of understanding of the direct Union between Russia and the rich Western countries, which require larger gas volumes and their own stocks already outlined.
"It is part of Russia's cooperation, a new arterio that is organicly linked to us," said France Fiyon, opening gas supply, demonstration, to which large gas contracts are important and political and economic.
This explains widespread laughly on the faces of head Gazprom, presented in a large number of loveminna, the gas reaching paragraph.
The harmonization of the gas supply is a technical movement.
The sub-cutting tube was made from being arrested in Beton to protect it from the ships of the ship.
He's located on the seaday, the middle deep of 200 meters.
To build it, there should be a mixture of fields left from the Second World War.
"According should be removed or destroyed as precaution," said Hence Mueller, the secretary of the North Past Company.
Many steps should also be taken to protect the fauna and flower.
It is a long metall smoke weight, equal to 242 Eifleen baths, without disruption throughout its length, without ventilations and without core stations.
The control platform was planned in Sweden, but the management project was rejected by Sweden because Sweden was not in terms of the fact that the Russian State Business was always in its river.
"When availability, we're going to cut a flower than for a minute," says Jens Mueller.
So, if the gas flight contained in the gas traffic will go to the air.
But it seems to be a little reliable designer that has been designed for the protein only 100,000 years.
The control of the gas-product will be carried out by a sub-country work that holds a ship for external monitoring, as well as an apparator circled within the gas supply.
The synerographical apparate is entered within the tube of a diameter of 1 meter and is spread forward to the gas stream.
After 3 full days of travel with speed 3 metres per second, he provides accurate information on any metal information.
The project was proposed for a period of 50 years without the need for a smallest refund.
The gas cycle is only carried out by the pressure of the gas.
It includes 200 bars when sending and 100 bars at arrival.
Five enterprises have joined efforts to implement the project.
The leader remains a Gazprom, which has 51 per cent of the capital.
The other are German company E.ON and BASF (15.5 per cent), the Netherlands Guiness and the French GDF Suez Group (9 per cent).
These five companies have created a joint company named the North Statute, which was ordered to build and operate gas production.
His Headquarters are located in Switzerland, where it is particularly welcomed.
Then Gasprom gave this company to a 20-year-old apartment with the possibility of extending the total gas transport.
"The Gaspum will pay for the full amount, regardless of the amount of gas will be really transported," says Jens Mueller.
The financing of gas supply was 30 per cent of the assets and 70 per cent of bank credits.
The total value of work is 7.4 million euros for two trumpets.
The GDF IT will be approximately 240 million.
But migrants are sure that they will buy their costs because Gazspem takes all risks.
The landscape comes out of the Baltic Sea in the Amormine to the dry river of the trees.
The concentration of 4.5 metres of the highest exit of the gas is of 4.5 metres.
The producers measure the pressure, temperature and special gas characteristics before driving it into German gas supply.
From the past period of terminal, one million kibbe meters of gas each time.
This will be three million in time and 6 million in 2012.
Brand Moleskine Brown Brown
Moleskine, created by the Italian company 15 years ago, will return to write.
He has an aircraft for hours carried out by letters in the light of the flight.
Moleskine is easy to learn about the direct black device, on the scene, on a yellow- blank page, just like springing with the time.
However, the book Moleskine, which we know today, was born in 1997.
The Italian company ' s mode that is in Milan decided to run in the sale of the designer blocks.
Mary Sembergonda, then a company adviser, was responsible for the starting of a new product.
Blocked by the old production technology, the molecule and locked boybutton ticket used, for example, for the covering of the smoke.
It is convinced that this type of blocks is high valued by writers and travellers.
"Moleskine made a compliance with an old and forgotten thing that was a compulsory for the artists of the XX century," said Mary Zebulgand, which has become a manager in the mode.
Good luck comes.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25 per cent and reached 12.7 million.
We went away from the production of the first years when it was total of 3000 blocks.
Moleskine moved the border of Italy and exported to 70 countries from France to the United States.
Includes the type of buyer's profile, because the blocks are uniquely engaged in businessers, students and free professionals.
Moleskine buyers have broad views and education.
The small Italian company who first had 12 staff now has 100 and two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
It spread its blocks in the books of Fnac, stores in small cities centres and could get a wide knowledge.
"We followed the spirit of time and the new needs in writing, despite the e-mail statement," explains Mary Seborgonda.
This characteristic cultural dimension is the development of Moleskine; recently the burden organized the “Olway”, where architecters and artists demonstrated their own blocks.
In August, he also put a packing with a leopard image in the case of the film in Locarn.
By using its success and cultural aeroplane, Moleskine has differentiated its products that are now containing skills, hands and computers, including all kinds of support.
Successfully generated: on August 2006, the Mode was buyed by the Investment Fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which wrote a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the rate of unemployment among persons with disabilities so high?
For example, 19 per cent of persons with disabilities are looking for work.
The 15th week of disabilities is starting today.
Despite public well-being policy started in 2005, the percentage of unemployment among persons with disabilities remains two times higher than 19 per cent of the population in general.
Promised?
"No, he emphasized Eric Blansh, Director-General Adapt, who organizes a week of work for persons with disabilities."
"In 15 years, significant progress has been made."
"In that time, the rate of unemployed was not 2.3 times more."
"And a lot of jobs. "
It should be said that in persons with disabilities are still much.
Between more aged: 37% older than 50 years (17% in the mean).
They have more low qualification level: 80 per cent of the bacalav level, and from 2.3 million students in higher education only 10,000 persons.
Finally, a long-term unemployment was extended to 85 per cent of persons with disabilities against 38 per cent in the average.
Furthermore, all these criteria, which are very difficult to return to work, and that are the problem of Christian Grapein, under the words of the Tremplin General Director, the Association created in 1992 to assist companies to take care of persons with disabilities.
This is some of the obstacles.
There is no need to talk about mentality that changes but too slowly.
Research conducted in April by the IMS-Introduction of the City Order showed that the issued managers had a low knowledge level of disability and “represented male people in colleagues or mentally or incompatible”.
The results of private companies with more than 20 people are still far from the goal of 6 per cent of persons with disabilities provided in the law adopted in 1987.
The latest known figures for 2008 gives the value of 2.6 per cent.
"Today we are about 3 per cent," says Peter Blan, Director-General Agephif, organization responsible for the collection of companies that do not respect this law.
Availability: The number of "substituted" organizations, such as payments, reduced from 59,000 to 46,000 (and 606 to 480 million euros).
"The end of 2005, which made a strong pressure on the company, explains Peter Blan."
"But this improvement also reflects the growth of awareness, particularly on large enterprises."
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59 per cent of employees with 20-49 employees have 82 per cent of employees from 100 to 199.
Azar: "What happy is."
Before the fight with Siny evening in Friday (20.45.) Edden Azar and George Leeks had not covered the pleasure they received from this friendly mother.
We're not going to say that there was a secret talk between them, but a symbolic image.
Sitting around the tribes of the Stade de France, George Leeksen and Edden Asor died.
Five months after the exit of his attacked mother against Turkey, the Belgian trainer can only glorify it.
"I'm very pleasant of Eden, his movement and the fact that he's a belgiver."
"I want to go further," believe the Lily player.
What before the contract between his achievements in the club and the collection, it's one thing, it's justified.
"I'll find a round year, and I'm not in Belgium."
"I have to win the eye."
Azar came to Senannium to the end of "block".
Not forget, however, and on the idea of “avouring”.
He supported Sinah from 7 years old and winning campaigns 1998 and 2000.
"I always supported them, he reaffirmes.
This, of course, also strengthens the special character of this mother.
And particularly what the mother is on the other side, Johan (Kabe) and Adil (Rim) is, he remembers.
"One our ways were overwhelmed."
"It's the opportunity to play against them -- it's a clean happiness."
Lexis's well-being remembered "goodness."
"Horrance" playing in "Fresh Math".
"Wornness" also claim as a "session", that France has become a very high-level team every year after the grain in Nizne.
"Lauren Blan was as a punch of a community, he's lifted up.
Now, when Belgium lost the next Euro, the technological sports will be trained in one aircraft with blue leading... in Brazil in 2014.
"Our small belgs grow up," he cried.
"We're making something, games of imbícics, they're hungry."
"You're sure about this in future mothers.
Portugal is very sure
The Portuguese Paul Bent begins its response mother against Bosnia (22.00 a.m.) at this Sunday in Lisbon with a great optimism.
The two teams seemed to have lost the feelings of reality.
"By the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and that the most important, happy country."
Paul Bent's already in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt that the Society, in which it is from September 2010, is qualified by Euro 2012.
Portuguese is all in 90 minutes of happiness.
But there's a mother to play, and Bosnia's to win.
In view of 0-0 on Tuesday's board, it is clear that the game is not finished.
Although Portugal has been dominated in the mother more than a hour, she was not able to reach the obligation goal that would be satisfied.
"It's a good result that contains certain risk."
But it is, in his darkly lighted stage where La Lus in Lisbon, the portugues are convinced that they're going through, in the eyes of the public, which must be in the street, although the mother's mother will be very thorough," said optimisticly fixed, but judge Bent.
"We're waiting for a very close mother, but we're sure we can win--- said the Portuguese trainer 42 years.
"We still have 50 per cent of the chances to get on Euro 2012," said President Carlos Kaiber.
Once on Friday, the mother against Bosnia requires wine from the portugians.
Nothing could make the boosts.
"It's a good result in which, however, some risk, I'm sorry, Bent.
"We'll play against a team that adds many technical dignities and people who have many individual dignities," he added.
As it was in Zenica, the portugues are going to make the maximum pressure on the bosniests from the beginning, "not to give them time to think."
Good idea, only this time it would have been realistic.
