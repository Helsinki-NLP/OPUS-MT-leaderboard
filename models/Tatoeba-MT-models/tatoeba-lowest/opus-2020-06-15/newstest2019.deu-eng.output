München: Florian David Fitz fully equipped with Ina Müller
So fresh and well-speaking knows him often: Florian David Fitz.
You need to look at it two times: yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The favorite player was in Hamburg - and he lived an empty night!
Hamburg - The Talkshow produced by NDR "Inas night" is known for fun funeral conversations on the theme of the Hamburg Hafenkneipe "Sheets".
Moderatorin Ina Muller offers with their guests on some bikes, some wine or higher drinks to stop the stimm and tongues.
Not a few promises is also drunk for the obligatory complaints.
On Friday, another consequence of the loved Talkshow was signed.
This time: The player Florian David Fitz is known from films like "Manner Herren", "Terror - your judgment" or "The day of the day."
From the museum, the journey arrived in the high north, but did not well.
On Saturday, he posted a self - his face was fully disappeared, the eyes only two small slopes.
The bed Selfie shows a completely disappeared Florian David Fitz.
But he's not sick, he's just got a powerful chamber.
He set up some - probably not really seriously - knowledge that he has gained now: "The rule is one: the NIE goes to Inas night.
Rule Two: Never drink the black sauce.
And spring.
And the wheat egg climb, the Ina throwing around half three, let's go.
The alcohol consumption is in fact written in the face of 43 years.
His Fans were the same as a few tips to combat the resurrections.
They have rich of Instant Breasts, Fish flowers or - probably the most targeted - head paintablets.
Others are easy to look at the normal attractive knostars.
As Ina Müller has overlooked the recent rescue, it is not known until.
Since it has been moderated on the theme but already since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be clearly tried...

Treysa has to fight with Vandalism and Unrat
The growth in the 36 kilometers long railway in Treysa is difficult to find and be found.
Recepts against the fatsing vandalism are searched but solutions are strictly described.
Schanges, cigarette kippen, mull and unrat, democrated muscles and middle-democrated tips - are presented since the longing of the income with a group of seat on the hair hill in Treysa.
For the previous object Bahnradweg in the red cocktail country a more than an unbelievable view.
The topic is to work members of the ADFC-Orts City, but also others are far more than the Radial Transport Officers of the city of Ulrich deserts.
The problem has already been addressed in the Radial Transport Council.
Don't give it so far.
The proposals have reached the Section Group to regularly disappearance of the waste box and cleaning of the areas at the level of entertainment.
"I think the last would be the order of the hour - independently of possible further activities," says the deserthagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the topic has also been introduced in the local Council.
Not only the Mull stands on railways and inhabitants - the seat group is on week-ends of regular meeting.
It is not only often laughing that the plants are also destroyed: raising plants out of the earth, demoled muscles, shots switched, shocked.
Volunteers would have already come up more often, tells ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
However, the actions are only the languagewords on the hot stone.
They assure that the rastroom is on the radweg in Treysa Treysa Treysa meeting point.
"Over the whole roadway is clearly here on the hair hill of the weak point," confirms the rail transport officer, which now also ensures the new radar sites in Ziegenhain which will be opened today.
"It's the same shit, it's gonna be fine."
Another idea is a video overwhelming on the hill: "It is likely that makes the weight significantly higher to relax themselves to merely.
This would, however, suggest that timely a police force will be overcome.
Basically, the disasters want a development of the hair hills.
It should be made more attractive.
In fact, the frequency of the railway can be very satisfied with the frequency of the railway.
The tourism market is still building.
Our radweg is very high in comparison to others in Germany," the ADFC members.
As extremely critical dangers, ADFC member Susanne Klippers appreciate the situation in the Ascherer Street in Treysa.
There's no abbiepure on the hair hill.
It explains that railways are in the middle of the road between side-side transport flights."
This is not a problem for sporting drivers but probably for elders and especially for children.
Music Contest in the Cultural Area: The "Choo of Hiltrup" and the Sea
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in each other.
"The song for Hiltrup" provides the appell of the City Offensive Hiltrup, in the "Music Context for large and small and young musicers".
A contest "with eyew winners in the sympathic Hilltruper family", like Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family with each other with the coffee and store of the honorable of the cultural railway.
Seven trainings were attended from a male bath to the great assemble: Alvin Jasic with Pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with Getarre, Rolf Ihmig, a long in Hiltrup of living albawares, the nine of the "Hiltruper star colors", three members and three generations of the families of Trenmp and Claus, a set of children's garden Lummerland and finally Rike Weathering and the Zwarnings.
This contest, so explained as a new manager Joachim Schmidt.
We have not yet lived this in other cities.
What were the texts connected?
In the places, the Hiltruper Sea and the marketal lee were often mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig, the Alle in his angry song to "Cö of Hiltrup".
The Cultural Court was also appreciated.
It was always about the lives of each other in these places, especially in Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke lived the short reconstruction pauses with short interviews with the interpretations or indicators to their creature.
So you learned from Humberg that he actually studied Chemie, but now also teaching gitarre.
From Tontechniker Stefan Schemmelmann he knew Franke to report that the last in Ludwigshapes - on a great event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest in the program.
And Alvin Jasic has put all the hands on youtube.
"It's not about win," said Frank.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper Gastronomie.
However, for the favorites of the Jury, there was something special for others to hear their songs.
A whole CD of Alvin Jasic and his pioneer Marcel Untied can play with Tontechnik Schemmelmann.
Another musicians can take a song: Along with his Hiltrup locker, which in particular imposed with his musicality, and the "Lummerland roel": "A very beautiful attraction" with ten children and two acquirers in Getarre and Cajon, Laura Kastners and Lina Tuölle.
Like all the children were once again in the end - and they even sounded without electronic support "right," as Frank said.
Leaders made the jury of the originality, reference to Hiltrup, accessibility of the melody and recognition value.
The Jury has been the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Westfälic School for Music, Andrews Clomphas of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the economic connection, and Jan Kaven, President of the city shareoffensive.
The city-offensive had an event in explanation with its ten years of life.
She rejected the event as a complete success.
All are "pleasantly satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in very shortly full cultural race.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the gameetest
The players form two teams that are with each other.
For each side there is a screen, where four cards with keywords that you can - the old trick with the red Folie - only can disappoint if you've hidden it.
This is ensured that the site is also able to read nothing.
On the cards then, for example, reading from the left to the right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Window.
Thirdly.
4. Feature."
These are the decisions to continue to encrypt it.
Because they must not be disappeared here, but codes.
A player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card that might stand on "3.4.2".
Decrypto should not be signed behind the secret foil, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case: he must - in this line and in this example - the "Worfel", "Fest" and "Fest" - so that his own team recognizes the correct sequence and the genetic team is not possible; because it won the party, if it is used to cut the code twice.
The encryptor then notices and reads loudly for: "Worn" for the wrought, "Lose" as an opposite to festival; it would also be something like "Party" possible and "Prag" because he was pushed in the school and knows the dark window tour.
So it's rund for Runde, the team for the team.
We do not know the terms of the face - but this can be better together with any indication that the encryptor is there.
Maybe a mysterious but not to disappear the surscriptions should be so, otherwise, it is difficult to make his team inevitable.
The most chryptic on "Decrypto" is unfortunately the rulesheet.
The players must probably study a long and outstanding time until they can finally play.
The declaration video under decrypto.info in the network makes it easier.
But whoever has first lost, will be fascised as many feelings in this invisible game.
However, in total, "Decrypto" is not all so deep as the predominant and genre Prime "Codenames", which is also a agent thematic on a game less words, but it is much better to play in small groups.
And to whom it is only about advice and not about victories, it can easily find a version for two of them.
Kulmbach: Man shows the police Hitler green and affords guests in the kitchen
A 48-year-old man, employed the police inspection Kulmbach in the night of Saturday doubled evening on Sunday.
First of all, he showed in the high city of a predominant police officer the Hitler Growth, then he also fell in the high city in a kitchen when he celebrated other guests.
After he was not clearly alcoholised the place revealed by the police, he had to deliver the night at the police inspection of Kulmbach in the Haft Chamber.

Operating work Pressig was the home of the Schubloks
The train operating in Pressig was the 10th year of the Drheiba in Frankenwald.
1991 ended a piece of ice railway storm.
"When a puffer was knocked at Puffer, it was heard in all pressure," Georg Dinkel remembered the story of the place and the train court.
Nobody did.
There also the brems were quiet and the weapons dragged.
It was also clean railway.
Examples that are likely for Dinkels home Pressig.
Nowhere in Frankenwald, there was a place such as the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen-Bergstracks to the north, which after an increase of about 220 degrees of height has its square point in Steinbach on the forest.
In order to consider this, previous dog and shock blocks were needed that they had their homes in Pressig.

On July 15, 1950, the "Volksblatt" reported of a 160 man's personal file; 13 Dampf and eight Elloks were statisted at Pressig.
The electricization of the streets in 1939 has already minimised the need for Zug and Schubbles.
Since 1977, they were only used for goods.
By 1991, at least 10 000 wheels were included in the month.
1982 Parts of the operating work were abolished in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is of course that you don't have a better use of the location, even in a point of good transport in the eye."
Against at Pfingst 1989, the Nürnberg Division to the July "50 years of electricization Nürnberg - Saalfeld" was a pompöse Bahnhofsfeest in Pressig.
"There were 10,000 delighted viewers here," Georg Dinkel remembers.
Let's get out later.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were disappeared, and the Rangierbahnhof Pressig was a story.
Dinkel recalled the most difficult work in the past.
Every fatal consequences would have been made.
Why the Pressig Railway Circle has brought for the conversion of the Erarchie of the two places and many other historical and current images here are in the infrankenPlus article.

The Union and SPD should fight - but there is still the effectiveness of humans in view.
What is doing and protected many?
With this question, this is possible to clothe pragmatic demands as well as the changing demands - and thus re-entrust confidence.
In particular, the parties now need to fight.

Air insurance is still worse
Frankfurt/Hamburg After the European Aviation Chaos in the summer, the German aircraft will not be signed for an improvement in the coming year.

But the end of the 50-year-olds has changed the usesgartens to a pool and housing garden.
"The nature has found, she was already before us, and we have to orientate us to her," the Fachman for woods and nest trees said.
That's why, for the garden building savings, let it not allow our home to remain beautiful and living.

How's the situation on the island now?
The national government has opened the airport again, so it can also be placed for aid.
When I came, I saw the houses in the coast that all were completely destroyed.

Some are keeping up before their homes, there's still there.
Because many food businesses and also the tanks are completely closed, people are partly closing food and benzin.
The public service is completely undermined and the national government helps.
A prison has also been destroyed, the leaders are partly run around and the search is difficult for them.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and lost.
