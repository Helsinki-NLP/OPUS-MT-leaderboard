Parliament has not ratified the amendment for the release of Tymosenko
The Ukrainian parliament rejected, in the context of an amendment to the criminal law, the draft to cancel paragraph on the incultion of Julia Tymosenko, the head of the opposition.
The Deputys in second reading refused the draft amendment to reduce the penalties for economic crimes, which would be able to open the doors of freedom for the former Minister currently imprisoned.
Tymosenko was condemned in October to 7 years of prison to conclude a priority agreement with Russia for natural gas purchase.
The court is not defined and the court must establish the sentence of the condemnation in December.
Tymosenko qualifies the judgement of political vengeance of the regime and caused a process of partiality of the court also to the west.
The draft to cancel paragraph 365 of the criminal law, on the basis of which the former Minister was condemned, was signed by 147 deputys.
It would have had 226 votes to approve it.
Libyan Victoria
Liberation or rebellion has already been won.
Muammar Kaddafi is buried in a unknown place in the wilderness and without him the war is finished.
It remains to be determined by winners.
As it is in the region, the winners to the elections are the islamists, but is it moderates or roots.
The Provisional Council decised the ordinary law of the Charter and we already know what it is.
Libya becomes a country without crime, because for a flight the hand is cut.
Women can forget emancipation, the un respectable events of the faith are passable from capital penalty...
This is the Coran who will join the personality of the Dictator the company of opposed tribes.
In Libye, there will be such a order as we can't represent it and how we wouldn't like it.
But our way to live is not unique, it is not objectively the best and probably would not benefit for the libians.
It is particularly surprised that Islamic warriers accepted assistance with recognition of unfidal dogs.
The only excuse is that it is not an American general that would lead the battles of the OTAN but rather Allah, whose size they celebrated every attack.
Then, when it is to look for winners in Libye, the Western does not leave it
We have participated in the turts, served islam and our petroltics have turned away from the Dictator as political allytics without that makes no benefit.
After the recently bad experiences of Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not bear Libye militaryly.
There is therefore no problem for the locals to disappear "crossed".
Without land occupation, petrol societys will easily be accompanied to the black gold of libinien.
Maybe not so much and western will finally be able to go to desincerated human rights protection.
For a little time we prevent these adoptions from the carrier.
A new crisis era begins.
France and the rest of Europe are in the investors visa.
A return from the statistics has passed on Friday in Europe.
Each of the status has published the PIB's legal information for 3A.
Czech economy has wandered the last quarter, while France and Germany are growing.
The obligation market is to combat all records.
Investors are not only looking at Italy, but also Spain, France, Austria and others.
The Euro statistical offices, Germany, Czech Republic and other European countries have published their visions for the third quarter of economic development.
Germany's PIB has an estimated growth of 0.5%, France's 0.4%.
The two countries have changed the data for the second quarter during which Germany was better planned (0.3% in place of 0.1%), however, France has declined a slight reduction of 0.1% (the origin of fluctuation).
Tschech economy had a growth of 1,5% during the third quarter.
But the PIB has deployed and, in accordance with the Czech Statistics Office, it is confirmed that economic growth is directed towards progressive reduction.
The results are worse than the previsions of analysis.
The most important events:
Czech economics had a growth of 1,5 per cent during the third quarter, but wandered during his last quarter.
The German economy had a growth of 0.5% in accordance with the planned and periodically recovered data.
The euro area and the European Union has grown from 0.2% between July and September as regards the previous quarter, as regards the analysis planned.
Greek economy has increased 5,2%.
The performance of 10-year-old obligations is 28.45%
The performance of the obligations of Spain and Italy is in turn to critical limits.
The problems begin to feel in Austria, France, Belgium, etc.
The performance of the Chess obligations remains lower than 4 per cent while the situation is involved in the region.
The voices are heard in Germany to say that the ECB should be the guarantee of last instance .
The cheques have been qualified for the EURO.
They won Montenegro 1:0 and celebrate qualification for 200 million
The representation of the football has successed its most difficult mission of the season!
In Monténégro, she also gained the super Cech and the garden Petr Jiracek 1:0.
Czech football has also defended a good part of chance in the second part and will not miss Europe campaign.
IHNED.cz followed the qualification match with a detailed report.
No special excise during the first part and a large part of chance for the second.
The Czech representative also gained the super Cech and the heroin Petr Jiracek with 1:0 in Monténégro and celebrated its qualification at the field of Europe.
Montenegroins were found under pressure until the second part because of a precise Czech defence.
The neighbours of the game were Damjanovic and Vucinic who have lodged two chances to mark a goal.
And by the super Petr Cech, the Czech Representation will not be absent to the European campaign next year, and more than 200 million wheels in the Czech football chain.
Since the first minutes we played a football warrier.
The two teams were difficult to draw combinations and the game focused mainly around the central line.
The pressure of national footballers has not occurred to cause the Czech defence that has exactly responded to long-terms even during the first half times.
Iranian students are ready to die for the nuclear programme of their country.
They created a human bouclelier
Some hundreds of higher school students have created a human bouclier around a nuclear site in Iran.
They want to support the nuclear programme of their country with a likely case of Israel.
Students have been requested in middle before the site and then wished the death of the EU and Israel.
Some hundreds of students of Ispahan universities created a martday human bouclier around the Icelandic Technological Centre where the uranium was transformed.
They thus expressed openly that they would defend the nuclear programme from their country to lose their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (AIEA) found in its last information that Iran has not stopped strengthening its nuclear weapons.
Israel has been made a possible attack on Iranian nuclear institutions.
Students have been requested in middle before the site and then wished the death of the EU and Israel.
In the case of an attack, whose objective would be to destroy the Iranic Nuclear Programme, the objectives would be not only Ispahan but also the Natanz site where the uranium is rich.
The food of an obediated child: don't take a little dinner and take the carcure for dinner
More than one third of children from 9 to 13 years have surpoid problems, 9 per cent of students will have a weight above the average and 5 per cent.
As the current research shows that obediated children are from families that have a malicious style of life.
This reveals how important the environment in which human being and models are evolving it.
On the tables of obediated children, for example, 50% charter is most often more than in normal children's families.
19% of the obediences had feeds to dinner according to the investigation carried out with a sensitive action "The Obedience is not a loss"
In small families, the sport is not also a usual, which is now the case of most today students - only 15% answered that at least one time per week the parents found time for active movement.
Research on 900 children
During the past school year, the investigation took place and participated in 900 primary schools in Tschekie.
It was the second edition of "Objet is not a hazard," action supported by the General Health Assistant and the United Society.
Since the beginning, there are more than 12,000 students to the third who are included in this project.
One of the decisive factors that cause dramatic increase in the number of children in surpoids, even obedients, is the lack of, correct food and not enough physical exercise.
"Otherwise, half of the children concerned indicates for example 5 times dinner-day - dinner - dinner - dinner, which is a basic principle of a good food", says one of the results of the investigation.
No little dinner and charter at dinner
Specialists focused on the fact that for healthy development, there are some basic details such as a small dinner at the same time.
In Czech Republic, only 23 per cent of students eat at my same time.
In most families, each takes his little dinner alone.
And the worst that was raised is that one ten of the population does not take any dinner.
The small dinner is however the basis of a good daily food.
The questionnaire showed that in the obediated children’s families more often consumes Malsaine frists.
Besides each student - without talking about weight - drink every day of sugar drinks (70%).
More than 40 per cent of the children concerned have regularly been sported, but for parents it is half, only 15 per cent.
Prepare your food
Another part of the investigation allowed children elected (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools to prepare their own food from proposed opportunities according to their own goal and personal opinion.
"The preferences of Czech children from 12 to 15 years are far from the ideal."
Of their favorite plates there are many feeds, meats and sugars.
"The most alarming is, in particular, a great preference for subsequent limonades", is indicated in the results of the investigation.
To dinner these are the pasts who took the first place just before white meat.
Children do not have any desire to pleasure and preference for fish and legumes was very low.
Head of health
The investigation also showed that children are ready to change their customs from the time they receive ad hoc information.
"In the course of the supervision of a group of participants to the survey who had filled the questionnaire after the Auditor "Obability is not a hazard," a good determinated wish to go to healthy food," indicate the results of the investigation.
The most marking was, for example, with regard to the suited limonades, because children began to give the preference to consumer water.
Children have most often cut on the questionnaire the white meat and fish like main plate and would reduce sudden plates and knedliky (Thake speciality of bread or land pain bullets).
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In a article of presentation regarding how to learn for the stylists, I have put a little anger of the fact that there was a lot of them since the beginning.
I didn't think what would happen later.
The exhibition of three professionals of speciality, the coverage of persons and a seminar on what happens.
And that will be worse.
More we approve final reviews and more are waiting for practical performances and information.
And even when the Sabbates and Saturday courses are really "bound."
This time we've been with the Director Alenka (in the course there's no boy) treated the way to spend the woman who has no standard measurement.
And women of this kind are most.
The one has a small couch, the other guy's body, without a special corbe, another of the superpoids.
The stylist must know how to optimumly enabling wide arms, extend a council or well gather the necessary corbs.
We have thus come to highlight the personship and also not to speak too slightly of women like Jennifer Lopez with a strong teeth and shoes and a fine size.
For example, if there is a difference between the size and the hooks so that jumps or pantalons do not match everything, this is the case to make it on measure.
And you don't regret it because the apartment that falls uncertainly is unestimable.
In a jump on measure you will feel much better than in the who leaves on the rest, shot and don't stand on the cleaning and so immediately.
For those who have a male appearance, you may allow a Tucker style shelter, with cosy tissue pieces, or even broderies.
There are apparently many examples of different appearances, and I'm happy that I have all the week to try all the information received.
But I'm also afraid that you're in relation to what I have to do at home is too much.
Each statistics has received a celebration to break for day and evening.
We must take into account the current appearance, the type of personality mode and its appearance.
I'll have to be "habing" Miranda Kerr, which you may know the Victoria Secret.
On the basis of me, this makes me pleasure, because it's better than clothing Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera who took almost hundred kilometres in the last time (Don't take my statement, svp, fully series) or the young Sellena Gomez.
We need to cut and cut from magazines or to search on the Internet, print and work the graphism.
The Moodboard, as we say for the final result, express our personal style and our relationship with the graphical creation.
Consider on the graphical part of the styling is also important.
The Stylist is not only covering physical but does, for example, create productive pages in the magazines (on products given tanks for hand-shaped sacks, mantels, etc.).
Mario Kamenik, Stylist and graphist, has maintained us all this.
But that's... until Sunday.
The Stylist must have a general vision
Three invitations of speciality have given a variety of aspects at the Saturday meeting full of information on the various types of persons.
Honza Pocorny, Stylist, Jakub Polanka graphist and Ben Renc, mode photography.
Jakub reminded us that mode is an illusion and the stylist should know it.
And a talent stylist knows to work with a single slightly different way.
Variability is for this primary example.
As for example, this trench-coat which must be brought classically with a jean and a t-shirt as a light clothes but can also speak the nucleal body, with scarpins and take it into photo as a roof.
Or if it's enough to remonte the shoes or the cold and have a new look immediately.
"Join with that," said he emphasized.
But I particularly appreciated the following advice: "For the work you need to know the rules perfectly."
"After you can start against it," said Jakub.
Finally, I understand why we are trying to learn these rules, what we do with what, to what, while in mode magazines sometimes see something else.
No statement on mode challenges.
I know again, thanks to the Ben mode photograph that the stylist has to have a lot more than those that are photographed.
That's what I say is that for history fashion that will have a ten pages (as a ten model) I must be ready to "retain" at least one fifteen.
And also, a clothing and its combination with other elements appear fully differently as in reality.
We need to consider this during the creation of a model.
The fact that the image and style are sometimes the half of the success has been confirmed by Honza Pocorny.
It's just enough to look at Madonna who is not a super-country, but his image and marketing have made it a global star.
In Czech Republic, the approach to the use of stylist services remains fresh.
And the faces recognize them sometimes as unnecessary (it is enough I know something but what I should pass through to the second step).
And if someone makes it a styling of our side, then we need to consider the fact that it tells us with a great probability a fully different size (more small) than what he actually has.
Then we remain that to ship on the google and to ensure whether the bolevard information is stated on the celebration, if it has a large or large, etc....
Honza and Mario put us on the heart on the morning that it is not enough to go to the stylist in the mode and to know how to look like models.
It must communicate with people he talks and is so important to be a good psychologist.
If people become people, don't blow up, keep their opinion.
"When a manager asks you to trigger his armor and fill it with new elements you can't throw everything and say to him, God's what horror."
"You will find some cases that you will find beautiful and that you will advise with what to bring them," said Mario.
This has shown us concretely what must all contain what is called "placovka" or sac of the stylist.
It's the one you reach around the size and you're on yourself for whatever you need.
Besides the things clearly defined such as cells, wheels for disappearing or even disappearing splits, there is also the nylon board (as the stelist uses for photographer of products such as sacks or chapels), special clothes with which we can close a clothes in the dose if it is too large (the pitcher or other type of agraph is not easily able to disappear the clothes) or a kit of cut.
In order to be not only people who listen to, but who tried something practically they taught us how to correctly assemble the shoes.
And during the photos meeting in the table where the surface is equal, the onceer could go to the outside, strongly.
And so we collapsed and collapsed.
We have no right to touch cells so that we don't be wounded by warning.
It is therefore necessary to actually behave competencies.
Mario welcomed me when he welcomed me for my creation.
The account I'm doing is not for my friend.
This is just a small summary of what we learned during the second weekend of course
I'm starting even more to understand that the styling of a professional is not a promenade in a roses garden, everybody telling what he wants.
The speed needs Le Run disputes throughout America.
Revision
In the original, an uncertain course is transformed because of a set of stupid errors of people who have nothing to do with a morning movement to work.
This is filled up to a certain measure the ambition of each, but it does not serve anything if nobody wants to do anything more.
The new subtitled Part The Run a product of great expectations before its exit.
He promised to take a new direction with the course course series Need for Speed already old and out a sort of game from playing parties that would not only be counted with points.
We were therefore curious how to be the passover overwhelmed during which the main hero out of his car and does what he wanted.
As this has already been done in the NFS series, the result is completely different than what it was done.
These are potentially arcade course games but the whole goes down to the bottom because of some unnecessary crimes that already exist for several years.
These are not really mistakes but rather the expression of an incomprehensive famine from the developers.
The adventure begins very good.
You've been taken in the adventure whose main hero Jack has natural problems and to resolve them is to participate in illegal courses through America.
You sit on the west coast in San Francisco and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea has interesting elements.
It is divided in 10 steps and then more than 50 courses.
What results in that each course has been made on another town and steps planned in different environments that are sufficiently different from each other and are interested.
The player has no feeling at one moment that the game offers something identical to him.
Some environments are quite nice even though the graphic graphical level is the same as the previous series.
Finally, it's not the end of the world.
But the conduct through the wilderness, in automne landscapes or in highly renewed mountains, is very nice.
The tests are more timely accepted by a a typical election.
For example, in the wilderness you find in a tempest of saviness that decreases the visibility in a sensely sensitive way.
Then in the mountains you should take care of what a pitcher does not fall up above.
The various courses are well operated behind each other.
There's only a little number, but it's enough.
There are moments you will try to overcome the number required of adversaries (as in a classic course) then you will move against the show (classic with chronometer) and then still wait another dual with an adversary.
At time you also have the police who goes into the game and trys to make you the difficult situation.
The news are the passs out of the vehicle.
It's rather interactive animation when the most of the time Jack flew before someone and you have to help it by putting it on the right button at the right time.
Nothing complex.
What is surprising is that there are less moments of this kind than what you're waiting (for concrete being there is only three).
In the result, it is well as that because this element is not able to steal and place, in the above context, in the elements that accept the game.
The behaviour is in the tradition of the previous games.
What it means is that there is no extraordinary thing, but we cannot say that it is negative.
With regard to realistic simulation, you must go to see otherwise.
But although you can find it better in the concurrence the behaviour model is very well with the type of course design.
So everything's okay.
The problems start appearing after some time.
To the difference of the behaviour model, the collection is not yet at the point.
We don't expect this game a combined deformation and collection, but when you do not have, in a collection with any object, the less idea of how your car is involved, so it is not fully good.
During the smooth disappearances, you touch sometimes slightly but otherwise your part in folly volcanoes.
Or it's in mixes.
Thanks to the restarting system that is not really a problem, but it really affects you.
The restart is done so that when you've seen the figure or you've gone out in the decor the game returns you at the last point on the wheel.
But you only have 5 renumbers.
When you have used the 5 restarts you have to start the game since the beginning.
So it's more tool, for where something does not happen as needed, because any way you can actually account.
Sometimes the redemands do not exist and need to find the solution by remembering the part of the concerned income.
The big here of this game is that the same actions are found in the same places.
For example, there are certain virages that need to go through a certain way, otherwise it does not happen.
Otherwise you will meet on a given location of "civils" vehicles in the same configuration as you have arrived first, fifth, 5 seconds in advance or a minute later.
What is the case of anger, these are the situations when you can easily see the adversary between two cars coming in inverse sense and when you come, you, you need to put it on the side and to turn them or go free.
It's equal if you're going before him because it's "cooled" so that for the situation given it's always coming around your nest.
The adversaries have other benefits.
During all the time of the game, you're coming to some places, again without worry about time, and you're still the same adversary that has before you at the same place.
This will work the most end of the game when you run on a long pont in inverse sense.
The adversary must all prices go before you.
When it passes before you he hides the view of other vehicles in inverse sense and you will enter a good number of times in collection.
You can understand that the goal of this game is to do something captiving and full of adrédaline, but it is clear that you're fast weakening.
And it's damage because through a simple behaviour model the game is interesting and places with so much action that you don't have time to follow everything that happens.
And it's equal if it's because of the concept of 50 units, that the course order is like that there is no chance to hurt or something else.
The original idea is the change of car during courses.
You need to take care of the pomps to essentially on the inners because you can change car's most of the time you have enough.
Cars are divided in three categories.
Sport cars are ideal for cities, the large American cylindricals for the right authors and the super sport cars to the exotic attorneys on very technical conducts for example on the roads in the mountains.
And the mode of challenges, which are courses in special places you know about adventure, is very well with the main history regime.
You receive not only medals but also experience points that add to your profile that is common to the challenges and adventure.
When you have reached the highest level of conductor, different objects start to break:
This is connected to the Autolog function that compares your results achieved with other players and provides other functions in the community.
One of the most difficult to understand is the situation of the last course of the adventure.
You come with your car in the metro tunnel (such as) where you're rolling in the darkness on the roads (it seems).
Your speed indicator shows you between 150 and 200 km/ hour (a prior) and behind you reaches a metro grape that sends you the car directly to the iron.
We had a debate for a few days to know whether someone actually thought at the creation of this game or even though the authors really take us for imbéciles.
The technical part of the game is not extra, but the visual part is generally nice and in some cases really super.
That is that in extreme situations the image does not hold the level and in some cases it is tragic.
This is especially concerning accidents with a large number of participants when a flower image will not serve you anymore.
The sound game is good and the track is in the choice.
In the purpose of enjoying the largest number and especially the younger public a new sound track was created in the style "I miss everything", but we can wait that no one will buy the game for music.
General pressure of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore really confused.
If the game did not have these stupid mistakes we could tell without fear that it is the best production of NFS in the last few years.
But this game gives the impression of not end.
Love is really good, but prepare to what the faults touch you in the eyes with the power of a air reflector.

Vicenova, Ambassador near the European Union:
Tschechs are as negativists and eurosceptics
"The Lissabon Treaty has radially removed the balance between institutions"
"I didn't wait for a too hard war."
"It will be 5,6 years before the situation is quiet and all players have a new role." It is so that Milena Vicenova has started its exhibition to the Czech Ambassador near the European Union.
When it has succeeded to describe the various EU bodies and their relations so comprehensible and visible, in the point that a large number of convergencies of the law of Charles University could have been invented, she showed how it takes its word "comprehensible and open to Europe" very seriously.
Mrs Vicenova has adjudicated Herman Van Rompuye, the new Permanent President of the European Council.
"At the beginning, it was the criticism that it was fair, that it is a round-to-cuir, that he could not fill any mission and I must say that he has cut the soup to all the world because he holds his role to perfection."
"It's a man who can listen to 27 Member States, to communicate with them and has a clear vision of the direction to take from Europe."
She explained the new position of the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and the Defence Policy under a response to the question: "Who is the one in the European Union?" "A what call I have to call?", so as an important step towards unity and a greater liability of the Union policy against states, such as China or India.
Nobody wants to prohibite us our syrecky (cott pop damage that feels very strong)
Mrs Vicenova has also stated the agenda that he had lived, lived and lived in a close time by the European Council.
She qualified the Tsk Presidency for two years of success.
Tschechs solved the amount of financial crisis, the gas crisis or a Summit for a East Partnership.
It has qualified the crime of a very negative governing and has disappointed the image of the Czech Republic.
Tschech representation to the EU is now very occupied.
Mrs Ambassadrice's words, "the activity has shot its full" not only for the Presidency but also for the financial crisis that continues to be resolved now.
Furthermore, it is necessary to approve the new seventh budget of the Union, which is very compliant due to the current economic situation.
As the budget seems to be mixed and for economies, what race will be the priority, which countries will be assisted at least, in the context of future negotiations.
Mrs. Ambassadrice recalled his slogans with which she came to Brussels "For an understanding Europe."
"I really don't like refreshments, foreign words, jargons that nobody understands.
As the citizen must understand that he is true that nobody makes round or dry corners, the bananas are very different or although nobody has prohibited us to make syrecky."
It wants to improve the EU environment and to see more cheques in the European institutions.
An Europe with several speeds is waiting for us
According to the Ombassadce, the Czechs have the reputation of being eurosceptics and people who do not see things only in their negative aspects more than positively.
Moreover, it is sorry to see a such small Czech representation in the European institutions.
The fault results, according to it, of several factors, such as the term of our candidates, their incapacity to write a motivation letter and a low support of the Czech Party.
In addition to a Tsk Presidency, she then emphasized the Force and Cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Create me, when you come to Poland, the Magyar, the Slovak, this French said to me, "Hey, what are you doing there, what does this group of Visegrad?" and it is not all content.
According to Ms. Vicenova, in a nearby future, these are more severe rules on budgetary policy that are waiting for the Member States.
This is the concept of a Europe at two speeds, if it is a number of speeds, which prevees rather than a "new European Federation".
"We have countries in the euro area and other out of the area."
"We have Schengen space, we also have the strengthened cooperation institution."
Firstly, it was said that they cooperated among the countries that want him and those who do not want to stay in their coin."
"There will be a lot of institutions of this type and there will be a Europe at two speeds," expected Mrs. Vicenova.
In this regard, she also appreciated the mission of the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuye to determine the bases that all the topics with EU impact should be discussed between all EU members and not only the eurozone middle.
History of a mark:
The IBM innovator begins the second century of its existence
If someone had to look for a call that expresses the IBM strategy, the next would be "the long term".
For a wide public IBM is the symbol of the technological revolution, it is a firm emphasis as very current and however since its creation has been held a hundred years.
The basis of this long-term strategy was thrown by the first head of the firm, visionary Thomas J. Watson Mr.
He left this slogan that many global problems can be solved for a little time that people are desired to think.
His Slogan "PENSE" became the explosion around which it will develop the life of a giant future (and also the title of the IBM's internal magazine which began to edit in 1935).
It was the foundation of the culture of the company, which was mainly developed by Watson.
For us IBM means a long-term thought of continuous movements directed to the future.
IBM has overlooked hundred years through the fact that she remained faithful to its basic values, and however he did not fear to change all the others around it.
This allowed us to transform technology, business and society during our first century.
We hope that in the second century, we will reach more" for the year the active manager of Samuel J. Palmisano firm.
A well prepared system
Watson, in the thirty-year-times, took care of his employees as Bata in Czech Republic - the people of IBM were the only among the first American employees who had payed vacation, a more eligible insurance payed by the employer and a well-developed reward system for inventors and commemorals.
In the same way IBM has a system of relations with the well developed client.
The company was at the beginning of a gentle start in the discovery of talents such as one of the first companys to have abolished any form of discrimination and could also have the choice.
The current plan is fully in the spirit of the anti-discriminatory strategy because it will be a Virginia Romatty woman - which should replace Palmisano's head.
This is working in IBM for thirty years and now is head of Ventes, Marketing and Strategy.
IBM during the past few years has done what is called Jay, the online brain-storming brain from what are many future strategies and innovations.
It is not wondering that there are many ideas - in the firm there are about 5000,000 people who work.
A institution with a good name
It is the internal and external image of the company to ensure him a secure position in business areas.
"After the beginning IBM had a concept of institution rather than a technological firm," Rosabeth Moss Kanter said, "Economy professor of the School of Economic of Harvard and the Book on IBM.
"IBM is not a technical firm, but a firm that helps solve business problems by using its technology," added Geogre Colony of the Forrester Research Forrester firm.
As the firm itself says, there is a difference between entering into the market and creating this market.
IBM - or the "Grand Bleue", as she is named Family to the United States, has increased to become one of the greatest world firms.
It is apparently the most polyvalent technological firm - it develops software, hardwares, infrastructure, hosting, server's Council Services to nano technology.
It has many patents of all American technology firms and five of its employees have received a Nobel price.
Among its discounts, for example, the payment card, the swap finance, the bar code or the disk.
IBM was found this year with $220 billion the second largest technological firm according to the market capitalization (the first is Apple) when the first time she overwhelmed in 1996 Microsoft.
Preview the most advanced
This is not all innovations and manufacturings that have been preferred by the client and time - for example, IBM has not successed the park on a OS/2 operating system, on the online proper service or on the IBM PCjr computer:
"Af the time your business is built on the advance movement you can't emotionally stay grown on the past," notice Samuel J. Palmisano.
So IBM has no problem to build its bases on many platforms and when they don't work.
For example, the Microsoft concept that holds and remains under the Windows operational system.
A perspective technology
In IBM income, services, which are formed for a fifth by software and hardware, have a preparatory place.
However, in 1990, she was with more than the most strongest representative of hardware.
Since 2000 IBM has sold low-related shares for $15 billion, it has invested $ 58 billion in the acquisition of perspective technologies.
It continues in investments and even since 2008, when for the first time it override the new financial crisis.
IBM negotiated according to the precepts of his first head Thomas J. Watson, which has also increased its volume of investment during the great economic crisis.
Is it now seemed that IBM had not been concerned about the current crisis?
The IBM action price has continued to grow up since 2008 with 120 percent, and the net benefit of the firm continued to be grown.
The IBM firm logo is to change all but not its values.
This flexible geography of other crises can be expected.
History of IBM: From divorce tranches to flights in the cosmos.
IBM (International Business Machiness) was born in New York hundred years ago; she was initially composed of the Tabulating Recording Corporation.
It took the name IBM in 1924 - initially was a brand used by a succursal of a firm in Canada and South America.
The base of the future IBM was the fusion of four firms whose history is linked to the 1980s of the ninth century.
They had technologies such as the former "points", the pendules that registered the arrival and the departure of employees.
The architect of the new society was Charles Ranlett Flint, which before the Society Surveillance Council until 1930.
Flint bound the chief of a concurrent firm Thomas J. Watson to assist him to manage the company.
The leader then made the shadow to the firm founder - it's Watson's ideas that are still resting the identity and culture of society.
Watson leads the firm in 1952.
IBM, as it says, started with the production of all possible machines for business and trade - the tradings of disappearances and meat to recorded falls.
During the first four years of Watson, the number of business was multiplied up to $9 million and started the expansion of the firm in all parts of the world.
Watson was so unpowerable that after 40 years of direction, his son is the manager of manager, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under its direction, IBM started the development of artificial intelligence and develops the first programing language.
In the 60-year-olds and IBM computers helped NASA leaving flights in the cosmos - on Mercure, Saturne and in 1969 the Lune flight.
Between 1964 IBM develops the first computer family - IBM System/360.
The classic PC that defines the time-time computer standard with the name of IBM 5150 comes on the market in 1981.
Fifteen years later IBM sold its computer factory to the Chinese society Lenovo, but buys the Pricewaterhouse Coopers, and started taking advice and services with a high value added.
The IBM strategy has been successful in the last three years - is the Smarter Planet concept "a more intelligent planet".
Its goal is the intelligent improvement of technology in areas not yet exploited, such as transport and management of towns.
For the IBM trade area, there is little time developed a "Smarter Commerce" platform which helps commercials to manage all the trade cycle.
IBM has a strong story also on our territory.
It created its successive in Tscholovakia in 1932 then the first countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, besides IBM RT, the Brno's strategic centre is also.
Center for Central and Eastern Europe in Prague, and there is also the research and development team of the global level that cares for the recognition of the word.
Rychtarava about her infidel husband:
You can keep this ass, I don't want it anymore!
Darina Rygherova (53 years) to this, it's finished!
After her husband Joseph Rychtar (53 years) was kept by the body and loved by Iveta Bartosova (45 years), Darina hoped even that Joseph wake up from his rock dream and returned home.
Only she could not wait and set clear rules for future life.
"Pepa can return home, but not as my partner" she explained Rygedorva.
When Darina Rygebrava gave asylum to Bartosova in her house, she didn't know that her couple wouldn't stand.
After 30 days Iveta insisted to move Ricany, Pepa did not resume the song.
And he was publicly loved him.
With the time Darina resigned, accepted his husband's link and ended to say that he was adherent forever.
Rychtirova isn't interesting to know who his husband is sleeping.
If Rychtar and Bartosova separately there will be no wife to get it on the step of the door of the house.
"It's the biological father of my son and if he wants to end his life in our common house, nobody put it out."
"It will be my old ear, who has lost, but a man with which I have a special relationship," he left Rygherova to show that she was detaineed from her husband but they are only in a decent relationship.
The fact that Darina closed her the door is not a problem for Joseph.
"I respect my wife's decision."
"I'll stay with Iveta and I won't change."
"My wife has set a marriage on paper and I respect it."
"The company continues, I take care of repairs, garden, real estate, I buy."
"Avec Darina is discussed completely, but we don't cook together", said Rychtar for Blesk.
If Rychtarava finds a new love, he won't prevent it.
"We don't cook together, and it's not interested to know where she's going, with who and if she has a connection.
I know that it's my fault, I fell in love of "Iveta, and I take all the responsibilities on me," concluded Joseph.
Women's worse: Does that also concern you?
If you ask men to determine typical seconds of women, everyone, like the other, are able to exit them from their lack.
My ladies, you'll know in the following lines of female seconds that come to pump the blood of men's vessels.
Buildings
Your half makes you comments that you're depending on purchases?
Do you have to buy you at least one clothing at a week?
Are you pleased to buy and buy packages at the time of money?
In your case we can talk about purchases as a second.
Some women think that they should leave their passion to make assets.
But you'll say, who would stay at the lake of clothing stores, looking for yourself with sweet clothes and then try them all in a cabin (the idea of different colours)?
And although most women's buying is a hobby, this may become a real disease for the man.
Just tell me how often you told your partner that he waits at the entrance...
Insatisfaction constant
"I'm not too big?"
"I'd need to smooth at least 5 kilometres - I should start sporting?"
"I like you?"
Didn't these phrases remember you anything?
Yeah?
You are therefore part of those women who are obedient by their appearance.
This is not the question that you should stop taking care of yourself but a lot of men is allergic because their partner is always going to complain from his appearance.
The strong sex is not to say that more the frequency of these complaints increases and more women become improving.
Hore and Privacy at the first place
It's like a infinite meal.
Lay the windows, pass through the inspirer, clean the suns, make the powder, discover the bathroom - and it's two times a week.
You make comments to your partner walking with selling feet on the own ground, to the children they left the lavabo, recorded the visa of the stayroom, and what gives you a lot of work?
In the case you just suffer this obsession, try with mind that there is nothing to extract and that the order and ownership must not be the first place in the family.
However, this unofficial desire of ownership can cause your relationships and even family peace.
Scientist work
"It's that survival used in the pool."
"Do you think to put these old chaussettes tomorrow?"
"An mobile service has nothing to do on earth."
If you do on your partner this knowledge work of this way several times per day, you'll really get it.
It is obviously that you don't think badly you want to make everything impossible.
Maybe if the men knew it, the women wouldn't have so much knowing...
Distribution, persifting
Distribution, persiffusion but also the insults against someone are also the own of certain women.
Women are particularly referring to relations, and they are satisfied to treat subjects such as, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us would leave a small inoffensive persiffusion here and here.
The hand on the heart is yet a particularity of women.
But the worst are those who advise, persippiate, even depress others and are for their surrounding - especially for the work in a collective of women - particularly dangerous.
Jagr and Voracek assisted by their participation in Philadelphie's victory
The Hokeyist Jagr attracted two times to the Philadelphia victory during the Monday NHL on the glass of Caroline and is again heading of the produced cheque players for the concours.
From the star point of the 39-year-old Claudius, who has yet done a more pass and was appointed the best player of the game, he marked in the two cases.
Jakub Voracek, who plays with Jagr also recorded two goals during the game.
Jagr after the game she explains to the out-Atlantic journalists that he had predicted Giroux that it would be a great evening.
"I told him before the game he would give his ha-trick."
"I heard it."
"When this feeling you fall up" explained Jagr after his action Giroux marks a goal of the first flyers.
One moment later there was a second seat of the Czech team.
Voracek fighted behind the goals of the Hurricans for the pallet and presented it to the Maxime Talbot Buster.
A second before the first Pause, the local Patrick Dwyer player made a descent, but the beginning of the second part belongs to Flyers.
Consequently in Giroux.
In cooperation with Jagr he marks three goals, then Wayne Simmonds transformed a fourth goal.
"I like to play with him."
"I don't mean he's the best player of the ligue but he's really part of the three best", said Jagr about his center.
"I never thought I'd play at the end of the carrier with a hokeygist like him."
"I'm really glad about that."
"I want to play on him."
"All these years to NHL the other team players tried to play on me, now it's my tour," added Jagr.
Caroline made a drama of this match because with a Toom Ruutu goal and Dwyer on a penalty course she ends with a difference of a goal.
Matt Read did not disappear other complications that end two against one.
"Pronger has made excellent attacks in our area."
"He knocked on the pallet, I took the speed and (Read) went to the corner the most far off of the cock.
"I tried to smile it and I came there," describe the last goal of the match of his Voracek view point.
Philadelphie has arrived with this victory in head of the East Conference.
The Czech Defender of Montréal Jaroslav Spacek did not complete the match with Buffalo, in second way, because of a wound in the upper part of the body.
The Canadians have not met with respect to a defence-defender experienced advance of two goals have lost after a penalty crap by 2:3.
Tomas Plekanec did not transform any of their attacks.
That's the fact that the back line was sick that mostly embraced the local training rather than lost puins because they played only with 5 defenders.
"It's no."
"We played the game only with an expert player, the remaining was young."
"But there is nothing to do, that's like this," said James Martin.
"Create Replace this hasn't enough and we couldn't rescue."
"We just had to simplify the game, put the pallet out of our area."
For this reason we had limited one of the P. K. Subban defenders.
Ondrej Pavelec, Czech Defender, took part in the thirty attack of Winnipeg and the victory on Tampou Bay.
5 different tourists participated on the Jets goals, which stopped a series of 5 loss matches.
How the travel prices have developed since 1989
To 1989 there were only five State travel agencies in Tschecoslovakia: Cedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autotourist.
Travel agencies at this time offered travels especially in the countries of the Socialist Block, as western travels were very limited.
Czech tourists traveled for holidays in Eastern Germany, Soviet Union (Sotchi, Crime and North Sea), Bulgaria, Romania (Two in North Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A great exception for the period from 1962 to 1972 when he was authorized to travel to Yugoslavia, then the regime began to have an excitation for the West and the travels to Yugoslavia were very limited to the Czech tourists.
The great paradoxe of the socialist time was that it was not authorized for the citizens of the socialist block (as the Czechoslovacs) to travel individually in the framework of socialist countries.
In the case that the Czechoslovak citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, in Poland or in the Soviet Union, he had to have an invitation letter unless the individual travel was authorized.
The travel offices at this time also offerd travels to West but had to make the whole night with a shopping bag or a "bone knowledge" within the trip agent.
And even after that it wasn't winned.
The agreement for curriculums which was the condition to travel to the west was rejected to people "againly wrong" who couldn't travel from all.
The Czechoslovac currency was not exchanged and it was not possible to get financial means without the Western visual agreement (West Monnacy) to travel to West.
Tschechs were most often their holidays in the country where there were many campaigns and chalets that the Czechs had been buying and so long until now.
Tschech trips have known a great revolution since 1989.
Although the holidays in Eastern Germany and Bulgaria were the maximum of 1989, the Czechs have passed the past four million days of vacation in the whole world.
The great paradoxe we have not aware today is that the most popular country is Croacia where it was not possible to go freely until 1989 because part of Yugoslavia of time.
The removal of visa in the last 90th century in the western countries caused a huge short-term visit in Austria and Germany.
Tschecoslovacs couldn't long travel through west aircraft that everyone wanted to see at least one moment.
For example, in Paris, the travel organizations would have slept Twos in park tents because our income wouldn't allow us to pay the hotel or pension.
The typical traffic of a Tschon travel was at this time to import with himself their own food, saucisson, etc. to economize.
Another important moment was also the interchangeability of the Czech corne, which finally allowed our tourists to finally have been able to buy freely from the Western currency.
Our living level and the average salary increased what has resulted around 1997.
With a growing demand for travel offices, travel agencies began to prepare tours with air cards linked by contracts formally reduced costs as far as it had been previously.
At the end of the 1990s of the past century, Tschechs had unviewed connections with the most developed world's world's developing countries, but the EU who later easily facilitated our travels.
Another interesting moment in the history of the post-revolution tourism, when the first air charter was prepared to an exotic country, Thailand, from the Czech Republic.
Since this year as each year direct air charters bring Tschech tourists into far-related countries; this hiver will be 12 exotic destinations from the Czech Republic.
It's more than 100000 cheques that visit the exotic countries every year!
Another interesting moment in this period that symbolizes our post-revolution development has occurred in 2008.
On 17 November 2008, the EU disappeared the visa for the Czech tourists and allowed our country to extend fully in the group of developed countries.
In 2008 also the Tschechs for the first time in the history have been more than the half of their holidays to the foreign (50, 3%) and for the first time in the history were exempt more than 15,000 krones per person for for foreign holidays, including the annexes.
The General Assembly must find his President but it is likely to end a situation without a "pad" solution.
Approximately 5th already the Czech football is without the President, and it is risking that the successor of Ivan Hasse at the Head of the Czech Republic's Football Association is not yet known after a General Assembly that should take place in Nymburk.
However, there is still no agreement in accordance with that vote Regulation must be done.
Without this agreement, it is not possible to start voted for one of the three candidates.
Jindrich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomas Paclik are interested by the Czech football direction.
Hasse gave his demission in June and during its start, his colleagues called together and find a strong personality that will lead football into the future.
Only during the sea after Hasse, the football returned back to divergence between the Association's rooms which cannot agree on a common candidate.
This was completely shown on 16 September when he had to choose a new president.
Delegates of the General Assembly have been unnecessary in the National House in Prague because the negotiation remained blocked and has not even been questioned to address.
There was no agreement on the fact that it had the right to vote to the General Assembly - only together, the statutory representatives or also the investing officers of full power.
There was a partial agreement since that time, with the assistance of the Office for the Status and the Law, that the representation on the basis of the full power is not possible.
Divergence continues on the election regulation.
It is too clear that the Executive Committee, which in its planned or extraordinary negotiations, has not provided anything to the situation.
The opinions on the possibility of vote have changed several times, but the nivralgic point remains the same.
The question is: how to process for the third tour to not fall into the pact.
"The talking threshold remained in the following fact: or to be done according to the statutes or to find another model," was one of the three vice-presidents of the Association of the Czech Republic of Dusan Svoboda who represented the professional football within the association.
According to the provisions of the model, the third tour of the candidates who will receive the most vote within the room for which it is candidate.
Morovia is ready to be removed in order to gain the candidate who will receive the greatest percentage of the two rooms.
And the Czech Party examines the condition that the winner should have the two thirds at least of the percentage of voice.
"Svoboda would then lose the idea of two previous tours, and it would fully refuse the bicameral concept," added Svoboda, which includes objections of the residence and the best would not change the regulation and vote in accordance with the existing statutes.
It is surprising that Tomas Paclik is also agreed even if it believes that the elections regulation established in accordance with the Pelta's status benefits among all candidates.
"I want the maximum vote in accordance with the status of the Association."
"Of there are no more saugreen ideas impressed by a representative as during the past General Assemblys," said the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is candidate for the first time and which is particularly defined against Pelta.
Pelta remains optimistic.
According to him in Nymburk, there will be a new president and believe that candidates will cooperate together and constructively.
"Today the possible qualification in Europe Championnat should calm everyone."
"The football will be again on a happiness vague and there will be more careful for cooperation" add Jabl's officer until the three have the greatest experience of football direction as well as regionally.
Rajchl is worse.
"I believe in this agreement, but unfortunately the situation is very hard."
"There is not a problem between the Czechs and Moraves, but there are trends to want to change the regulations to design."
"This can lead again a blocking to the General Assembly."
"I hope all the same reason that the healthy reason will win," said Rajchl.
There is no longer time for a common agreement to all parties.
Some reunions should be held directly to Monténégro but who can say whether all the football direction will be full for the match.
The specially afforded flight in which they should travel to Podgorie among the vice-Presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl had not deployed for technical reasons and was seeking a variation to take part of the Executive Committee on the ground.
At the end it is the ministerial meeting, which might have been a marriage, which should be decisive.
The Minister of Youth Education and Sports Joseph Dobes would be very happy to receive parties decisive within the country's strongest sports association and to bring them to a agreement.
In the game there are many: a state donation, football credibility, and also the Czech Union Sports Assembly, which must determine the direction of the Czech sport after Sazka's financial problems.
Paclik goes to fight for the President's office because he does not see any correct candidate.
If the Chief of the Plzen Tomas Paclic had seen before the General Assembly whose profile would have responded to all that it would request a new President of the Czech Republic Association (AFRT) would not be put into campaign for this high function.
"If such a candidate I support it, I fight for him and I don't present me to the election."
"But in the current situation it was not possible to find such a candidate," said Paclik to the Czech Presse Agency (CTK).
Paclik's motivation is to enter in competition with Miroslav Pelta and Jindrich Rajchl in order to just try to prevent Pelta to access the AFRT head, which would at priority provide favour for this selection.
Peclik also emphasized that, in the case of the elections, it would be the Chairperson's position until 2013 planned for a General Assembly.
It would well appear in the function a expertise and high-level manager but that is not linked to the football world.
"I have discussed with people who would have the profile," he said.
"For me this was terrible when some said to me they wouldn't want to be identified with the Czech football at this time."
"I would like to change this image," he added.
What is said, mostly Paclik, that is the relationship between Pelta and the regional Union Chair of the Plzen Roman Berbr, a man in the countermeasure that is known in the coulias as a lobbyist capable of affecting the vote of the Delegates of the General Assembly.
For Paclik, it is not acceptable that Pelta takes this position to the President.
"If he won, the current state would remain and there's nothing again in the football."
"And with the support of Berbr, which is a high-flower, it would be less favourable to football," she declared Paclik.
What the choke still is that the name of the Pelta was made a few years ago during hearing in the context of a corruption investigation, which Pelta had been unfairly caused.
"I don't know what pretty Pelta would bring to the football."
"And how we are considering the EUFA and the FIFA" said Paclik, "if Pelta becomes President, I'm selling the Plzen club."
In the case Paclik triumphed on Thursday, it should prove that he could cooperate with Felta.
Rajchl, another candidate who had been supported by Paclik before the General Assembly of September, which had ended by a fiasco, thinks the same thing.
"He (Pelta) would be the first with whom I would."
"There has great capacity"
"It would be able to present, for example, as a head of the representation."
"But as the Association manager it wouldn't be capable."
"I don't lay the nest in what I don't know", said Paclik, which in September took a great attention when he was planned for the cancellation of the Commission of Arbitres with Ludek Macela, which was replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclik claims that it would be at the level of managing the Association.
For example, he takes its capacity to manage private firms and he also guides the Plzen club since the past year, which was engaged with its support in May last its triumph in the first division.
"I have the force to change something in the sport world and to bring it a certain culture."
"I would freer the influence of some interesting groups who, for example, have tend to inflate on the disciplinary and appeal Commission, which leads to bad goose situations," added Paclik, which does not cut his anti-pathia for the Head of Sparty Daniel Kretinsky.
It would also consider harmonisation of relations with the Czech Olympic Committee whose lobby power to high-level policies would allow for more money for games.
"It's one of the key points the new President should take care."
"If this is the tax on loss games, as it explains the political parties, I understand their arguments but they should also say where money goes," said he.
Paclik does not take its current connection with the Plzen club as something negative, even if he claims that the President of the AFRT should be " above the parties".
Pelta is again bound with Jabl until and Rajchl with Dukla de Prague.
"It's not the ideal."
I don't see why to transmit my actions from the Plzen club to someone if I have to return one and a half years later," said Paclik.
Pelta promised new status for AFRT that should end the patch situations.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Food Association, one of the candidates to the President of Miroslav Pelta promised that, if it was chosen, AFRT will have new statuss that should end in the future for the election regulation.
The official of Jablclammar is before Thursday in Nymburk very optimistic and thinks that the success of the football representation today should be calmed before the vote.
Pelta before the election of September, just promised to be devoted to the national representation and to the obtaining of financial means if it was chosen.
It was decided to be candidate at the last time before the past of the General Assembly, and it might be able to defend its vision of the football direction and to present it in a wide context.
"The people at all levels do a football for a long time and are waiting for a Thursday there is a president."
"They feel that it is the best time for someone to take the direction of the Association," adds, but before all it is linked to the Jablinu club, he worked a number of years in the Department and the Executive Committee of the Union.
It also has enough experiences to lead the Czech football.
It is convinced that behind the current problems with the election is a euphorie that reacted at Ivan Hasek's time.
"Wellfully at the "General Assembly of June have been approved, which were not perfect as all of them were viewed."
"If all these different interpretations were already being a president since September," said Pelta.
It is just the revision of the most important document of the civil association who has taken attention to the delegations.
"If I have to be President, I will take it as a personal mission and am ready to take all the responsibilities in the case where it doesn't work."
"It's a principle without which we can't exist", added Pelta.
Then he is enforcing, said, not to confront his adversaries.
He previously said that he could cooperate with Jindrich Rajchl that he had recognized his training in law and that he continued to know that his adversary and candidate would be his first Vice-President.
He has no longer attacked Tonas Paclik for a long time which, contrary, stops Pelta criticize.
"He developed in the football for a year and has already been successful."
"Their attacks were not the most honorable and surprised many people during the campaign."
"That's why some now have any doubts about his character," said Pelta to the address of his adversary, but remained, said he, faithfully to the proclaims he did in September.
His strongest weapon is according to his knowledge of the football from the lowest level to the national representation.
It should be a football race.
"And I would also try to end all the cases that begin with the Bohemians or after the corruption scandal."
"I would immediately enter into negotiations with the public and private sector so we can get enough money for all football," said the CTK CTK CTK's 46th candidate before two months.
He also added that his appointment to the football would not bring any change of persons.
"I'd have to know with all employees," said he to Strahov where a understanding nervous reign is since there is no direction.
Although there are catastrophic scenaries planned with the General Assembly, he believes that the Delegates will not be in Nymburk for nothing.
"If there is a single point of discussion on how to vote on the third tour, we will come to over it."
"The football needs credibility and it will only receive it when there will be a new leader at his head," as Pelta says in optimistic way two days before the day probably determined for his officer carrier.
Rajchl promises that the AFRT would start to work hard under its direction
"When the current Vice-President Jindrich Rajchl is elected a new President of the Czech Republic Association to the General Assembly of Thursday, that would not like much people, para.
However, Rajchl promises that in the case that it would be elected, it will begin to work hard.
He wants systematic changes and will make members of the Executive Committee responsible for the various areas of football.
He also promised to regulate Bohemians cases, improve relations with EUFA and FIFA, bring more money football and continue the work started by the Chairman Ivan Hasek.
"Come President, I want to take a football over his whole."
"International contacts with EUFA and FIFA through national representation, professional football and a younger football. "
"But I don't say I'm gonna do all this alone," said Rajchl in an interview for CTK.
"I am a team player and I want to distribute the skills within the Executive Committee to make each member care of a determined area."
"And I'll distribute difficult missions to make the football a great step before."
"Wove people will not be content because it's going to start working hard rather than crying the others" he added.
He said that it would not be a candidate because of a critical atmosphere.
"On me we know I'm working 20 hours a day."
"But I need to know if it's going to do that, and if I'm gonna have people behind me, who'll put me without stop the balls into the roads and make any doubts about each of my actions," explaining why he's heated.
"Wooched people said to me that I don't have to deny because they wouldn't even deny."
"It's a confidence that I can't trace," said he.
What the motive is, saying, is also to continue the work started with Hasek.
"In the last two years, there was a great job, and I don't want to leave him to fall."
"They have been launched processes that will have consequences in a few years and I would like someone to stop it." He said with fear that, in the case of the election of Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the Union would come back as it was before Hasse.
"I believe in a systematic work and it's something Mirek Pelta can't do."
"That would be for those who were elected in the football behind him so that it would be only for the ones who were chosen."
"You can try to try me a number of things, but certainly not to support anybody."
"I'm trying to be a goal."
"I want to do football for all because everyone will be content not only those who have been chosen
And it reiterates that it would be just a Chairman for Tschech.
"And if there is any of those who say the contrary, I'm ready to make the maximum for Morovia."
"For example, it is time to consider that the second division is divided in two parties to the one cup and the other habitat whose winners would be found in the first division."
"There would not be a situation as currently with only three teams living in the division because the problem is currently to find young players.
As Tomas Paclik, President of the Plzen Club, entered into the competence for the Chairperson, Rajchl cannot evaluate its own opportunities to win.
"I feel still a Tsk Chamber which elected me his Vice-President and knows that there will be success with me," said Rajchl, who considers the futures of the success of the economicization of ten million krones on disavantaged contracts, negotiations of contracts with televisions and the law on games.
In contrast, he said that the fact that the Association is not union, is a common fault to all.
When he said about the Pelta, "when he is disqualified because with him the Czech football would lose his credibility," he thinks the second adversary Paclik is a strong candidate who has what offers to the football.
"Persoon can't doubt to Plzen that he has made this year a superboy work."
"If he had chosen, he would certainly continue in what has been started by Hasse and would not be a significant change among the people in the Commission."
"It wouldn't want to raise his success," said Rajchl who evaluated his river.
Europe's most beautiful pools
A smoke in the blue
De Julia Stanek
Oven's optic, magnific pools of Budapest: Who travels through Europe can live its blue wonder - and after turning the city or make a long promenade - can leave his legs made in gas water beans.
A book shows what base of birth can be the most well-being experience.
When Iris Meder was searching for the last 18 months, there is an object that should not miss in his bags: his bathroom mail.
Looking on her dose in the water, she observed the artistically arranged cuts, and nested at the front of the Putten Marines who waited for him from the other side of the pool and was not lacking to admire the New Meticulously restored art of these transformed pools.
If a covered pool had made her pleasure, she noted in her card without time all the worthy details of interest on the type of construction and the history of the building.
More than 200 pools have been recorded in this way by the architect of Meder and she presented them in his book already published: "Badefreuden (Joies del Bain". The covery municipal pools of Munich, the historic bath palace in the black forest, "Béton Hardcore" in Taunus.
It has conducted its "ships to the most exceptional banks of the Central Europe" in 13 countries. On the side of Germany, Austria and Switzerland, she has visited the places in Italy, France, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Poland and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croacia.
The 46-year-old German is a real warrant of the bath culture.
Meder, explains that she doesn't have a lot of interest for the sport, but ell feels taught to the water in a total different way.
It is irritant that the supporters of the birth must be able to contain blue cards and accompanie Javel's water pontator, while joggers respect the perfum with epice forests or can listen to the fresh oil gas of the park.
"I've been asked for a day why the pools must actually be always if laids," said the wine.
"I started a collection of beautiful baths."
The surface of water doublely strengthen the architecture
A pool in a pool and oil of sauna flights - well-being factor in birthrooms are enormous because all senses are evident, after Meder.
And if the buildings would be given a little more painful, the rooms to nest might be a real delicate for the eyes: "Instead of a plane, we have a water surface in the birthrooms."
"These is on one side transparent, but reflects on the other side the beauty of the whole building."
All surfaces are optically present in a double way: high, multi-color vows, tremplins.
The volume of a small image format "Badefreuden" makes a worthy report of 190 pages on the history of architecture and culture on the oasis of historic welfare - he certainly gives the desire to make a sad in the blue.
The collective Medder discovered remarkable examples during his research in Hungary.
Besides the well-being baths, as well as the Szechenyi's 100 years old in Budapest, she found water containing nitrate in a natural caverne in the carst (coverna in Miscolc-Tapolca) and a bathroom of thems with water containing alcaly and (Városi Termálvoordö in Jászberény) and found in a building in the form of bottle.
On the other hand, the swimming pools in full air from Switzerland and Austria offers visual views. Along with a pool of Zürich's bathtub you have all the city in his eyes, you can admire the Arlberg renewed from an external pool of St. Anton: The turcs is close to a window from which you can watch the animation on the ski pool.
Maybe the most extraordinary pool design is waiting for the neggers in Längenfeld: Aqua Dome Austrial is like a OVNI that comes to air on the Alpes.
In the hiver, the vapeur rises from the three open streets, while the back plane rises up the mountains of the Austrian to the sky.
Alhambra in the black forest
Javel's water owe does not emanate all the pools of the Meder collection.
Many thermic bains are an oil of sufre, from the Arpád-spa in the Hungarian Bekescsaba is a strong oil of petrole, which is difficult to believe, to find themselves in a health spa.
The odeur comes from therapeutical alphabet waters containing carbon hydrogene that is almost black and its limon you gather to the skin since you leave to swim into the pool - a special space experience.
During his research on the beautiful pools, Iris Medder also made deceptions: When she wanted to visit Bad Luhatschowitz, a free outdoor pool and full of the Tschecoslovaquie, she found a barried terrace.
The bathroom designed by the Dušan Jurkovic architec in 1902 was closed to time.
By throwing an eye push through the window of the Immeuble-Art New in red-blanc-jaun, she observed the expansion of bad herbs between the cars.
She observed an opposite effect in a charming pool in the Black Forest: The palace of thermes of Bad Wildbad.
This building has already survived three phases; we can discover not only the neo-roman elements from its design in 1844 but still a mass room in Alhambra, which was added to him in 1900.
Since its sophisticated modernisation in 1995, the thermal palace remains the favorite bath of the expert in pool, Iris Medder - and not only because it is original of Blackwald.
"It's already a beautiful performance that of the foundation of construction styles as different in such a formable unit," said Meder.
With such a palais, the threshold in the thermale pool is apparently only a small issue.

The German Bank considers in detail the specification of primary matters
Christian Teevs
Does the German bank leave its speculation on the first materials?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has charged a working group to search the impacts of the speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the Chief of the Group wants then to take effects.
Hamburg -
For the citizens of the Federal Republic, it is clear: According to a study, 84% of the Germans are unacceptable that banks specifically on primary materials such as mass and bullet.
Twenty-third persons who were questioned are even required that the German bank and other credit institutions continue that business adventure because it increases the problems of the poorest world.
This is the result of a Forsa survey on the agenda of the consumer organization of Foodwatch.
The study supports a report submitted by Foodwatch in mid-october.
The author Harald Schumann emphasized in this article that the explicitation of the Busses on primary materials, high prices and that banks share compliance with global famine.
Consumer protection campaign is concretely aligned against the Head of German-Bank, Josef Ackermann, even though large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are acting in the same way.
The primary material specification was initially introduced to protect goods against price fluctuations.
But most experts are often shared with the view that parents have been detained from the offers and demands, and have benefited to the costs of very poor.
Ackermann responded to the different crisis of the United States concurrents: it promised to investigate the reproofs and said, "No matter is worth the penalty to play the good reputation of the German Bank."
According to the information of SPIEGEL ONLINE, a international working group is currently reviewing the accused of Foodwatch-Report.
The review must be completed at the end of the year, and then the results of the German Bank's Administration Board must be submitted - with a recommendation usually.
At the end of January, the Head of the Bank will indicate the consequences to be removed.
It could result in a reduction of the first material market, or even a complete leave.
Ackermann builds its image
The Chief Foodwatch Thilo Bode welcomed the new, but at the same time confirmed its critics towards the financial sector: "The specification on the increase of food dense prices shows a particular way of dracony, in which the banks' banks today are now useful to the general interest."
Ackermann is the first bank lobby lobby to be today's obligation.
"The German Bank must remove all the places from its portfolio, for which money has been invested on food speculation," said Bode.
"This is a little important, for Mr Ackermann, if it is a question of deployed people or if the German Bank's reputation is played."
Awaremann's conscious presence can appear at first surprising view, but it is clear that the Group's PDG wants to present a perfect image, a few months before leave its functions.
The German Bank has announced Monday that the President of the Administration Council will not change anything to what was planned within the Administration Council.
Ll could improve its mark image with a abandon of controversed agricultural speculations.
And about the loss of evental eventually, he doesn't worry about it - his successor will worry about it.
One on two would resume the places on the first materials.
Foodwatch try to maintain strong pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 international persons have already participated in the organization campaign.
Bode published Mardi sondage, with which on 7 and 8 November the Forsa Institute has conducted questionnaires at 1001 people.
Just one percent found this legitimately that the German Bank proposes places for which pars on the prices of food products are made.
Many bank customers would also take personal consequences if they learn that their bank was involved in such operations: one on two would resume, after the song, all the loans for which money is injected in primary material specifications.
43 percent would decide from such a bank to their surroundings, 49 per cent responded that they would reflect their account to change the bank institutions.
21th house in Vienna
The Peaceline, which has moved
The Science Instruct
A history of architecture with high, lower, and Happy End: the Austrian plate for global exhibitions in Brussels in 1958 reported prices, was a museum in Vienna, left empty, then falled down.
It is now again open and holds place of exhibition.
If it is enthusiasm for a modern architecture, for its clear forms, its hangars in seeing, its living and awesome allies and its new construction materials that are typical of the technical progress, then the architect of the autrichian Karl swanzer architecture for the universal exhibition of Brussels in 1958 is a good and famous example.
The Pavillon de Schwanzer received the "Grand Prix d'Architecture" for its building in acid and glass, light and suspicious.
Today, construction is considered as an important stage in the contemporary architecture.
He made the architects so famous, that he also built the Pavillon for the next Austrian universal exhibition.
With its legal house at four cylinders of BMW and its adjacent construction in Munich, it finally becomes known at international level in 1973.
Its project was transformed as a temporary construction after the universal exhibition in the Jardin Switzerland at the south of Vienna, and in 1962 a museum of the 20th century opened.
But the building was neither physically or technically adapted for a museum - not walls to increase art works, so not a good environment.
However, it was too long used, until the contemporary art receives a new building in Vienna.
Since 2001, the building was empty and was further leaving.
At this time the architect Adolf Krishanitz transformed the Pavillon, it now takes the name of the "Maison of the 21th century" and will be used as museum for the contemporary art.
Tuesday, the Belvedria Museum opened, with which the house belongs, the first exhibition - a chance at any point of view.
The new start was well conducted by Agnès Husslein-Arco, which became the new Directorate in 2007 of the Belgium Gallery.
Husslein-Arco, has promoted an art history of a significant card among others in his young artistic patients, after Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and as a founder of the museum of the modern art of Salzburg, has conducted the work of transformation to political men and the protection of monuments, has obtained public and private sponsorship funds and has established the operation.
Except the contemporary art, the works of the sculpture Fritz Wotruba whose foundation is the same name there were exhibited, a coffee and a library there are found, and a office must be built there.
Early Surveillance, Small Budget
For the achievement, Kristantz was the ideal interpretation.
Not only because he had transformed and expanded with sensitivity the secession of Joseph Olbracht and that he had gained the concours, but because he studied in the Vienna Technical University and that the pillar was "a extremely important place" where he had seen "practically every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the project of origin, and he knew the problems of the building, lost in generosity and light following the movement to Vienna and its use change.
During the current transformation, there were big problems: the 'edivision was 'un erythror in energy', said Krisanitz.
The window profiles of the glass profiles have been changed, the isolated glass in green fibres was put and the tooth replaced by a particular security glass.
The thermal pounds were strengthened or replaced, and the clothes filled with friendliness were realised.
Two subsoles have made place to the new operation, a fixed light panel between the house and the road ensures lighting, a pont drive in the entrance - it's almost a new construction, but it's always easy Pavillon Schwanzer.
Outer gates of origin are left, the house is painted in a thick protection against red-brown rock.
And the cinéma room is even exactly identical to what she was once.
And this is under close monitoring of the competent authorities for monuments and a small budget.
"When materials that were good and little sweet must be found, and who also place the office of the monumental protection," said Krishanitz, and he focused on a gross earthquake in subsole.
Despite all borders, problems and transformation, the "Edivision" remained flexible and easy.
It would have been difficult with the Pavillon, "who comes from Brussels," said Cristinatz recently, a typical history of "Drop-in-the-City".
A such architecture is "unfortunately in the wrong place" and wants, although it wants to survive good conscience.
But in this case, the House of the 21th century does not be in the wrong place, because if it is a chance of urban construction: around the Jardin Switzerland is just a quarter of the central garden, all newly planned, with offices and apartments.
And another chance may happen: the House of the 21th century could benefit from the comfort of another construction Krisanitz, because the collection of Francesca van Habsburg has bought the province of Beerlinis, and, as it said, it is already negotiated with the city to get a site in the neighbourhood of Jardin Switzerland.
Bahn plans a hiver crisis in millions.
The railway society has developed a critical planet, which is aimed at avoiding hiver train accidents.
The number of employees should be doubled.
This costs millions.
In the fight against train accidents related to the hiver season and the late, the "Deutsche Bahn" railway society will exempt more than 70 million additional in this year.
The 'Picture' daily reported the prealable by calling an internal crisis plan to the group, that investments of a total of EUR 300 million would be planned until 2015.
This should allow better availability of vehicles and rail networks also in extreme enterprises.
The number of internal and external employees for the detection of rail installations and coastals should be doubled and over 16,000 people.
The goal is to disappear the snow and glass to the beginning of the service phase and 90% of the drivers required for service within a period of four-5 hours.
Two months ago, the Head of Rüdiger Grub has kept the government and the industry at a conference at the summit of train accidents also surveyed this hiver.
The last winter, the railway society, has had a lot of problems for the transport of users, because it lacks other reservations in cases of difficult meteorological conditions.
This is how many new regional trains are waiting for a authorisation from the Ministry of Railways since years.
Furthermore, there is a late in the ICE train delivery.
The ferry road society has been a year ago what to do, since it needs to check the ICE train thresholds clearly more often in the workshop, after a segment of the ICE was conducted in the central coast of Colonia.
The German Bank "Deutsche Bank" pays millions of penalties to the United States.
After the case of Chief Josef Ackermann, there is a new time in the United States: the German bank "Deutsche Bank" must pay a amendment before millions.
As if the problems of the German Bank were not yet sufficient, the past of this sector was rattrayed more than in the United States: the Francfort Institute pays $145 million in comparison to $06 million, to regulate a disparity due to the fatality of five major co-operative banks during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of hypothec documents.
The NCUA financial market regulator brings the large banks a series of appeals, and it has encouraged co-operative banks to make false promises concerning the purchase of financial products; they would have minimized risks.
These documents lost very valued during the financial crisis and entered banks to the lower.
"We are satisfied that we could find a solution on this matter, without the parties in the court proceedings," said a German Bank interlocutor in New York.
The Bank has not recognized any faults in comparison.
This is also valid for the Citigroup, which was committed to a payment of $20.5 million.
The President of NCUA Debbie Matz welcomed the concessions of the two bank institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) responsible for co-operative banks in the United States, and it is not important to protect customer deposits.
NCUA is trying to repair the damage of a number of thousands of dollars.
The comparisons concluded now are the first in their genre.
The regulator also took other large banks and has been assigned before the Court of Justice JP Morgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
With regard to the question of hypothec documents, the "Mortgage-backed Securities" is "Mortgage-backed Securities".
Credit houses are on the basis.
When the American Employment Building scattered in 2007, this was a fatal for a number of banking companies.
In September 2008, at the sum of the financial crisis, the United States Investment Bank grew up.
Even though the events are already given for a few years, it is now on the American banks a tempest wind.
The investors and monitoring authorities have tried many uses to obtain repair or to sanctify loss.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has declared the greatest burden of complaints.
It calls for 18 large international banks, two financials of the "American state of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are benefited in nature in cases of hypothecs of about $200 billion.
The German Bank should also provide a resource for the FHFA, and this is a number of operations of $14.2 billion for the years 2005 to 2007.
The monitoring authorities request that Frankfurter responds to the "sharing loss" but without quoting a specific sum.
The German Bank had rejected requests as unjusted and said to defend himself.
WARREN Buffect increased 10 billion in IBM
Buffect, the financial gourou invested colossal amounts in the IBM business.
Since March, he bought actions for more than $10 billion.
The large American investor Warren Buffect explicits without ceasing invest in informatic enterprises, since the long-term evolution of companies is only bad pronostics.
However, he read IBM's reports and changed its opinion on investment in this sector.
It had already been understanding much early that IBM proposes mostly services and information systems for other business sectors.
Warren Buffect's investment is considered as a hair attack in the finance world.
Therefore, the IBM activity has the right to be called now "Monstor IBM".
Because Buffect today revealed the CNBC economic emission that he bought since March of the IBM actions from $10.7 billion.
His investing company Berkshire Hathaway has thus become a large IBM's actionnaire with 5,5 percent.
Buffect said IBM has never known anything about this commitment until now.
He welcomed the direction, even during the economic crisis, reasonable benefits.
"You have done a great job," said the Buffect strategically.
IBM has developed for a long time on IT services as "operation of accounting centres.
The information pionnier, older than 100 years, offers also software and consultation as business calculators.
Buffect had to have to avoid technology companies.
He said that he was only investing in the business which he understands.
But on the contrary, Buffect is rather attracting the rail flower, the producers of lubrifiants or machines.
Her Holding Berkshiire Hathaway is located nearly 80 daughters, and parts from all of a number of large groups such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, the former back municiois.
This 81-year-old was the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway, and he reiterated it to one of the world's most prestigious enterprises through intelligent investments.
Yet, his style of life is modest.
That's why it's a religious figure for many investors in the whole world.
His feeling almost unfair to win money has valuated him the surname of "Orcle d'Omaha".
After the advertisement of Buffet investment, IBM's actions increased from one percent to the boundary.
"Big Blue", as IBM is also called, has a total of more than $220 billion and accounts with Apple and Microsoft among the most precious technology companies in the world.
At Microsoft, he said Buffect, he doesn't want to participate in it.
The founder Bill Gates would be a very good friend.
The threat is palpable
After the discovery of the "Zwickauer cell" the Turkish media doubts the German law status.
A newspaper also speaks of a " bloody ideology" that would come back.
The murderers of eight tourists and a small Greek company in the year 2000-2006 had a extreme context.
Following this new, Turkey and the German-turk population responds with fear and concern.
For for many German-turcs the spectrum that we had been believed for a long time reflecting its appearance: since the burning attacks of Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there was no more violence comparable with this extreme right context against Turks.
A xenophobia in Germany, however, has never been questioned.
The extracted right network that has been discovered, however, revealing the proportions of which dimension is far from being previsible.
"It's a return to bloody ideology," "There was the title of the view on the Internet of the Turc daily "Haberturk".
The "Sabah" magazine emphasizes that one of the authors would be a man of the Constitution protection, and worried about the fact that the German authorities could be involved in the browser of extremely placed.
It is reasonable that the Turkish community in Germany replied: she called this weekend to a silence communication to the victims of racial violence at the Brandeburg door.
It is only two weeks before the Turkish community in Berlin and the German and Turkish policies thought to a ceremonie of the fifth anniversary of the German-Turch Recruitment Agreement.
It is with gay colors that the cohabitation had been set to scene, symbolizes a success history.
The reports of some Turkish media are the effect of a jaff: "The cadeau of Germany for the fifth anniversary" is the title of a article in the Turkish Platform "Haber X", which refers to the context of the series of murders.
So the German view of the "Hurrive" does not have to do with the unilateral conditions.
"He starts to boy," Tel is the title of the chronic of Ahmet Wielahci.
There is emphasized that people would have been killed, paid taxes and would have made a significant contribution to Germany's reconstruction.
Police action was very critical on German-turn forums and they had been discussed by the success of their research.
Why he hasn't come much early in the spirit of the German authorities to make research in some suspected environments of extreme right, the authors acknowledge.
More than one is ready to be at least to drastic means: "If the case continues to be abolished, it will remain to migrants nothing else than self-defence and weapons."
"It will be the best self-defence."
"Inner peace in Germany strongly depends on the quality of information and maintenance of the punishment of the whole network", written "Selen".
This means whether internal peace in Germany is in danger, the attents of Mölln and Solingen in the 1990s have well explained.
The photo of destructions after Solingen burning is deeply closed in the German and Turkish memory.
Because no other event has been clearly shown to the Turcs living here that there is a tangible threat, and the Germans, on which misfortunity and distance could be disappeared by acts of violence.
However, attents have increased the feelings of us in the Turkish community.
Don't repeat past errors
Another time, this is most often the exchange of the German policy after the attacks whose Turkish press: Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the burning of Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Chief of the Turkish State, was represented to the functions in Cologne by his Minister of Foreign Affairs Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel contained timely in his talks, as many taxes produced local Turkish population.
As if the value of a person could be evaluated on the amount of its tax charges.
The current report of the Turkish media shows how many German-turcs have been deep to the "local law status since this date.
In addition to the efforts of an easier clarification and review of the extreme-drome terrorism in Germany, a clear message is that time necessary.
The Cross Bank of the Zürich Lake
The most appreciated European Bank is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS has been almost fair in financial crisis and patients at the same time from a crisis.
It's a German that's got to go now.
This is certainly not what Axel Weber was imagined.
After the Federal Bank Chapter, it was known in July, that he would take an approximately spectcular position in 2013: President of the Office of the Swedish Bank, a great step towards an unexpected and lucrative carrier.
Axel Weber was publicly glad, welcomed; Switzerland for his beauty and UBS for its recent solidity and has been loved comments on future colleagues.
"UBS has successed Turnround."
"I'm glad to cooperate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel."
And yet, since the month of September, it was clear that everything was going to change.
A UBS title sale in London decreased all the bank security systems and burned approximately 1,7 billion euros.
The UBS Administration Board Chief Oswald Grübel, a well known banker not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
by the President of the UBS Administration Council is considered as suffering - and all asking: When will Axel Weber come to the end?
We have already learned that Weber can be advised from the bank since February 2012.
And he will take the presidency of administration already in May - not in 2013, as he reported the Tuesday Bank.
This is difficult for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, a lot more professor of economic and bank president and would certainly have needed an adaptation period.
On one occasion, he then takes the responsibility for the bank strategy, which is to prove again again more than it has missed the title of the "the larger bank in scandalous Europe".
In fact, UBS is from a huge side - until last, she was the largest manager of the world's actives, and otherwise, it suffers for years of a scandal to the other.
Nothing seems to disappear the Swedish flower bank.
This started during the financial crisis.
The UBS had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss manager of active, silence and solid, but also russed, was combined with ambitious objectives: it also wanted to become a very large bank.
So the UBS would lead from one side in 2007 with $1,6 billion more money from an ad hoc client than any other bank in the world.
On the other hand, it has developed as a bank of investment in the world's larger banks.
That did impression.
The old Banker Hans Geiger and later bank professor in Zurich says: "I always took UBS as a good bank model before my students."
"In the current optic, you're asked, "How would I just be able to miss me at this point?"
He's deeply stubborn.
In 2007, it appeared that for the first time, something was not around the UBS.
In the middle of the year, President Peter Wuffli was a surprising way, which was considered to be a high intellectual and a gentle banker.
A few months later, we were pressed for what reasons he left.
The division of the bank had burned with sub-prematured documents and had a cross on billions.
The UBS has announced an increase in the capital of a amount of 13 billion francs and made a crown above.
For this reason she actually found investors, but, a little time before, would have broken the souries: a non-transparent Asian status fund that comes from Singapore and a Arab state fund, which was passed under silence, at the point that the name has never even learned.
It was not only the first thing.
In April 2008, it was completed.
The Bank had to advise the losses in milliards, the President of the Marcel Ospel Board, which was still the second Administration Council in 2006, the best payed in Switzerland.
In October 2008, the UBS was followed: taking into account its investment errors, in the financial crisis before the fatality and will be saved by the State.
The National Bank has sold the UBS ten billions of problems, and the Swedish Confederation has given six billion francs for conversion obligations in actions for which it could be co-operated by the bank.
Switzerland has been shoted - because she noted what point this could be dramatic for a small country, to open such large banks.
Finally, the UBS 2007 total balance has increased more than five times in the Switzerland economic performance (see graph).
"We couldn't save UBS once again," said the bank researcher, Geiger.
After the first disaster, the second was followed.
For a few months ago, UBS had been capitalized because of a fiscal dispensation with America and had been ready to publish the data of the asseted client, which might be broken by the Bank's assistance.
Furthermore, it accepted a payment of $780 million in reimbursement of unjustified benefits from these operations with an amended majority.
The UBS has thus published more or less than it had been assisted to fiscal fraude.
At the same time, she lost something that has always been its capital in competition with the rich customers: the prejudice of discretion.
After the offense, the Swiss secret was no longer the same.
It follows the repair of the Chief of the Administration Board and the Chairman of the Administration Board.
And the exempt of the customer's money.
Thus, in a few months, the bank had lost its credibility in the two main case sectors: bank investment because of bad spectrums and the management of assets because of fiscal fraude aid.
And, as there was a little back to quiet, and as we thought that UBS would go out, he followed this bad story of title goods: a single flower bottle of €1,7 billion before the bank appears that something turned around.
And it is published: with the management of investment risks, this seems not always to work.
"After the Adoboli case, we have been able to find that the supervision of risks to be too little changed," said Martin Janssen, economicist and professor of financing at the Bank Institute of the University of Zurich.
So the financial director of a large German bank is sure: "UBS's problem is that it has no risk supervision."
However, it was exactly the idea of reasonableness, with which the Swiss bankers had taken their function for a long time, that was to be observed by the great power of the world: not too large risks, but the security for money - and the world could well be found beyond the Alpine Republic.
The Swedish bank treasures became the symbol of an unbelievable reliability like Lindt and Sprüngli are for a particularly noble chocolate.
The UBS Central in Zurich will still be paid with the private Swiss bank's solidity – it is just a little larger.
The situation is already classic.
The Bank has his seat at the Zürich central garden, which leads directly from the central garden to the Zurich Lake, which himself is around by the Swiss summits.
The buildings are pretty pregnant here, the store lowers are among the highest Europe.
The additors like Tiffany are found here between the Swedish stores as well as those of the Sprüngli confise.
Since the centuries of the Swiss bankers were settled here: from the national bank through the Crédit Swiss palace to private banks such as Julius Bär.
We're coming in the UBS entrance hall through a hard door.
Inside, the walls are clothed with marbre, before they are shot tips of kitchen, and next to the bank logo, a large label for "safe".
UBS knows what the customer is looking here: security.
This idea of the Swiss bank is one day or another disappeared from the market - or drives the two large Swedish banks, UBS and the Swiss Credit, as a manager of a small Swiss private bank.
He would not prefer to read his name in the newspaper, as all the Swedish bankers also do business with the two large banks.
The UBS would become too large, is it - especially in bank investment, where English would be spread.
Switzerland wouldn't have any more to say.
"And even, they've been adjusted to the moods of the Angle-Saxons for a long time."
This was actually the English-saxone investment bank, which changed the UBS, and made high benefits and then the deployment: no European financial institutions has lost so much money in the sub-prese jungle like the Great Swiss Bank.
The catastrophe became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"What mercred the government coalition of the small country to seven million inhabitants has undertaken the greatest rescue operation in the history of their nation," author Lukas HUM in its book "UBS crash".
With about 68 billion francs, or 45 billion euros, political men accepted saving the large bank.
How could it happen?
If we speak with Swiss bankers, they see the problem especially at the size of UBS.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swedish banks concluded a huge group.
A bank was created, which was already too large for the small Swiss - and recorded an increase without ceasing.
What helped is that the two different UBS banks have complemented: a rich bank, but in the léthargie, with a strongly management of actives in Zurich and a poorer, but certainly already more internationally.
At the same time, international investment banks welcomed many money, with which they were able to turn a huge road.
Two names are associated with UBS ascension: Peter Wuffli, 2001-2007 Chief of the UBS Group, and Marcel Ospel, otherwise President of the Administration Board.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a dream team," said the bank researcher, Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the great modest intelligent, which is very well in the models and statistical models, and Ospel, the intuitive, which was a way to the summit with bank learning."
But the Omega would have been fitting until the end of Wuffli.
And weakenly would have done at the end a decisioning error: "He thought that his models were reality," said Geiger.
"It's a tragic crack."
Tragic, maybe.
One thing is clear: the obsession has happened before the fall.
The UBS staff is clearly remembering the leaders meetings in which the Chief of the Wuffli Group always made the same word: deteriorate Goldman Sachs.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank of the planet.
She commanded "League Tables" the classifications, which have documented the success of banks at this time.
After all the UBS wanted to go up.
Some steps have already been successed.
In the case of furniture and transactions of mobile values, it has played a very important role.
However, business advisers, who had the responsibility, emphasized a weakness: in international interest operations, in the "Fixed Income" banking jargon, there would be a huge difference in comparison with the larger banks.
UBS would have milks at the level of US hypothecs.
To understand this lack, UBS was launched in a adventure, which almost costed life.
Growth abstracts, also the bank itself is that a management fund created before it in the US sub-pre-pre-premised places they invested.
It was transformed into a massive machine that embalked and translated the value documents based on the American hypothecs loans - but that also maintained risks.
Even when other banks were trying to get down for a long time.
"Again, in 2007, when the American real estate market was in flowers, UBS bought there," said Geiger, bank expert.
More the euphory is greater the pit is brutal.
A manager after the other had to leave, when he put a term to the attempts was more difficult than it was thought.
In the UBS, there are places to be equipped and are until now banking.
He who leads the big bank has a almost impossible task.
It must find a bank strategy, for which all proposed business models were lost.
The bank researcher has already a idea: put a term to the investment bank, concentration to the management of goods, return to the Swiss roots.
But the bank does not want to go so far.
But the investment bank must be aggressively attracted, as soon as it is clear until now.
Once Thursday, Sergio Ermito Bank Chief wants to present its future strategy to the world.
The 51-year-old Italian was only supposed to be transitional as the bank separated with a surprise of his predecessor Grebel.
During time, it was imposed: it must sustainablely conduct the business of UBS, reported on Tuesday the Bank of Zurich.
Ermtie wants to return the investment bank to the 1990's progress status.
He cancels 3 500 jobs.
But it's not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is she?
With what does she want to win money?
These are the questions that "Axel Weber has certainly already been set.
He publicly said that he was only going to find with his wife a apartment in Zurich.
The next year.

"We are obliged to live with them, we can't destroy them."
The problem is not allowed to solve in cities without the inclusion of the petrol, according to the view of the Wolfgang Kellner of Leer.
Concevable is a combination of the appearance of animals to an accredited condition and offers to allow them to reinstall otherwise.
Psychologus and ethnologus, Uta Maria Jürgens planned "the info panels at the place of throats" to establish fully different relations with the: "We can finally better support a button in the face with a dose of trust in himself."
Jürgens has co-based the Ascheberger-chember educational of the Trases at Schleswig-Holstein, road panels reporting about the life of these very intelligent fresh flows.
This project was adopted by tourists.
Jürgen has given his own opinion about the critical regarding the noise caused by the birds: "This is a great number of communications, these birds have much to say."
Intelligence and power of animals are legitimate: fresh work tools do not only be used to reach regularly but they produce their tools as work tools.

Personal disagreement
The new book of Peter Englund offers deep and generosity. titled "The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate History of the First World War" (The Beauty and Chagrin: an intime history of the First World War), it begins with a long list of persons who reveal the heart.
A advice to start: Call this page sensitively and make your mark-page.
You will learn to know these people detailed. In this romantic record of Peter Englund, this list of persons will be your GPS, a label during the few moments where, like one of his men or women, you will be jealoused and disappeared in the breasts of the war.
Peter Englund is a Swedish history and journalist.
It is also the new Permanent Secretariat of the Swedish Academy, which releases the Nobel Price of Literature.
He wrote here a book outside of the common, which he described, with exactitude, as an anti-related work.
It contains some known names, important treaties or famous battle treaties; no ambassadors or discussions on strategies and materials are found.
It's not so much a book about what happened, explain it that a "liver described what it could seem." There are found the "sensitives, impressions, experiences and humors.
"The beauty and chagrin" resumes the experiences in wartimes of 20 men and women more or less ordinary, both sides of war, young schools and botanists, through doctors, ambulanceers and vendors.
Some will bring us heroes.
Others of war prisoners, some will lose members, become funny or lose life.
They live here, like the chiefs of a church: then some are learning, they are ralling news.
The book of Peter Englund distracts traditional stories.
It brings a decline to the idea that the World War Real War only is resumed by the terrible war of the tracing on the Western front.
"Beauty and chagrin" describes, in fact, other war theaters: Alpes, Balkans, Eastern border, Mexico and East Africa.
The soldiers present in this book are under roads; a Christmas passport in Egypt under the pyramids; the shocked tackles are an iniquity problem.
This book is emotional from the first page.
The war invade life of these people like a natural disaster, such as a mosagan Katrina who pushed the corite.
When canon knocks rise away, and you're a mother at the fountain, are you staying or escaped?
Who'll come in any way?
Just no one can understand what happened, nor even the reasons of this war.
According to Peter Englund, "the lack of fact was made by oppositions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, inspired theories, dreams, dreams and rumors."
"The beauty and chagrin" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nourrice within the Russian army, as well as Richard Stumpf, a young marine of the high sea fleet.
Their stories are mainly covered by memories, letters and other documents already published.
The versions of their lives can be terrible or passionate, but are more preservated through the accumulation of small times and details.
Most of us address the privacy and the ability to leave it.
It tells the story of a German school, Peter Englund writes: "Reset, overall replace."
"Cap of replacement, fair aluminium, cooking imitation, paper bands, wood buttons."
He continued on the food of replacement in Germany.
It describes the "viding made of river kitt brown in the grass of mout (and ends with a false bow bow) ; the tabac manufactured with sweet roots and the hair seated of earth's powder; the woods of shoes. "
He states that "837 authorized substitution meats are registered in the production of saucees, and 511 caffees of replacement are also found."
Some stories address the honor and strength.
A American recognizes his own pulsion to the wildness and explains about the war: "You feel that after all, it is what men were intended, rather than to sit in a comfortable fault, a cigarette and a whisky on the hand, reading a newspaper or a best-seller, and rather than to make sure that such a vernis is a synonym of civilization, and there is no barble behind your packed and locked chemises.
Indeed, a British soldier realizes that it might be able to die, and no one will not consider it or will take attention.
"When it is designed to be sanctified, we hope to have a public."
It's unfortunately comparable to " a man condemned in secret."
Other observations concern the decline of an old Europe and new terrorism.
"The conflict becomes a story of economic competition." Peter Englund wrote, "a war between uses."
He understood the arrival of what he calls " a new species within the beginning of the century: the murder of goodly elected mass and convaincing ideologically, in well-good clothes, which executes his pitcher as well as sitting behind a counter."
People act unexpectedly, so much of basic behaviour as heroism is found.
Peter Englund speaks of soldiers that have attained all the prices to attack veterinary diseases in prostitutes to avoid the service at front.
"It finds the largest expression in the powder trade, which soldiers buy and steal on genetic organs in the hope of ending to hospital," he writes.
"The most desperately applys it to the eyes, what is translated by a life-life cecale."
In this translation of the Swedish by Peter Graves, the prosesese of Peter Englund is flexible but not attentive, perfectly adapted to his task of humanity.
In decades of short scene, he understood the way the war had "detected in exclusively uncontrolled forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, an advertising for religion " .
People begin to ask why their leaders are making them a war.
The best work of the First World War is often indirect, such as "Great War and Modern Memory" (The Great War and Modern Memory) of Paul Fussel, or "After nothing again", by Errich Maria Remarque, rather than complete.
Peter Englund's work is a little conventional pantheon.
The end of the book is the most appreciating thing I read in a non-fictional work.
I won't see her.
But it's like he had onto his book, put out of your hands this page where the list of people contains and burned with an alumatist.
After first fault, a minutely planned operation
A hundreds of police officers have been involved, some of which have anti-emerite cases.
The Monday night on Monday was chosen because the Zuccotti park would be empty.
The operation remains secret of all horms of some high officers and others from the beginning that they were going to carry out a year.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was in the heart of the operation, and his presence stressed the risks and challenges for the Department of Police.
There couldn't be any repairs of "pisodes" last weeks, such as the use of iron gas against demonstrators, which were governed against the Department Regulation and generated a shadow of public solidarity for demonstrators.
Operation for cleaning the Zuccotti Park has been developed after two weeks of planning and training.
Policians were prepared by watching the deployment of jobs in other cities.
A capital period was organized on Randall island, in view of the operation of the Zuccotti Park.
Police officers receive a better training against eyes - anti-terrorist anti-terrorist measures that are soon to move a large number of police officers - to concentrate on the Lower Manhattan area.
The last training session was held on Monday night, on the side of Manhattan of the East River.
The orders to move to the park have been " in the last minute " said a habitual, referring to the operation as a " simple exercise " .
"The couple of policeers I know and who were called didn't know they would come to the Zuccotti park," said the person under anonymat.
"The only ones to know that they would come to it are at the sum of the architect of the Department of Police."
The city has holding a lesson, from there the secret of the operation.
On 14 October last, police officers wished to clean the park, but were reproached by hundreds of demonstrated plans.
Mardi's operation involved the officers of various police units, including operational forces of all the area of ten officers used in particular criminal villages.
Mr. Kelly said that many people were going and came to the park during the day, in the way of migrants. So a morning hour was a proper hour.
"He agreed to proceed when the park contained at least of people," said he.
Cars of emergency services equipped with spots and high-parlers were collected on Pipe Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan pont, before interviewing.
The recorded lights and messages with high speakers have seemed to intimidate the manifestants.
While officers to Community affairs arrived in the equipped park of their blue clothes, many demonstrators simply gathered their business and go away.
No tent has been touched before 1 p.m., or the police has left the time for employees to gather their business.
Other police teams were viewed on the period, ready to intervene if arrests were necessary.
Journalists present within the park have been forced.
Paul J. Browne, the Police Chairman, said that this measure was taken only by security.
But according to many journalists, the police would prevent them to observe the intervention within the park, directly retained by officers.
Mr. Browne said that the television cameras presented on Church Street, the west side of the park, were able to capture images.
While the police moved to the west through the ground of the events of manifesting business, including bags, plastic gas and boards full of clothes, teams of the department of sanitation followed, cleaning everything that the employers had left behind them.
The few demonstrators who refused to leave have been traded. The images have been distributed on the Internet a few times later.
The main group of demonstrators took place near the kitchen of the campsite, not far from the park center.
Some have formed a barrier that the police had moved to stop metodically.
A ten of persons at the screen of the campsite were accompanied together.
Finally, two persons were caught in the trees, said Mr. Kelly.
The emergency services were called to cut the chains.
No arrest had been held in the park before 3:30, Mr. Kelly said.
According to the Police, the cleaning operation has completed about a hour and four later.
Mr. Browne, approximately 142 persons were arrested in the park.
most for " public and refusal ".
Joseph J. Exposito, Police Department Chief, is the most grate office to be found on the places.
Phil T. Pulaski, Chief of Detective Department, was also present.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "not leading the operations" said Mr. Browne.
A second group of policeers patiented the east side of the park, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, if necessary, if necessary.
Barricades were located on Cortlandt Street, a home pool to the north of the park, as well as Pine Street, south.
There was the police to expand the periodic over the Zuccotti park.
Many of the officials, most equipped bulleters, would even have been seen to throw people to disappear.
Approximately 28 people were in the north side.
One of the most living actions in the night had occurred in the south of the park.
To 5 p.m., south of Pine Street, a shower seemed on the head of a police car. Others were seen in the train of creating the fingers of a police train.
At a moment, a boat of counterplay rose up by flying the people.
Finally, a policeman and a manifestist were hospitalized.
The school assistance syndicat continues the city for licensing
The syndicat represents hundreds of school assistance lost their employment in the last month is intended to engage in the city's proceedings for non-discriminatory and discriminatory licenses. The impact is disappeared on schools welcomed students.
Prosecutors are likely the final weapon of the syndicat, the 37th District Council, to try to cancel the licenses.
Sixty-third school assistance, parents-co-ordinators and other employees, taking part of the lowestly paid in the city, lost their employment on 7 October last. Independent leaders compared these licenses to a political trade unions that have not allowed the city to access a health care fund directed by the working groups and that would have been allowed to close the budget disappearance to the last print.
The municipal authorities have denied the accused.
At a hearing of the municipal Council in the last month, Mr. Walcott said that the licenses were a part of the budget covered in June.
One member of the Council said that school assistance licenses were not specific in the budget.
The Council officers of the 37th District stated that they would comply a complaint on reclaiming advice, warning the Department of Education that it would continue; a press conference will be organized on mercredi to announce the judicial continuation to the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
Dennis Mr. Walcott and the Departement of the City's Education will be the defenced part. The plaignants will be represented by eight licensed workers, all black or Latin American origin, such as most school assistance that have lost their employment.
Elizabeth Thomas, a Port-Party Departement of the City, said that municipality had not yet been able to see the reasons of the process and therefore could not make comments on the allegations.
According to a building of complaints obtained by New York Times, the syndicat missed the number of licenses in the highest divorced villages in order to support its complaint against an unfair treatment, explaining that the poorest schools would lose the most help because of a regularly underfinancement.
Although there is no license on the Icelandic states, and some attempts in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa institutions, 17 school assistants have lost their employment in the 23th District of Brownsville, and 46 in the 8th and 9th districts of South Bronx.
In view of the loss of eight school assistance at the public school 36 in Harlem, where 68 per cent of the students live in poverty, the continued states that "There is not a settlement of unemployed parents that can provide funds to comply the lack of budget."
The Public School Budget 36 was reduced by 3,26% this year. The funds were also lost when the city has changed its calculation of additional funding for all deforested students.
The syndicat also claims that the directors of the leisure could be deceived by some terms in a memo authorised the license of parent coordinators.
The meme used the term "passing" to describe the action, even though "transfer" generally describes the action to move a teacher from a school to a group of available workers that are payed by the Central Office.
According to the draft complaints, “Six-six-coordinators of parents have been licensed” and "not only because of exchange".
The Congress will find an agreement on the issue of the Libye
It would finally appear that the Republics and the Democrates had found agreement to the Capital on the issue of the resumption in Libya.
There will be a successful deployment, capture and death of the long dated Muammar Kadhafi and American implication.
The Committee for Foreign Relations of the Senate should take a next marchday decision, supported by President John Krry (Democratic - Massachussetts), with Senators John McCain (Republicain - Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Independent - Connecticut), applauding the libian people for their revolution and the American troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is to honor the strength of the Libyans while they starting to rebuilding their country," said John Kerry.
"It is a bipartian support to their democratic aspirations."
The language may be unoffensive, but the discussion on the Libye has never been simple until now.
This was the lawyers of the two parties have entered into conflict, as well as with the White House, on the formulation of several resolutions to adopt or not the military role of the United States in the OTAN mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution to authorize the limited employment of US military forces in Libya.
The draft law was sold by a wide bipartisan marge and has never made a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day the draft law, the Deputy Chamber also rejected a measure to reduce the financing of the United States operations in Libya.
The American mission has therefore remained under a legal cleaning form - the Congress sufficiently contrary to criticalize the mission management by Obama, but not enough to cut herb under his feet.
The Decision of the Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell under insurrections in August and Kadhafi was killed on 20 October last.
The OTAN mission has been officially completed on 31 October.
The Senate can now act.
The Committee on Foreign Relations "effective the Libyan people for its strongness and extraordinary determination for freedom" and "First men and women of the United States armed forces and their coalition partners in military operations to protect the people, their fantastic force and professionalism."
The resolution also affirms "the national interest of the United States to reach a irreversible and successful transition to democracy in Libya."
Will the new measure provide the Commission for Foreign Affairs in the Senate or would it distribute the legislators as last in June?
The Senator and President of the Commission Richard D. Location (Independent) opposed the last version.
His door speaker said last Monday, Richard D. Location had not yet read the last new version of the project.
In the Capital Chamber, the Chamber should vote this week a amendment to the Constitution to obtain a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all the Congress Republics, and a few Democrates.
The measure supported by the Republic of Bob Goodlatte (Verginia) will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other question to get a vote to the Chamber or Senate.
Other legislators have not been able to approve their amendments, but it is not without trying.
Goodlatte's amendment is part of the 68 constitutional amendments to be submitted to the Congress, on a wide range of subjects.
Some are recurrent - the same draft law-proposal for the Chamber and Senate - and others are light changes from one previous.
At least 15 versions in the Chamber are considered only from the amendment for a balanced budget and another post that " would monitor federal expenditure " .
Some of these law projects are identical, but they give their support - including the new Republics who want to sleep their CV - the opportunity of being " the author" of such a measure.
The Budget Control Law adopted in August recently requested the vote of the Chamber and the Senate on the amendment of a balanced budget.
In March, 58 seminars have been voted for a non-compliant resolution which supports the idea of such amendments.
In addition to the budget, several members wish to limit the number of mandates during which the Congress members can serve, while José E. Serrano (Democracy - New York) wants to establish the limit of two mandates for Presidents.
Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democracy - Illinois) proposed a multitude of amendments to ensure the right to quality education and health care, among other matters.
An amendment which prohibites marriage between the same persons is perpetually proposed, as well as the amendment prohibiting drape profanation.
Some legislators also wish to authorize the cancellation of federal laws if the two third States are opposed there.
So it appears that members were to offer amendments, they are not so fast as in the past.
At the 111th Congress, the legislators proposed 77 amendments and introduced 66 at 110e.
The fall is rare than the beginning of 1990, when the members generally proposed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to the figures provided by the Library of the Senate.
But these amendments have not been more successful than today.
The last amendment was added - on 27th - was ratified in 1992 but proposed to the Congress in 1789.
"Massacrée but not battle" said Gabrielle Giffords during his first televisioned since the fusillade
The representative of Gabrielle Giffords (Democracy - Arizona) appeared on Monday in a televisioned emission, shouted "The Sun WillCom Out Tomorrow" from Broadway and said to reassemble rather than to return to the Congress.
During his appearance in the "20/20" newspaper on the ABC chain, the side of Diane Sawyer Gabrielle Giffords led to form phrases and needed help to walk.
The emission took its hard return following the ballo that fracturned his crown and lost the left side of the brain, through his head.
Three months ago, she had returned to the Representative Chamber to vote the text on the debt platform.
During his first televised television since January, who killed six persons and wounded threeteen others, Gabrielle Giffords was sore, rid and singing - and qualified his rebuilding of "doffy".
After Diane Sawyer asked her how she felt, Gabrielle Giffords, 41 years old, he answered "Today well."
The interview with Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, Astronaute Mark Kelly, had been held at a special edition of a "20/20" edition, diffused the vision of the outcome of the new book of the couple titled "Gabby: a courage and hope history."
The Special Emission retained Gabrielle Giffords since the 8 January board.
In videos filmed by Mark Kelly in the first weeks, it appears on his hospital bed, the head wrapped and a wide cicator on the front.
It is going to use one or two fingers only, with the encouragement of her husband.
A few months later, Gabrielle Giffords is settled in a rublant penalty while the doctors learn him to carry out simple actions.
A sign of your head.
A lips move.
And finally his first word, "Quoi."
Some days later, Gabrielle Giffords shot another word ("Toast") to ask for change the menu of his little summer.
The videos distributed by ABC show the important role of the music in the reconstruction of Gabrielle Giffords: we are seen the Representative to sing with the doctors of Cyndi Lauper " Girls Wanna Have Fune" and Tom Petty "Free Fallin"?.
During the interview with Diane Sawyer, Gabrielle Giffords, which takes two hours every day with the doctors, he said not to remember the fusillade.
According to his husband, he was currently reading a article on the 12th March when she stopped and asked for the first time information about the six people killed during the incident.
The armed man, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a prison of Missouri and has been treated in waiting for the proceedings.
"There were many dead," said Gabrielle Giffords to Diane Sawyer.
"Shit, stop, stop."
During his reconstruction, she said Mark Kelly to Diane Sawyer, she said, "I was shot."
"Then I'd say, "Gabby, you've not been shot," said Mark Kelly.
You've just been masked.
And you'll get out of here, restore and get more stronger than ever.
More pleasure than respect for troops
The event: a Wall Street galate to collect millions of dollars for veterinaries without fostering the city of New York.
Kid Rock shouted a ballade on immunity, frustration and loss.
A hundreds of soldiers, marines, pilots and marines around him.
The people in coast-cravate was laid down at his feet to accompany it.
"The military, men and women, are considered as heroes," said David Saltzman, organisator of the summer fund collection.
A military highgrade present in the gala, with which Mike Mullen also participated in the friendship of the United States, head-major of the United States, has seen the role of the troops in different ways.
"They were presented as a kind of orphelin," wrote the military highgraded in an electronic mail.
I am sure the organisms had good intentions.
I know.
But it wasn't respect.
The absolutely contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relations installed between the military and a suffered American public but often distant.
Loves are produced to the troops for their sacrifices.
But they have a certain price, they explain some military.
The public makes it more like he was sorry for men and women in uniformity.
"We are not all victims" said the Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who led the troops to Iraq and will soon go to Afghanistan.
"But it seems that the only way to support us is to touch us in the role of malicious spirits."
It is a very sensitive subject for military leaders, which do not wish to be unrecognizable or in vain with the public they serve.
They also realize that the wrath of the returning troops of Vietnam's war was very worse.
The majority of the loyalty talks therefore have been confidential among the Veterians.
After the return of his two sons from the battle with the Marines, the Colonel retired Mark Canzan warned them that the public would consider their service under two perspectives.
Some would look at them with respect because they were compared to insurgents and looked at far-related conflicts.
Others would ask whether " a victory in fury and violence is hidden under the surface " said Canzan, who struck in Iraq and returned to work to the Government in Washington.
When he was looking for employment, he said, he felt that some persons who had moved the intertainment were asking a subtle way if it would be able to hold the press under the stress of an employment required to Washington immediately after his return to the fight.
"When you address the subject of the service, you are compared to negative impressions," remembers the Canzan Colonel when he speaks to his sons.
The difficulties of the military are partly overcoming from the American identity to wars.
The victories are rarely happy by a too little family country with the army and seeing little direct advantages of wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
" As a nation, we do not appreciate the heroism of the same as for the Second World War, " says the General Representative David Barno, which led the troops in Afghanistan.
Instead of this, political and people welcomes focused on the deepest of the suffering of a military.
The troops are recognized for the number of service periods, the number of lost friends or the expansion of wounds.
The army faces the growing pressure against violence
This week, a capital hearing will decide if 28 men and women will go against the army for an action made on violence.
In the case where appropriate, hundreds of plagueds will prepare the next.
The soldier of the 1st class Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and married from 11 weeks in the night where she said she had been violent by a soldier.
It was in October 2008. She would return to her case in Miramar Air Station, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend, when she met a college transporting a drink package.
He asked him if he could join her in his room to drink a white.
"C" was a alarm signal" says Elizabeth Lyman.
But Texane has put his concern on the side.
I thought, no, 19 years old.
"He's Texas," she said.
"I should have followed my intuition."
A few minutes after I was entered in Elizabeth Lyman's room, the man attracted him by the back, throwed down by the earth and violent, pretended.
This week, on 18 November, Elizabeth Lyman and 27 other military, some still in service and other non-related, will with anxiety wait for the decision of justice in an historic process that will be held in Arlington, Virginia, and that will decide if a proceed against the former secretariat in Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld will be done.
These are convicted that they have not stopped the generalization of violence within the army, and thus against the constitutional rights of soldiers.
In February, Susan Burke, a lawyer of Washington, the proceedings involved the start of 17 plagued. The number of the following months was 28 - 25 women and 3 men, all presumed to have been violence or sexually abused by soldiers. They also suggest that the army had not been entailed, pursuant or provided an appropriate justice after the attacks made.
Susan Burke declares it to the galatians military, because the problem begins with them.
"The army is a vertical structure," she said.
"Who are the individuals in position to "effecte the culture of refreshment? The leaders."
The advocate also states that since February month, it was contacted by almost 400 other survivors, most of which could be part of future judicial prosecutors.
Its strategy: Instead to gather all the plagueds in this case - and then put all its eggs in the same painter - it will try several processes, if necessary, to maintain pressure.
The defence team, for the Department of Defence, directed by the American lawyer Neil MacBride, proposed a motion to reject the case.
Judicial documents obtained by Newweek detail the defence strategy, and mainly the fact that the army cannot be pursued by military soldiers or not for the wounds caused in armed forces.
According to a decision of 1950 of the Supreme Court, named Doctrine Feres, the Federal Government is not responsible for wounds undertaken by active staff.
" Bad is inherent to the military military service " reporting documents.
The Department of Defence refused to make any comments.
Things changed since the 50s.
While women have not always officially the right to go to battle, this distinction is only included on paper: recent war lines are rarely male.
In Iraq as in Afghanistan, women's soldiers teams play a more important role, including to enter into contact with local women.
The results: on these two wars, 150 women soldiers lost life - two thirds in war situation.
It's time for the army to modernize Susan Burke.
She is not only to conduct this fight: three other procedures are being undertaken in more than their own.
In Yale's law school, the Veterian legal services centre prepares a case against the four main military academies to encourage themselves to a missionary ambition.
On the other hand, Vietnam Veterans' non-profit foundation is to prepare a process against the army, focusing on " robustes of personality " assigned for victims of violence to grant them - a relatively ordinary fact, according to the activeists such as Annu Bhagwaru of the Women's Action Network (Mobile Women's Action Council), a group for Human Rights.
Its group has tried a process in December to the Vétéran Administration, in the case of discrimination practices in order to treat the claims of benefits for those explaining who had been victims of sexual aggression in the service.
No independent law projects were submitted to the Congress by a bipartisan mixture of Senators and Representatives, proposing various solutions.
In 2010, 3,158 sexual attacks were registered according to the Centre of Prevention and Prevention of sexual aggression (Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office) of the Defence Department.
But it is well known that the number of sexual aggressions is undervalued. Indeed, according to Pentagone's own estimation, this figure represents approximately 13.5% of the 19.000 incidents.
The March report also studied the percentage of judicial prosecutors: in 2010, 20 per cent of the cases registered in the army have been the proceedings of the half of the percentage of the civil judicial system.
The flags of the case of Susan Burke describe their aggression as the first of a traumatism series.
In the case of Lyman, it reports the military police of violence less than one hour after the facts.
That night, she said, it was asked to tell her 11 times in details of his violence to different police, doctors and commanders.
She brought up a "race kit" (relatedly a kit of violence), and the blood of her aggression - had to cut off his arm - was found in his bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Elizabeth Lyman was seated before a judge, in a proceedings on sexual relations with his little friend the day of his aggression.
Six people have testified as a witness of morality for the author of the crime, which has ended to be accepted.
"I remember the day the deputy has been brought," Elizabeth Lyman says.
"I thought I was going to start having contracts.
"I was put in psychiatric unit, and when I was out, I remember to say to my commandant, "It was not his process but my."
Elizabeth Lyman was bound to consult a military psychiatrist, which has ended to diagnose a diagnosis of personality, making it inappropriate to the service.
In January 2010, it was returned under terms less than honorable, preventing it to receive any benefit.
Is Lyman's case and other plagueds going forward or not, it's a long story, says John Turley, teacher of law at the Justice Faculty of Washington University.
However, did it not say, "In my opinion, they should be able to advance."
Only this doctrine criticised since its introduction is between them and a verset.
I've always criticised Feres' doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same benefits and means of dissuasion set by responsibilities.
"The chances are weakly against them... but it's important that they're trying," added he.
These things change only when goods are willing to fight.
If the proceeding does not turn back to their favour, Susan Burke, the lawyer of plagueds, will gather its hundreds of other plagueds for other proceedings.
"We will continue to fight against the army on this issue as long as there is no reform."
Where until we die, one or the other of the two options.
The walls have eyes: researchers studied you on Facebook
Before the new face of the extreme right in Europe, Anders Behring Brevik was a simple guy who was part of his online anti-immigration views.
Lundi, Brevik, who was recognized to have been taken from a murder fold in Norway in July 77 victims, was confronted with his first proceedings.
While Brevik acted alone, he was far from being on the cybere space: it was a large part of the time before the attack on its computer, discussing some of the millions of nationals who support the extreme right groups on social networks.
After the tragedy of this age, researchers want to know more about these people.
But how do you find them?
Awesome... connect to Facebook.
"We have realized that it was not so difficult that it was to find them," said Jamie Bartlett, the main author of a recent report published by the DEMOS reflexion group on the digital people in Europe.
Facebook sets out so many personal information, says Jamie Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the public tool of the site to find people they seek with a scientific specification - how marketers do it for years.
The Jamie Bartlett team found that a half-million members are fans of the extreme right groups in Europe. It assigned them with announcements, but instead of referring to a new group or product, the advertisements invited users to respond to an investigation. Questions posed their level of education, their attitudes against violence and their optimism for their own future.
In contact with these persons through Facebook, Jamie Bartlett and his colleagues were able to ask 100,000 parties from 14 extreme right parties in 11 European countries - without leave the office.
"It's a new way to be searched", says Jamie Bartlett.
Some results are not surprising: the on-line partners of the right groups are rather men, young and immigration.
But it's wonderfully, "Those who operate online activity and outside are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who remain behind their computer screen."
The DEMOS study is only an example of how Facebook has become the new uncontaminable tool between the science hands.
Reflexion groups, medical researchers and politologues use the site to study all issues affecting health issues such as social tendencies, thanks to "I love", documents on walls and updates.
With more than 800 million active users that add three contents on average day, the "supernovation of data" generates a research explosion, increased the number of research work that the site's name appears in the title of almost 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, Facebook's advantage remains in the fact that it allows you to study people you can not approach the street.
"Forward, when you tried to investigate the people of the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
"You should go to the party, but they never have allowed you to enter", says Jamie Bartlett.
"Facebook prevents all this - you have directly access to their information."
Others say that the site could provide a way to identify and address health and social problems.
According to a recent study of the D. Megan Moreno of the Wisconsin-Madason University, and its colleagues, young students who talked on Facebook of their work in the embryodity had much more opportunities to be alcoholic than discreet students on this matter.
Megan Moreno suggests that student colleagues, such as the advisers, could monitor the site and intervention to assist a student whose status was too often talking about alcohol.
"You can't address a problem if you don't diagnose the diagnosis," Dimitri Christakis, co-auteur of Megan Moreno and Director of the health centre, behaviour and development of children at the research Institute for children located in Seattle, states Washington Post.
"We know how to identify children with risk and who would not be recognized in another case."
Facebook always accesss the information of its users.
The site team that takes care of data has studied statistics concerning the loved situation and the day of the Holy Valentin, the participation rates in the mid-party elections of 2010 and a national happiness index (by information available only – digital freedom campaigns have been supported for long time that the site could have available its data carrier to other people with research purposes).
But Facebook users know that the site observes them, that it will or not - in exchange to play at Scrabble with a friend that is located at thousands of kilometers, the site is allowed to access your information.
But what happens when Facebook users are part of an investigation that they didn't even speak?
While researchers have well-defined designs on how to collect information otherwise than through the Internet, it is anything else online.
"I don't believe that a large number of users had already thought that a researcher could study their profile," says Neil Selwyn, sociologue in the Connaissance Laboratory of London, under a study of 2006, which he conducted by watching the walls of his students.
"When they know, the exchange were seen only by their friends."
Then comes the question of methodology.
Even without transition through the Internet, there is no guarantee that the subject of a study is completely honicious.
On Facebook, it is impossible to know the truth rate of a profile or the user wall.
"What you say about Facebook and what you do in reality are two whole different things," said Neil Selwyn.
This is why, despite his experience as technological researcher, Neil Selwyn thinks that a block notes and a stalo remain the best tools that you can use.
"No one can replace the real world and contact with people," says he.
"Society studies are deemed to deal with social aspects - and social aspects, not before a computer."
"Froid and inhuman" : first comparison of Anders Behring Brelivik
Anders Behring Brevik, the man who agreed to have organized the two attents that have made 77 dead in Norway this age, was described as a fighting "of resistance" during his first appearance to the process which is deployed in Oslo.
"I am a military commander of the Norwegian resistance movement and the Norway Temples," explains it before a 500-person hearing room.
"In terms of the competence of the court, I regret it, because you hold your mandate of organizations supporting hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism."
"I recognize the facts, but I don't have a fault."
Torkjel Nesheim has stopped Brevik during this monologe because he didn't want to let him the opportunity to use this process to express his opinions."
For the same reason, he refused to leave Brevik, who brought with him a talk on paper, speaking to the parents of victims at the end of hearing.
The Judge Nesheim also requested the police to keep Brevik for 12 more weeks, and he prohibited him to speak to the media for four weeks and warned him that the authorities would be watching very closely all visits and matchings for eight weeks.
A thirty-seven of survivors and victims were present at the audience.
Some have come in the hope of watching Brevik in the eyes, others to be sure he would be placed behind the bars.
All participated in audience in the purpose of seeing the end of the process.
"I found him cold and inhuman," said a survivor of Utoya at the Norwegian NRK television chain.
"I wasn't on the scene, but I personally have made a little progress after I saw and heard the suspect."
With a dark coast and a blue cravate, Brevik was stayed quiet and professional during all the process. He looked to the journalists and survivors in the eyes in the entrance and out of the court.
Despite the strange idea that Brevik was a wide movement of "resistance", the judge decided that it was not a fool. He also stated that there was no evidence that he had acted with complaints.
The attents of 22 July seem to be the work of a extremist rather than a whole group of radics, which may be strengthened by some.
But this does not reduce happiness or confusion being made by the whole nation.
"I would prefer him like a monster, but that's not the case," said a father of a victim.
"This would have been much easier."
7 lessons from the lost interview of Steve Jobs, this week
After the death of Steve Jobs on 5 October, some compared it with Henry Ford - different from the technical and inventor of modern information.
But what the Apple fans can find more revealed in a recently revealed maintenance of Steve Jobs and which will be distributed this week in first part of a film on the main markets, is how this creative spirit had included the processes and flows of products.
He was uncertainly a creator and a dream. He identified a hypersensitive but was very meticulous and organized, as well as a improver of organigramms - a man who believed that many undertaking leaders suffered from a "malady laying them to think that a gentle idea makes 90% of the work... [Mais] a significant amount of manual work to separate a great idea of a product of exception."
In 1995, Bob Cringely developed the televisional series "Trioph of the Nerds". This series relaxed the birth of the computer, and stayed for more than one hour with Steve Jobs for a long and rare conversation.
At that time, it was about 10 years old that Steve Jobs had to leave Apple. It was already hard to work on his new NeXT informatic company, with a popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small part of the maintenance with Cringely is used in Nerds, he states that the main copys have disappeared in the transport.
It's just after the death of Steve Jobs that a complete video is found in the garage of the realistor.
This video, lightly remonted, is the base of the 68 minutes film titled Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which will be distributed to the Friday cinem and next Thursday.
For someone who knows to deteriore the comprehensive interactions, Steve Jobs seems quite excited to exhibit technological philosophys and its commercial strategies.
And incrediblely attentive.
In four different points during the survey, responses come a long time after the questions - between 10 and 15 seconds of reflection, while Steve Jobs clearly appreciates his thoughts, in the purpose of bringing a precise answer.
It is also discovered moments where the perfectionism of Steve Jobs rises, in which it seems utmost to listen to Cringely's questions, giving him cuts to make it acceleration and transition to more important questions or issues.
Filmed before Pixar, iPod or iPhone, there is a pretty precise aspect on Lost Interview. Steve Jobs assess what he thinks of good or bad in the other companies and is part of his own vision on the future of the information.
It's a thing to read the posthumy reviews of Steve Jobs' card, but there's something bad and inspiring on the man we see here, the anxious dreamer at the sight of the size.
He has a vision on how things can be and must be.
He explains them then to be implemented.
This is a fast recaption of seven remarkable sequences of Lost Interview:
On the way he learned to manage a company:
"In all these years, I always asked, 'Why do you do things?' and the answers always are the same: 'Oh, just because they need to do'."
No one knows why, no one thinks deeply about things in a business.
That's what I found.
Steve Jobs continues by detailing its efforts to simplify the accountability in Apple.
Perplex as the costs were registered - often start by a "standard cost" evaluated for nest, then corrected with a "variation" - it developed a automatised use which guarantees the specific calculation of commercial costs.
On the possibility of playing a tour to Pape:
Steve Jobs tells the anecdote of the "Blue Blue" which he created with Steve Wozniak - a device that served to pirate the telephone networks and freely phone.
The device has made a lot of prealable writings, but the euphory of Steve Jobs here in his description of the Blue Boîte as a proper act is contagious.
It describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, then connecting to a AT-T network with others as much as possible as satellites.
"We're enveloping the bottle of different things a half-duuzine once and you're moving in the public phone and it came a minute later to the public phone on the side," says Jobs.
"We were young and thanks to this Blue Blue, we learned that we could create something that we could control billions of infrastructure in the whole world."
We're not aware of a great thing both, but we've been able to find a little thing that can control great things. It was an incredible lesson, and I don't think that Apple would be a day without this.
Steve Jobs continued to tell a wonderful tour that he and Wozniak had put on: he phoned to Vatican with the Blue in the middle of the night by going through to Henry Kissinger and asked to speak to Daddy.
While several members of the Catholic herory are invited in the middle of the night to speak to the American diplomat, the two complainants are just dreaming before the Pope himself is rising up.
On his love with technology (and starting by Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, when the exchange of the rooms detained to manufacture a frequencymeter, he searches for Bill Hewlett's number in the year and passes for him.
Once after their 20 minutes conversation, Steve Jobs gets a partial age age job at Hewlett-Packard.
"There had a remarkable influence on me. It was the only company I had seen in that age and this made my definition of a business and how the employees were treated."
Steve Jobs has become one of the HP employees to visit the company's research laboratory situated in Palo Alto, where he discovered the first desktop computer.
He was as large as a valley, having a small cathodic tube, and I fell in love.
The adolescent that I was back to HP and began to write programs for this machine.
On innovation improvisation:
In several moments in the interview, Steve Jobs speaks to introduce new products on a head-law.
At the beginning of his card, while it is installed to sell a few printed round cards, a client asked him to gather a complete computer.
Working only 30 days of credit, it was necessary to take care of the comparison and delivery of the devices completely.
Later, at Apple, it remembers the difficulties that have occurred to develop a computer mouse:
"I remember great disputes... I've been crying up and guess he would need me five years [for making a museum that would cost $300]. I had enough, I went out and came to see a conceptor."
Fourty-seven days later, we had a mouse that we could produce for $15 and that would be incrediblely reliable.
On the large enterprises that are off:
Before he was able to reviv Apple, Steve Jobs had anticipated the way many industrial leaders would argue and lose the control of their market.
"Accounts that you worked at IBM or Xerox, do you make a better copyer or a better printer, and then?"
You have the market monopol, so the company does not meet any success.
The sales and marketing can be evolved, so [these types of persons] who end through the management of enterprises and produced staff are declined from decision-making.
The producted genius who has led to this monopol position is completely disappeared by people who cannot imagine to conceal a good product compared to a bad product - the manual work required.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have kept all the computer industry.
She could do ten times his current size. Xerox would have been the Microsoft of the 1990s...
They've disappeared the disappearance to the victory.
On innovation as artistic form:
"A huge manual working part divides a gentle idea of an exceptional product... so that you develop this idea, it changes and grows."
You learn exactly about its substantive.
There's a compromise to do... Some things you can't do, electrons can, see, robots, also uses.
You must keep thousands of things in the mind (thes concepts) by appearing to each other.
Finally, the decisions are taken by personal goal. It is to try to expose you to the best products that men created, and to try to bring these things to the product you are created.
Picasso said one day the good artists copy and fly the big artists.
We're always angry to fly out of excellent ideas.
It is part of what rendes Macintosh exceptional. The people who worked above were musicians, poeses, zoologists, stories, who were just shown the best scientific science in the world.
If this is not the information science, they would have done extraordinary things in another area.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with adversaries of the right of health while the court meets
The day where the Supreme Court is closed to consider the question of political discussion, namely whether the opposition to the Law of President Obama of Health will be heard, two of its judges, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were noted during a dinner occurred by the law of law of the Obama, which will defend the case before the high currency.
The event was Thursday last, when the nine judges were gathered for a conference to discuss pensions for consideration.
One of the cases concerned was a process attempted by 26 States that addressed the reform of ambitious health care, voted by the Congress last year, a law which was a complaint point for conservators at the national level.
The judges agreed to hear the complaint, in fact, a monumental argument of 5:30 is expected in March next, and the result is likely to promote the detabilisation of the presidential course in 2012, which will be fully exposed when the decision of the Court will be made.
The lawyer who will stand before the court and argue on the rejection of the law will obviously be Paul Clement, who served as a complaint general of the United States during the administration of George W. Bush.
The PLLC Bankcroft legal cabinet has been part of the two tens of cabinets who have helped the annual dinner of the Federist Society (Federalist Society), a long dated group to defend the conservator legal principles.
Another dinner who appeared, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that have undertaken the law, the National Federation of Independent Business (National Federation of Independent Business).
Another promoter was the Pfizer Inc farmer geant, which presents a huge financial jewel in the leather result.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel a few hours after the court conference on the case.
There was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the top Republic of the Senate and the adversary declared the health law.
The guests see at dinner, Scalia and Thomas.
This is not new: the two judges were presented to the events of the Federal Society for years.
And there's nothing that goes against decentology rules.
In fact, judges are exempt from the conduct code which regulates the acts of federal judges.
If they were it, they would certainly argue by the Canon 4C code, which stipulates: "A judge may assist the funds of organizations related to the law and otherwise that the judge could not be a party, an invitation of honor, or a program of such event."
Nevertheless, the simple presence of Scalia and Thomas nearby two of the lawyers' officers, as well as a business with a massive financial interest, was sufficient to warn theactivists of the government ethic.
"The Catholic of Ethiopia and Super-inflation against the Code contrarys the statements of several judges which the Court comply with the same rules applicable to all other federal judges," said Bob Edgar, President of Common Cause.
"The judges were drinking and dinner and a collection of gala funds with lawyers who had cases in particular before the court."
Their presence and participation in the fund collection of this event demonstrates any claim of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little regard to the criticisms that they are too easily threatening the course business with the agenda of groups such as the Federal Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a high-profile warranty.
Furthermore, the conservators claim that it is the judge Elena Kagan who has a problem of ethical and not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was a general applicant of the Administration of Obama when the first oppositions to the law were provided at the level of the Court of First Instance.
His criticians have made pressure to make Kagan reproof to hear the case, saying that it was too invested in the defence of law to be impartial.
Kagan didn't show it.
Boeing registers an record order of $18 billion for line aircraft
The Emirates Air Society commands 50 Boeing 777, bi-couloir line airports, with the possibility of buy it 20 more.
Boeing also sold six Boeing Dreamliners in Oman Air, a market of more than a billion dollars.
There is nothing extraordinary that a company receives a command over 50 of its products.
It is all a case when the company concerned is the Boeing Aircraft and the amount of these 50 airports reached the amount of $18 billion.
Even unbelievable is that Boeing has received this command: the Middle East, a mine of gold growing in future air commands.
In Monday's previsions, Chicago's company believes that the South East air companies will need in the next 20 years of $2,520 to a total value of $450 billion.
During the weekend, Boeing informed the best trade aircraft command of his history - 50 Boeing 777 bi-couloirs.
This is the Emirates Air Society based on Dubai who has passed this Pharaonic command.
Boeing announced to Dubai Airline in 2011 that the airline was also able to buy 20 aircrafts, which would increase the total amount of $26 billion.
On the other hand, Boeing stated on Monday that the Oman Air company commanded six Boeing 787-8, named Dreamliners, a model that flows from important fuel and goods for passengers.
The amount of these six devices is up to more than one billion dollars.
"It's clearly positive for Boeing," said Neal Dihora, Morningstar analysis.
"These customers in particular have a great value."
In the Middle East, the land producers of petroleum countries have many of their air companies.
They therefore have not only the means of paying these aircraft but a currency of the fuel price - usually prejudice for airlines, because it represents their most important costs - would not be so damageable because the country would gain money with the currency of the petrol price.
This is an important point because these companies will be less possible than others to can can cancel or disseminate their flight orders when the feed price increased, Dihora reported.
"They have a cover of natural risk," said he.
The Emirates Command strengthen Boeing's predominance on the large-porting airport market and helps leaving the aircraft's improving attempt with its A350 airport.
Boeing's victory in the airport salon comes four months after the advertisement of Airbus to report the beginning of the largest A350 version, which revalues directly with the Boeing 777-300ER.
Airbus resumes its starts to increase the powder according to the request of its customers to increase its charge and autonomy capacity.
Boeing company ' s action has increased 1.5 per cent to reach $67.94.
The sister of the Mexicon President manifestly fights the Michoakan elections
Luisa Maria Calderon states that drug traffickers helped his adversary Fausto Vallejo of the PRI at the course of the Governing Office.
The sister of President Felipe Calderon seems to have lost its attempt of access to the Michaakan Governor functions during violence elections, and she said Monday that drug trafficking had favoured one of its adversaries.
The first results indicated that Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party or PRI was headed by the Guideline of the Western State.
"The crime intervention organized during all the vote process and in particular yesterday is an alarming fact, not only for the Michacan, but for the whole country," reported Luisa Maria Calderon in the radio during an interview on Monday following the elections.
"They have missed our candidates, our electoral agents... have taken urines, have installed road barriers... and have bound people to vote" for the PRI.
The PR governed Mexico for sixty-and-year-old years to lose the Presidency in 2000.
But he organizes his return, and a victory in Michaan is an important step in that efforts.
The PRI hopes to win the "Presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to be understood only by little Calderon, who was heading of the dreams before the day of the elections.
Calderon, the Conservant Party of his brother, the National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as a winner.
Silvan Aureoles, the left candidate of the Democratic Revolution Party or PRD, who is currently occupied by the governance functions, has arrived thirdly, a penal debt before the Presidents of 2012 for this divised and painful left.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the first results.
Vallejo, old master of Morelia, the capital of the "State Capital", has made any link with drug traffickers and has strongly advised other candidates to accept the results.
Michoakán has long been homed by the cards of drugs specialized in marihuana, heroin and metthamphétamine.
This is the "State of origin by President Calderon, and he elected the Michoakan to launch a military offense against trafficking in December 2006.
However, violence has remained.
A week before the elections of the PAN was killed while he made a campaign for Luisa Maria Calderon, and many candidates refused locally to the campaign.
However, for the PRI, as corrupt as Michaan's elections had the air, a victory will help the party in its election.
The man who is expected to represent the PRI in the course to the Presidents, Enrique Pena Nieto, welcomed Vallejo since Washington and said, "I think this victory is very encouraged for the next year."
BASD strongly urges Asia to assist the euro area
The Asian Development Bank requested India and China to help the euro area to avoid long-term decline that would prevent the development of Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, BASD-based in Manille, said that the two economic powers for the fastest growth of the world should "effectuate everything in their power" to accelerate the recovery of the monetary zone by the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He decided to see the difficulties of Europe of an "inflammable eye" and reported that Asian financial support for the leaders and resources of Europe would prevent long terms of the global economy.
"We're all together in this crisis."
"Therefore whoever can help Europe to get out of the crisis is useful," said the financial Times during an interview during the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
"Asia can be protected until" to a certain point but it is not at the opening. "
"Donc if China and India can help, nothing prevent them."
In the past months, the euro area was seriously expanded by a crisis of sovereign debt.
Received that the cost of the Italian Emperor is dangerously mounted in Arrows and the First Ministers of Italy and Greece have been released.
The flexibility crisis of sovereign debt in Europe has made unfortunate the fear that the global economy would not be recessioned, and has resulted in the calls for the main economics to meet for helping the euro area to find a solution.
Mr. Nag suggested that the CFF would purchase any Asian assistance, but also stated that this bilateral assistance - as to buy the obligations of the United States financial saving fund, the European Financial Stability Fund would offer a greater power to negotiate the Asian partners of Europe.
Anand Sharma, India Minister of Commerce and Industry, indicated that "Inde will do everything that it can" to help the euro area, since its own economy now suffers a decline of exports and a decline of foreign capitals.
"Persone doesn't want the euro area to remain instable and abused," said he.
"We have monumental challenges to resume and we need to maintain a high growth level."
"What's not a choice, it's an impérative, because where would we find work for the ten million of our young men and women?"
Others support that developing economies such as India should not help European riches while they face their own economic challenges.
Ashutosh Varshney, professor at the University of Brown in the United States, said that it would be very difficult to accept Europe's aid at 1,2 billion Indians, which at least 800 000 live with two dollars per day, see less.
"On day, they will discover that the Greeks are taking their pension to 50 years and that they will go to the sun and will have a bad warming," he reported.
Lee Howell, President of the World Economic Forum, also asked why the Indian reserves should be used to maintain many Greek officials who are well payed in bad employment that generate losses, such as in the ferroviary sector.
Mr. Nag said that the euro area's crisis would cause significant repercussions through Asia.
The BASD's previsions of a economic growth of 7.5% in Asia in 2011/2012 are now confronting the "permission risks" because of the European threat.
He reported that weakly vulnerable markets needed to develop "said plans" to protect economic return and important capital flights.
Safety warnings of the Pentecoon on potential defence reductions
The Secretary for Defence, Leon Panetta, highlighted the pressure on the Monday Congress, warning that the immense budget compressions would be able to know national security, and cleared a financial reaction in the Pentecostain neighbourings to Afghanistan's battle camps, through civil collections.
The Pentagone has already provided $450 billion for the next decade, but now it is afraid that an additional $600 or more complaints would be impressed if the Congress does not appear to an expenditure agreement.
"The impacts of these reductions would be devasive for the Ministry," said Panetta in a letter to Senators John McCain, R-Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina.
He stated that the Congress outcome to achieve a budget agreement resulting in the calls for sequence, would lead to 23% reduction, and the wage of many new projects.
"An important reduction as well, applied as without discretion, would make most of our ships and our in executable construction projects - you can't buy three quarters from a ship or a building - and bring seriously harmfully at the other modernization efforts," wrote Panetta to Senators.
"We would also be contrary to separate a number of our civil personnel and, because the reduction would be imposed as quickly, we should almost certainly send civilians without payment to achieve the goal."
"This change would cause the faith of those who are supporting our military and will seriously harm our preparation."
The reductions would likely touch the fighting troops, continue Panetta.
"Although the financing of the accounts of the foreign contracting operations is not directly affected by the sequence, the war efforts would be negatively affected by serious perturbations in the basic budgets," said Panetta.
"The contracting staff would be reduced, bringing back in contracts and supervision of contracts supporting the war."
"The wages staff would be reduced, entering payment reimbursement to war providers, and legal and political support would be perturbed."
The two Senators had written to Panetta 10 days early, asking details on the potential of automatic compressions on the Ministry of Defence.
"The consequence of a sequence on the Defence Department would deploy a rapid decline of the United States as a global leader of military force."
"We are severely opposed to this draconic action," the Senators said in a common communication Monday after midnight during the publication of the letter of Panetta.
"It's not a consequence with which we can live, and it's certainly not that we should impose."
"Successation is a threat to national security interests in the United States, and it should not have to be done."
The letter of Panetta and the recent warnings of Senators increase the pressure for a budget compromise or an appeal to exclude the Pentecost of Reductions remains.
Panetta was more violent about the possible compressions, even though it has been itself at the highest post of the Pentagone's feast years of expertise of the budget to the Congress and the White House and knowing that he was compared to difficult choices.
At a press conference last week, the secretariat at Defence has put a shadow table of what could happen - a military with a cockle, but not a nou.
"It's a ship without marine."
"It's a brigade without balloes."
"It's a flight, without enough pilots."
"It's a carrier in paper, a boxer army, buildings and bombs that have not enough formed soldiers to fulfil the mission," said Panetta in his preliminary comments at Pentecost.
"It's a depressed, badly prepared and unable to face potential adversaries."
"Actually, she invites the aggression."
In an addendum to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta has specifically stated how new reductions could "generate important risks: response time to crisis, conflicts and disasters; serious limits to our ability to develop us and join us into the world; and the risk is unacceptable in future combating operations".
And Panetta said that some of the largest defence projects could pass through to the cutter, including those already tested and some just at the first stages of planning.
This list included the Fighter F35 Joint Strike, a new planned bomber, the new Ballistic submarine of the new generation, the new litoral battle ship and the new ground vehicle, which would replace the Army and Sea Humb.
With a term to development and testing, F35 could generate $80 billion for 10 years, but its partners say that it is an essential stage of improvement and response to potential threats from China and other river.
How to repair a lie
A view on the recent lacks shows what fault and lies are perfect in daily life.
The Republical candidate to the President Herman Cain is occupied to exchange sexual allegations with several women; each side accusing the other to lie.
Penn State Administrators were accused of parish to cover reports in accordance with a football trainer who has been aggressively attacked by boys.
Last week, the French President Nicolas Sarkozy was taken by a open microphone claimant to the American President Barack Obama that the First Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
The lies destroyed cards and convulsed from countries.
The member of the New York Congress and compliance of the Internet Anthony Weiner, has passed for an idiot and has rapidly issued delays against inevitable evidence.
The former candidate to President John Edwards was accused of violations of the financing of campaigns related to the cover of an extra-conjugal link.
And then, no one who has lived the story will never forget the Medical Circle that President Bill Clinton has declined by holding his second mandate on his sexual implication with Monica Lewinsky.
The tricence records for school tests and university are legend.
There were cases where teachers gave the tests to students to take care of their performance assessments.
Mentors who should teach the contrary send the message that lies and triggers are acceptable.
How many trumpets can we meet?
On a given day, studies show that you can hear from 10 to 200 months.
In fact, many of these are painful lies.
Another study showed that foreigners had three times in the first 10 minutes of their meeting.
Detecting or receiving lies is an essential skill that each has to acquire, at the time, for personal and professional reasons.
It is not to be a society game like that, say, characters, where the goal is to write to it: "I had you", the detection of the trumpet is a serious range of knowledge based on scientific data collected during the six decades in prestigious universities who conducted a deep research in such projects, including psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the elderly myths have been demised.
The mentors look at you in the eyes.
They don't march, they're angry, or they're not always doing.
Don't conclude that mentors are difficult to detect and difficult to dismant.
A qualified mental detector can discover the truth by examining the structure of the declaration, facial micro expressions, the training of the question and the time of response.
I have been able to consider scientific results in the wide body and always stressed the knowledge of the drugs, and it is clear that the detection of the library is a modern skill that is easy to learn and useful to navigate in our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include in particular improving, interviews, negotiations or management.
Good mentors are courageous to read the others by putting them down by manageing their own emotions and intuitively discovering how the others will survive them.
We know that extravereigns lie more than investors, that men say more falsely "centred on them" while women say more lies "centered on others" - usually to protect the feelings of someone - that married people are often lie to their partners than non-married persons (although the lies they have tend to be extreme).
We also know that if you're injured as a mechanic, others will feel less guilty to lie to you.
How can you say if someone lies?
First of all, watch the normal behaviour of your subject.
That's what you call "edit the rear data".
This helps to provide a reference point to measure the future changes.
Watch the posture of your subject, the laughter, the vocale quality.
You need to know if someone normally pays his feet in order to not start injust accuses when you see the feet in the middle of the meeting.
Then searching for false words and non-wording indicators.
Consider these indexes such as red drapeals, not evidence of the trumpet.
The false people can immoviate the top of the body when they tried to remember their story, they can point their feet towards the door, turn to a exit, change in significant way or present a respiration of "post-interview" - an exhibitioned suspicion, a posture change when all difficult questions have been passed.
Questioners often show falsely that the maintenance is completed just to find out post-interview reaction.
Therefore, note the vocabulary of your subject.
The famous Scott Peterson was deployed using the past as his murdered wife was alive, deploying a national research to find it.
The false individuals may also use a distanced language: "I haven't had sexual relations with this woman... Mrs. Lewinsky" or repeat a whole difficult question.
The most common verbal indicators are underlined.
Someone can use a lot of wood bowl in his response to a difficult question: "Well... to say true... if I remember goods... to my knowledge."
This makes the perceptional response rather than factuelle and is often a red dragon.
There is no magic formula for the detection of lies, but the development of the skills to recognize falsely is possible.
These skills will improve the possibility of any person to avoid victimization in their professional and personal life.
The controversial oléoduc plan will be deleted after the late approval threat of the United States
A few days after the administration of Obama has encouraged the approval of a project of oléoduc between Canada and the Mexico Golf, which highlighted the wrath of syndicates through the environment - the company seeking to build the oléoduc said that it is ready to return the project to the rail.
TransCanada said Monday night she will move the pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive area of the dunes of Nebraska, and it is reliable that the project will also win its approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference to the Capital of the Nebraska.
The Officer of TransCanada, Alex Perbax, claims that the company remains confidence that it will end with the approval of an oleoduc but with a different itinary.
This is followed by the Department of State in the past week that he would delay its decision to obtain a federal authorisation for the project until he receives new potential engineering studies to avoid the dunes of Nebraska and the Ogallala Aquifer, large water sources.
"It's a real path towards the front," says Lee Terry, a Republic of Nebraska in Fox News.
The new survey of the environment commanded by the Department of State would probably resume any decision until 2013, after the elections of the next year, although the officers had the impact of the policy in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the decision of the Department of State, and expressed its support.
The oleoduc of 2.735 km would extend from Canada to the Mexico Golf.
It would be 700,000 bars daily since the province of Alberta to the Texas raffineries.
To do this, he's got to go through six States.
It is hated by ecologists, but loved work groups, which have been paid over 20,000 employees related to oleoduc.
But Nebraska's lawyers opposed to this plan are pressing that a law for the force of the distance from the sand Hills and the Ogallala Aquifer, a major source of potable water and irrigation.
The survey of environmental impact during the Department of State has found that the project would have only limited negative environmental impacts, but the energy industry stated that the Department's inspector has designed a different investigation of the examination process, focused on two questions.
One is that a lobbyist undertaken by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was a country adviser of Hillary Clinton in 2008, would represent an interest conflict in the programme.
The other is to know whether a company who has been engaged to conduct the initial study was an inadequate choice of its relationship in TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle continued to prevent a young child to go out of fear
A family of New York states that Disco Patti LaBelle was launched in a divaincuation of violence in the room of their immatures of Manhattan, and feared her little girls at the point where she was scared.
"Lady Marmalade" stinked the small Genevieve Monk age of 18 months, at the point she raised "the changes of personality, sleep troubles" and "the fearful growth of foreigners", said her family during the Supreme Court of Manhattan.
It was the 10 November of the last year when the scene technicians Kevin Monk, his teaching marriage of children, Roseanna and Geneva were prepared to travel to family.
While Kevin Monk was going to find the car, Roseanna Monk went down in the room of their bullard's bottles Riverside with their bags, bringing Genevieve into his arms.
Roseanna Monk said she was arrested by the door and put her daughter for a moment.
"What happened behind me?" she said to me, "Do you know what your daughter does?" I said, "Yes" and I went looking for her," she said.
The Beelle has demonstrated the pregnant woman with anger.
" She said to me about your aggressive, 'You don't have to leave your daughter next to the door'," said Roseanna Monk.
"I said to her, 'What you say or think I'm not interested.'
She became embraced and started using jury - the word "" and the word "" of a strong voice...
She had a water bottle and began to sprink me out of the water of the bottle.
She said that Geneva has become hysthetics at this point.
'I said to that woman,' look at what you have done to my daughter,' said the mother of the child.
LaBelle threw her mom - who always had Geneva in his arms - and had to be kept by his surrounding that entered her into a car waiting for them, said Roseanna Monk.
The little girl wept so strong that she was put to shot, added.
Furthermore, the family sent a note requesting excuses for LaBelle, but has received no answer.
The lawyer and representatives of LaBelle have not returned our calls to comment.
The complainant claims not specificed damage, but the lawyer of the family, Sam Davis, said that he had taken the case free and that the family was intended to give a donation of all money to a charity work against children.
"The purpose is to hold Patti LaBelle responsible for his behaviour," said Mr. Davis.
"This kind of behaviour is totally unacceptable, especially towards a maternal teacher who has a 18-month child."
Climateversity freed the economy
During the first year of management of Mario López Valdez, the unemployment and information has increased, foreign investment was lowered and the economy was contracted.
2011 is a year of recall in the Economic History of Sinaloa, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, auto-related to the change, which has generated large expectations for the progress of the economy, but given the climateversity of the beginning of the year, has not been observed, in exchange of the deterioration of the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures of February, with a result of the loss of billions for the agricultural sector, limited the possibilities of the State's growth economy, caused the contraction of economic activity in general by 3,6 per cent in the first half of the year, justified mostly by the history of 31.16 per cent in the agricultural economy, which affected the dynamism of other economic sectors.
According to the Mexican Development Council ' s report, 582 million 835 hectares had been damaged, including 78.03 per cent of the total damage and the remaining of 21.07 per cent, the main synthesis cultures have been the legemes, the mass and the hazardous weight.
The decrease of economic activity, until November, has been observed a constant increase in the unemployment in the State, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geographic, with a 453 percent of the active economic population, the rate has increased 5,28 per cent and July to September 6,19 per cent, a rate that represents more than 74 thousand chlosors, in the first quarter of 18.969 people.
Liquidness levels
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactoral, according to the economicist Gerarddo López Cervantes, Director of the Economic and Social Science Faculty of UAS, the growth of unemployment may be expressed indirectly in response to public actions.
"What the unemployment has been observed is an increase in the unemployment of different factors, including the loss of liquidity on the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation approved in the Congress to combat money whiteness, because for people who gain the dollars in a illegal manner is not easy to work for them to gain, invest and use them in something," said he.
Detained migration
Lopez Cervantes reported that the growth of unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people who have left the State to go to work to the foreign, the United States has been limited, firstly because of the difficulties of entry and secondly because they have already many difficulties to find work, these people remain here and ask job sources, which makes the highest unemployment," said he.
Serious lacks
The analysis of the synthesis labour market has occurred in view of the high level of serious lack of work that predomins between the conditions of work, according to IECI, 60.38 per cent of the population occupied in this state, without coasting as worker in no social insurance institutions.
On the basis of unemployment and serious lack of unemployment, another reason for the status is the lower wages, the entity has lower rewards from the Netherlands, according to the registers of the Mexico Institute of Social Assurances and the Secretariat of Labour and Social Prevision.
The average monthly income of synthesis workers was up to September 5,000 352 weights, very lower than the average national, situated at 7 000 375 weights.
IED Contraction
On the decrease of economic activity and unemployment in 2011, 630,000 697 dollars have been recorded the highest reduction of the Straight Investment in the last 10 years, according to the Economic Secretariat from January to June, the IED of the State has reached $5,87,74 per cent, with regard to $5 million,143,000,312 in the same period of the previous year.
At its turn, the Secretariat of Economic Development of the Government of the State contains a total investment of 17.280 billion weights per year, mainly registered by the companies of the third sector.
The debt
In view of the economic countermeasures scenario, the Government of the State in July requested the public adoption of a credit of 3 billion weights for investment in 18 municipalities, with the aim of reactiving the economy, the approval of the State congress was of 2,600 billion weights and until November has not observed any benefit of the income in any sector of the economy of the State.
Reactions
For representatives of the patronal sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés demonstrates a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, President of the National Transformation Industry Chamber, said that in 2011 there was no harmonisation of the wills of the various sectors, including the Government of the State.
"The performance of Sinaloa's economy has been really very poor in this year, we need to work intensely to recover the field we have lost this year, in 2012, we have to doubt our efforts, it has to be able to enhance all and especially the good walk already synchronized by this new Government team, we hope that the next year is much better," said he.
Economic reader
Loredo López said that events such as the burdens of the beginning of the year have retained the State's economy and have limited its performance and growth.
"The lower economic flow is produced by several events, including the geleds, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that is not quite fast to generate a economic dynamism that allows us to have an acceptable level in the processes, products and services, and therefore at the end of the year, we will close much under the expectations that we had," said he.
Redefine vocation
For Theodoro Salazar Uriarte, President of the Patronal Confederation of the Republic of Sinalia said that the State was wished to cancel more productive activities than dynamism.
"In general terms we have noted that we have been working, we believe it is necessary to develop a long-term programme that redefines the vocational and economic direction of the State, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resources in Sinaloa has been described," he said.
Good to do
The President of the Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a future vision that can improve the efforts of the Government.
"In general, I would like to say that the Government has made efforts to give good results in different areas, in the fields of economic development there are some progress, but it is important to develop a long-term programme," said he.
He reported that the current administration has shown progress in the manager of public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the Government is more inclusive, which I can say is that much work and the Government is aware of the fact that there is still much to do," said he.
Condemned for 8 kilometres of marihuana
A person in Novolato was condemned to five years of prison and 100 days of ambassador for eight kilometres of marihuana.
The General Parque of the Republic informed that the small condemned trafficking is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for crime against health, in its variant of marihuana ownership for sale.
In accordance with the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by officials of the Mexico Army on 7 June 2010 during the monitoring operation on the Cipriano Valdez Street, before the 80th to El Castillo, Navolato.
The small trafic moved into a type pick-up, white-floor card, in which he moved a black shot into the vehicle door and on the place of the cockpit a small bag where the military found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marihuana.
For this reason, the elements confiscated have been made available by the Second District Judge and the convicted are still found in the Centre of Execution of Legal Consequences of the Decrees.
Debts for employees
The work of social character contained in programs such as Hábitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants risks not to be completed where to store serious delays because of the lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda reported.
The Guideline of Civil Development has stated that even though the construction programmes have progressed, they are in a risk situation, since the Government of the State did not meet its obligations to provide contributions over the 11 million weights in the three programmes.
It noted that the investment of these three programmes is approximately 50 million weights of which the State must provide 25 per cent and only the Federation and the Municipe have provided resources for workers, so there is a possibility of relaxing in their finalization.
"They must provide a contribution of 12 million, and despite the fact that the year's time they will end, they did not give us nothing, even if since July they had to give us a party," he said, "and we, to not write backs, we started the work and we have many advanced, but we need money."
He pointed out that in the past year, during the administration of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the State had not paid the corresponding contributions, so at the beginning of the administration, the Municipe had to ask a credit to cover the 7 million that the administration of the State had not provided to this occasion.
"We had already undertaken this in the previous sex years because the State had no economic capacity to participate and the programs continue to function and that year, to have access to these programs, we have made the resources to cover what the State had not paid," said he.
Despite the fact that there was an commitment to the State ' s authorities to provide these resources, he stated that they had requested the Administration and Finance Secretary, Armando Villarreal, to enable the management to ensure that the corresponding percentages were as soon as possible.
"They must provide nearly 12 million, and despite the fact that the year will end, they didn't give us anything."
The Court is valid "the analogic punishment" in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of similar signals by digitals is one of the most important changes that the world has undertaken the past years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the United Nations (SCJN) deployed the constitutional contradictions that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputys formulated against the Presidential Decree, which advanced the term " analogic coasting" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes required for the invalidation have not been gathered.
A minority of four Ministers, including the President of the Court, John Silva Media, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed its responsibilities when he issued the decree that details the actions to follow in order to concrease the transition to the earthquake digital television.
With this result, the constitutional contradiction promoted by the Secretariat of the Republic has been defended for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes to make the Court of Justice the constitutional or non-constitutionality of the Decree, and it continues to be in force.
The draft sentence, developed by the Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed the declaration of the Decree as non-constitutional, because the regulation on radio and television is a reservation reserved by law to the Federal Commission of Telecommunications (Coffeeel), in contravention of chirurgic subordination principles and law reservation.
For the project, only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordo were voted.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Deputy Chamber have promoted two constitutional conflicts to contest the decree and by admitting the complaints, the Minister Sánchez Corder suspended the implementation of the decree and all the actions provided by the Chamber for digital transition.
The plenary meeting of Ministers has also decided to deploy the complaint formulated by the Deputy Chamber, without discussing the project of which the Minister Sánchez Corder is also responsible.
In its intervention, the President said that it was not agreed with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the Federal Executor cannot structure through general standards the measures to be prepared by public administration.
"I think no longer if it would be affected by the regulator's autonomie," he recalled that public policy planning in strategic areas such as telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the Federal Executor, which has a constitutional mandate to the State direction.
The substitution of similar signals by defined signals is one of the most important changes that the world has undertaken in the past few years, and it has been translated into a better operation of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more lines.
To enjoy the change, it supported, would be to enjoy the benefits of digitalization that imposes a decision of public interest that does not only have technical dimensions, "for it also includes economic, social, political and national security issues."
These questions, signed, "requests the operation of all a system established, in accordance with the principle of the State economic direction, a group of attributes that the Constitution grants the ability of the State Executive".
He recalled that many countries in the world have already completed the digital transition and have done it through the Executive, despite the fact that they had specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the executive, being issued by the contested decree, has in a form the scope of the Congress skills, as it ensures the respect of the laws issued by the law, is ensured.
Analyze the possibility of a "related by vote" in Michoakan
According to the data cleared by PREP, the difference between the first and the second place of the election of the governance is only 27 per cent, even without accounting of the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,000 degrees 74.
The possibility of the "related by vote" was a reality in respect of the electoral process this year in Michoakán, where, according to the data made by the Pre-Eliminary Head (PREP), the difference between the first and the second place of the governing election is only 27 per cent, even without containing the votes corresponding to 879 of 6,74 double-speakers.
In that respect, the President of the General Council of the Michaakan Electoral Institute, Mary of the Bederal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, on 9 November, the electional organization adopted a series of guidelines to harmonize local standards for the electoral reform.
It will be remembered that Michoakan has not authorized its political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Law of Electoral Justice, at the same time that the State Congress adopted the reforms a few before the end of the legal term so that this electoral process could enter into force and the Leonel Godoy Rangel has hated its publication in the terms provided for by the Official Journal of the State, with the argument that it had some objects.
On the same 9th November, the Supreme Court of Justice of the National Justice (SCJN) decided the constitutional contradiction promoted by the Pouvoir Local Law and qualified as "invalid and illicit" the vote of the officer of the statutory for constitutional reforms, as it is not the right to "sank or condemn."
Interviewed on the possibility of "related by vote", Mary of the Bederal Angeles stated that through the approval of the IEM General Council's guidelines, it will be possible to achieve the partial and provisions of the votes by the local electoral organization.
Thus, the part of votes, one or more electoral packages may be that: the results of non-coincidence processes are not co-incident; there is no scrutin scrutin process and deployed in the original folder is not found in the President of that; or there are errors or highlightings of the procedures.
Furthermore, the total disappearance of the votes received in every urine of the election may be carried out when there is an indice of the fact that the difference between the applicant granted by the respective election and the second place in the scrutin is equal or under a percentage point; in the condition that at the beginning of the session there is a express restraint of the representative of the Party and/or coalition presented by the second of the reported candidates.
The total disappearance of the scrutin may also be achieved if at the end of the common disappearance, it results that the difference between the imposed candidate and the second place is equal or lower than a percentage point, provided that it exists the express penalty of the representative of the political party whose second candidate is issued, where the electoral packages were excluded from the partial disappearance.
It should be mentioned that this is the situation of the election of Morelia, where, according to the PREP, the difference between the first and the second place is only 0.16%, even without accounting of the votes of 129 from 923 upper processes.

The new Italian government will be formed in mercredi
The first appointed Minister Mario Monti will be meeting with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put this country on the side of the economic disaster
The first appointed Minister, Mario Monti, will be meeting on Wednesday with the President of Italy to present the new government that will face Italy's crisis on the side of the economic disaster and has made dangerous all the European Zone.
A representative of the Presidential palace announced that Monti, named Sunday, would be meeting on Wednesday with the President, Giorgio Napolitano, to confirm that it could form the Government.
It is expected to present a majority of the technological captain, even if it is not clear when the new executive will take its position.
Monti said he would submit to the President the result of his conversation with the political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's capacity to overcome this difficult phase," said the former European Commissioner to journalists.
Monti did not expressly say that he could form a government, but the tone of its comments indicated that the obstacles were overcome.
"The frame is now well stretched," added it.
Monti has complemented the process to form a government at least three days, in a more reduced time than normally, while Italy fighted a political and financial crisis that has lacked its costs of inadequate debt to support.
The new administration directed by the former European Commissioner Monti must approve a hard extinction package issued by European leaders to recover the confidence in Italy which had been affected.
Noting the pressure on Monti to extract, the instability of the markets in placed the performance of the Italian BTP obligations to 10 years above 7 per cent, the level in which Greece and Ireland have continued to be saved.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of the Italian patron Conf industry, said to the media after his meeting with Monti: "We said we are much supporting this government."
We believe that this Government is the last opportunity for Italy from this emergency situation.
Monti ' s success opportunities have been significantly stimulated by supporting the PDL Party of Silvio Berlusconi, with which the crises were obliged to release the past summer.
"We believe that the efforts of professor Monti will have a good result," said Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre party.
The PDL support, the largest Italian party, is significant because many of its members had been opposed to the Government of technical majority as Monti.
Parliamentary support
The new government of Monti must have a strong parliamentary support to implement what probably will be reforms of impulsive austerity.
Any blocking or delay in its efforts could lead to a new and devastator of financial markets.
Italian foreign banks association has been added to pressure, noting that a monastery's fatality would be a disaster.
Monti started its consultations with political, unions and patronal groups and youth organizations and women.
He will end his tournament of Friday meetings at night.
Monti was appointed on Tuesday by Napolitano, which has a extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief reply at the end of the past week, when it was clear that Berlusconi was going to delay, the costs of the Italian debt are now income at critical levels between the uncertainty of the success of the new Minister.
Save Italy, with a public debt of €1,9 billion, would be too much for the current financial defence of Europe.
Monti said that his Government should continue to the future elections planned for 2013, despite the generalized previsions that politics would only give him time to implement reforms before the elections advanced.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the large parties stressed the fact that this should only be formed by specialists, an indice of their objections before a financial pressure process.
Political sources have reported that mutual misfiances and disagreements between parties composed the test of inclusion of political figures.
Spanish experience is higher than the costarkins
22 footballers named Spain, 10 have participated in more than 50 international games.
From Costa Rica, only one of the 22 invited meetings took part in 50 meetings.
A huge contrast to the Costa Rica, if it is compared to the 22 conquered by the two countries for the friendship today at 15:05 p.m. at the National Stadium of San José.
During the national and Europe campaigns, the number of the monthly classification of the FIFA, contain a registry of inter-electional games in class A, the Tricolore has only the defender Michael Huana as the only to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached on Friday in the game against Panama (0-2) on Rommel Fernández.
The Spanish footballers playing in the Ligue of the stars and powerful clubs of the Premier League of England, maintaining an intensive activity in national ligue and cut campaigns and disputes in European coupes such as League Champions.
All this must be added to the experience with Furia Español during the combined elections of the European Couple and the football World.
In contrast, the constant footballers have an international experience limited to an area such as Concacaf, which is considered a lower level in the FIFA.
We can see that the largest record of the Spanish selection is the heimker Casillas guard, which previous summer against England (defence 0-1 in London) has evaluated the record of the former but guard of Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Today, Castles will play against the Tricolor and they will impose a new record for Spain, with 120 international games.
Xavi Hernández, the cerebral of Barcelona, at 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA, as well as the other hundreds of the Ibarian team, Zubizarreta mentioned above with 126 and the front-center of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Prepare the center number is located Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
He is followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61 and David Silva, with 53.
On the coast, and near Michael Huana is the left side Júnior Dayz, with 48 presents and the Bryan Ruiz busher, with 45.
After this, only five over 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
At least.
Those who have less. With more than 30 presentations in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
The national side, with less than 30 presents, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest is not even 20.
During Nao Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar, only one and only one Olman Vargas and Edder Nelson will not begin again.
History bugger of Spain is David Villa, with 50 millas, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.

Quinteto has included the country in its tour to celebrate two decades of trajectory
"Go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become real"
In the exclusive interview with Viva, the basist Jeff Ament, of Pearl Jam, said that the group is ready to offer one of his best concerts the next afternoon on the National Stadium.
They were waiting for more than 20 years, but the group is sure that this will also be a dream of reality to happen in this country.
It is that the founder and member of Jeff Ament assured, by speaking exclusively with Viva, Brazil, last week.
The group is located in the south American island of its two-year-term work tour and will Sunday 20 make its unique escape in Central America.
This day will be presented on the National Stadium from 19:30, next to the Los Angeles The X and the La Roberts group.
This is an extrait of the conversation, the complete transscription is located in the Nation on Internet.
For its constant adoptions, Pearl Jam will happen in Costa Rica is a dream becomen real. Are you sure that your fans live?
Go to Costa Rica is a dream that has become real for us.
This is our second time in South and Central America and this has been great.
I went to Costa Rica only once the holidays; it's a so beautiful country, and I think we can take a couple of days.
So this makes us emotion to carry our music out there.
I ask you because there is a kind of divorce to the group, fans live with intensity the previous days.
What is your message for your most fertility?
Thank you for staying next to us all these years.
21 years later, we had to come to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so much and we've been sorry for a long time to this concert.
Some say already that his concert is the largest show of the year.
Does this add a little pressure to your visit.
Some of the greatest shows we offered during the last 21 years have happened in the last two weeks.
We offered a two magic shows to Sao Paul and we hope that this has made us for this concert in Costa Rica.
We are very comfortable to produce it.
We love this country, we love to make surf and jungle; for the two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you find Costa Rica and its vags to make surf?
We have a lot of survivors and I have a very good friend who lives in Tamarindo and the vags are incredible there.
My friends were always going to make surfs in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, at Mexico's coast, are great places to make surf; so we learned it, through the gents who love the superf.
Seeing the tournament, you're offering huge shows, with a lot of songs.
What are you planned for your presentation in Costa Rica?
As we have never been produced there, we have no restriction in what we can do.
We're trying to make the best possible show, with a large variety of songs; we're trying to interpret two songs from each album and offer our guys a good and different directory.
You never repeat the directory.
What's that supposed to be?
I think it is partly because we have nine disks and we can interpret more than 120 chansons and everyone like different songs, so it is very difficult to choose what songs we're interpreting every evening.
When we have two or three songs in the directory that we have no longer interpretation for a long time, this helps us to stay concentrated and we surprised because this reminds us the reasons for which we love these songs and that we can forget.
This makes the show more interesting for us and therefore I think it becomes more interesting for people.
With this tournament, you're celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it difficult to believe all you have successed?
Yes, absolutely.
First of all, I think no one of us had imagined that we were going to form a great rock group, and the fact that we did it over 20 years, that it appears to be a dream.
We continue to tell our blessings and the power of continue to make music together make us much emotion.
We love and adorn the creation of music.
We're lucky to go to the world's places we've always wanted to go.
The things couldn't go better for us.
What does it mean for you have been a fundamental element in the creation of the wheat?
This has always been a privilege for us to form part of this group of large groups.
We are very friends with Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's surprising when a move is on a group of friends, and it's little common.
At time, a group rises from a city, but it's a lot more weird when five or ten groups go out at the same time.
We are fiery and it is a privilege for us to form part of the Seattle Group.
We're still playing with some of them in time.
Last year, we participated in a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden in their tour, so we're lucky to be friends with all of them and it's a honour to form a part of the son of Seattle who rises up.
It's so weird that a group like yours will hold one and with the same members for a long time.
Yes, four of us were together for 21 years and Matthew (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, and only this is much more time than many groups are normally long.
First of all, I think we're all lucky to be alive and, secondly, we're all worried about the others.
We are all intime friends and thanks to this there are musical bulletins that give from freedom to each one to experience.
We trust each other with the music of each one and that couldn't go better.
Your relationship with the same word is not easy, but through your success you have been able to do what you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we grow, it was easier to find a balance.
We assure that we don't have too much time in turn because it's easy to fall in this game of the great multitudes and people who love your music.
If you don't forget that people are there for music, it advertises us not to forget that we need to respect the music and what he brought it, without taking into mind the fact that we are famous and a rock star, which really doesn't care for any of us.
How do you remember your other project, Mother Love Bone?
I think we've written good songs, and at the beginning this was great.
We were a group for almost three years and we have not published a disc before the death of Andy (Anndrew Woods).
There were many frustrations for the fact that she has dure so little and the most important is that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore) who started in the group with us and when I hear a song or I see a photo I think to the unbelievable person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, this was always a pleasure to work, were, talk about the music, the football and many other things with him.
He was a surprising human being and he misses us.
The National Group Las Robertas will open the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and why did you choose it to open it?
Yes, the production has sent us videos with different proposals and that was the group we have loved the most, so we are accompanied to see what the Roberts can offer directly and that must be very disappointed.
Why do you always change Yello Ledbetter's words directly?
This is a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don't know.
That's him who's shot and I think he's doing it with the first words he imagines.
As a basist, what are its influences?
There's so much...
Among the first I remember Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many influences that I could talk to the afternoon of the lows I love.
How did Pearl Jam maintain relevant gain, despite the fact that this is no longer in mode?
I think we're all feeling a little unconnected of the word of gange.
When I think this, it reminds me of the groups I have come to mention, such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those who have risen up at the same time and, if it is relevant now, I think that it's wonderful, because it's a music that is worth the penalty to listen, and the groups like Mudhoney are now the best music than ever.
At the beginning, his music had more dark content, and now it became more positive.
What should this change?
It's interesting, because I think there are songs in the new album that seems more light, but there are also songs like The End or Just Breathe qualified as very dark songs, even if they can sound a little positive.
With the two, when Ed played them for me, I weep when I listened to them, and these are very dark songs.
I think if you grow and there is a traumatism in your life and you lose a parent or friend, these things start affecting your art and music and these songs, unfortunately, represent this for me.
I also think that we can also be happy and even as we can do the dark music.
Peru:
Fujimori hospitalized for medical reviews
The former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized in a public hospital to be evaluated for the loss of muscle force present in his feet, and informed his family doctor.
Fujimori, 72 years old, who purifys a penalty of 25 years of prison for human rights violations during his Government (1990-2000) suffers of various affections, including a language cancer for which it has been operated four times and which is under control.
The Alejandro Aguinaga, his personal doctor, said to Canal N television that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days in the National Institute of Neoplastic Malayies to determine the reason of pain and loss of force in its lower members.
Aguinaga commented that Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the remission of the penalty for humanitarian reasons, uncertainly, he said that it would not wish because he feels innocent.
It has been operated four times of language cancer, he has a loss of 18 kilometres, and other pathology, such as a serious eruptive gastroat, a kyste of pancreas, renal calculations, art hypertension and movement problems in feet, has been identified the doctor.
Fujimori cleans the conclusion since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Office.
In April 2009, 25 years of prison were condemned for the death of 25 persons because of an annihilation of the army who had condemned the first years of his government.
Mujica travel to Mexico to consolidate political links
A formal court, with the Uruguay President, José Mujica, and formed various ministers and patrons, would begin the Sunday to take a visit to Mexico to extend trade between the two nations and to address political themes of the region.
Mujica will be held next Friday with its mexican homologe, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of a long agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the collection of residents in Mexico, according to the Uruguay Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents in the city of Guadalajara will be "profit for the exchange of information in political affairs between the two nations", as published by the South America Presidency on its website.
According to the local media, Mujica is looking for a convergence of Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France who had occurred when the French officer Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on the list of fiscal paradises, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his talks, Sarkozy has not been excluded from the international community by countries that continue to be fiscal paradises, a declaration which caused Uruguay's rejection and the call for consultations of his ambassador of that European country.
Since November, the G20 Chairman, a group of emergency and stronger countries in the world, has entered into force with the South America country since January, a convention to exchange fiscal information to avoid dual imposition.
The Uruguay Government has tried to deal with the concreasing of fiscal trade agreements to exit from the "Green List" of the Economic Cooperation and Development Organization (OCDE), integrated by countries who do not implement all international standards of fiscal cooperation.
Since 2004, Mexico and Uruguay have entered into force a Free Commerce Treaty (TLC) which has increased the exchange of goods between the two nations.
The moustachu plombier passes into three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario was unfair, for 25 years to save the Princess Peach of the strikes of the evil Bowser, but he never made it in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the love of the young in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which comes this month to the stores of all the world, has been designed since the beginning to well exploit the characteristics of the Nintendo 3DS mobile console, which allows to play in three sizes without using lunchs.
"Mary is the person who must say how to function the stereoscopy without lunettes," said the responsibility of the NNA specialized pressure in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game initially designed for this support", because until now the success as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" was the adaptions of the existing titles.
The Nintendo port supported that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is a "accessible" video game that allows a fast and flower game.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "for example" to increase less happiness users.
Once surmonted, the most experts can make a "second tour" at the levels of the game, which this time is more difficult.
Furthermore, users can choose real time between aggressive "D" or one who only affects the depth of the action, but it would be necessary to play in three dimensions to overcome the various challenges and "not succeeding to optical illustrations".
This Super Mario incursion in the three dimensions is also supposed the return of the person to a mobile console, that has not been passed since 2005.
In these Nintendo video games there is an eye climb to the adeptes of the saga and repeat the form of success of the previous games, which consists of the fact that the moustachu flower has to be using mixed experience platforms to release the Princess Peach.
Even though I play news in movements, environments, costumes and enemies, and also in the cases of Luigi "jouable".
Colume gives its appeal to Portillo extradition to the United States
The President Álvaro Colom announced the spring that he had given order for extracting the former leader Alfonso Portillo to respond to the United States for the conspiration for the white-up of $70 million.
This ends the proceedings for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that calls for Portillo to judge it.
In press conference, Colum stated that his decision was obliged to the independence of the judicial and executive authority, taking into account the fact that a court of first instance had already ordered its extradition.
He stated that during its term "not helped" in any judicial resolution and he had been carried out to all the extraditions he had known.
Apart from Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marrokin will also be added to murder and serious lesions, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes will be extraditional for drug traffic.
What Colom has done shall be an executive start after the exchange of all judicial and constitutional institutions to judge the former official of the Interval 2004-2004 intervalle.
According to the Fifth Penal Court and the Court of Constitution (CC), the Portillo should be removed after solving its legal situation in Guatemala and after guaranteeing human rights.
Portillo was absoluted for the delay of Q120 million to the Ministry of Defence when he was President, which was the case before the extension, but the Public Ministry called and reactivated the case.
Trinjove helped 6,000 young people in risk
The entity is born to avoid the marginalization of youth without training
The balance of the first 25 years of the Trinijove Social Support Entity is important: 6,000 young people have been exclusively helped to overcome a difficult situation during this fourth century.
This is added to the long hundreds of job posts currently obtained by this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to make the balance in a celebrated act in an old industrial complex of Fabra i Coats with more than 300 people assisted.
Trinijove was born in Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping little formed, without work, with toxicomany problems or marginalised.
The celebration of yesterday in Sant Andreu focused on a number of entities and institutions who cooperated with the association in these 25 years.
The various political representation, in full electoral season, showed the unilateral character of the work made by Trinijove.
As the President of the Regional Government of Catalan (General), Arthur Mas and its predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the former Social Education Minister, Ernest Maragall and the former Master added to the Maire and Current Eco-Society Adviser Ricard Goma.
It is also assisted in the great room of Fabra i Coats the active Minister of Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleriens and the General Cardinal Director of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stated that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time, and the current is also it, but he added that the work done until now "is a good basis".
The President gave Trinijove an example to know how to fight the bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something again for the entity and for the work that makes it," says he.
Properties invahid by square for micro-fests, evacuated
The invasioners were 11 of the 13 apartments of the building, Balmes, 51.
The 12 employees left the middle ownership without any resistance
It seems to indicate that the 51-year-old residents of Rue Balmes had ended.
Two persons voluntarily left the immune they had been illegally occupied, and where they had organized microfests that had disappeared neighbourhoods by judicial order and without the need of police intervention.
To the end of the operation, the door was changed to prevent the situation to be repeated.
"At this day there will be a control of access," said the administrator.
The square, who had invahi 11 of the 13 building apartments - the rest of the households, were inhabited, were equipped with the electrical installation and a part of the water, through the walls and left residue of all kinds, especially alcoholic bottles.
The first three apartments were the scene of the masse feasts, which remained up until two days and were disappointed of the locators.
On the side of the building there is a discthek, Balmes 51, which was also affected.
Her owner, Mary Pantinat explained for Europe Press that, since the occupation of the building, his case was 80%.
The owner of the discotec stated that the owners of the property had made him a deloyal competence because they sold the shoes to three euros, while they were worth 10.
Furthermore, the owner of the leisure local had to respond to the complaints of neighbors for the voice, while, according to that, the news were not provoked by the climbing clients, but by the occupied households and mostly the participants in the festivals organized there, which were more frequent and intensive in the past weeks, according to the irregular neighbourhoods of the area.
The license of the discotec has explained that the eggs were so large than she had even conducted an agreement with the owner of the immeuble and that has done nine months that the "looking" would be dinner.
Guardia Urbana (Christian Police) also confirmed that the past weeks they had received more complaints from the neighbourhood for this situation.
The Chairman of the municipal group of the Maurie PP Alberto Fernández Díaz had asked for the past week "the immediate evacuation of the immune to end with the common and quoted life problems that he caused the residents and the degradation of the area."
The popular leader explained that before the age of the building was only an edition, but in the last months the square had occupied all the building stars and almost all apartments and that in certain apartments there were also flights.
In this sense, he added that "because must be ended with impunity and be imposed against the anti-social behaviour generated in the property".
The Mosso (the local Catholic police) also evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 15.30 p.m. police moved to Rue 35, from Rue Mont-ral, after receiving an invitation from a neighbour who had noted that four people were access to the building.
The four were immediately arrested.
Park or mountain?
The co-incident architects on the opportunity of convocation beyond the polemic on honoraries
The municipal concours on the 16 gates again opens the discussion on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the middle of the 1980s, full of the eighth Metropolitain Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), the Administration has printed Collserol's promotion views.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of Barcelona metropolitaine.
In addition, she also contained a comparison, in numbers, with the Central Park of New York.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park became again, in the imagination of many people, the upper limit of Barcelona, the Catholic capital is the only one that is not easy to the north-south axis, but high (montagne) lower (mer).
Collerola's qualification as natural park is the advantage of this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park Sinn Yellowstone, with blooders in the role of the Yogi eye.
This was the situation until, in September, the master conveyed a mega-compliance with 16 concours for all access doors to Collserola.
A door lays down to the park idea without any doubt.
That's, or someone wants to put the doors in the field.
The question appeared only: Collserol: park or mountain?
The concours, both in its organization as well as in relation to the city's reflection, is a theme of conversation of all the architects in Barcelona.
It is almost a recurrent theme of which two members of this old helicopter speak when they are recognized in an ascensor.
And this is just one of the rare views on which the three architects of Barcelona, university professors, who have been presented there.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Modol and Marta Bayona: the comfort is opportun.
For Roldán, after abolishing the litoral front "It is necessary to discuss" on "the front of the mountain" because the discourses of Ildefons Cerda, the feast of green houses have not been done at end.
"We need to get out of the basis that the most broader park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things for its great accessibility.
Collserola is more comprehensive," the architect gave for which the title of "ports of Collserola" provides a "legical pound": it is not necessary to think of those "as access to a park, but the delimitation of certain areas in which it needs to be acted".
Model, like Roldán and Bayona with the experience in the urbanistic world, qualifies the proposal as "intelligent challenge" with "the losses".
Experiences resulting from "the uncertainty of the public space project" after experience lived in the 1980s and which had in the Forum "Canch Son of cygna".
The first fear is the own delimitation of the borders on which it can be built.
"Alimit something means to put the next step already," that is, its extension.
"New urbanistic instruments, planning, because current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can cause the authenticity of disasters."
In addition to the question, the Model believes that, simply, the shipping of the region El Valles de Collserola "perhaps be heard as a park, that of Barcelona, not."
Model recalls that there is already a job by the Collserol Patronat who "not must be lost" by rewarding the opportunity that the master offers its corporation to intervene in this project "after the first time".
Furthermore, he understands that the nearness of the mountain with the city is the self-code that allows architects to enter into the debate, but "double" if this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a success", he said) that "We, architects, should be only an instrument".
Bayona insinues that the response to the question that gives the title of this room is complex, because the bases of the concours lacks a global vision of Collserola: "They have been convened 16 transversal concours - said he - in the sense of Mount-mer, but there is no long-reading that goes and understands the area together."
This does at least in this case, which has been opted to participate in 16 concourses.
Another way, a project for one of the gates to store the program and define the architect of the neighbour door.
In its opinion, yes, the master should ensure that the immediate band of Ronda de Dalt should, in all its extension, provide an equipment area that makes a sweet transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and this will be released free
After 72 days of preliminary arrestation, the legal power fund of Casino Red has granted forgiveness to the brother of Monterrey for the process initiated against him for chanting
After 72 years of arrest, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the foundation of the legal power of Casino Red will grant him the forgiveness to the Second Federal Court of the District, which follows a proceedings for singing against the brother of Monterrey.
After the attent of Casino Royale, the owner of the Red Casino, Sergio Gil García published a series of photos and videos in which presumably Manuel Jonás required payment of an economic quota to allow Monterrey's clandest operation of the house.
After public denunciation, the Parquet opened a criminal proceeding against the brother of the PANist, and on 2 September the Parque was arrested and held in provisional arrest for 30 days.
Four hours before the Office of the Public Ministry of 3 of the Patrimonial Decree, it was transferred to the Centre of Detention 1, situated in the Old Quartier of the State Capital.
During the 49 days following, there was a second detention order after the Office of the Public Ministry had detained crimes of corruption and organized crimes.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Café Café Penal Centre presumably to sing with a million and half weight of the owners of the Red Casino; but only a few hours in the middle security detention centre, because there were threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the process refered to the municipal cells of San Nicolas of the Garza.
On 25 October, a complaint order was issued by the Second Federal Court of District, Jorge Yánez, who said that nearly two months of investigation had been confirmed sufficient evidence to determine the fault of Jonas, such as the exchange of 1,5 million weights of the representatives of the house in exchange.
On Monday, the foundation of the legal power of the Red Casino, Victor Aldo García Gómez, presented before judge José Luis Pecina to ask for forgiveness for the brother of the region, and he could therefore receive his freedom during the next hours.
During legal formalities, the Officer of the Public Ministry attached to the Court Ramiro Aria asked García Gómez whether the damage had been recovered and who had been the partners of the game's house who had granted the forgiveness, but the lawyer tried not to communicate the name.
In accordance with Regulation 197/2011, the legal forgiveness of Jonás Larrazábal has been granted and later it is not possible to submit any complaints on the proceedings which he has tried against; it is not requested for any repeal of damage and no punishment.
After the foundation of the legal power of the house of the game, at 15:50 a.m. the immediate freedom of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The Court of Justice, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of San Nicolas of the Garza, to communicate to Jonás that he had been legally forgiven and his dossier would be classified.
He will also communicate the order of immediate freedom that the judge has issued.
Secretariat Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives the details of the air incident in which his life was lost the secretary of the Government, France Blake and other seven persons
The Secretariat of Communications and Transports (SCT) informed that the results shown on the accident in which his life had lost the Government Secretariat, France Blake Mora and other seven persons, indicated that helicopter had directly hit against the earth in full structural integrity, without that the pilot could try a forced warrant.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, secretariat of Communications and Transports, mentioned that before the aircraft was disappeared, the pilot found that climate conditions were appropriate to fly.
"The elements that seem to indicate that the unit had different contacts with the ground, palles had contacted with the trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fussing."
He also informed that the unit was designed for 19 persons, so that it satisfy the requirements required to transport staff.
Furthermore, he said that investigations made in the area of non-pact are not reported to the appearance of peaks on the ground.
"In a search reported that there are no parts or components of the aircraft in another place, the impact has been made structurally.
"Helicopter was designed for 19 passengers and satisfied the requirements for transporting them.
The ground had a seven-30 degrees of inclination.
For the present, the Secretariat has ensured that a priority is to have the highest possible results; but the investigation can take a few months, it may even be a year.
At its tour, Gilberto López Meyer, Director-General of Airports and Services, he assured that the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Major Presidential State was working in rapidly to cross, and that happened on a rising ground.
"This information supports the hypothesis of a normal operation to crush at the time of the impact," said he.
During the press conference, the SCT title of the SCT, Perez Jácome, identified six important elements in the investigation:
Visitive vol:
According to the airline, the flight has been carried out in accordance with visual flight rules, which implies that the equipage must have visibility during the flight and the ground.
Meteorological conditions:
The reports in the AICM mentioned appropriate conditions for disappearance, and in the steel and measured that the aircraft faced to the limited area between DF and Mexico's State had low nebulosity covers.
Selected roads:
It is likely that, because of the conditions of nebulousness, the equipage has been seeking a lower and more visibility in the Cuernvaca Valley.
Localization of the unpacked.
The coordinates of the unpack and the last record of the coyncline aircraft on the co-incident radar may have not been lost or lost the control or highlighting of the flight trajector.
The rest of the aircraft in a reduced area:
The information available until now allows the impôt to take place on a legal and bilateral trajector.
The model of dissemination of the remaining aircraft allows to imagine that helicopter has been hurt against the ground in structural integrity conditions.
It has not detected fire or explosion traces:
On the left side there is still no trace in the rest of the aircraft of an explosive or fire type.
The latest inquiry results indicate that the aircraft had many contacts with the ground.
During the field work, the aircraft was found at a height of 9,000 200 feet above the middle level of the sea, the earth had a pent that goes from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
Photographs show the sequence in which he may have dearticulated during its trajet.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that helicopter may have multiple effects with the ground.
Following the minimum research in a higher area than the place concerned, around the incident, the aircraft has not found parts that were dispersed, which supports the presumption that the impact had occurred in structural integrity conditions.
MSS announced to find the obedience gender
Social insurance leads an investigation to discover the obedience gender in the case of children and youth; this is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Assurance (IMSS) announced that he conducted an investigation to discover the gender of obedience in the case of children and youth, as well as the 'Genetic Protocol of Children Obligence and adolescents, which will allow the markers to be associated with superpoids.
In a communication, the Chief of the Medical Investigation Unit in Biochimie of the Hospital of the National Medical Centre of the 20th Section, Miguel Cruz López explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, sisters, nutritionists and social assistants had been established.
This team is supported by third cycle students and students of the National Health Institute (INSP) and from the Investment and Research Centre (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
In the investigation, it is requested to participate in the population or not right, to submit to the participating sports units from the IMSS Valley of Mexico, where the evidence of the minors is performed from 8:00.
He emphasized that the Protocol started in the Cuahutemoc Sport Unit (Mexico Ponente) and that since 8 October the activity was deployed in the Sport Unity of Nezahualcoyolt (Estado of Mexico East).
After reaching the goal of 500 or 600 minors, the study will continue in the Sport Unit of Independence ( south of Federal Distrito) and finally in the Sport Unit Morelos (North of Distrito Federal Distrito).
He explained that the goal of this investigation and the aim of encounter the components and the importance of genetics with regard to the development of obedience and identification of children and young mexicans of risk factors to prevent the appearance of chronic generic diseases.
As the 14 November, on 14th World Day of the Diabeth, he pointed out that the goal is to gather three thousand children and young children between six and 14 years, with the consent and monitoring of their parents, for the implementation of specific food issues.
They will also be requested for their physical activity and their family herdenses of their diseases, to avoid risk factors that decline affections such as diabeth or renal insufficience.
He stated that the sames will be applied to all participants of anthropometric measurements (poids, size, circumstances), arteral pressure, definition of glucose levels, triglycerids, cloertol and insuline and genetics (the search is seeking to identify people related to child obsentity).
Cruz López reported that this investigation is the fruit of health care for young people's health professionals for hazardous weight.
' Health investigations in 1999 and 2006 reported that in only six years, in the case of boys, 77 per cent of obedience and in the case of girls of 47 per cent, the surpounding has also been observed a dramatic growth of the IMSS specialist.
He stated that the justification for trademarkers was based on the fact that the population of the country is different from others by his genetic history.
He informed that in the middle of the Mexicans, 65 percent of indigenous erdency, a 30 percent of European and a 5 percent of African and this condition reflects in diabetes and surpounds.
He explained that the genetics of obedience are generally translated into the inability of burning the exemption of energy that consumes (calories), which is put into grass.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive assessment of the children, which allows to detect whether they represent a level of surpoids or obedience.
It even says that the presence of the dark (acantose) sharp (acantosis) on the cock and the front shows the probability of suffering metabolic highlights and even pre-diabeths.
Information is directed in a confident way, doctors recall it by writing to parents, each of the measures and changes in the lifestyle that they have to be made to prevent diseases.
Cruz López explained that there are three key components that cause surpoids, obedience and other chronic affections: the sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, remaining the most of the day before the television and use ways of transport instead of walking on short distances.
Another reason is the highest caloric, which is the largest consumption of sucreed beverages, carbon hydrates (atmospheres - meat past to the meat mas browsed in mass sheets - pain, pain, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with a high content of fats and proteins and genetics analysed in this protocol.
UNAM's assumption would avoid cases
Rafael Herrera, researcher of the UNAM Chemical Faculty, develops changed aspires with polymers to produce a mechanism with a better performance, independently of environmental and temperature conditions
If the signals that the lake were solved, it would not be necessary to retain approximately 200 000 cases every rain season in the Metropolitanne Valle of Mexico, noticed Rafael Herrera Nájera, Chimica Faculty Faculty (FQ), which has ensured that if the construction and maintenance of the bituminal pave is adequate, the cases could be reduced or even completely elected.
During its conference A technical view on cases organized in the framework of the International Year of Chimie, he announced that the laboratory who is responsible for the development of aspires amended with polymers to produce a mechanism with similar characteristics, but with a larger mechanical resistance, both high and temperature bases.
Mrs. Najera said that this kind of modified appendix could be used in places where climate is extremely warm, such as some of the northern cities in the country, to improve the performance, and therefore, case training.
He explained that asphalt, the lower part of the petrol, is a set of molecules of hydrocarbons, molecules with a lower molecule weight called asphaltens, and molecules with a low molecule weight called Malthen, which together gives its behaviour viscoelastic behaviour.
The viscoelastic behaviour of the asphalt consists of the fact that at high temperatures, about 180 degrees, it is used as a liquid, at 120 degrees C its viscosity is very large and at 50 degrees C it presents a almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes shopping, added to it.
This means that in the streets the resistance of the asphalt is not uniform and changed during the day in accordance with the environmental and temperature conditions, the specialist in chemical engineering warning.
The FQ researcher observed that the roads of Mexico in most of them were covered by a flexible thread, composed of six material beds, including the three latest asphalt.
Among the surface beds is the swimming pocket, formed by small stones bailed in asphalt and later compacted.
Each of the small stones that form the rock, signalât, is bailed and asphalt.
When the vehicles are being used by generating efforts, it allows forces to be very good in the board.
If it had been changed asphalt, those would have better propained, opposed the chemical engineer.
On the drying bed, he said, the last bed called roaring bed, made in final stone, that is, the sable that is also bailed in asphalt.
As this is the cotton in contact with the roads of vehicles, it must have more mechanical force than the asphalt cow and provide accession in the street.
In the part of the beach that receives and distributes the efforts, the road cut also requires that it has an appropriate stage and the material that it has been made must be subscribed.
The climate, particularly humidity and temperature variables, also is a very important factor to consider, especially water, because they are considerably affecting the performance of the asylum cotton.
When the sun is cut, water spreads inside the cotton is difficult to make it easy, which rallys all the beds and therefore causes casses.
In the course of training of a case, he said, the first is the road film and later is only affected asphalt cotton, but the damage does not immediately, but it is a process that must be signed to the first signs with adequate support programmes.
The member of the National Research System explained that the load of vehicles is another important factor for the training of cass and therefore the deployer of each tape must always be linked to the load of vehicles and ensure its satisfaction to avoid frequent case training.
Rafael Herrera warned that there are still a lot of investing and working on the asphalt, for example, bituminary emulation, which already exist in other countries and allows the cases to be easy and without need to use high temperatures.
What lacked the candidate from Valle to be the new Colombie Miss?
Analysis of factors made that Melina Ramírez Serna does not obtain my Colombie's coron.
Valle receives its number number number 14 of prince.
A new Valley of Cauca is left with the desire to win Miss Colombie's core.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to satisfy on the podium of winners, to bring the money corner and the band that acquired it as a new prince of Colombia.
With the outcome reached yesterday in Cartagena, where Ms. Atlantic is mounted with the coron and the sceptre, the department has already been 14 titles of Princess and Melina, a Legio of women of Valle del Cauca, which were found near the core, but were proclaimed, including Miriaemia Ospina Benoit (1987), Clara Domínguez Borro (1949), Patricia Bellinia Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanica Evers (1988), Monica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pine (1990), Diana Isabel Romaro (1993), Garselle (2000), Aljure (Catala) (Catalina), Alhance (192007.
The great question that many worlds today are:
What did he miss? Because the result represents the defect of a great favourite in each presentation she showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombie, because she had not been elected in vain Reine of the Police and Better Visage Jolie de Vogue, titles obtained by the rivers Taliana Vargas or Navarro who had not been elected in vain Reine of the Police Visage of Vogue.
The first factor considered key in the decision taken by the jury of appointing the Princesse is the fact that she did not agree with her answer to the question "What was the book that marked you and why? put by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamus.
This is the response of the candidate of Valle to this question:
"I read a lot, I believe enough in the literature, I think it's a form of culturalizing himself, definitively I think the book that signed my child is "The small prince," is a book quite deep.
Now I read "Crime and Châtiment," it is a book of universal literature that we should read everyone; and now I read the book of Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a very beautiful book called "The Fire of blood".
This response did not like all first because of the term "cultural" and secondly not to explain concretely how every book City had marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina said she felt quiet and happy with the result "The universe and wise, it happens what must happen.
And for everybody, read if please, "The little prince" is a great book.
Among the hypothèses launched there is the one in which Valle was destroyed by favoritism.
A journalist of Bogota continued to be the preferred, birth and candidate who received all the preliminary prices (Oster gastronomy deficiency, the vote of the public for the best artisanal costs, and Reine Mother), "these has wandered the jalousy of other candidates, stressed the queen and so she did not shine on the scene."
And it was noted in his first submission in bathroom postlot at the Hillton Beach and its two challenges of the carrier veille.
Even though the two challenges she had seen itself, it was noted that she had no force and energy of the representatives of Magdalena and Atlantics.
Ariel Osorio, journalist of the program "Como in house" (Comme at the house) of the Canal RCN said that the fact that Melina was designed prince "confirm the fact that the candidate who receives most prices during the concours does not receive the Queen's core".
Furthermore, Valle avoided the press at the end, and it was an error.
Another hypothesis is that Valle has not succeeded to convince the jury on his interest for social initiatives, which is actually the importance of the National Concours of Beauty.
That is why two days before the election of the International Jury Lucy Doughty said that they were seeking a woman undertaken in regard to the social needs of her country.
"If the beauty is not sufficient in a Miss Colombie, it is necessary to look beyond the physical and focus on its social sensitivity, which before starting the Concours are already involved in projects," she explains.
The explicitly, as Valle has sinned by his infringements from his back and the fibrose that had been observed in his abdomen, but it is contrary, since exactly the jury chose it as the candidate 'Brease' with the most healthy, good food and physical work responsible.
Jorge Hernán Orozco recognized that Melina did not have the best body, that he had better, "but his problem of fibrose on the abdomen, who actually had not been too notory for me, he left the points of the last day."
During the periodist Guido Hoyos, the Cromos Review believes that the error of the candidate of Valle was the chirurgic intervention that she had understood.
"The surgery is good, but Valle didn't know what to do.
Her body has never been its attitude and she has lost because of this aspect."
For this price, that the National Concours of Beauty reiterated for the first time, after the Bad maillot was a cruel prediction that had been done last night, it was said that it was a small gift that Raymundo did in Melina to not give him the goal of the knee.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina begins today a year of kingdom, not as a sovereign year, but as princess, which gives him a position to represent Colombia in one of the international concours by designation of the National Concours.
However, it will pass into the story as one of the resins that, despite its smooth transition by Chargena, has not obtained the coron.
Thus was the work of the person of Cali identified the body of Alfonono Cano
A dactloscopist of Cali has passed to the story like the man who confirmed the death of "Alfononso Cano."
The work of these officials is crucial.
In the past 4 November, a dactloscopist of CTI de Cali went to the story as the person who confirmed the identity of the Supreme Chief of Farc: "Alfononso Cano", comparing its digital empires.
Of the seven dactyloscopists working in the local CTI offices this week, it was the tour of "availability" of Eliazar González, a man of Puerto Tejada who worked for 21 years in the field of judicial investigation.
At the beginning of his card, González worked in the municipalities of Chocco, where many times he had to pass more than five days in the forest to come to the place where the bodies had to be identified.
In 2000, he was transferred to the capital of Valle and after appropriate courses, he was specialized in dactyloscopy, which is the study of the fresh hair, i.e. the pools and feet.
During the week of the operation against others of Alfonso Cano, he warned Eliazar to take with him garments at least three days.
Something was very big to wait for him.
Friday night he went to Cauca in a palmira helicopter.
He knew that he had to identify two bodys and that one of them was the man who leaded the oldest guilty of the world, so he asked him to take the card with the ten digital campaigns of Guillermo León Saenz (the name is true).
But when he came with the inquiry team on the place of the body, he did not recognize it by his physical aspect, because he was very different than he had seen in the media.
He wasn't a barbe, he was bound as a countryman of the area, without lunchs and much smaller.
But the empires don't lie.
A galtonian loup, the inch, a preleveur and a lantern, Eliazar compared the digital card printings with those of the card.
His eye did not stumble it: he was the Alfononso Cano.
This same night, the original man of Puerto Tejada was the responsible who confirmed the ministry of Defence, Juan Carlos Pinzón that yes, he was the Supreme Head of Farcs.
Searching for the company
For a dactyloscopist of Sijin de Cali, the recognition that President John Manuel Santos made Eliazar González at a press conference on the operation against "Cano" is very significant.
Many people don't know our job.
Deactyloscopy is a precise science without a march of error, which may be crucial in the resolution of crimes.
In addition to identification of bodys, the dactyloscopists support investigations for crimes such as flight and murder and confirm the identity of captured persons.
When they are captured, many delinders present false identity cards or there are no documents.
We take their digital printings and search them in the database.
The researcher said that in an case of flight he had to remove a part of the wall from a house, because in this place the shelter had supported his hand to bring out a full cock and money cock.
"The walls are difficult because they are not adequate surfaces to throw it out a digital impression, but in this case we could get the impressive of the whole hand and identify the delining who had participated in different flights," he remembered.
Empires may also disappear or confirm suspects in cases of murder.
Received it was found a dead man, with bottles of drink around him.
A parent could be suspected by the crime and actually imprisoned on the coincided bulletin.
Even if it does not ensure that he is murderer, it is the place on the scene of the crime.
A dactyloscopist of the CTI explained that the digital printing of objects with chemical or physical reactions.
When they appear, the captioner or band is used to take them.
Afterwards are sent to Asif, the data database of delinquants, or the National Civil Registre.
"The problem is that there are still a lot of colonies without papers", said the CTI expert.
He explained that all are not how the CSI television program is shown.
As all the light is not gold, everything that touches is not strongly becomes an imprehension.
However, it can be used if the confrontation is necessary.
"Indeed" challenges the authorities in New York
A hundreds of demonstrators moved before the Zuccotti place for camping there.
Many people have accessed the evacuation order and moved to a neighbour park.
The integrators of the Occupe Wall Street movement challenged this march to the authorities of New York by trying to enter again, through a court order, at Manhattan place, where they were evacuated in the eagle and when they tried to take a different park of the Grand Pomme.
A hundreds of demonstrators were moved before the Zuccotti place, where they wanted to access through a judicial order that allowed the 'indicated' camps again in this place, while the other part of the movement responded to the evacuation by taking more park on the north of the city, where there were new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp again in the place, we'll be installed in another place and we will continue the legal fight to return to Zuccotti, and through seats and peaceful manifestations," said one of the ports of the "Occupe Wall Street," Mark Bray.
Bray informed that the response of the 'independents' to the removal of their camps personally dismissed by the Mare of New York, Michael Blomberg, came to the courts, where the judge Lucy Billings made a order prohibited the forced evacuation of the place and allowed the manifestants to stay in the camp.
Furthermore, the 'Indeeds' took a new park located at the confluence of the Canal Street centres and the Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which is New York and New Jersey, property of the Trinity Church parois.
At least for a hour they were able to take the place, but after the police moved and stopped some manifestists, even if Bray could not confirm the concrete number, assuring Ephes that he had seen some journalists that were also delayed.
The organization ensures that there were hundreds of persons installed in this place where a delegation of religious leaders was moved by signs of support to the movement members and attempted to interfere for them in favour of the police.
During time, the Zuccotti place - which is a greening of private property - remains closed by waiting for the celebration of a proceeding hearing planned by this Friday while the legality of the evacuation should be analyzed in this morning.
Some demonstrators moved until there and distributed to the copys of this order, and they even delivered it to the officers who observed the place, which caused the 'infant disparities', said Bray, which indicated the fact that some officials had strucked the manifestants.
The judicial order prohibites the authorities to evacuate the members of the Wall Street occupation or to apply " laws published after the beginning of occupation or prohibition of demonstrators to access again to park with tens or other properties that they had used before.
The Maire Bloomberg stated before the press that, because of this judgment, the city had suspended the opening of space to the public and the demonstrators, which he warned that local laws would not allow them to be installed with tents and bags to sleep.
The municipal adviser has personally defended the evacuation carried out in the place of Zuccotti, an operation during which 200 persons had been arrested and decided because the manifestants had " violated the law."
Blomberg explained that he had given the order to evacuate the place because it was " a place where people were not coming to protest, but to punish the laws and in some cases to do evil to other persons," because " certain stores had received threats" and residents feared "for their quality of life."
"The evacuation of this morning in the winter has been renewed and demonstrated that the Blomberg Foundation is more interested to defend financial interests than those of the American workers," added the moving door, which accuses the maire of "not respecting the freedom of expression".
"Occupe Wall Street" also indicated that they don't think to organize "growd actions" for Thursday in cooperation with Community organizations and syndicates to meet the two months of protests, which started on 17 September.
Pamela Anderson will be the Vierge Maria in a Noel special television program
At the coast of Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, she will go out in the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" next 1 December
The Canadian Pamela Anderson was the assistant of Tim Allen in "Home Improvement", helped in "Baywatch", lapin in "Playboy", marriage of rock Tommy Lee and now, the acteur and model will be the Vierge Marie's special program of the Canadian Television.
The CTV private channel has announced today that Anderson, in the cotty of the "Crooner" (baladin) Michael Bublé and other famous Canadians, will go out in the "I's a Russell Peters Christmas" next 1 December interpréting a very special Vierge Marie.
CTV has distributed the images of the television program in which Anderson, also known for the spread on the Internet of a private pornographic video in which she appeared with her husbands of this time, the batterer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, appeared as the Vierge Marie, supported in a puppet that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a famous Canadian original come that recently presented a part of the "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" of Charlie Sheen, appeared as Joseph.
On the side of Anderson and Peters, the CTV Special Programme also presents the Canadian Canadian cantor Bublé, who at the end of March mars married the argentin model Luisana Lopilato, which is not himself far from the contradictions.
Received, Bublé called "put" American Kim Kardashian during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan was ridden after the earth’s trembling
The PIB increases 1,5% through home consumption and ends the spirale of decline from March beginning
Since March, the Japanese economy was paralysed, still convaluing after the trembling land devastler that has become nuclear crises, the worse catastrophe of the country of Nipona since the Second World War.
The first estimates of the Government of Tokyo have calculated the material loss to $300,000, a case that, despite the difficult global context, seems to be attracted.
Following three consecutive threshold quarters, the data of the Interior Brut Product between July and September served to finally turn the page: PIB has increased a 1,5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in an annual rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - in addition, the largest rhythm of increase from January to March 2010.
The recovery is partly explained by the recovery of equipment acquisitions to restore the areas disappeared by the land treasury and tsunami afternoon.
In fact, enterprises increased their investment by 1,1 per cent, compared to the decrease of 0.9 per cent of the capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first reduction after six months of non-interrupted increase.
However, the true stimulate of the Japanese economy is not only based on the key-assy impulsion that invites the crisis to consume or reconstruct infrastructures, use infrastructures for wheat crowd.
Japan was especially monitored by the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently represents 60 per cent of the Japanese PIB.
This change increased 1%, increased expenditures on vehicles, travels and dissemination activities.
The stigmate of yen
Tokyo moved to the internal market when yen - the nippon currency - became one of the "refugiant" values elected by investors who fled the debt crisis in the eurozone and the United States's prevision problems, a privileged privilege that is paid as one of the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger division, the products are slighter in the foreign, a serious turn for a country whose economic fleet line is defined by the health of the large technological groups.
Toyota or Sony, for example, have been responsible for their low results between July and September.
While markets continue to seats in the EU devices, the Government of Yoshiko Noda has not lowered the guard.
"The risks that continue, such as the deterioration of certain foreign economies, the impact of Tailand's inventions and the rapid appreciation of yen," reported the secretariat of State for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And actually, perspectives are not all encouraged.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OCDE) mentioned that most Member States have presented in September of the clearest economic acceleration signs.
The indicator who anticipates the inspection points of the global economy has emphasized that the main powers are released.
For this has lowered four decades up to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8.
Eurozone has even been lower than the average, which is at the 100 level, lowering eight decimal points up to 99.13 points.
Athenians again doubts
Daddymus says that the adjustments will be approved, but the keepers will not sign any written commitment
With the prices of the risk-deployed devices and the uncertainty reinstalled in the parks, Greece continues to embrace in the labyrinth which leads to the outcome of the European debt.
The feeling that the "consensus" of the new Hellenic Governance Government is rather imposed by the requirements of Brussels than by a real conviction of political forces starts to be confirmed by the facts.
During the new ministry, Lukas Papadimos reported that there was no alternative for structural reforms and that the period of 100 days in his designation could be short to apply them, the leader of the Conservator New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, would ensure that it would not support the new extinction measures in any case and reiterate its requirement of new elections for the specified date of 19 February.
"The main task of this Government is to apply the decisions of the Summit of 26 October," said Papadimos, when he opened a parliamentary debate yesterday, which will end tomorrow with a confidence vote for the new Executive.
A 24-programme package to stimulate employment, the reform of the disciplinary code of officials and new measures against fiscal evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, the message of Samaras does not denial the doubts of his position: "We are forced to help the Government of transition, but we are not bound to nothing else."
The conservative leader went a further step in its pool than the EU and FMI, organizations that have to deploy the 8,000 Athenians needed with emergency, and clearly said that there would not approve any letter on the implementation of adjustments.
But the European Commission, not yet irritated by the stuff caused by all the referendum of Papandreu, reiterated yesterday that his requirement is firm: it will not deploy aid if the new Government and leaders of the leaders of the Greek leaders are not signed "which is written without ambitions as soon as possible."
The Economic Affairs Port, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that troika's inspectors would return to Athènes to discuss with the new Government 'the "the sixth tranche" of 8,000 million, even if there is no more definitive date.
Greeks have a lot to do.
The Queen Sophia: "These are instruments for progress and hope."
The Queen emphasized the place of Spain as regards this type of finance
Spain 'ha reached a global planned place in the role of Microfinances'.
The Queen Sophia recalled that the country has become in the last two decades the second donor of the planet in respect of this "cooperation instrument" whose "heatness" is a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope in a better future for all humanity, based on trust in human beings."
The Queen has inaugurated the V-e Mondial Summit of Microcredit in Valladolid with the assurance that " there is no doubt" that this type of operations are " absolutely essential" to reach the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations for 2015, and, in particular, in the one who has the aim of reduction to the half of the volume of those who live with incomes under a dollar per day, which is set by the "see of poverty".
Spain "continued to work" to increase the network of recipients "in all parts of the planet, and takes this task with "competence", reported the Queen Sophia, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions of origin during the Summit would be extended until Thursday, "in order to create new capacitys and opportunities for the poorest and especially for women", the main benefiters of these loans.
We have "waits a lot of objectives" and "We do many challenges."
The MicroCredit Summit is considered not only as a for discussion, but also as the platform from which the "toove basic goals" must be impressed.
For example, his Majesty explained that the goal is that 175 million poor families who have accessed to these financial services and that hundred million of those families have gone out of poverty in which they are now living.
The impulsion in the design of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world has followed the starting path a few years ago in a pioneer way" by Muhammad Yunus, emphasized the King Sophia as a "act of justice and recognition two".
And she described the father of this instrument as a "awesome ideal in the universal cause of fight against poverty," the work she had known for 15 years, when the King had seen in Bangladesh to conceal her grounds of loans.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings like those celebrated at the Côte d'Ivoire Côte in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "for each meeting I could find a continued evolution", explained his Majesty, whose relationship with this project has brought to him here the qualification of "family Chef" meeting in Valladolid from the "bancer of the poor".
Finally, the Queen Sophia has concluded its intervention by encourageing those presents to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to progress in the fight against poverty.
"The label"
The Minister of External Affairs, Jimenez Trinity, warned that solidarity " is an Ethic Imperial" for every democratic State.
In this sense, she said that it would be an error to bind cooperation with developing countries in economic prosperity times, because it is a " permanent obligation".
Jimenez believed that microcredits supposed to " a serious and severe policy devoted to the eradication of poverty" and now "more than ever" Governments of developed countries should work under solidarity criteria and leave that is the victim of compression.
For Spain, the microcredit is one of the main lines of development cooperation.
The State Secretariat for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, applauded "the success" to give "of confidence" to those "excluding feed all of the door"; and the sea of Valladolid, France Javier León de la Riva, wished to welcome those presents in a city that "abrised its gates from the solid spirit".
The CDU proposes that the European Chairman should be elected to universal support
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union Congress (CDU), Monday, 14 November, Leipzig, was deployed without real difficult for Angela Merkel, a chance but also the President of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially planned for the programme but was imposed to the automne, including to satisfy warrants who judge the government's policy today and may be Italians tomorrow.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the direction, was adopted to almost one-one animation.
Only 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten were abstended.
The allocation of several minutes to which Angela Merkel was right, then, a few hours later, Wolfgang Schäuble, the very Europhile Minister of Finance, had not left place.
The idea-master of the chance - and motion - stands in a slogan: the answer to the crisis "not less than Europe but more than Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but because "New million jobs are directly depending on the euro".
For the chance, "the time came from a perceive in Europe."
This could be brought by amendments to the Treaty of Lisbon to strengthen the European Union control of the European budget policy of the euro area, but it could also delay on the election of the President of the European Commission to the universal sufficiency "to give a face to Europe."
In any case, one of the proposals for motion adopted by the Congress whose inspirer is clear Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is little likely that the Vingt-Sept agrees quickly on this revolution: the Great Britain is hostile and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is also.
But the jalon's laid down.
The Delegates also rejected a extreme majority the proposal to put each country's weight into the European Central Bank directly due to each economy's weight, which apparently returned to increase the weight of Germany.
It is aware that it was inside its party's climate, the chance has multiplied the references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl but she has no longer tried to win her congress on the two of European competitions or countries in rapid difficulty to criticalize Germany arrogant.
If Europe's motion is a paragraph to the importance of "Free-Lussian friendship", Angela Merkel did not refer to France.
Except skills.
Remembering that two centuries ago, Leipzig was in the heart of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most vulnerable defeats of the Napoleonian army.
What does fraude represent to sick stops?
Following allocations, the UMP and the Government launch the offense on disease stops.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday, 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a case of family accommodations and to speak on the topic - recurring since 2007 - of the fight against social frauds and asistant.
And to accompani this offensive, which is part of a willingness to make economies in a rigour context, but is not less announced of an axis in the right-right president campaign, most wants to focus on disease stops.
First, in a budgetary objective, the Government intends to impose private employees a fourth day of lack before taking a job stop.
Of course, without specific undertaking agreement, a loans that would suffer four days of salary, therefore at least 15% of its monthly income.
A measure that is risking to sustain anger, but that would allow 280 million euros to report, according to the Ignoos.
And who would be accompanied by another measure, more symbolic port: impose to the officials a unemployed day in the case of work ceiling (They are not until now unlimited, against three days in the private).
While these issues are in discussion, most also refers to the thematics of fraude, this time the abuse related to work stops.
"The controls will be much more important and, in addition, if you're taken, you'll reward," said Xavier Bertran at the micro-account on Sunday, 13 November.
As for other cases, announcement effects seems to be unproportional with the reality of fraudes to work stops.
In fact, since 2002, it has been a constant follow-up and political offensive, which have most often brought their fruits.
France is not more sick than in Europe.
Let us first act on national numbers.
In 2006, more than 237 million euros have been released by the National Mediterranean Independence Office (CNAM).
According to the Institute of Health Research and Documentation, newspapers represented in 2008 5 per cent of health expenditures, with EUR 11.3 billion.
On this sum, 46% concerned maternity conceits and unemployment accidents, and 54% were related to disease stops, or 6.2 billions of euros.
So 2.5% of health costs.
In 2010, Français met 14.5 days of work stop, against 17.8 in 2009, according to a study of Alma Consulting Group.
A average that hides some differences: another survey, published in 2007 by the Monster.com Carrier manager site, showed that 75% of the 400,000 French employees had not taken any disease day.
Another study, this time of disease insurance , indicates that in 2010, 37% of the disease stops were less than 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days to a month, 15% of one to three months and 11% later.
When compared to them with their European neighbours, the French employees are not enclosed than the work stops.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001, the total absence rate (for health or non-related reasons) was 10 to 11%, with 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Between drugs to sickness represents very little face to the black work.
With regard to fraude, it is only low.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 results in the systematic controls on disease stops over 45 days.
In 2008, by 1,5 million of controls, UNCNA found that 13 per cent of the 285,000 made for short-term stops were "injustified or too long", or 37,050 cases.
In the case of the arrests over 45 days, systematicly controlled, 11% of cases "inadequate or unjust" of 1,2 million, or 132 000.
In total, 169,000 cases "unjust," for several million employees had a disease stop.
A figure that is well a little face, for example, to the black work.
According to the Dominican Deputy of Tian, the author of a report on the question in June would represent 9 to 15 billion euros of lack to gain tax by year, or more than the total cost of daily compensations, and therefore ultimately more than fraude.
Daddy: Greece must apply a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new Adjustment program to restore its economy.
This is what he said on Monday, 14 November, the first minister, Lucas Papademos, before Parliament, adding that the hundreds of days given to his union government wouldn't suffice to fulfil this task.
"To continue the efforts of recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment program," said the Chief of the Government, which made its first public talking to open the debate on the confidence vote to the Middle Parliament.
The implementation of decisions taken at the Summit of the euro area on 27 October will be the "prioral task" of the new government, since the participation of the country in the euro area "sheet" is added.
Mr. Papadémos therefore planned that the country's public deficit will be reduced "to the 9%" of the BIP at the end of the year, after 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right refuses new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the Leader of the Right, has provided its Monday support to the already approved measures to try to exit the debt crisis, but has predicted that its party would not take place on any additional austerity.
"We will not vote for new measures," said he at a meeting with the members of his party, New Democracy.
It agreed with the objectives of reduction of debt and debt, and to fight gaps but adversary to any policy that would prevent economic recovery.
In Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who predicted that FMI and the EU would not deploy the necessary loan of 8 billion euros without written guarantee of all parties that they would support the measures planned, Antonio Samaras answered that his word was sufficient and would not sign anything under external pressure.
A expert committee must be aligned with ehutania and assisted suicide.
The Canadians live in the decline of death, according to the report of the Canada Royal Society
Concerning Palestinian care, the Committee claims that Governments, health institutions and doctors are working together in order to ensure better Palliative care, and that is, beyond cancer cases.
Canada's society lives in the decree of death.
Only 9 per cent of the Canadians agree to speak in effect with their doctor of the conditions they want to die and take provisions to this effect.
It is one of the conclusions of a taxing report of the Canada Royal Society, which participated in six experts related to different areas, including Ethiopia, the right and the doctor.
The Committee recommends the Government to amend the Criminal Code so that the Criminal Code allows the assisted suicide and the ehutanasia, when this choice is imposed, to a patient responsible to take such decision.
At the entrance of the game, experts include a recent investigation of the Economic Intelligence Unit, which compared the quality of death in 40 countries of the planet.
If Canada has been classified 10th, the study notes that "the medication of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people fear to address the subject of death."
Medicalization or not, 77 per cent of the Canadians have no access to Palestinian care, we report the experts mandated by the Royal Society of Canada.
And despite the desire that most Canadians have to die at home, 68.6% of them end to die in the hospital.
In the whole country, it is Quebec that this rate is the highest rate, with 86% of the dead of hospitals.
On the delicate issue of ehutanasia and the assisted suicide, the authors of the report come to conclusions that are against the position of the Federal Government, which already said not to change the Criminal Code on Euthania and Suscide.
However, in accordance with experts, who also have been revised in all countries where these approaches are legally legitimated or degraded, there is no evidence that this declination leads abuses in the application, i.e. the practice of euthanasia or suicide assisted on non-companied persons or not consent.
On the other hand, he stated at the Jocelyn Down Conference on the report, more cases of these debts would be found specifically in the countries where ehutanasia and asylum asylum are not legitimated.
"The eutanasia is practised in Canada, where it is clearly illegal."
"Aid suicide is conducted in Canada, where he is clearly illegal," explains Jocelyn Down.
Canadians for Euthania
Remember that 85% of the Canadians have already been proclaimed in favour of euthania because they believe that it would allow people to live in order to improve their suffering, according to an Angus Reid sondage in 2010.
And 66% believes that the fact of legitimating ehutanasia will not be to send the message that life of older persons or disabilities is less value.
With regard to persons who practiced suicide, the sounds of 41 per cent should not be pursued.
In the area of maintenance or stop of care with a patient, the situation is less clear, saying the authors of the report.
Therefore, in the list of their recommendations, they suggested that it was indicated in the Criminal Code that the receipt of care for which a legally rejected is not criminal.
The Expert Committee also requests that health professionals should be formed with respect to a refusal of care in the end of life without fear of criminal consequences.
Concerning Palestinian care, the Committee claims that Governments, health institutions and doctors are working together in order to ensure better Palliative care, and that is, beyond cancer cases.
Finally, in the field of Palliative or Terminal seed already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the Committee requests it to be considered, if it is not to reduce physical pain, such as ehutanasia, and to be subject to the same procedures.
Reserve of other experts
Some experts in the field of health law have already issued reservations on the conclusions of the report of experts of the Queen Society of Canada.
Me Peter Deschamps, specialist in the right of health, qualified by "extreme" the position of the signing experts of the report, among other things because it does not limit the practice of ehutanasia to the diseases in terminal phase.
"This opens the door to a situation where everyone who would be disappointed of life and who would have more than 18 years could ask what help we would follow", said I Deschamps, who had consulted a report summary.
I'm also emphasized that the authors of the report seem to place the autonomy of the person above all the other values participating in the social tissue of society.
But, "in society, he says, there are tags and borders."
The Margaret Somerville Health Specialist also expressed " a strong opposition" to the conclusions of the report, which she qualified by "pro-eutanasia's "manifeste".
Margaret Somerville, who itself is a member of the Royal Society of Canada, expresses in particular the report on the lack of abus in some countries where ehutanya and assisted suicide are legitimated, or the Netherlands and Orgon.

Challenges of Bachar al-Assad demonstrated the places of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The diplomatic pressures have been intensified here on the Syrian of Bachar al-Assad, which, with the support of Russia, resistance and impressive a "complete" against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab Ligue, the European Union strengthened its sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbouring Syria, took position for a departure of President Assad.
The King Abdallah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to call for President Bachar al-Assad to "quit the power" in Syria where a quarantine of civilians and members of the regime have been killed.
"If Bachar had in heart the interest of his country, it should be released, but it should also create the conditions necessary for a new phase of Syrian political life," said the King of Jordan, neighbour Syria, in an interview to the BBC.
For its part, the Chief of Turkish Diplomation, Ahmet Davidoglu explained that Turkish mediation efforts had been undertaken since the beginning of the year at the Syrian regime were sold by an echo.
"These who are not in peace in the Middle East with their peoples and can't be satisfied," said he, aligning Syria, near the Turkey's country against which Turkey takes a more harder line.
The United States are a pleasure of a "forcing consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" after the decisions of the Arab Ligue and the European Union.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League, countries such as Turkey take a more hard tone" in the face of repression in Syria, noted Mark Toner, a port of the State Department.
During that time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime died in the region of Deraa, South Syria, announced the Sirian Observer for Human Rights (OSDH).
Two other civilians have lost "overtakings of turts and pioneering to hard merailles in Jobar" in the settled city of Homs, according to this NGO.
During a press conference, the Sirian Minister of Foreign Affairs Walid Mouallem said that the country was "to the end of the crisis."
He also has strongly reacted to the decision of the Arab Ligue to sustain Damascus of his work, which is " dangerous".
Siria "not flood," added, ensured that "the dog compounds against Syria will be echored."
After its decision to sustain Syria, the Arab Ligue has now studied a "made protection mechanism of civilians" and wants to send 500 members of Arab rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Minister of Foreign Affairs, Alain Juppé, also said favourable to send United Nations observers to protect civilians from the repression of the regime in the "paranoia".
A new extraordinary meeting of the League is scheduled tomorrow in Rabat to take the point on the implementation of the crises outcome plan decided on 2 November and, in particular, for the reimbursement of armed forces from cities proceeding to the condemnation and release of arrested demonstrators.
The Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergei Lavrov, judged the decision of the Arab Ligue, while China urged Syria to implement the crisis output plan, while maintaining the support of original sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Montin' request for time for the markets and sacrifices to Italy
The future Chief of the Italian Government, Mario Monti, called for the markets to form and implement a programme, which will contain "holy sacrifices" to recover the loss of the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner was in discussion with the political parties yesterday before I meet the unions and the patronat today.
It should establish a relatively limited cabinet composed of external technicians in the Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a important programme with many sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, deputed by one of the many small parliamentary groups involved in entrepreneurs, after having met the President of the Council designed.
The President of the Chamber of the Deputy Chamber Gianfranco Fini said to wait for what Mario Monti asks for sale a confidence vote to the Parliament to ensure that the new Government has sufficient support.
The consultations will be concluded by the presentation by Mr. Monti of a restricted list, unlikely of a tenth of ministers, the head of the State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented the nervousness of the busy and obligatory markets yesterday, asking them time.
In "Democracy, there are specific times" to prepare a government and its program, he stressed, "certainly the markets will be patient and understanding."
His appointment by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but the survey resumed the above, inter alia after an unexpected fall of the industry in the euro area in September.
The Prime Minister should be a technological technological technological technological team, even if he emphasised that he would like and include "politics".
The new government must continue until 2013, on the date of the next legislative, assigned.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputys, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive the trust of the Parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monti, once the work was in the emergency and in the purpose of Italy 'redeviana protagonist' in Europe.
A European Commissioner Olli Rehn emphasized that "with a new government, our diagnostic on the Italian economy does not change."
The EU is convinced that Rome will not meet its budget balance objective in 2013, despite the plans of austerity adopted by the last months, in particular requested new rigour measures.
The Italian Emma Marcegilla, who will see it on Tuesday, also stressed the need to resolve the economy, "for a country that does not have growth cannot respect the parameters of deficit".
Mr. Monti, referring to his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "time change" for Italy after 17 years of "berlusconsism", the "professor" symbolizes the "the challenge of the serious" and "And Italy", according to the editionallists.
The unrecognised great will be its team's long.
The President of Napolitan would like to avoid an anticipated elections, since Italy must place from April 2012 for 200 billion euros of State obligations.
A Russian scientist helped the Irish Nuclear Programme
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, helped Iran to develop a useful detonator with nuclear weapons, said Monday a American NGO specialized in the atomic risk.
The International Science and Security Institute (ISIS) is based on the recent report of the International Atom Safety Agency Agency (AIEA) and other documents from the United Nations Agency to identify that researcher.
The IAEA has participated last week of its recent concerns about an "posible military size" of the Iranic Nuclear Programme.
According to ISIS, the widely in the AIEA documents, Mr. Danlinko, born in 1934, would work for three decades since 60 years in a Soviet Military Centre in Tscheliabinsk (Oural), and would be involved in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would leave the center to establish a company produced by "nano-diamants" in Kiev.
The economic difficulties of his society would lead to contact Iran's Ambassade in Ukraine in 1995.
He would then cooperate in the Irish programme from 1996 to 2002 before he returned to Russia.
In its last report, the AIEA said "the strong indications that the development through Iran" of a nuclear detonation system has been assisted by the work of a foreign expert, which did not only know this technical, but that, as a Member State has informed the Agency, has worked during the most important career of his career on this technology within the military programme of its country of origin."
The crimes and crimes of anti-musulmans have increased 50 per cent.
The crimes and crimes against musulmans have increased from approximately 50 per cent of 2009 to 2010, while other racial and religious violence had slightly lowerly lowerly lowered or few progressed, according to the State statistics of the Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of musulmans prevented violence was of 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, 49 per cent of an increase in 13 per cent of Catholic violence, 4 per cent of the infringements against Jews and 14 per cent of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "family crims" has been very lightly increased to 6,628 cases, including 47.3% motivated by race differences and 20% by religion differences, according to the FBI.
"Over a decline in 2009, it was attempting to see these crimes and crimes to increase again," stressed the human rights organization, “the increase in anti-musulman violence is particularly significant”, added the organization to a communication.
"Human Rights First has long emphasized that violence against musulmans and all forms of hatred crimes must be considered as a serious violation of human rights," adds one of the officials of the organization, Paul Legendre.
"The American government can and must do more to attack these abuses," he added, considering that this could lead to an improvement of the police reports on the "nood crims".
"Hamily criteria" in the Federal Law of the US is a heritage of the time of combating civil rights.
This legislation was adopted after the death of Martin Luther King to punish violences related to race, skin, religion, origin and now sexual behaviour.
Twitter changes its platform and looks like Facebook
The micro-blogging Twitter site has introduced Monday changes in the presentation of its platform, in particular to enable users to observe the activities of those who follow, which makes its service a little more than the Facebook service.
A new "activity" tab and another "name" allows the activities of other "Twittos" directly to follow the "tweets" and those who follow you.
This allows you to know if they follow messages, if they are subscribed to new accounts, if they have favorite messages, etc.
This new form of Twitter was tested "On a small percentage of users in August" before being distributed to the whole Monday network, AFP stated the Twitter port, Carolyn Penner.
Twitter, who was known for his little institutional function, with some few spams (RT to redirect a message from one another, #followfriday to recommend follow another user) with the happiness of the initiatives, then opens to a broader public with a more manual comparable to the great public networks Facebook and Google+.
On the network, users at the same time discussed the interest of this innovation.
"It's unnecessary, weakening, and it looks too much like Facebook", wrote @jemb123.
"The Activity functionality will help me follow some of my Twitter flux," sent@dannykronstrom.
Austria
Registration of a "or rule" in the Constitution
The Government of Great Social and Democracy/Christian Coalition in Austria decided to include a "good Rule" in the Constitution to reduce public deficits and therefore avoid a eventual degradation by the notice agencies of Austria's sovereign note (A).
It is the social and democratic chance Werner Faymann who has even announced this decision at the outcome of a ministerial Council, while Australian public debt is 74.6%, largely above the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly under the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvibility was declined only from one cran from AAA to AA+, we should have paid three billion euros of interest in more than every year," said the Vice-Christian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Michael Spindlegger.
Austria therefore follows the request of the Summit in Brussels of the European Area Member States of 26 October last: the Heads of State and Government had then claimed the registration of the end of 2012 on the reduction of public deficits and return to the balance of public accounts in the Constitution or in the Law of Local Value.
The system adopted by the Austrian Government is approached by the German model, which has been the first European country to adopt such "related" rules.
Since 2017, the structural public deficit will decrease each year of 0.75% of the gross domestic product (PBB) and, from 2017, the structural public deficit of the Federal State shall not exceed each year 0.35% of the PIB, while regional States and communities should present budgets in balance.
The goal is to take the public debt to the Maastricht Treaty's 60% criteria.

Noda threatens a new change market intervention
The Japonian Prime Minister, Yoshiko Noda, predicted on Tuesday that nippones authorities would return to the change market if they had to continue up.
"We will interfere as we did the last time if we find an overwhelming birth" in the yen change rate, Mr Noda to Senate explained.
On Tuesday, yen was not far from the historical levels that had made the Japanese authorities to intervene on 31 October.
This day, Tokyo sold massively yens against dollars to disappear the value of the Nippon Division that was to establish a new power record since 1945 faces the green bill.
However, yen has been regularly remonted since, doubled by investors' purchases that consider it as a "refugied value" in these uncertain times of global economic acceleration and income crisis in Europe.
The dollar is perished on Friday under 77 yens, and the euro is down under the symbolic bar of 105 yen, nearly the levels of the last intervention.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was about 120 euros and more than 160 euros.
This flat of the magazine nippons the exports of the archipelines because it reduced the cost of Made products in Japan and reduces the value of the income from the foreigners by the Japanese firms when they converte them into national currency.
"Japan fighting to rebuilt" since seisism and the tsunami of 11 March, which destroyed the Tohoku region (Noord-East), said Mr. Noda, which fears that this re-employment of yen would not be killed in the eye of the refreshment.
The third world economic power has renewed growth at the third quarter -1.5% compared to the previous quarter for the first time in one year, through a increase in export and consumption of disappearances.
But the Prime Minister judged that the yen crowd was not "the basic economics of Japan".
The Minister of Finance, Jun Azumi, for its part called the Japanese Bank (BoJ), which opened a meeting of two days of its monetary policy advice, to take all possible measures to enhance the yen.
But the adjoint Govern of the Institution, Hirohide Yamaguchi, provided that BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", while hearing that any additional monetary deployment was not to wait in mercury.
At its last meeting final October, the emission Institute increased from $5,000 billion (47 billion) its acquisition of goods from the Turkey, through 55,000 milliards of euros (519 billion) the amount of the amount it grants to the purchase of different financial provisions to include the liquidity market.
Euro area:
ranking rates, the Bourses flanchent
The risk of condemnation of the debt crisis is always the European indexs.
Despite the appointment of new government leaders in Greece and Italy and better growth numbers in France and Germany, the rates of fragilised countries continued.
The European Borses are always worried about the stability of the euro area, which is a little more negative territory on Tuesday 15 November.
In Paris, at 10 a.m. CAC 40 lost 1,4% to 3.064 points.
The Dax in Francfort is 0.4% and London 0.1%.
" With the new tensions on the performance of the euro area's loans in difficulty, action markets around the world continue to make part of their recent gains ".
"The investors, nervous, are just too aware of the condensation risk," explains Terry Pratt, the court of institutional at the IG Markets, which is town by the Reuters Agency.
Tokyo's Bourse was decreased by 0.7 per cent, suffering the renewed fears of the market interventions on Europe's capacity to contain the debt crisis.
"Japon, as the rest of the world, has slightly eye on Europe and exchange will continue in a close corridor of changes as long as investors will not have evidence that the situation is established ", believes Mitsushige Akino, managing funds in Iiyoshi Investment Management.
This inquiry of concerns about the future of the euro area penalizes the unique currency, which continues to decrease on Tuesday.
The euro is at its lower level for a month and half.
To 10h, the European currency is $1,3570, in reply to 0.4%.
According to the courts, she returned the party of Angela Merkel, the CDU, meeting in the Monday Congress, adopted a motion which, in particular, provides the opportunity for a country in difficulty to leave the euro area without so far to leave the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates over 6%
The rates of immigration in Italy and Spain remain at very concerned levels.
This morning, the performance of the Italian obligations at 10 years reached to 6.85%, the Spanish titles of the same maturity 6.2%.
These tensions on the interest rates of Southern countries, but also in France, continue to eat the fear of stakeholders.
The Chief of the future Government of the Italian Mario Monti called for the market time to restore the situation in Italy, threatened by asphyxie by the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said that the implementation of decisions taken during the euro area on 27 October would be the " main task " of his Government.
Spain is found in the market view line, while it takes Sunday legislative elections in the country.
The rate difference ("display") between 10 years in Germany and Spain has reached a new higher history.
At the expectation of the euro area growth figures
Statistical costs, France has registered economic growth of 0.4% to the third quarter, or a little better than 0.3% expected by female consumption.
However, Inseas revised the number of the second quarter, with a reduction of 0.1% of the gross domestic product (PIB) instead of an fluctuation.
And, it's actually the fourth worried about the most economics.
Germany, on its side, recorded a growth of 0.5% in the same period.
A first estimation for the entire euro area is expected at 11.00 p.m. while the European Commission is to take care of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
The facts must import it on dogms
If it is a question that it can not be addressed from short terms or under the emotion, it is the energy policy.
Availability and electricity costs directly affect the purchase power and the competitiveness of enterprises.
It is healthy that an electional render is the opportunity to think about such injuries and the place of the nuclear.
The debate will only be fruitful if the whole economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options will be examined.
The French must focus their opinion on objectives and rational data.
While we're seven billion humans on the planet, the demographic evolution will lead to a double demand for the electricity from this to 2050, less than take a huge part of the world's population of a vital element.
At the same time, the reduction of fossil resources should be paid to continue produce electricity in continuity, without forgeting the improving need to reduce serre gas emissions to combat climate disorders, a subject lost from the environmental debate.
The incident of Fukushima does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains isolated in its decision to reject nuclear.
This is not the case or Belgium, which submits its need to find a source of replacement capable of being replaced, or Switzerland, which just means to build only the past generation centres.
Inverse, Britain, Finland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil, to cite only them, continue to define their projects.
The United States decided after Fukushima to add a unit to their park by recovering the construction of an interrupted central after the accident of Three Mile Island.
If the German model, focused on renewable energy, sometimes is presented as an example, the reality contrarys the discours.
Berlin's election will be delivered by the reinforcement of the electricity price, an energetic dependence accredited by the increased gas resource, particularly Russian, a bond of CO2 emissions income by the construction of central gas and carbon.
In a few months, all of these fucking effects are already feeling.
The case of Denmark is to mediate.
Europe's Champion of the 'Eolian Champion, with 30% of its electricity, is also one of the largest carbon and gas users of the fact of the wind intermitting; in this regard, its CO2 emissions and its electricity price are 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
Inverse, through the condition of our energy policy, our neighbours acquire an electricity factor of more than 40% than the French female.
While in a globally globalized economy the energy cost is a key factor of competitiveness and a manage of industrial tool maintenance in the national territory, French enterprises benefit from the least chronic Europe's electricity.
In fact, any significant reduction of the part of the nuclear would generate a strong increase in the electricity price, which would make the beautiful statements on the reindustrialization of our country and the defence of the purchase power.
A large majority of French refuses to pay, since they do not demonstrate principle opposition to this energy, the dreams show it.
We recall that energy policy in our country has allowed the construction of an industrie of 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 employees.
It is strongly exporting, which leads to specialized PME on international markets and makes them very unlocalized jobs.
If France had decided to go out of the nuclear, it would be to sacrify a good number of these PM by reducing the 6 billion euros of French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electric would an EPR commanded to operate sixty-yearly while the decline of his manufacturer would be programmed?
To solve energy equation, it must be admitted that there is no source of the production of "electricity wonder, no more than diabolic.
The development by the area of small electrical CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions, shows the complementality of energy sources.
For nuclear, maintaining the highest level of security is an absolute improving.
In France we have a security Authority that performs an intensive and transparent control on existing centres such as the Flamanville Scanner.
Our teams, whose professionalism is recognized, are used of the same obsession of security.
In a half-seventh, the nuclear industry has known three serious accidents.
One, Three Mile Island, is involved in normal operating conditions; it is left without human or environmental consequences.
In Tchernobyl, the design of the reactor and the unfair human offences caused drama.
In Fukushima, some appear to forget that the accident resulting from two natural disasters of an unprecedented breach that caused the death of ten thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will draw up the teachings of this accident, as she did for the two previous ones.
The EPR offers a design to make it capable of rescue to such phenomenon.
While it is considered by all electrics to build a central, the stop of its construction in Flamanville would be a great cadeau offered to Areva and EDF concurrents by laying their free way to leadership in the unconturbable nuclear development.
It is necessary and legitimate to search for the best energy bucket for our country, but it would be unrepensable to leave the "emotion, dogms and parties managers to control a decisive debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Is the immigration a charge or a chance for the economy?
The immigration policy under Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticised under various Englishs - integration of police, judicial and administrative services subject to the figure policy, compatibility of this policy with the "autoproclamed state of human rights" in France.
Recently, this is the administrative harcade of which the foreign students have made the newspaper, the Minister of Interior (leaving Liberation of 23 May) proclaims that France "not needs for foreign talents, mass and restaurant servers".
But she is only rarely analyzed under the economic angle.
There is a sufficiently wide consensus between the left and the right.
On the right, you were given by James Chirac who explained in 1976 that "900000 unemployed should not be a problem in a country understood by about 2 million immigrated workers" and on the left, by Michel Rocard explaining that France " cannot welcome all the world's misforture" in 1990.
The only difference, the level of generosity
In 2005, the fear of the invasion of the national territory was divided to the left in the right.
For both sides, immigrants are acquired as a charge for the French economy and society.
The only difference remains at the level of generosity that the immigrants will be granted.
In its program, François Holland cancels banks, noting that the codevelopment will allow our " migratory problem" to solve.
This idea of immigration as a charge, a problem, may be electrically paying; but it is economicly very costful.
As it reminds Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron's economics in a recent work that synttheses the most recent knowledge of immigration (Exceptional people: How Migration7/d Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a great consensus between the specialists on the positive impact of economic growth, salary and employment of immigrants.
Retain anemic immigration to growth and night to employment.
The fears regarding the impact of migrants are based on the idea that they are risking to substitute national workers, particularly few qualified, with a pression on their loans.
But the experience shows that immigrants are in fact much more additional than substitutes to national employees, which is essential for employment in employment percentage sectors.
Poor qualified immigrants work in sectors that do not affect national employees, and the most qualified in dynamic sectors in which training does not follow employment.
A positive effect on salary
In the same way as a chirurgian will have to work in a country that knows a penalty of anestists, these complementarities between national and migrants make that immigrants have a positive effect on the wages and the employment of nationals.
John Peri calculated that an increase in 1% migratory flows leads to an increase between 0.6 and 0.9% of the real long-term salary.
And this does not take into account the fact that the diversity provided by immigrants contributed to the creation of ideas and economic growth (the cost of naturalised immigrants between the Nobel American prices; Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo have been founded by immigrants).
Migrants are also networked of social systems, average of 1% of the total budget in the European countries.
For example, the World Labour Organization believes that in Germany a immigrant in the age of 30 years will provide a net contribution of 150000 euros to the average public budgets throughout its life.
Nicolas Sarkozy wanted, at the beginning of the mandate, to go looking for the growth point "with the dents".
The dents concerned, using immigrant dissuader, have had an inevitable effect.
Europe has discovered democracy, remaining thinking of European democracy
Democracy is a good good good; it is also a fraud.
The European continent should be able to remember him who, for her invented in Athènes over two thousand years ago, knew the tragedias of the Great Guerre, totalitarisms, Holocaust, the goulag, but also France, Portugal, the colonals in Greece.
Some have been able to believe that it would suffice, so that the democracy of the triumphhat finally of his enemies, to execute the vote, and to execute it in the most direct manner that is.
We know, since Napoleon "the Petit" is a easy idea.
The universal sufficiency, to be the necessary condition of democracy, is not sufficient and may even be made "oppression instrument", as the Republic philosoph of Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy needs more: a public space, a public spirit, values, organization, division and control of powers, education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
Europe's crisis that we live is a economic crisis, but it is so much and first a crisis of political and democracy.
The Greek real refinanced Palinody will have in this respect the value of double revealing: the need for a powerful return of the policy, but also the feeling that it is incomprehensive.
This ambiguity must be thought to be overcome.
The truth is that the lines on front of the democratic fight today have been moved, and that, for many of them, the Republician soldiers no longer go into the right direction.
We have nothing to win to require a success of national referendums, organized with the needs and in order.
A absolute European monastery or a feet withdrawn in the empty national reply: what choice for the citizen!
No, we don't want to cut off but a common, full, right, seren and continually, of the choice and democracy at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, any more, where to stop the "numberation - because there is only a crisis, and it is in Europe.
This is the whole Europe, which is greater than the market dictators and notation agencies, which suffers of its impoisibility and of its absence of solidarity.
This is all Europe that is humilied on the international scene.
It is concerned of the transfer of sovereignty to Europe - but it is all Europe who is quite slowly lost his sovereignty, and with her every one of its nations.
The emergency is to return to the popular sovereignty to the piloting of the European project.
Because it is together that Europeans can reduce their debt weight, free markets and prepare the future in investing.
The crisis outcome will take decisions at the European level that can not be taken without a complete democratic legitimacy, unless we are sure to lead to disaster.
After long fighting this proposal by socialists and by James Delors, everyone today calls for the European Economic Government.
Come on.
But thinking about it without a stronger political and democratic integration, and lived as the citizens, would be a new fool and a new impairment.
We must take a new stage of European construction.
In order to make the Republic in France, it has been "fair" of the Republics.
The revolution in interests could not suffice.
This lection remains valid.
We need to build a more integrated economic Europe.
This can only be done by building a more democratic Europe on the political plan, a real European population sovereignty.
For Europe, let's do Europeans.
The cards to push "uncontact" are generalised
The world salon of the fridge card opens on Tuesday, near Paris, in an optimistic climate.
In 2011, 11% of the world-wide sales of microprocessor cards (bank card, SIM card with SIM...) should actually be acquired to more than 6 billion units, according to the Eurosmart Cabinet.
The most portrait segment is the one of the technology without contact that allows to pay common transports or to regulate its purchases by just approximately approving the card of a reader.
This year, 460 million cards without contact should be sold through the world, against 320 million a year early!
Their part should still continue in 2012 (580 million expected units) and represent approximately 10% of the global card market (6.925 million).
During the transition of the Asian and Pacific region, Europe wins the field for payment without contact.
Some 26 million bank cards Visa are already equipped with this function and 75,000 final payment cards accept it.
In France, the starts are more modest: 400,000 without contact Visa have been deployed.
But the big surfaces put the double bottles.
Carrefour also issued this year 2.5 million cards Pass MasterCard without contact.
To go through the upper speed, the banks now need to teach their customers.
"The large French institutions have been engaged to disseminate the future to their clients of bank cards equipped with the free contact", announced Gérard Nébouy, Director-General Visa Europe France.
Banks test the mobile payment
But this is only a first step towards the future payment means: the mobile phone.
Many devices are today equipped with NFC technology (Now Field Communication) in order to perform transactions.
"They took the late."
"But they should finally know a real expert the next year."
"Our tables on sale from 80 to 120 million in 2012," says Marc Bertin, President of Eurosmart.
But the banks take the fronts.
The Agricultural Credit announced the launch of a test from December to June next to Caen.
The iPhone of some 200 clients and collaborators will be equipped with a study authorising payment without contact.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the General Society also said to prepare the marketing of a offer for its customers to pay without contact with their mobiles.
From Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front extends
Paris is concerned about the links between al-Qaida to Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
Long date suspicioned, the links between the terrorist group al-Qaida to Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the negeniaine Boko Haram sect are confirmed.
Sunday, Algerian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Abdelkader Mesahel, has even stated that Alger now has "acquired security".
"The way the two organizations work and the reports of the education services show that there is a good cooperation", explained.
Paris seems to make a similar analysis.
The investigation on the rapt of two French to Niger in January last would have made passengers on the day.
Kidnapped in a restaurant of Niamey by nearby Aqmi, Antoine di Léocour and Vincent Delory had to be killed the next day as many of their advisors during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the numbers of the intervention, French and Nigeria investigators had to find several telephone pushes from terrorists.
Terrorism
The analysis of the eastern calls to several interlocutors based on Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers are particularly interested in investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who lived long in Maiduguri, a north city of Nigeria, Boko Haram's beach and the other to a man who says near Aqmi and the sect.
"It is an advance, but we must certainly wait for more formal evidence before talking about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram."
"But it's possible."
"We know for many years that the sect benefits from external and intellectual support and that it is more active," the modern Kunle Amuwo, Nigerian researcher.
In the past months, these "subsidies" were even more clear in Boko Haram's evolution and discourses and in its opérative modes, which are now involved the use of comics or explosive engines of more comprehensive and same factory as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting by Washington, has thus made pressure on Abuja to take into account the problems raised by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have long considered the group as a little worthy of interest.
Quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a muscular school and the fundamentalist Mohammed Joseph, Boko Haram - which means "Western education is a sin" - ready to establish an islamic emirat in the north Muslim of Nigeria.
In this poor region, association has a fast success.
It is politics and requires a severe respect for the chariot while his military forced fight against the wicked central government.
These are first seen churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram warrants are particularly active, multiplying attacks against commissioners.
Abuja's response is, as usually, without nakedness.
The army invested the city, accounting 800 dead.
Mohammed Joseph, alive arrest, is killed in prison.
Since the sect will be radiated and leave its fifs from the north.
In the last Christ, she returns an attack that makes 80 dead to Jos, then another to Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram is still in Abuja, who took it to the police's secured QG during a suicide attack, his first.
In August, the United Nations seat will be its first international objective.
The establishment of a terrorist axis in Africa which would be shipping from Mauritania to Somalia by the Nigeria is concerned now of all security experts.
While Aqmi invested Mali and Niger, the Somalians of Al-Cheba operated in Kenya, Boko Haram appears as a new threat to the heart of the continent.
The last week, in a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé kept up against Boko Haram and was ready to share all the information.
The world in accordance with the Republical candidates to the Presidency
On China, on Iran, on the help to Israel, Middle Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry are simplism and misconsciousness.
A America, which is a crisis, can she manage a comprehensive world with simple, simply simple ideas?
To listen to the Republical presidential candidates, the elections could believe it.
Since a few days, Middle Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and others multiplying tonitruating statements and foreign policy raccources, traditionally a strong Republic.
On China, on Iran, on the help to Israel, the unemployed slogans often slogans.
Mitt Romney, the best placed in the course of the appointment of the "Grand Old Party", urged the Chinese to the WHO and put them on "for the manipulation of their currency," a porteur in America exacerbated by the migration of all pans from its industry to Asia.
As soon as it should involve the decrease of a commercial war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Ambassador in China of Obama and only candidate to have a view of sophisticated foreign policy, has failed to enhance himself with an attitude that "flows" emotions.
He called to a muscle but constructive dialogue with Pékin (the current position of Obama).
But Huntsman, who smells in the deeps of the songs, remains unaudible.
On Reagan's image
Romney also promised military flags on Iran to stop its nuclear programme.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran, would he be fantastic."
"If Obama is real, they'll have the bomb."
He also promised an increase in military assistance to Israel, accusing Obama to deal with its obligations in respect of the partner.
Herman Cain, the second candidate, the best placed, shows him about an impressive meconnaissance of folders.
Received, he called to anticipate Chinese military threat because Pékin 'stempt to develop nuclear capacity' - apparently noted that China had the military atom since 1964!
The Texan Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants battle against Iran, was ready to join the American army to Mexico against drug cards.
The use of torture against presumed terrorists, prohibited by Obama in 2009, is also before Cain, Perry and the candidate Michele Bachmann.
We are far from the Republican candidate in 2008, John McCain, a hard weight in foreign policy.
The adversary of the current President reflect that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he gained the cold war.
They remember Obama himself was a friend and he had to put water in his wine to anterrorism.
They argued with reason on the exchange of his naïf dialogue with Iran, on the start too slow of the "boys" of Iraq, on his territorys in Libye, with a low label.
But the attack isn't so awesome.
The population is rather positively judged the national security balance of Obama, which was eliminated by Ben Laden.
Since Iraq, military interventions leading to enlargement.
And, considering that we need to rebuilding America economicly to resurrect his leadership, Obama is more accurate.
North Stream, new Russian gas door in Europe
The north Stream Gaoduc, directly linking Western Europe to Russia through the foundation of the Baltic Sea, was entered into service.
It must provide gas for the equivalent of 30 million foyers.
Gazprom, the Russian giant guest, wanted to celebrate the event with elat.
More than 500 inviteds whose four heads of State and Government participated on the Baltic borders, between orchester and buffet final, at the inauguration of the North Stream, the new gas, which directly relaxed under the sea, Russia to Germany.
Symbolically, the German chance Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, the first French Minister François Fillon and his homologgue of the Netherlands Mark Rutte turned together from the valley commanding the entry of Russian gas into the eastern European network.
With this new gas, 27.5 billion cubes of Russian gases will be reached every year in Western Europe by a first tube of 1 224 km from Saint-Petersbourg region in the Mediterranean country.
A second tube must be completed in the end of 2012, with a view to exempting a total of 55 billion cubes metres of gas, or the equivalent of all French consumption.
And we already have an opportunity to build it a third on the same way.
For Gazprom, the finish in time and at the time of this huge singer has victory airs.
The project was strongly contested by Poland and Baltes countries.
The North Stream will enable direct gas delivery into Germany by avoiding any land transition through a third country (Pologna or Ukraine).
Thus, these two countries lost some of their power, and it is more difficult for them to think about Russia, in order to close the access to the eastern European markets.
In the strongest discussion, Varsovie had not been able to compare the North Stream to a " new German-sovic Pact " in relation to the Hitler and Staline covenant to occupate Poland in 1939.
That's how to say if the subject is politically sensitive.
The West Europe, while supporting this Russian project, has gained a greater security of its appreciations.
But it is the price of a relaxation of energy Europe, as the project created a broke between East and West Europeans.
Russia has, in five years without prejudice, triumphed its vision of direct covenant between Russia and the rich Western countries, strong gas consumption, and the gains are declined.
"This gasoduc is a component of our partnership with Russia, it is a new art that links us in organic way," confirmed François Fillon by inauguring this gas, demonstrating what the large gas contracts are both political and economic.
All this explains the widespread sorrows shown by the Guidelines of Gazprom, presents in Lubmin at Gazprom at the point of arrival.
The construction of this gas is also a technical operator.
The submarine tube is winning beton acier to protect it against the boats' angles.
He stays on the base of the sea, 200 m in medium.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mine fields from the Second World War.
" A hundred had to be removed or destroyed by precaution " , indicates Jens Müller, the North Stream company.
It should also be multiplied to protect fauna and flower.
The tube is a long metal serpent, hard like 242 Eiffel tours, that nothing stops over its length: nor valve, nor maintenance station.
A control platform was planned on the width of Sweden, but the managers of the project refused it while the Sweden was little desired to see a Russian State society permanently set up on their coasts.
"In case of avary, we stop the transmission of the gas at least one minute," specific Jens Müller.
In case of escape, the gas contained in the gas is therefore escaped in the air.
But this case is a little likely judged by the constructors who have planned suspicions to know a escape every 100 000 years.
The monitoring of the status of the gas is ensured by a sub-marin robot, translated by a ship, for external observation, as well as by a device that circulates within the gas.
The form of a cigarette, it is entered within the tube, wide of a diameter meter, and it is posed by the gas.
In the coming, after three complete travel days to the speed of 3 second metres, he provides specific information on the metal deformations.
The gas has been designed to operate 50 years without having the less repair.
The gas movement is simply secured by pressure.
It's from 200 bars at the start, and from 100 to the arrival.
Five companies have one of their forces to achieve this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which keeps 51% of the parts.
The Germans E.ON and BASF are joined (15.5% each) as well as the Dutch Gusunia and the French GDF Suez Group (9% each).
These five companies have created a common company named North Stream, responsible for build and operating the gas.
It has her seat in Zoug, in Switzerland, where the imposition is specially favourable.
Gazprom then lodged this company for twenty-year renewable, the total of gas transport capacity.
" Gazprom pays for the total capacity, which is the amount of real transported gas ", specifically Jens Müller.
The financing of gas construction was 30 per cent of the assets and 70 per cent of banking loans.
The total cost of work should reach EUR 7,4 billion for the two tubes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has risen to 240 million.
But minority actionnaires are sure to return in their costs, since only Gazprom takes the risk.
The gas is emerging from the Baltic in Lubmin, on a sharply piece-planed litoral.
Valves, high of 4.5 metres, strengthen the gas output door.
Captors measure pressure, temperature and specialities of gas that happens before it is transferred into German gases.
Since Tuesday, this terminal receives a million metres of Russian gas cubes every hour.
In full capacity, this will be 3 million per hour and in 2012, 6 million.
Moleskine, a brand card.
A 15 years ago by an Italian company, the Moleskine wants to reward the sight of writing.
He has a parfum of aventures, of hours past to write in the light of a bougie.
The Moleskine card is easily recognisable, with his black rectangular cover, his elastic, its sheets of a white colour, as old by time.
However, the Moleskin card as you know today is born in 1997.
The Italian mode mode company, based on Milan, decides to launch a designed but different note card.
Maria Sebregondi, then adviser for the company, is charged by launching the new product.
The card is inspired by an old production technique, the skin skin skin pool, which designs a Trunn Coton used to cover banks for example.
This type of card was very captured by writers and travelers.
"Meleskine gave a old and forgotten object, which was a icon of the before-gardist artists, until the XX century," says Mary Sebregondi, being made since the license of the mark in mode mode.
The success is here.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26 per cent for 12.7 million amounts.
It is far from the first years of confidence production, where only 3 000 cards were designed.
Moleskine exceeds Italian borders and exports in 70 countries from France to the United States.
It is difficult to establish a buyer portrait, because the notes cards are also seized by businessman and students and professionals.
On the image of Moleskine, his consumers are cosmopolits, opens of spirit and worshipped.
The small Italian undertaking, which contains 12 employees at its beginning, has already been 100 and has been available since 2008, one in Milan and the other in New York.
It distributes its cards in the libraries, from the Fnac to the small center-ville butics and imposed its identity.
"We followed the air of time and the new need for writing, despite the e-mails, explains Mary Sebregondi.
This cultural signature meets Moleskin' development: recently, the mark launched a Detour Exhibition where architects or artists express their own cart.
In August, she also launched a leopard cover at the time of the Locarno film festival.
From its success and this will be cultural, Moleskine has diversified its products: sacs, agenda, stylos, computer housings... The brand is described on a whole gamme of support.
A successful success: in August 2006, Modem was earned by the SG Capital Europe Capital Investment Fund, today Syntegra Capital, writeing a new page in Moleskine history.
Why is the unemployment rate of employees with disabilities so high?
Over 19% of persons with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th week for employment of disabilities is opened today.
Despite a voluntary public policy set up in 2005, the rate of unemployed persons with disabilities is twice higher than the average: 19%, against 9% for the entire population.
Defendant?
"No, emphasized Eric Blanchet, Director-General of Adapt, the association organized by the week for the employment of disabilities."
" progress achieved for 15 years are significant. "
"In the time, the unemployment rate was not two but three times higher."
"Again, it remains still extreme to do."
For disabilities with disabilities, barriers remain a lot before accessing employment.
They are more aged: 37% have more than 50 years (17% in medium).
They have a lower high quality level: 80% are not the bath and over 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabilities.
Finally, long-term unemployment is very expanded: 53% for disabilities, against 38% in medium.
Bref, as many criteria that are individually compliant to employment, which " are the novel of the problem " , according to Christian Grapin, the Director-General of Tremplin, in 1992 to help enterprises in recruiting with disabilities.
This is for the trial of the goals.
Stay the non-dit, the mentalities that develop, of course, but too slow.
A study held in April by the IMS-Introduction Association indicated that the managers concerned have " low knowledge of disabilities " with a " superpresentation of road chains, psychic or intellectual deficiencies " .
The result is that the private enterprises of more than 20 employees are still far to achieve the employment objective of 6% of unemployed employees, as set out in a... 1987 law.
The latest known figures from 2008 are 2.6 per cent.
"We are now around 3 per cent "," says Peter Blanc, Director-General of the Agephif, the body responsible for collecting the contributions of enterprises that do not respect this law.
The evidence: the number of " taxed institutions, as well as the versed amounts, reduced between 2007 and 2011, over 59 000 and 46 000 structures (and 606 to 480 million euros).
" The 2005 Act, which increased contributions, created a strong pressure on enterprises, explains Peter Blanc " .
"But this improvement also translates a genuine conscience, particularly in the larger groups."
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59 per cent of employees from 20 to 49 employees are employed with disabilities, against 82 per cent of the undertakings from 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "What you have goodness."
Before faces Bleus Tuesday (20:45) Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens haven't hidden the pleasure that friendly match.
It will not be written until there was conniveness between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting on the coast of the Auditary of France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have made peace and well.
Five months after the humor of his attack against Turkey, the Belgian elector has only elections to do about it.
"I am very glad about Eden, his progress and the fact that it is Belgian."
"I want to go before," assure the Lilois on her side.
With regard to the contrast between its supplies in club and selection, "is it all, is it justified."
"A Lille, I'm all the year, that's not the case with Belgium."
"I need to take my brands."
Meaned against Romania on Tuesday in view of this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "briller".
However, without forget the idea of "plaising".
The Bleus encouraged them since the age of 7 and the victory campaigns 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been supporting," said he.
In fact, it is involved in enhance the "particular" character of this meeting.
On the face, " there's a Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", rape it.
"They have grown all at the time."
"You could play against them, it's only luck!"
With goodhomie, Leekens has evoked the "fiety".
"Feded" to discuss "a gala game."
"Freated" also to find - in quality of "vice" - that France has "hereded a very high-level team" a little more than one year after Knysna traumatism.
"Laurent White made a tonnner work," he enthusiased.
While Belgium missed the next Euro, the technicians would be well shared with the Bleus direction, Brazil in 2014.
"Our small Belges become big," said he.
"They are now to build something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry."
"You will take it into account at the next matches." He included France.
Portugal is very confidence
The Portuguese of Paulo Bento is close with a lot of optimistics his barrier back to Bosnia (22:00), this Tuesday in Lisbon.
The two teams had missed realism.
"By the end of these 90 minutes, we will be a happy team and, especially, a happy country."
Paulo Bento sees it already in Poland and Ukraine.
For him, there is no doubt of the shadow of a doubt, the Selecayao, which is on the bags since September 2010, will be qualified for the Euro 2012.
In fact, Portugal is only 90 minutes of luck.
But there's a game to play, and an adversary, Bosnia, to deploy.
Seeing the match to go (0-0), Friday in Zenica's pool, it appeared clearly that the games were not done.
Portugal homed the party for more than one hour, certainly, but was not able to mark this so precious goal, which would have emphasized it.
"It's a good result, however, that contains a certain risk because we have not marked goal out."
But at home, in their lighting place of the Luz in Lisbon, the Portugueses are convinced to pass, before a public that should be too busy, even though the party is obviously announced " very sweet," said a Bento optimist but lucide.
"We're waiting for a very smooth game, but we're really sure that we can take the top," said the Portuguese trainer of 42 years.
"We continue to have 50% chances to be in Euro 2012," has even regarded the successor Carlos Queiroz.
No reported Friday in Bosnia requires the Portugues to mark and win.
No one can suffice to the Bosnians, who also need to mark.
"It's a good result, however, that contains a certain risk because we have not marked outward goals," regret Bento.
"We'll play against a team that has many technical qualitys and has a lot of individual qualitys ", added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will intend to put a maximum pressure on the Bosnia to " not give them the time to think."
A good idea, in the condition of being realistic, this time.
