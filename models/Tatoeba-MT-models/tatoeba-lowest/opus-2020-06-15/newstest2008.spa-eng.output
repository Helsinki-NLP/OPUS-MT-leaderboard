European inflation has been dismissed in foods
The accelerated inflation, registered in the euro area, must first be placed on the widespread growth of the price of food products.
The increase in the prices in November was above in the 13 countries of the euro area, registering - after 2.6 percent of October - an annual inflation of 3,1 percent - announced the Union Statistics Office in Luxembourg.
Official previsions were only given as probably a 3 percent - announced the Bloomberg.
The European Central Bank (ECB), on the difference of the North American, British and Canadian banks, did not cut the basic interest, I know that decrease, together with the prices in increased primary materials and the reduction of the forced park, would lead to an inflation espiral.
The ECB wants to maintain the inflation rate below, but at least nearly two percent.
According to an analyzing, the ECB is found in step 22: "If you have to negotiate" on inflation so that afterwards it should not be interventioned on this subject.
The inflation of 3,3 percent, registered in Germany, shot the record of twelve years; so it increased in Spain from 3,6 to 4,1 percent.
The inflation was divided in the euro area because of food and energy prices.
The quotas on terms of the trigo increased a 88 percent, and also the quotaization of the soja reached its maximum level since 1973.
Likewise, it should be paid much more in 2007 for vegetal oil and milk products.
The green petroleum price on the world market increased this ann in a 52 percent, reaching the black gold for almost 100 dollars.
According to the ECB, the inflation in 2008 will increase from 2,1 percent to 2.5 percent, in change for 2009 to 1.9.
According to the analysis, the annual inflation shall be retained within the next 3 or 4 months around 3 percent, however, the average annual rate shall be 2.1 percent.
At the same time, the ECB is expected to reduce the rates of interest during 2008.
Gallup provides a government crisis
After a long stage, the support of the Jovenes Democrates Alliance significantly increased its maximum level since 2002, as the Gallup has never experienced so low - a 13 percent - in the case of socialists.
The difference in the case of the safe electors of the parties - because of the greatest firm of the opposition electors - would mean more than two thirds (a 71 per cent) in support of a fifth part for socialists (on 20 percent).
According to the investigation, the Democratic Forum and the Alliance of Free Democrates would not reach or the necessary limit to have some parliamentary escape: its support in the total population is two percent.
Among the secure electors there is one percent of more than sympathetics in both bands.
The economic environment continued to deteriorate even in comparison with the lower point - never was so high, a 41 percent of those who judged particularly bad economic situation in the country, while another 46 percent believes that the situation is quite bad.
Familys, after the most hopeful expectations of the primary and summer, are now more weak about the change of their own economic situation.
With regard to the next year, most of the population have accounted of the deterioration of the situation and only a tenth part is expected to improve.
In December, 71 percent of the consultations, numbering above any previous investigation of the Gallup, said that the Government Chairman was worse than its functions.
The 13 percent of the consultations trusted or trusted a lot in Ferenc Gyurcsány, as Viktor Orbán supported 38 percent of the advisers.
A 54 percent of the population did not trust the absoluteness of the Head of Government and 27 per cent did not trust the Chairman of the Alliance of Democrates.
One of the indicators of the policy settlement situation is that, what proportion of society believes it is possible to control the detention experienced against the Head of Government without government change.
While after the troubles of October last year, 35 percent said that it would be desired to keep the Government and the Chief of Government, this proportion is only 20 percent, while most relating (a 33 percent) believes that the only solution is the celebration of new elections.
The referendum interest is characterised by the fact that 60 percent of those in question on the participation question responded that he would certainly participate in and another 20 per cent said that it was likely to be involved.
As comparatively, in "A general elections to be held this Sunday" would have only been a 55 percent of the population and a 15 per cent likely believes their participation. Based on the current intentions of the electors wouldn't have any doubts of the result of the popular consultation.
A 74 percent of the population would disappear the payment of studie rights, 79 percent of the medical consultation service and 84 percent of the hospital attractions.
If we observe these contributions only among the safe participants in the reference, 81, 84 and 89 per cent of the electoral would reject the introduction of the rights of studies, the payment of medical consultations and the hospital attractions.
The sweetest is the Tanan, the Tess has calculated its prices
The average increase in the price level of a 16 percent of the hypermercadors of the Budators-Bodler Gold triangle, with the difference that this year has not been increased.
Article of Napi Gazdashag
This year also increased a average of 16 percent in the Budators' commercial triangle the usual shipping canastic of the Napi journal, but in all hypermercules, a growth was higher than the thousands of HUFs.
As in December of the past year, the prices have already been "dispared" in food surmerged, so a percentage drastic surcharge has not been experienced in comparison with the high-party point.
However, obviously, it is abusive for consumers the fact that what the past year could buy to a very price under the nine thousand HUF, today they can not do it nor for ten thousand.
The canasta of Napi in studied hypermertics exceeded the psychological limit of ten thousand HUF at least 91 HUF.
And the highest value canast was 10 573 HUF.
(in 2003, the canast costed 6800 HUF.)
The Unicum licor price and fishery was stored almost at the level of the previous year, but a strong increase was registered in the thick, nest and seed of the amapol.
The price of the trip and bread hair followed the data of the Central Statistics Office, although we also found a kilometre of bread for the price of 139 HUF.
Competence does not reduce the product price at least 200 HUF.
Also it was surprised in this tent that the Coca-Cola price with a removal bottle of two litres costed less than 200 HUF, so that this product, even with the bottle price, costed only 257 HUF.
Nevertheless, in Napi evenan’s shoes was the most faced, as Cora the most barried.
According to our calculations, as regards the prices of the Nationality of the past year, Cora increased with a 15, while Tesco and even with about 18 percent of the prices contained in Napi's canast.
Comparing the values of the most faced canast last year with the most barned sink of this ann, the difference has been 12 percent, while the growth between the most barried year and the most face of this year has been 21 percent.
The average growth was 1480 HUF.
In the past year, the average price growth was 1206 HUF, so that in the past year's Year Nationality the prices had increased.
Only this process was the one who dismissed trade, the supermercadors visiblely were in a position to decide on the price margin to apply for each product and to calculate the effect of the change of consumer prices.
(If the trade unfair plans the speed of the movement of a product, it may lose an important benefit in the margin which is injusted to the volume of sales.)
The increase in the Napi’s canasta price has achieved such extensions because of the increase in IVA, which the worst of 1720 HUF was higher than the value registered in 2006, while the difference was only 844 HUF.
This year has not occurred such extremes, since the highest price of now has been 1630 HUF more than the past year and the most barried also increased with 1284 HUF.
As compared to the two timely ships, catastrophic growth was registered in prices at least 20 months, hypermercules increased more than 30 percent of the price of the consumer articles of first need.
(It is not necessarily confirmed the figures of the Central Statistics Office: this office, in the case of some foods of first need, registered a increase of price over 30 per cent in the interval of 12 months.
So, for example, rather than the trip, also in the case of the egg.)
According to the Napi's canast, in this case it seems almost impossible, since in the price of this product that was pretty cool for the past year, in comparison to the base, it was registered, in the worse cases at least 10 percent of price increase.
According to all indices, harine providers have a stronger position than eggs, and could impose drastic increase in prices even multinationals.
The hypermercules do not stop in the trading triangle of gold, constantly speaking of positive results.
According to our experience collected, most of the consumers of the three visited tents are no longer interesting prices.
Of all products, they buy large amounts, taking the food conservated by pallets.
At the morning of the middle, in the three tents, there were large collars in front of the cattles, as a sudden increased the number of customers.
However, we have information that sale wages are lower, many multinationals are rejected by the investigation institutions because income remains under their plans and not only in the case of food, but also in the electro-estatetics.
In many hospitals, there are desinfectants.
This year has been registered in hospitals several thousands of infections made first by the independent application of antibiotics.
Reinended hygiene circumstances in hospitals, bed-up and staff overlaps do not favour the control of infections - claims the departmentary of the National Epidemiology Centre.
In many hospitals, there are also desinfectors.
A contact with MRSA has not been diagnosed in the János Hospital Traumatology department.
In a hospital after a serious accident, the presence of antibiotic battery was detected.
The patient was isolated.
The same type of account was produced in this same hospital at the beginning of the year.
A serious automovilistic accident was given to the hospital, and the same patient was a little later to return to the hospital as a result of the contact with MRSA and since there was no important intervention on the presence of the bacteria in his body.
Until 10 December this year, 1094 cases of hospital infection produced by multiresistent agents have been registered in the National Nation National Surveillance Surveillance Survey - said Karolina Boröcz, Departmental Centre of Epidemiology.
This means that in hospitals with all security have been registered this amount of infections produced by multiresistent agents, the rest has no information.
Search for the two third parts of infection (683 cases) should be to MRSA, i.e. the Gold Staphylococcus, resistent to meticilina-oxaciline.
A third of human beings take the gold bacteria of Staphylococcus (SA) without any disease.
The infections produced by the SA (e.g.: inflation of gargan, amigdalitis, fractal infection, heat infections) react well to antibiotics and are easy treatment.
However, when the antibiotics are exaggerated or unobligated, the bacteries that normally react goodly to antibiotics are transformed in very resistent batteries to antibiotics and quickly contained in inadequate hospitalal conditions.
They may cause serious hospital infections, such as wounds or septicemia infections first than patients with transitional or chronic immunodeficiency, patients with debilitated body, elders or persons of low weight.
In view of the doctor of the Hospital János, there is nothing special in the MRSA infection, these infections are cotidian in hospitals.
The MRSA must not be confounded with the epidemic, but the MRSA is only outstanding - said Tibor Nyulasi - where his presence is not considered.
Resistant to antibiotics
"These patients are isolated, the hospital staff attracts them in homa and mascar guants and there are the appropriate antibiotics for their treatment," said Tibor Nyulasi.
The hospitalized patients are previously considered to check the presence of MRSA in their body, but they can not even avoid infection in all cases.
You are not able to take samples
It would be possible to prevent the hospital infections of MRSA in most cases, however, the current national hospital circumstances are not favouring the prevention of training and contact with the multi-religious patent agents - says Karolina Böröcz.
As this infection is mainly produced in hospitals and households, hospitals should consider hospitalized patients and immediately assign the patients who take the MRSA body.
However, in hungry hospitals there is no way to take microbiological samples.
This fact should also be given that the National Health Carrière does not finance these medical reviews.
So most cases come to public light when visible MRSA infections are already produced in the patient-- said the Departmental Medicinal of the Epidemiological Centre.
The European Union makes huge initiatives for the implementation of antibiotics in human medicine and also exists national directives to treat pathological infections and tables.
It should be emphasized that the treatment with antibiotics should be directed, or whether, microbiological exams should be made to prevent resistance against medicines, but hospitals do not always meet this requirement.
Taking microbiological samples are still less frequent in the case of ambulant patients or basic assistance, Karolina Böröcz confirmed.
The desinfects are closed with the desinfectors
Science experiments have shown that most of the cases of MRSA contained a patient by health personnel.
Thus, they play a very important role in the washing of the hands, the use of gome and mascars, however, also in this sense there are considerable lacks in hospitals.
The MRSA is contained through the transmission by plates and direct contact between persons, however, in national hospital circumstances, it is not always possible to isolate the patient contained.
Furthermore, hospital sals are abroad, the beds often are very cold, although in order to prevent epidemic, patients should be separated at least by a distance of 1.5 metres.
Unfortunately, it can also be experimented - added Karolina Böröcz - that in hospitals of less favourable economic situation is assisted with desinfectors, there are few sick and many patients and therefore there are more probability for infection.
In view of Karolina Böröcz, where appropriate prevention measures are fulfilled, less infections of this type are registered or the container of the patogenic agent can be kept.
Governmental Programme against MRSA
The contact treatment with MRSA is a huge expenditure for the National Safety Fund for Discrimination, so in all countries fight against it.
In England, for example, there is a government programme to prevent and reduce the cases of the RSA.
The program seems to be successful, according to the data provided, infections with MRSA show the decline trend in England.
The European Centre for Prevention and Improvement Control (ECDC) has priorities to prevent multiresistent agents (including MRSA) and the hospital infection to these patologist agents.
Rejected the alcohol control of the police commander who caused a mortal accident
The financial official report on the case of the death accident caused by the commander of the police of the district XXII was made.
It is possible to exclude the possibility that he conducted ebrio or in the turded state from then dismissed commander of the XXII police district, who the martyrs crawled and caught the death of a transecutor - informed the Saturday Attila Morvai, port of the Capital General Fiscality, after prepared the death report on the case.
The fiscal report confirmed the result of the primary alcohol control that had already been found that the former commander of the police had not consumed alcoholic drink before he was laid behind the flight.
The chief of the XXII police officer of the 19th District police, the Martes with its special vehicle to the Dobler on the Cossuth Lajos of the XXII district street abroad a 55-year-old man who was trying to cross the street, but not in the designed area for peatones.
(It is the last fact that the peak did not use the brain to cross the road, in accordance with the rules of the Trinity Code, there are no warrant circumstances, the conductor must always end the step to the dublar.)
The transecurrent lost life after being hospitalized.
For this reason, the police leader of the district disaster left and requested his jurisdiction, according to the police communication, because he had a lot of case with him.
The investigation of the case is under the Budapest Research Force.
Attila Morvai also said that the former police commander had cooperated with the fiscals responsible for investigation.
More than 400 million euros for infrastructures
Hungary Finance Minister János Veres and the Vice-President of the European Investment Bank (BEI) Marta Gajecka signed the Thursday in Budapest three credit agreements for a total value of 400 million euros to finance education, transport and environment and the energy sector.
In 2006, the European Investment Bank (EIB) adopted a budget of EUR 300 million to finance in the Hungarian budget for transport and environmental protection projects, which will be carried out from the cohesion funds, which the parties have already previously signed a credit contract by a 100 million value, the contract to be signed concerning the use of the remaining 200 million euros.
The credit contract of 150 million euros is also intended to finance the budget of education projects.
The BEI adopted totally 300 million euros for this objective in Hungary, on the use of the remaining 150 million euros, by extending the credit contract.
The parties signed a contract of EUR 50 million for innovation, which would mainly work for the Debrecen University's innovation and research project.
During the conversations also turned the theme on the construction of the fourth line of the Metro.
The agreement was agreed that when Hungary ends with the EU's details of the Metro financing, they will reiterate the issue that if it is necessary or not to change the original contract and how it is done.
According to Jhanos Veres, this can be placed at the first quarter of 2008.
Since 1990, the EIB was funded for 113 projects in Hungary by 8.4 million euros.
The interest of the credits is amended to EURIBOR and the EIB offers an 8-year-old thanks period without covering the committee for maintaining the credit available to the debtor.
Bulgaria, the EU Agricultural Paradise
It is wonderful that the development of the Bulgarian real estate market - the attention of all Europe is directed to that Balkan country a little mentioned time.
What, where and those who buy on the market are still more barried in the EU, which will be faster?
Analysis of the Re/Max Desktop Division.
The favorite goal for real estate purchases in Eastern Europe is, unfortunately, some Bulgaria, with its barata apartments of ski pills and the beach chalets.
The mountain regions of Bansko, Borovec, Pamprovo and Vitosa are the most favorite, as in the Albena streets, the "Costa Dorada", the "Costa del Sol", the old Sozopol and Nesebar, but still more people are looking for immubles in the around Kavarna and Balchik.
According to Re/Max’s analistians in Bulgaria, later or early also the central area of the country - such as Veliko Tarnovo, Gabrovo, Elena, Triavna - will discover the interests of real estate promotors and every time more people will buy in the particular barried area of Russia.
Likewise, the Sophie capital, trade spaces and offices can be attracted as well, promise a rapid recovery of investment.
Bulgaria is on the best way to become one of the most attractive paradise of Europe golf, and can be so a significant destination during the two stations, not only in the summer and in the winter.
So the preceding investors are already doing their purchases, for example in the banks of banksko.
In view of the analists, those who bought in Bulgaria are also endeavoured to change their life and their way to live.
Most customers are English, but they also come from France, Belgium, Spain and always more in Romania.
They also present maltes and chipriots and traditionally there are many Russian clients in the Black Sea and Ski paradises.
Foreign customers can be classified in three groups - says Georgi Jankov, Regional Director of Re/Max in Bulgaria.
Those who intend to be installed here buy new or renewed by a price between 50 and 100 thousand euros or good old homes in bad state between 5 and 15 thousand euros to renew them later.
There is a good communication and access for them, as well as the neighbourhood of a large city, tents and generally a local doctor.
Constitute the second category the chalet buyers (Bulgaria in December was included between the first 10 vacation destinations of the German).
The third group establishs the real estate investors that make their purchases with the hope of benefiting average or long-term benefits.
The price of capital immunities is constantly grown, since the demand is always greater.
While Bulgaria has lower prices in the European Union, in the last five years, these have suffered an annual increase of 21 percent
The increase in the price of immunities significantly exceeds the growth of the wages.
Fodor and six per hundreds of Hungarians
As reported by the Minister of Environment and Hydrology, Gábor Fondo, expert meetings will be completed on March and the seat after official inauguration will continue negotiations on the international climate regime after 2012.
The 192 world experts and political experts discuss about the Bali Rule Letter, which has on the successful efforts for the period of reduction of emissions set out in the Kyoto Protocol, which lives until 2012.
There are now animated discussions on the particularly between developing countries and industrialized countries.
The U.S. has already stated that at the moment it would not wish to negotiate specific figures, although it is expected to reach the agreement that in comparison with the situation of 1990, until 2020, the emission of gases responsible for the winter effect was reduced to 25 to 40 per cent.
Another major theme of the conference is that if industrialized countries, in addition to reducing emissions, are or not intended to provide material and technical assistance to the countries that need it.
A further agreement was made on aid to provide developing countries.
The Kyoto Protocol ' s support fund will be directed by an integrated guidance board by 16 members, probably within the United Nations Environment Fund (GEF) - spelling the "Protocy Paiac".
6 per hundreds of Hungary
On behalf of Hungary, the Minister of Environment and Hydrology Gábor Fodor supports the efforts of the EU to maintain its role of prosperity in the global climate protection and to promote the signature of the new international agreement until 2009.
The Minister stated that the EU was engaged to reduce the level of 1990 in a 20 percent of its gas emissions, responsible for the winter effect, independently if it was signed or not the "after 2012 agreement" and is designed to decrease a 30 percent if the other large developing regions of the world and developing countries are also intended to assemble commitments in accordance with its responsibility and capacity.
Gábor Fodor pointed out that the Kyoto Protocol ' s signing countries had been forced to reduce a 5,2 percent, within that, the 15 EU Member States were enhanced to meet an 8 percent of reduction.
Hungary's commitment is to reduce a 6 percent of the emission of gases responsible for the winter effect for the 1985-87 period, which our country will meet - notes the press communication of the Ministry of Environment.
It is much that it is in the game in Balí, since within two years the international climate agreement of long-term climate policy should be signed, because if not, it is sure that its entry into force would be made after 2012. In this case, the UNCTAD reduction commitments would not be immediately followed by a new international system for emission reduction, whose need was warned in its recent report by the IPCC, international scientific association with the climate change, which has been made by the Peace Premile.
The reduction of emissions would therefore suffer a delay and could not be prevented to increase more than 2° C of the average temperature of the earth, as according to scientists would have inconsistent and irreversible consequences.
The British Army recovered in YouTube
The units of the British Army in a video distributor publish filmed actions in Iraq and Afghanistan to popularize themselves.
First of the British Air Force (RAD) was the one that had been the YouTube Services: the special units placed in Afghanistan since March 2006 are loading videos on their actions against the Taliban - reported the BBC.
These records with mini cameras on cases are controlled in the Candahar general body of operations, then they are sent to London to be loaded on the Internet.
The political message is inevitable.
There are already 139 records from the air force soldiers that have been loaded from this way to the Internet and its "canal" canal has already been seen for more than 75,000 people.
The British Defence Minister was registered in the spring of 2007 under the name of the "Checure Cinquids Defence" and the videos of actions made in Iraq and in Afghanistan, while both the Ministry of the United Nations Community (Commonwealth Office) and the Multinational Forces in Iraq (MNFI) have their own channel YouTube.
Operation in Afghanistan
Originally, the air force had been loaded videos with recruitment objectives, but in view of the Ministry of Defence, they also serve to submit to the public the true goal of the presence of the British Army in the outside.
This kind of proliferation practically does not matter anything in comparison with conventional recruitment televisions - declared BBC the expert in Defense Gordon Mackenzie - in a change, inevitably have some political message, since in a specific way they justify the reason for being the military actions decided by the Government.
The Americans prepared a video game
The executive is also concerned that, in addition to the edited and censured records, the distributor also appears efficient videos, such as the death of soldiers: in the films of "effective "proliferation", a little hypocrite, officials speak as a maximum of losses, without to present the bloody part of the fights.
Furthermore, from Irak and Afghanistan battle camps have been loaded to the Internet many videos recorded in real operations, but the British army is only recently using this opportunity.
Americans use a little different way for recruitment with video players, downloaded freely, named America's Army, which in the middle of a more or less real situation the player can be set directly in place of soldiers.
Tobala and past feeding at the Navidad Feast of Ministers
It doesn't seem very sensitive to the work office Monika Lamperth: instead of the shipping party, it will celebrate a work meeting for your colleagues who can disappear in 2007 with salt and coffee past.

What you know is that for the feast that will be held in the Museum of Apply Arts was invited to more than four hundred people.
You're meeting the powers of the huge huge
The Liga Sindicatos and the National Federation of Obliged Commissions will be the Friday a flood committee to coordinate the moon wheel that will continue for undetermined time.
The Sabbath will be held a half of protest, while the Monday-day will be held on the final vote on public health law - will be started the work pair.
With all security, this action will cause great difficulties in the transport, as the railway transit will be completely stopped and until 13 hours will also be driven by workers from the Budapest Collective Transport Empire.
On Friday, the Liga Sindicatos will inform the details of the moon details that will be held together with the National Federation of Working Commissions.
The LIGA and the National Sexual Independence of Maintenances will also be formed as the moon's actions.
The Sabbath shall be held a half of protest, while the lunes of the participating incidents shall be proclaimed in an unlimited time, if not reached to a agreement with the Government.
This means that - on the day of the parliamentary vote on public health law - they did not report on the date of the end of the end of the beginning.
If the National Assembly dismisses the public health law, the indisidents will immediately receipt their call to the hail.
Instead, if the law is adopted, the flood commissions will be gathered and decided on the future.
On the basis of the agenda of the Monday of the National Assembly, it is also possible that only the public health law is voted in the very night entrys or at the best neighbour of the midnight.
Following the moon wheel, it should be important to mention: in the railways will be left to work for undetermined time, tomorrow may be a part of the collective transport of Budapest and more than half of the inter-burn bus transport of Volán companies.
Similarly, in many points the country will be closed from half of the roads.
Numbers of incidents and civil organizations have been adhered to the hole, their names are constantly updated on the Liga website.
Some incidents announced their flight for undetermined time, others per time.
Until Thursday the State Ferrocarril and the Free Sindicato of Ferroviary Workers (SLTF) were not able to reach a agreement or even to the minimum services, although, while near the Christmas feasts, more are people who travel into trains.
According to the information received until now, from the start of the day to 13 hours, the workers of the Budapest Collective Transport Employment Employment, Budapest Airports from 7 to 9:00 of the morning will hold four hours of the LIGA SIDs of the Electricity and Fernity Industry, the Sindicatos of Teachers called to an aggregate from 2 to 8 hours and the Democratic Indicators of Teachers from 2 to 8 hours.

The most important of the four requests formulated by the Liga is that the Government should reply its proposal on public health reform and submit a new concept to a social debate.
The second application is that the new form of calculation of the pensions which will enter into force in the coming year.
The third is to ensure, even before 2010, for the case of pensions added, the possibility of the marketing jobs to enter into the system.
The fourth reason for the skin is that the Free Sindicato of Ferroviary Workers (SLTF) which is part of the Liga SIDs, they do not accept the proposal of the Ministry of Economic and Transport on Railway Lines and they are waiting for another proposal.
Political Capital[b1]: The country increases the risk by Hungary Guardia
According to the Division of Riesgos (Risk Analysing Capital Division) of the Political Guardia Guardia, which was established in August of this year with the support of the movement by a Hungary Mejor, has increased the political risk of Hungary and region.
In the "risk warning" of the company is written: in relation to the activities of the Hungary Guardia the highest political risk is the fact that "with the extension of the existing ethnic tensions between the Guinea and the non-Giganian population, even short-termly, can be produced violent ethnics”.
The main reason is that Hungary's political strategy probably is the provocation of a success of that nature - added the representative of the investigation Institute.
They stated that this must be one of the main lacks of Hungary political protagonists: "The protagonists of the public life have moved the public debate of the Guyana problem to the representatives of the radical and extremist political groups, which have been able to fund their political strategy on existing disparities between citizens and Hungary."
This increases the problem, imposing the normal dialogue, strengthening the extremists and increased the probability of the steel of violent conflicts - are estimated.
In addition, according to the investigation Institute, the activities of the National Guardia, because of the great attention of the national and international average, "had significantly deteriored Hungarian images in the outside, especially with regard to the stability and democratic development of the country."
It recalls that, since October 2006, he has always received greater publicity and encourages the reorganisation of radical and extreme right groups in Hungary and that many organizations have been formed since summer 2007 in the country that are self-defined by " national defence associations".
"The common race of these groups is that they are self-defined as civil organizations while they are openly proclaiming the conduct of their members for defence - even armed - (civian defence, national defence, public defence) by the impotences of the police, the executive, that is the State - aggregate.
They stated that all this is done in accordance with the method that seeks to provide a civil presentation to different political aspirations, based on the disappearance of society with political and political parties.
For resolve civil and the form of association in the case of these associations not only serves to avoid legal inscription problems, but also to be a political strategy at the same time.
According to the analysis, the Hungary Guardia’s activity is also a risk factor from the neighbourhood relations.
"In the last months, in numerous neighbouring States, Hungary Guardia was refered to a potential danger, while the ultra-national policy figures of some neighbouring countries want to justify their own anti-Ungarian policy with the creation of Hungary Guardia,
All this affects the political stability of the region.
According to the research Institute, the establishment of Hungary Guardia is not an isolated phenomenon in Central and Eastern Europe, so that political risks were increased in the whole region.
Guardia of Hungary worked like, for example, the Bangladesh National Guardia, whose constitution was declared in August 2007 by the National Union of Bulgaria (UNB) on extreme right.
The constitution of the Bulgarian guard must be made to the massive disturbances of the guitars who have occurred in one of the Sophia barriers (Crasna Poliana).
In enhanced this situation, UNBC decided to be observed, with the argument that the objective of the organization is " national defense".
In his view, in the last 17 years, there was a "Girate terror" in Bulgaria, however, the State remained impotent and indifferent against the facts - remembers the political Capital.
They argued: this initiative has caused an encouraged discussion in the public manner of Bulgaria.
As it was written, it indicates the increase in the risk of ethnic disappearances that certain civilian organizations in Bulgaria have announced that they will resolve their own guard.
As the Hungary Guardia work until now has shown seems with the Búlgara National Guardia, it cannot be excluded that Hungary citizens also respond to threat in similar form, organizing their own self-defence - can be read in the warning of the political Capital risks.
The Political Capital Research Director Attila Juhász said that the risk analysis is one of the activities of the investigation Institute.
As said, each year's analysis of risks and when they experience something that can affect the change of the risk, they inform the public opinion as happened in this case by publishing their advertisement on risks.
The festival is not always written with red numbers
In Hungary, the law defines exactly the days written with red numbers in the calendar and has already become a generalised practice which returns to the feast days - that the lamb will be less - the workdays are reorganized.
Even in EU or North America, the feasts are unitary.
Hungary laws have a difference between national, State party and festival feasts.
The festivals are mainly relating to religious festivals and efemerides.
We celebrate the New Year also: both the last day of the old year, as the first day of the new year is festival - this last in all that they can escape those who passed by celebrating the old ear.
During the whole year we have eighteen written feasts with red numbers in the calendar.
It is a national feast on 15 March in memory of the revolution of 1848 and 23 October, mentioning the 1956 revolution.
On 20 August, we celebrated the funding of the State, on 1 May, the working party, on 1st and 2 November, recalled to our family families and fellow friends.
Furthermore, in our country, we are feasts of resurrection, Pentecosts and Christmas.
According to the calendar, our State, national or religious feasts are sometimes related to a week end, so often it is angry when before or after the feast is a only workday.
In turn to the enlarged week ends so, during previous sabbats you can't run from work or school.
It is the minister of work that regulates in its specific decree when it is necessary to work exactly on change of the previous or later day to the party.
This legal standard is to comply with all staff and employees, as well as with public employees and officials.
There is no obligation to change enterprises and services institutions, which, due to their role, are also ininterrupted working during the festival days.
This approximate order can be changed only around the Ombudsman end: since 24 December, it is practical to hold life in the country, since, according to the experiences, most of the people "doged" during the day between the Christmas Christmas and the end of the announce or take their holidays during these days.
The next year several of our festivals will relate to average or week ends, so there will be less changes in the working days that this ano.
First, the agenda will be amended to the working party, so they may then rescue workers for four next days.
The Sabbath, 26 April, will be held working day, to change Friday 2 May will be a festival.
The other change relates to the feast of 23 October: Saturday, 18 October, must be working instead of Thursday 24.
On the other hand, the ano that comes during the end of the year may be released, since it is not working in almost any part, nor the last day of the year is a Wednesday.

E-mails we forgot to send, sound messages that we never receive, false lies that are going on us without account: they all form part of our Folclore's work.

Interesting requests if you want to meet public expectations
The car advances slowly in the usual attack of the morning.
It sounds a foreign compasse in the radio: violence with electronic effects.
Get down the volume.
Change the ritmo of music and the previous sounds are added the lower and then the voice of a female core as a true joyful interview.
The channel mr2 plays the song Wings of Love de Zagar.
National musical life did not have many of us with quality pops.
But now it seems totally different this attack when you're listening to Zagar's new disk.
It appears Yonderboi. Some new and interesting songs from the underground [b2]digital [b3] National little to change the image and even though it is again likely the garage style, breaks guitars, the national pop elector has demonstrated: there are news under the sun.
Balazs Zságer started his chariot in the city of Pécs, touched the whole of Yonderboi until the starting of his independent route may be because both can't be protagonists of the same common.
With its project (Zagar) and its music, a jazz mixture of electrical and pop music, triunfar triunfar, when they requested soundtracks [b4] math-matography (pl.
Ferenc Turkish Szezon.
The most widely public recognized the whole that in a principle he had acted only in small clubs when the wan2 magazine selected its first CD edited in 2002 between the 50 major national disks, classifying Zagar, together with Yonderboi as almost the only national trend former, could also be sold in Western markets.
There is no doubt that Zagar and your joint are kind of mode, but no one has asked them if they take this label or not guiltyly.
The whole reacted how to react: he prepared a new and better disc.
The receipt disk, titled in possible Walk Fly Instead, can open new ways for them, although the own title is designed to establish continuity with non-alial angles in the city of Pécs.
Because this title was one of the lines of the old Balaszs whole Zságer.
It is well the reference on the air, on the flight, but beyond the music's aircraft now appeared - in accordance with the spirit and trend of the time - the guitar that sounds stronger, the effect of the rock and rol.
With these songs, he presented the disco in the Millerary Guergy Ligeti, the song that is currently working in England with the whole The Puzzle.
The disc includes a real success of the canal mr2 Pet月fi that recently transmits frommorrow to the popular music night. This emittentor has led to the ears of radioys the high music of Wings of Love, recorded with six guest cancers (Divas Underground").
So everything is in order (?).
hvg.hu asked Balaz Zságer.
hvg.hu: After this new success, the question you are interpretating, in what measure is a music dedicated to a selected public?
Balzs Zságer: The chosen public definition for me is little.
In my opinion there are two types of casts in the light music; not mainstream and underground[b5], not alternative and pop, but commercial and sincere.
The so-called subterranean music may be burned, without sense, and can be composed equally only for sale, what makes it commercial.
But also a good pop song can surround from a sincere inspiration.
The attitude of hearers also works with this spirit, independently in national languages and borders.
hvg.hu: Do you see some difference between the collection of your music by the Hungar and foreign public?
B. Zs: In the foreign, especially in the western of us, light music has larger traditions.
Here's not only the 15-year generations of the conciertos, but also the elderly.
They take greater attention to the changes made around them in the light music, as they consider the part of the modern culture.
hvg.hu: What role has the public in your work?
You care who are, from where are they and how many are those who hear your music?
B.Zs: Of course, I feel well when I can see that people always have more people to our concients.
But we never composed music for the market.
Let's not compose music for any purpose, but for any reason.
The role of the public is most important in the conciers where a relaxing influence exists, but this is only in the incompatible changes of the moment.
And yet, I know that if you want to comply with public expectations, you ask her interest.
hvg.hu: How do you want to follow the example of Yonderboi?
He worked in solitario and made his road better at the west of us.
B.Zs: We do not follow his way, although they are sometimes trying to compare our music with him.
We work better in the team, we trust the musical presence of the other and let it be disappeared.
In one principle, it was inevitable to compare our work with the Yonderboi music, since many of us start our carrier in their group and we start another way.
hvg.hu: The list of successs of Mr.2 Petsfi Wings of Love is on the first place.
Many people listened for the first time to Zagar's name in relation to this song.
Have you opened awarely with this style to a broader capacity?
Z.B.: We were not trying to compose great success and sell with these successes our disc.
This song is something else than that.
We add it to the end of the disc, trying to relax after the sound of the disc and the weakest issues.
hvg.hu: How did you choose the six songs?
Why just to them - what was the main reason?
B.Zs: The idea was creating a core to the style of the game.
Then the idea of creating this core of the solists of a good voice of our own national musical scenario.
So this core of six women was created - or be Sena, Kutzora Edina, Judie Jay, Bori Péterfy, Enikć Hodosi [Neo] and Juci Németh was then baptized as Underground Dives.
hvg.hu: Do you exactly make the song or girls changed some?
Z.B.: This song exists long ago in instrumental version and when we had already all the disc material, we think that there's still nothing.
The memory was dragging the song.
Even that night I buried the song that later learned her girls.
Everything has come to the first attempt and in an incredibly exposed way.
I remember, I was very exciting then, but of course I also needed the Dives.
With my voice, I wouldn't have worked so much.
hvg.hu: So much in the concert as on the disk seems like if girls would be in second plane.
There are no solidists (except Judy Jay only), they have no own role, sing all together and not stronger than music, so music does not only match their songs.
The fund is also located in the scenario.
Intense?
B.Zs: They are just in the fund for technical problems.
We wouldn't want to distribute the roles of solidists.
The song also shows about this, because we forget a time of our ego, who from where he has come and where he goes, let us therefore let those alas, the swallows of the love rise up to us.
I would like to achieve that others also sympathe the state of Euphorotic sense that we feel when we were born this song.
hvg.hu: To whom have you dedicated more work?
Z.B.: In the musical composition actually to no one, more at the time of mizclair, there were more difficult pieces.
For example, the Dorian Gray's Dilemma in which I'm touching in a concert plan or Rock'n'Roll Goes to The Girls, where for a long time I wouldn't want to work the groove and then, a little bit was placed on his place as in a puzzle.
hvg.hu: What is your favorite song on the new disk?
Z.B.: This changes constantly with the conciertos and because I've already "livered" the disk.
Now the prophet is A Fool, the Escape From the Earth and the Never The Same.
A flood corriger of milks of millions for their lower complex
A malicious disagreement.
So it is as noted to his old employee, Jerome Kerviel, the French Bank Great of General Society, owner of the Checo Trade Bank.
For him he lost approximately five million euros.
However, it seems that Kerviel was a great player who wanted to compare his colleagues and, of course, with good capacity.
He entered, alongside all the large cheque banks, the crisis in the American market.
"He has a fagil character," he left to hear from his uppers, the same as they sent him to the police.
But what is disappeared from Kerviel's responses according to the French media, such as Le Monde, is that it was a man who at the end of the past year had a gain of more than 1.600 million euros thanks to its business.
Crisis not only in America
"All I wanted to do was gain money for my bank" is sure of his answers.
Precisely, in summer, he made winner during the American crisis 500 million euros.
This opportunity has seen her coming to the beginning of the year.
In February, some news were started to listen to sub-pre-pre-priest calls to low income clients or those who had problems with payments and that these customers would start to have problems.
However, this crisis should not have affected the whole economy.
Kerviel didn't believe it and she correctly added it.
And then, at the end of the year, their gains exceeded EUR 1.600 million.
"When I already gained my first 500 million I didn't know how to notice it" trusts Kerviel and adds, that nothing has been left to himself, in absolutely.
During all the questionnaire, he declared that the records had been deceived so that it would not be reached to his discovery.
Even when the Bolsa Eurex began to be interested in his business.
The risk was made in profit
Did you think she'd get to discover?
Well, no.
"I thought he had gained 1.600 million for the bank and that from that simple fact, it would be glad to them."
From where did he take so much will to strike in this way?
In my position, they had to work gradually.
He went to work in General Society in 2000, exactly after the end of study in Lyon.
The annual payment of $51,000 was managed.
Two years later, he was a correlator of Bolsa, and in 2005 he became a bottle corner with an annual $90,000.
I still knew that I'd never win as well as the others.
"In my first interview in 2005, I already noted that I was watching carefully.
Because of my training and also of my professional and personal progress, Kerviel described the investigators.
But at a little time of my entrance into the company, the first great success came.
Thanks to Allianz's actions, during attacks with bombs in London, playing lower a title of EUR 500 million.
And this override an array mechanism, and I wanted more.
If it's that you win, we'll leave you.
"It's like a snow bullet," said the police.
But it is said, the captains knew about all this, or that they are sorely suspecting it.
"Mentres gained money, closed the eyes."
Only afterwards the battle at the beginning of this year.
One day, it lost thousands of euros.
After the end of week to half January, I want to remove all sheets.
When the Monday came to work, he didn't work in the bank.
And two days later, the bank announced that it had lost $5,000 for its fault.
And how did they go to localize him?
He was suspected from his holidays.
"I did only four days per year.
The corrector that has no vacation is a corridor that doesn't want anyone to take a look at his shipping" ended Kerviel.
Czech Republic has the possibility of reaching 365 million
The Ministers of the Government of the Czech Republic signed yesterday with representatives of the European Commission a total of nine operational programmes of which the Republic of Czech could obtain 14 million euros (approximately 365 million crowns).
It is practically the half of the total amount that the Czech Republic may obtain from Brussels for 2007 to 2013.
From seven operational programmes, approximately 125 million crowns for regions.
Czech companies can get around 100 million crowns of the Programme Emprese and innovation.
The majority of the money will be intended to transport up to 150 million.
The Transport Programme is the majority of the operational programmes and represents up to 22 per cent of the resources that the Czech Republic can achieve from the Fund.
This money increases the budget of the State Fund for Transport Infrastructures which will include the amount of 90,800 million crowns.
The Employment and innovation Programme should serve enterprises and enterprises to obtain resources in the innovation of businesses.
Business should achieve funding for the acquisition of new technologies, industrial research and the implementation of more effective organizational methods.
With regard to the current use of the EU funds, the Czech Republic is located between the incoming countries than less using them.
Twenty-eight years for the representative of Nicaragua, the court described
The Nicaraguan Court of Appeals described on Thursday the penalty of 20 years for the representative of the country, Arnaldo German, which was condemned in 2003 by the disabilities of $100 million (case 1.800 million).
Despite this, some time later, he was released from prison to go to home arrest in his hamburg not far from the Nicaraguan metropolis.
There is nothing clear in these times, according to the AP Agency, that the head of the Central American State between 1197 and 2002 will again be between the series.
According to the President of the Court of Appeal, Ileana Pérez will be more dependent on the pending officers if Germany leaves his punishment to home or if they return to prison.
Four years ago, the court demonstrated that Germany had constantly transferred money from the government to the account of a company in Panama.
This society was credibility, and the account was actually of its closer family and partners.
The part of this money agreed in the fund that Germany created to finance its campaign in the elections of 2001.
Thus adopted the budget
That's it.
The State Budget was adopted.
Why is this budget special?
It is the first developed by this Government and accepted by most of the coalition without the support of the opposition.
The budget of this year has already been approved by support of ≥SSD, because it was prepared by the Sobotka Minister and ◆SSD could not be accepted.
Besides various discussions before the vote on the confidence vote to the Government, there was nothing dramatic happened this time.
The parliamentary meeting, in this traditional view, adopted the new law with quietness.
It's a great paradise.
Each government begins and ends with each chapter and starts from the budget, please or not.
The budget is an important part of the policy, but it is hiding the rivality of power between government and opposition.
It is important for media to communicate and therefore give you special attention.
Political discussions are much more interesting than the simple numbers.
The State Budgets of the latest Social Democrat Governments suffered three defects that for this year 2008 could not be so easily solved:
The first of them is the high participation of mandatory laws, called as expenditures of mandatees not only pensions but also the social benefits that have been adopted in the past year before the elections by the "silenciousa" coalition of μSSD and KS月M.
The second is the deficit in the economy as a result of the first defect.
The third limit is the deficit of public financing, such as the municipal and Community budgetary deficit.
Despite this, the largest risk is not in the deficit of the State Budget.
This is public and relatively under control.
However, the flood bomb is on the deficit of the municipal and Community budget.
Many barriers to be able to obtain other investment sources, except for the money of taxes, taxes and credits of the banks, often have issued obligations with which they had deployed indirectly to their contributions.
In the past few years, these debts were made to pay through the massive sale of energy actions and other development networks received from the state and privatization.
You are currently not accounting of this resource.
If we are only at official and verified facts, we discover that:
Our economy, already a few years ago, passes through growth phases like the rest of the world, of which it has been shot μSSD.
This was the ideal opportunity that his Government could order the financings of the State.
However, instead, the state continued to endure.
The rest of countries, except some like Hungary, Albania, Pakistan or Egypt, have been more reasonable than our republic.
It is a great shame that falls, above all, in the previous government.
We are part of the nations that are less threatened by poverty within the global measures.
This is why the massive social programmes are not necessary that, in the past few years, they have been unutilized with huge measures.
And though they have continued to remove part of the uncomprehensible people's expenditure adopted this year before the elections, if shortly does not change the age of jubilation and reform of the pensions will then be the end of any policy in this country, and it will govern that will only be a simple burocracy.
Expressing a little, we can say that the policies that they govern will be converted to officials, which are mechanical dividers of the majority of the money of tax taxes for jubilation and social performance.
Therefore, the budget of this year cannot be revolutionary, but the pressure of the standard expenditure of the mandatees can be stopped.
The planned deficit of more than 70 million for 2008 would be absolutely unnecessary, if the past government had not been harmed in the last ten years.
We don't wish that the policy that they govern will only become officials for this reason we must be patients and grant this weak coalition of the government, which is understood that the state can only exempt from taxes and taxes, quietness for the preparation of other reforms of laws.
Only this will be able to achieve a balanced State budget.

The banks want to solve the crisis
The American Federal Reserve Bank, the European Central Bank and the British Central Banks, Switzerland and Canada decided to fight together against the financial market crisis.
The monetary market will receive more than $100 million through delivery.
In these provisions, banks are subject to the types of interests which are able to provide money.
For example, the American Fed will send for $40 million, and then 24 million will facilitate the central banks from Europe and Switzerland.
After the attacks of 11 September, the first time the central banks of different states are agreed in this coordinated process to protect and reduce the consequences of the financial crisis.
"This step should solve the most economic problem, i.e. the continuing growth of the free capital we could provide banks" wrote in its report for customers, Bernard Baumohl of the advisered Economic Group Group.
"This coordinated action of the Central Banks probably reduced the recession in the United States of a 65 percent to a 50 percent" added Baumohl in its report.
The banks have already paid $60 million, especially in the United States.
Economists are waiting for thousands of losses.
"The central banks must really be afraid of what they hoped still when they decided to give this step," said the main economicist of ABN Amro, Kieran Davies.
"It may be that the situation is really bad" added.
The Central Banks fear that they have the same problems of access to the costs and therefore they need to provide more slightly to their customers.
This would reduce the consumption and send to the American economy to the reaction with different impacts in the growth of the world economy.
The Central Banks thus decided, after not pursuing the LIBOR tariff call, the London Inter-Bank tariff that was used for the cost of money in the inter-banc market.
This means that banks have constantly feared to be provided for money even when the Central Banks of the United States, Canada and Great Britain reduced their number of times of interest.
"The same effect as another fall of the types of interest," said the Reuters Agency, Greg Salvation of the Tempus Consulting Company.
Some economicists are not surprised that the step given by the Central Banks contributes to enhance the crisis because it does not solve the fundamental problem that is the fall of the real estate market in the US.
Klaus: Discussions of ecologists are incredible
Global climate change affects particularly developing countries.
President Václav Klaus again expressed the problem of global warning.
Critical was now closed by the United Nations International Conference on Climate Change in Bali.
In Vienna, where he presented his book Azul, not green planet, commented that the discussions of the ecologists are incredible.
According to Klaus is unacceptable not only the structure of the conference that creates a foreign mixture of government representatives and non-governmental organizations, but the fundamental difference between the retomic and reality.
"There are still the debates structured, are artificial words fires, solution institutions to the current problems", said Klaus.
The Czech President during the presentation of his book emphasized that this issue is very important for him and that it is therefore interested.
He also expressed her joy to discover his book translated to the German because, as he said, "Muchtimes I only meet me with the loading of my ideas."
Now interested can be informed about their various opinions.
Klaus remembered that it is not a climate but he has, according to his view, sufficiently due to write a book like this.
It is academic, with capacity to follow and judge specialized disertization, has experiences with statistics and is also economic.
At the main time of the closure, he expressed its thought that climate is constantly changed and that its changes are normal, that there is no agreement between scientists, that the consequences of the current changes are not so large and serious, nor represent possible disasters and that the attempts to affect climate development are ineffective, ineffective and costlessly unacceptable.
In addition, as a man experimented with the totalisms believes that it is unacceptable to impose the views not tested to others, which feels like a dangerous way of limiting the freedom of others.
On the questions of the present, it repeated that it is not against "the reasonable environmental defenders, but against the ecologists that do not take into account the relationship between costs and benefits."
The same topic spoke in Vienna for two months ago in the Hayes Institute.
600,000 people have not reached to change their cardinal
To six hundred thousand leaders have been held the date and therefore they have not reached its old cardinal to conduct which validity ends at the end of the year.
Today, it is the last day when people can ask changes to make officials time until the end of the year to emit the new carnet.
However, the Ministry does not fear that after the new year, there are hundreds of thousands of leaders without the valid carrier.
According to trafficking, the carne has not principally changed those who have not even wanted to lead it.
While people announce a rapid decline of carnage change, the metropolis offices are full of requests and the interest for the new carne has increased.
The accommodation calculates about 2.000 daily customers.
The collars are waiting for a half hour.
In Prague, the new cardinal has not yet been brought out of about 140,000 conductors.
The emission of an emission of a new corner for 20 days.
However, it is possible to request cardin emission in a shorter period of five days.
But in that case the conductor must pay five hundred crowns.
The conductors who obligatoryly should change their car and not reach until the end of year, but they will go out to the ways without the valid carrier will be removed to a lot from January.
The infractor will pay a maximum of two thousand crowns.
The police can correct crime with an amonestation.
In case of administrative offence, the majority will be up to 2.500 crowns.
According to the previous information, a lot of those persons who do not go anywhere.
They could be able to pay up to 30,000 crowns.
The Ministry has appealed to the offices to enter a moderately many of thousand crowns, as a maximum.
According to the vocal of the Department of Transport, Karel Hanzelka, many of thousand crowds do not threaten anyone.
According to him, the behaviour is a document in which people can decide whether they want it or not.
It is not the identity card that each person must have valid.
People who don't want to lead should be delivered to the carnace.

The court turned the penalty to Berdych's complaints.
The former police Josef Opva and Petr Ko nețțaa's compliance accused with the crime David Berdych will pass between thirty and ten years in prison.
The Supreme Court of Prague decided as a definitive result of the reduction of penalties, the first to one year and the second to two years.
At the detectives of the Department against the organized crime, they would in principle fall between 14 and 12 years.
In contrast to today's decision, only by revocation by the Supreme Court.
Berdych is also accused in this case but he is first waiting for him the Court of First Instance.
Despite this in other processes, it has already been sentenced to a total of 16 years.
You can't receive any more.
In January, the District Court recognized the participation of 19 persons and the Supreme Court, today, to 16 of them.
Most accuses of accused were rejected by the investigation for cases invented.
According to the Senate of the Central Bohemia, the police members in accordance with Berdych have passed information from the police sources of criminals, covered the robots and helped criminal group members to avoid criminal penalty.
These crimes delivered the 30 percent of their robot to Opva and Ko nețțak.
The prosecution refers to criminal acts carried out by the group between 1999 and 2001.
With regard to the robot, his victims suffered serious impact in their health but also accused of the abuse of power as public agents and without allowance of weapons.
In the home registry, the police found arms, munition with a steel narrow, a Laser guide and a furniture.
The Criminal Group, according to the accusation, rolled tens of millions of coronas.
Excepting almost a thirteen of men in this process, the court has already recognized Berdych and other unfair.
Other men related to the case of Berdych are still declared by other processes, and in some cases they have not yet appeared.
Tomáš P月t and Maroš μulej, who have now not been sentenced, are in prison in Ireland, where the final decision on their delivery to the authorities of the Czech Republic is expected.
A account to change some children: 12 million
To change some children in the maternity House the lawyer of the affected families Igor Veleba, Igor Veleba wants from the hospital of Tischebič 12 million crowns of compensation of the expenditure.
For each of the mothers, three million, for parents, two million, and for children, a million.
The hospital offers a maximum of 200,000 for each father.
The legal representative of the hospital, Ond月ej Dostali is not in principle in accordance with Veleba's proposal.
"The question we don't approve her, it's too high," said Dostali after today's meeting.
"Of we can make an idea of this contra-proposal, we need the report of the specialist sent by the contraparty to investigate.
We'll advise if he's got a resumer.
Let's keep the view that there will be hundreds of thousands of them all" said Dostali.
The amount should be moved between 100,000 and 200,000 crowns for each of the parents.
At the beginning of the cause, Jablo's family wants, every month who didn't cried to his biological daughter, a million crowns.
Velaba was served as a basis for negotiating the compensation of the report of the specialist, only that he was developed in the Motol hospital's power in Prague.
The parents of girls according to psychology and psychology specialists suffered from psychic and stress of different levels and deepness.
The situation of stress was better supported by men, although they were painted with recriminations for the change of girls.
Women's bringing him worse with the traumy they are currently living, and with regard to what happens today, Veleba completed.
Veronica and Nicola were changed by the nurse in the House of maternity in the past year, the ninth December.
The past week, girls returned to their biological parents, Nicola to the Hermákový to Pćibyslavic, and Veronica to Libor Bro月 and Jaroslava Trojanova in Jablo.
The Governor of Vysočina, Miloš Vystračil, gave to each family 100,000 crons as compensation expenditure for the error committed in the hospital of Tãebič, which is managed by the region.
All hospitals of the Czech Republic are guaranteed by law as responsibilities for damage.
In case of errors, the reservation fund must be removed and extraordinaryly may request the administrator's assistance.
The Court has recognized them a proportionally low compensation, the amounts calculated according to the tables contained in hundreds of thousands and extraordinaryly of a million crowns.
Polyvka lost the Kingdom of Valaquia
Boek Polivka lost the flood on the Kingdom of Valaquia.
According to the jurisdiction of the provincial court of Ostrava was the first who used the Kingdom Mark, but the project was created for many years by Tomáš Harabiš with whom the actor cooperated.
Polivka has not been presented today to the oral view.
According to your lawyer, the cause has probably not been completed and its customer will return.
"The pleasure is that Mr. Harabiš and his team are a couple of parsits of the popularity of Bolek Polívka," said the lawyer of Polyvka.
For him, before the words of the Kingdom of Valaquia, the image of the actor and the coomous.
The same idea also has Harabiš.
"We'll take a few ten years of work.
Search for money and invention" said.
For him, the cause of the feed is in the money.
"After years I found that the project has successful and that this could also receive something.
They want to live as parasits of our job" added.
A lucrative business
According to the Court, the Kingdom of Valaquia was first used by Polivka in its television programme.
In 1993, Radoslav Brzobohatý was coronated by the actor.
Then he was not trying to orientate him to the creation of a Kingdom of Faith.
Some years later in Harabiš was editing the Kingdom of Valaquia.
From that coomico original, a business and a lucrative business activity that Harabiš created after the Kingdom Society of Valaquia.
In 1997, Polivka agreed in the use of its name and signing in the sports and also offered its owners to visit visitors of his grandfather and assistants to their spectrum.
Who will sit on the throne?
The judge today also determined that Harabiš only used a simple idea that Polivka had made public in the scenario for its own business benefit.
"It is clear that Bolek Polívka helped the popularity of the Kingdom of Valaquia," said the judge.
He added, however, that in the spirit of the project Harabiš and its team they were fully dedicated to it.
Cooperation, between the disappeared parties, continued until 2000 when Harabiš organized the official coronation in Poland.
Since that moment, they started conflicts between Polivka and Harabiš whose culture came with the destruction of the "Rey Boleslav I, the elected forever."
The main role in the Kingdom, through the middle of Harabiš, deployed in the song Jarmila úlllaková, as the queen.
In 2002, Polívka presented an accused against Harabiš and its society that has been rejected by the court until now.
Something clear could be brought to the lits, the tour by the throne with his princes, which is already preparing Harabiš.
He should get out of him the new king.
You don't want to read more data or dates.
"We don't have any pressure.
I should have something like the king's way to Moravia.
The King should be elected at a specific date.
Even Mr Polívka can be presented" added Harabiš.
Test Peugeot 207 SW 1.6 VT: supervised prejudices
I've never liked the Peugeotu 206 too much.
His traffic characteristics were never anything special, the quality of the change chain, manabra and the product could also be characterised as under the average.
But now there is on the market its successor, the Peugeot 207, and this is much better.
This Combi called SW is a little more advanced and me, I just think it better.
When I tested the classic Peugeot 207 five doors, for example, I wanted, for example, the room of the head in the back seat.
But this would be the only desire because the Combi's Combi carrier means in this sense, that I will not suffer the two meters of length.
Flying through the world
I'm past through the inside quickly so that I don't repeat it too much.
This is an elegant design where the only defect is the poor central tunnel.
Here would value more design invention, even though the car already seems pretty elegant.
The seats are comfortable, there remain the time we left from seat and supported shorts.
In addition to the 206 model, the bilateral address has significantly improved.
And the space? and here you can feel how they have grown the railway measures.
The Combi disappears the citated out of space in the header.
Delivers the massive
But the main thing in this vehicle is your malicious.
This must be worth it as very accessible (grade to the back-abatable port) and a well-distributed storage.
The dead spaces are equipped with gun cubes that offer an ideal solution.
They do not molest, and can be extended to the point of subjecting weak objects.
But let's stay in the depository.
According to the tables, a 428 litres capacity has more than a average value in comparison with competition.
But not in comparison with the vehicle of the same type sold in the Czech Republic, the Combian Fabi.
If we compare the 207 SW with the new generation of the Mladata Boleslav model, we will find that the Peugeot will be seen with its 52 litres.
From vacations to the foreigner or to colocar the child's carrier is critical.
But if it had to comment something positive then I have to cite the pool that remains quite ground after fighting the second line's support.
120 horses in four goods
Our car caption was equipped with a injection injection of four balls on a capacity of 1.6 l. and a 88 kW force.
And truly, it's how it should seem to be a 1600 more than the family five doors.
It's quiet, consumer little and, above all, has an impulsion.
If I compare it with the time of the nickcoda then it seemed like if the flight tube had been tapped by a trap, I can say that with it I could be impressed.
The prices answer
The car price is not for all cups.
We must, however, take into account that we have equippedly equipped vehicle and a very good motor.
The basic price of the car with injection of 1400 per 329.900 crowns is still possible.
Our addingers put it from 410 900 crowns, which is too much.
The Premium type has already reached any 80,000 crowns.
Only we'd still have airbag in the headers, auto-conditioned air, automatically clean parameters, automatized posting windows...
It's mean, the car with everything, about 531.900 crowns.
It's a lot, but looks at the team complements in the Fabia and you'll get a quite similar number.
Now you are only decided by what of the two marks.
Slovak students do not integrate in English schools
In English schools are children from Eastern Europe and therefore places fear more changes in schools.
The integration of Eastern Europeans now is only a series of problems.
Even British schools register the cases where migrant conflicts between migrants and children of nationals increase violence.
The problem of the integration of children in Eastern Europe in the British schools is very well illustrated in the northern city of Kent, where it begins to grow conflicts between the Native and Slovak migrants.
Discussions, extortion and sources between students have already reached their own parents.
The situation came so far as the Chatmam police arrested a Slovak woman who was throwing arms to a ten-year student with a green steel.
In her defense, she said that the girl was insulting her son with racist tongues.
The police also had to act after an attack with two young girls of age against a Slovak migrant.
The girls bowed him with ractic hurts and threw him stones.
"When we lived home, a boy came to us at the end of the bus and began to worry about us.
When I told him to leave him he made us the alleged of manzans and perses, and then he turned the pantalons and showed us his back" he described another disagradable accident for The Times, the mother of the Slovak student.
The juices are both of both sides.
One of the Natives also designed conflict with Eastern Europe migrants as to fight for survival.
The cases already mentioned previously show us as the environment in English schools starts to be quite weak.
In Britain, there are 70,000 Slovaks who have come here for work reasons.
Approximately 3000,000 Slovak students attend English schools.
Cuba, the most beautiful island of the Caribbean
For visitors, it is really the island of freedom.
Everything waiting for your holidays can be achieved, always you choose correctly.
Sleeves and sleeping players, big olives or a quiet sea like a storm.
palms and all included with camels offering pigs on the beach, wheat or variety of cocktails.
Kitesurfing, golf and government.
In the Caribe Island, you can find all this and much more.
Only in a island is still much more and this island is Cuba, the most beautiful and most beautiful of all the largest islands.
At the time of the Spanish, Cuba was the basket of America's conquistation.
Colon called her, the most beautiful place that human eye has seen.
Habana became store and load port of the spanish treasures out of America and brought to Europe.
And then it came to the American epoca.
The National Hotel grew up at the end of the 20 years.
He commanded him to build one of the chiefs of the American Mafia Mafia, Lucky Luciano, because everything in the UEU (and therefore prohibited) was welcomed and supported in Cuba as drugs, game and prostitution.
Among their invitations, among others
Winston Churchill, Ava Gardner, Frank Sinatra.
In the Habana, high buildings were high, even inventories cut the cars that were a worship symbol in the past 50th century.
Ernest Hemingway bought a bathroom in San Francisco of Paula, near the Habana, and in Cojimar had his bed.
In the walls of the Middle East, his signs left the stars of the world of the spectrum and political of all America.
And today?
In the walls of the Bodeguita you can also leave your autograph.
In the card bar, National Hotel mixes the cottage according to its desires.
And these cars have already been served in the 50-year-olds, until now they're still working by La Habana, because those Lada and Fiat who have already arrived have oxidated between these home and wind winds.
Even when La Habana, particularly the old barrier is deteriorated notably, there is no such wonderful colonial monuments as there.
Other places are metamorfose in beauty, for example, Trinity.
Because tourism is so necessary, its development is guaranteed.
In the last 15 years, new hotels grew up not only in La Habana but also in Varader, in the coast of the province of Holguin and in isslots like Cayo Coco, Cayo Guillermo and others.
Cuba still offers a curiosity that is in the only world and that is very valued by the loves of the rail.
The sugar cake is transported from the largest plants to the sugar manufacturing by stretching ways in vapor or electric machines.
Your cars for decades haven't been discovered and now they are there, machines that function and the models of brothers who are in other parts of the world only are found in museums.
Where are you going?
The most known place for most visitors does not change.
And therefore, there is no need to speak more about La Habana or Varader.
Maybe, only remember that in the already quote of Hemingway there is a museum than those who love the writer, they must not leave visit him.
The Viñales valley is the most paintoric rinner of Cuba on the west of the island.
Exploiting vegetation growing in warm rock lands.
Mogotes, hot rock pills and high scarped rocks in the valley falls, and in their greens are accompanied with the fruitful lands thanks to which rockards are shaped hiding dense vegetation.
The valley is the place where it is collapsed, probably the highest quality tabak in Cuba.
Visiting some of the clean oil manufacturers can be found with your final product.
Maybe somebody's interesting view that there was the chile of the series, Mayor Zeman.
Trinity
An old city I promise that it was founded not much after the Spanish colonizing the island.
Slavery and sugar brought her name and richness.
The riches became beautiful with the constructions in the small city.
The Spanish colonial architecture, particularly affected by the French colonies coming later, has already changed in four centurys.
Trinity, between the sea and the screen of Escambray, is a so-called place that in the past 50th century there was no way to join her with the rest of the country.
This island helped her to stay outside the rest.
Nothing was built new and so, nor, nothing was destroyed, because every person was happy to have where to live.
If you have more time to be in Trinity than one late, you'll like to know interesting places in the neighbors like the Anconn Playa or the valley of the sugar manufacturings.
the night belongs to the Music House, which souls with his music the silence of the morning.
Baracoa
A small city in the west of Cuba, some consider it as the most beautiful island.
With security this view is already confirmed by the own way.
The two roads coming from Guantánamo must pass through high and brown mountains, as well as by a nature that are sometimes known by the action of man.
This Eastern place of Cuba has been registered as human heritage by UNESCO thanks to its intact nature.
There are the best chocolate, in his church, they have the cross of Colon (in fact it is a cross that has come 100 years later from the departure) and from the hill, where the castle was found and now there is a hotel with its name, there can be seen the mountains and among them the most known, the Yunque.
Café, ron, pures, Sierra Master, the Bahia of the Cochinos and the island of Pinos, the Cabaret Tropicana, the sponsor of Cuba, the Virginia of the Carity, the Santiago, African religion that practiced the descendants of those slaves, of all this could be filled with many pages.
But, as it is said, it is better to see once.
The friends are passengers in Afghanistan, say the Americans
A few soldiers and insufficient equipation needs is what is affecting the mission's journey in Afghanistan.
OTAN, according to the American Defence Minister, Robert Gates, should design a specific plan for the next years.
The mission in Afghanistan is not as it was thought, they participated in Edinburgh (Switzerland) representatives of countries with troops in the south of the country.
At the same time as the conflicts with the movement of Taliban today, the eight participating States discuss the plans and coordination of the fellow citizens.
While the United States this week through his Defence Minister, Robert Gates, encouraged OTAN's forces to greater activity, Britain saw it as a priority to strengthen the African Government authority and the repair of development assistance.
"Environment in Afghanistan is palpable but armed forces can only be one of the solutions.
The following is possible to the population they only can start economic and security development," said BBC emisor the defence Minister, De Browne.
The nine percent
The activity of Afghan rebels according to data of the American army is greater than in the last five years.
The number of violent actions increased in comparison with the last year in a 27 percent, and in the province of Helmand up to 60 percent.
OTAN countries in Afghanistan have about 400,000 soldiers in which the fourth part is southern the territory.
However, for the United States, the Allians have reached the same limit as the organization and equity of units.
More helicopters, soldiers and experts are precisely requested to conduct Afghan units.
"We will like to think seriously about specific objectives for the future and how we get it," said Gates.
In a similar sense, the Secretary-General of the OTAN, Jaap de Hoop today also spoke.
"I'm not glad to know what we have on the earth and the sky in Afghanistan.
We have a nine percent of soldiers and teams that we would need, and that's a little", said De Hoop to the Reuters Agency in the meeting closure of three days with the Japanese government in Tokio.
Who is passive
In the past months, there is a polymic of whether all citizens have the maximum of the Afghan.
For passive, Germany was criticised, for example.
"The Germans have a relative number of replacements in Afghanistan.
But they are in a minimum violence area and the needs of fight there are not so high as in our, in the south and east of the country," said Gates.
The Sun sensationist journal, this week, he called the German soldiers vagos.
"Afgan rebels discover that the Germans dedicated to play while our boys fighten" wrote Sun in a material accompanied with German soldiers photographs playing the table tenis.
The German Image answered the attack and published a photograph where the British troop played a rugby game on the south of Afghanistan.
State debt will reach the bill in 2009
The State must be 84,000 crowns.
In September 842,700 million crowns were reached to total debt.
This year, the Government was planned to be 159,200 million crowns.
However, at the beginning of December, the Ministry reiterates the plan to 152.800 million crons thanks to the improvement of the development of the State Budget economy.
The State debt of the Czech Republic increased at the end of September to 842.700 million crowns.
In nine months this year, it increased in 40,200 million crowns.
Since June, 13.400 million crowns reduced.
Today, the Ministry of Economy confirmed its data on the debt of the state of October principles.
For each chick, the debt corresponds to 84,000 crowns.
Over the past year, the State was deployed with more than 111 million crowns.
"For now it seems to be that we could pass through the border of crown box until 2009.
In the next year the debt should be moved between 90 million and the crown bill" said to the iHNed.cz server, the economicist of Patria Finance, David Marek.
It also appears likely to see the economicist of the Next Finance, Vladimír Picora: "We could pass the bill in 2009.
Exactly when this will depend on the next budget we don't know yet.
If it is seen that the situation in the changed political scene and politics would be able to retain, then it could be overcome to 2010.
But I don't see this change." He added it.
The duty growth
The debt of the state creates debts in the central government and, above all, arise of the accumulation of the deficit of the State Budget.
The debt of the State is paid by goods of the treasure, State obligations, direct credits or for example costs from the European Investment Bank.
The internal environment of the state has increased this year from 38.500 million to 719.400 million crowns.
External debt has grown from 1.700 million coronas to 123.300 million coronas.
The debt of the business state at the end of September contained 803,300 million crowns from June to 13.700 million crowns.
The average cost of the State debt increased in 6.5 years.
"The total annual debt of the first to the third quarter has created a 13 percent that is largely given by the economy.
It is interesting that growth is generated above all the obligations where a growth is 20 percent.
It's bad that debt grows but otherwise shows that it is going to negotiate until there is a reform of pensions" Picora commented.
Better than waiting
The State Debt Strategy for 2007 was extraordinary that the Government had planned this year 159,200 million crowns.
At the beginning of December, the Ministry reduced the plan of 152,800 million crons thanks to the improvement of the development of the State Budget.
The amount is mainly composed of the deficit of the state budget that this year will be of 76 million crowns instead of the proposed 91.300 million coronas.
The rest consists of maximum resources planned for the Czech Agency of consolidation with approximately 13.300 million coronas, the reservation of 10 million crons for pension payment, 43 million crons to finance state obligations and 1.800 million crons in payment of the European Investment Bank.
It compared today before a court in Jarthum to give a name to a peak-shake
The British professor judged in Sudan for the blaspheme to Islam has been condemned Thursday by the late by a court of Jarthum at 15 days of prison and exemption, noted his lawyer.
Britanica was accused of having left schools from 6 to 7 years to give the name of Mahomet to a peak thumb when any representation of the Islam’s prophet is illegal.
It was past of a lactic penalty.
This British school teacher of 54 years in the High School Unity of Jarthum in Sudan has been detained on Sunday in his home and inculted to the Islam and Section, in accordance with article 125 of the Sudan Criminal Code, due to several complaints of schools to the Swedish Ministry of Education.
The story is actually remonted in September, when this teacher asks his students, of 6/7 years of age, to choose a name for the class's skin shoe.
"On names come out of the mouth of children, such as Hassan, Abdullah and Mohammed, ", see the director of the school Robert Boulos.
Finally, after a vote in class, 20 children from each 23 have chosen Mohamed as a favorite name.
Mohamed is certainly the name of the Muslim prophet, but mostly a very common name in Sudan.
Then the children have performed a book for the class with the photo of the ooz with the next league "My name is Mohamed."
He himself had no label with this name, but the problem is just the representation of the prophet considered as an insult to Islam.
One of the muslim colleagues of Gillian Gibbons, professor at the same school in Sudan, said that he knew her well and that he would never have done something that could be blaspheming to a religious faith, "I'm sorry only that he had asked children to vote for a name ", it is only a " unresolved error ".
Opinion divided by numerous students of school teacher that describes it as " very attention to their students " and " which never speaks of religion " .
Remember that the name Mohamed is also the secondest name given in British Britain, it is written in English with 14 different ways.
This name often chosen by Muslim families is a way to honor the prophet (often given to the first child of a family).
But what are the rules that are involved in the use of this name?
Can we, for example, give a player?
It is of course a question of interpretation.
The Wednesday has not reached a agreement on the future status of the province, during the last meeting of negotiations in Vienna.
Finally, the fracase.
The Serbians and the Kosovo Albanians have ended the morning in Baden, Austria, a sixth and last discussion meeting without able to overcome their differences on the future status of the separate province.
" It is unfortunate that the parties have not been able to reach an agreement on the statute ", declared the European Ombudsman Wolfgang Ischinger during a press conference in Vienna.
Submitting that peace in the region was " in play ", his American homologus Frank Wisner, urged Belgrado and Pristina to respect its commitments to maintain peace and dialogue beyond the end of negotiations.
" We are not prejudiced to violence for now but entering in a very difficult period " , he added, noting that " clear tensions exist ".
End of average on 10 December
Thronic mediators, which reacts the European Union, the United States and Russia, will last month in Serbia and Kosovo.
The future of the Poland province to 90% of Albania could be more clear when Ischinger, Wisner and Russian mediator Alexander Botsane-Khartchenko will return their relationship to the United Nations Security Council from here to 10 December.
Baden's discussions, near Vienna, were the sixth and last negotiations since the throck was undertaken by a new mediation by the United Nations in the past August.
US and European believes that their media will be completed on 10 December.
The Russians, which have already blocked the Security Council ' s concession of independence in Kosovo, insist in a persecution of the negotiations beyond this deadline.
" Russia was and remains engaged in favour of a negotiated solution, a commitment solution," said Botsane-Khartchenko.
Declaration of unilateral independence?
After eight years of administration of the United Nations of Kosovo, Wests consider that independence under monitoring the European Union is the only viable solution.
Pristina is prepared to announce it unilaterally if the Security Council does not resolve its favour.
Belgrade insists in a relied autonomy.
"Wellfelt, no agreement has been found," announced the President of the Autonomical Autority of Kosovo, Fatmir Sejdiu, in the Baden hotel, where these "debates of the last opportunity" were held in the Baden hotel.
Hashim Thaci, the former commander of the rebellion of Kosovo and the future Prime Minister of the province, has made part of his pain.
But he added that the autonomy plan presented by Belgrade " belonged to a past he led to murder and deportation."
" home effect "
The Serbian Chairman Boris Tadic was considered by its part that an commitment was always made, warranting the majority of Kosovo against the consequences of a unilateral declaration of the independence of the province.
Belgrade has particularly feared a " home effect " in a region still detained by the Independence Wars of 1990.
" For Serbia, this does not mean that an commitment is impossible."
On Tuesday, the Serbian delegation had stressed that each decision was exclusively providing the Security Council, in which his Russian partner has a veto right.
" The Kosovo Parliament will have the last word "
" Only a solution in the Security Council is acceptable for Serbia," said the First Serbia Minister, Vojislav Kostunica.
" Those negotiations have been held two years.
They must be completed as they have started: in the Security Council. "
To the journalists, Fatmir Sedjiu had responded that " the Kosovo Parliament had the last word on the status " , adding that any unilateral declaration of independence of the Albania would be " in concertation with the West.

As always in this kind of events, official versions and rulers are opposed.
What are the circumstances of the accident?

Spectacular reflection on space station
It will be lacking more than seven hours of work in the space of Scott Parazynski astronauta and its partners of tripulation of the International Space Station (ISS) to carry out the spectrum of a deployed and essential solar panel for the continued scientific activities of the station.
An arrayed output which assembled the records because of its duration, of its allocation of the habitable modules, of the speed with which it has been imagined, "catched" tools for the astronautes to perform the reparation.
The problem appeared on Tuesday when the astronautes had released from the Lancedera Discovery the Harmony module, a cylindric green piece that was in charge of collecting the European scientific and Japanese laboratory (see contained).
This module is a type of aircraft for laboratory modules.
But you have to be able to prove them in electricity.
The second task of the tripulation was therefore to move an electricity production module with solar panels that decrease 17.5 tonnes, already present in the ISS, to put it into its final position.
Following it, tripulation started the reorganization of the sun panels of the module that had a 76 meters square.
And it is where one of the panels, which are deployed as a scordene, has been damaged at a little more or less than one meter for a cable that was attracted.
Deployment has been stopped to no longer damage the panel.
The astronautes, who had the principle to carry out a control output of the Discovery Lanceer, and then go to repair another solar panel whose rotation system was defected, were forced to dedicate to the damaged panel.
And it's Scott Parazynski who has been elected to go to caracollate at the end of the 30 meters of the tele-direct arm added to the station to perform the reparation.
It's one of the best "spacewalker" (spaceandler) of Nasa.
High, resistent, very shelter, has the very developed tower and long arms.
At the age of 46, this doctor of training has been responsible for "operating" the solar "hered".
After inspected exactly the damage, he sealed the false cable and installed types of "tabels" in the damaged zone.
He had helped you the second " Spacewalker " which was staying close to the air closure and, from the inner, by other astronautes like Peggy Whitson, the commander of the tripulation.
The tool that he used, a hockey ministry contained with isolation to avoid electrocution in the sun panels produced several hundreds of volts, has been conceived and "catched" by the astronautes on the board of the station.
Once the operation ended, Scott Parazynski hoped that the panel should be completely deployed before making the inventory of its instruments and return to the inner station.
Yesterday, the astronautes had gone out of a middle of disappearance before today, seven astronautes returned from the Discovery Lanceder for the return to the Earth planet.
The title of EADS sanctified in Bolsa
The EADS action is currently lower to the Paris Bolsa, after the A400M aircraft and defence group has announced that it should be exempt between 1,2 and 1,4 million euros to take account of the A400M pensions.
EADS is now 4% to 21,96 euros to the Paris Bolsa.
The group was obligation to revise its prevision of the operational result for 2007 in response to the delays generated by the slow progress of the A400M engine development, which constitutes the inaugural flight of the aircraft.
The cost for the delay taken in the delivery of the military transport aircraft stated in October is assessed " between 1,2 and 1,4 million euros from which more than 1 million to Airbus has announced the mother house of the European EADS constructor.
Following these loads, EADS will be forced to announce new objectives of the 2007 operational result during the presentation of its trimesteral results on Thursday, adds without any more encrypted precise.
The group also indicates that the estimation of new loads is consistent with the period of six months.
It should be remembered that the operational result of EADS was 86% in 2006, mostly due to charges linked to other programme delays, the very green A380 portrait.
At the beginning, the Group was the first A400M delivery to the French army in October 2009.
The selection of the status where
No surprises on the Sunday, on the outcome of the towns: the Russians are going to operate massively for the party of President Poutine, Russia.
Confirming its aspiration to stability, including the authorism, after a very limited campaign.
At three days of the legislative elections, the Russian President Vladimir Putin guides the electors today a televised message on public chains, already registered but its content is stored secretly.
It makes it as a manager of the list for the Joint Russia, the pro-Kremlin game whose victory is discovered.
Tomorrow, the Chairman left nothing to be transpared by receive foreign immigrants, endeavouring a new burden against the West accused of inherence - its theme of prediction during the campaign.
"We know the price of a true democracy and we want honorable, transparent and more open elections, without incidents " added.
According to the opposition, we are very far from the truth.
Declaration of a campaign missing by pressures.
The communist leader Guennadi Ziouganov says that there is no "jamy had such sweet elections, until Eltsin's time ".
After the repression of the manifestations of the last week end, the former Jake Garry Kasparov world campaign, condemned to five days of prison for illegal manifestation, the visits are prohibited according to their submission.
"The Russians watched the mentality of the soviet man."
After these uncertain legislation elections, two more open questions are transmitted:
Who will happen to Poutine at the presidency?
The Official Journal published yesterday the first tour of the presidency election on 2 March 2008; candidates had until 23 December to meet them.
In 2000 and again elected in 2004, Vladimir Putin cannot request the third pursuant mandate.
Then no successor emerges.
What paper will Poutine play after March?
Preparing Minister?
Chief of the parliamentary majority and the very powerful Russian party that would choose the government and the President?
Whatever the legislative elections such as the presidency, the triunfare power will be.
It's a tradition.
"The Russians watched the mentality of the soviety man, not seen owners of his destination ", estimates the Lev Goudkov Socilog, the independent centre of Levada.
The Nikolai Kopossov, of the State University of San Petersburg, has been far away: the civil society was attracted in this country, Christianized five centuries after Europe; the famous spirit of the community retained the training of individualism.
After the free reforms of the 1990s, Poutine renewed the model of a fatherly State, perfectly accepted by the population since this new paternalism has not been followed by terrorism, but by a certain economic disappearance ", Mary Lipman estimates the Carnegie Foundation.
Today the Russians " refused by their own will to the personal responsibility " of which shortly tested after the URSS exchange.
"Why do you reflect?"
The phenomenon touches all the social capabilities, including the world of matters.
And the administrative election thinks to keep the status quo: 65 leaders (of each 85 russ captains) lead the local lists of Russia.
New Western's importated freedoms are often synonyms of caos, such as in the 1990s.
The view is to prevent the stability.
In the name of the Russians will not vote nor for extremists.
Conclusion of Tamara Tcherednitchenko, Professor of 54 years: " What to reflect?
The power is not too bad, why do you change them?"
A severe memory
After more than 60 years of confidential nature, the national files of Bad Arolsen, described the destinations of 17.5 million victims of the Hitlerian regime, are in free access.
The 47 million files documents, stored about 27 km of stories to Bad Arolsen (Hesse), were not only consulted until here at a "humanship" end, i.e. individually and nominatively, at the request of an old victim or their law.

Since the process of ratification of this agreement has been completed by all States, reception is effective since yesterday.
Sensible information
Access of the stories to Bad Arolsen will allow searching " particularly on the movement of prisoners, the population of the fields and the health of forced workers ", the director of these files managered by the International Commission of the Royal Cruz (CICR).
Until recently, several States, such as Germany, were opposed to the public of these nominative documents, because of the sensitive nature of certain information.
As the proposed homosexuality or the mental hondicap of certain victims of deportation.
The records of the concentration fields or of the detention orders established by the Gestapo had been gathered after war at a practical end: finding the countries deported or undertaken in the obligatory work and eventually bringing them a test of their internation in order to open the road to their compensation.
Still today in Bad Arolsen, more than 300 permanent asalariats are treated by tens of individual requests.
However, for a part of the scientific community, the access to Bad Arolsen has revised limited interest.
"There is essentially new to wait for these documents, " said professor Wolfgang Benz, director of the Beach Research Centre at the Berlin Technical University.

Montreal faces Terminator
It's not easy to cross hollywoodian films to Montreal when nothing else than Terminator is opposed to this...
This setting mission is part of the deletion functions.
A mandate - "politically difficult" because the manager of California, Arnold Blackenegger, declares the "walaway productions".
Is it difficult to combine with the "Governator"?
"I have to be careful, it's the industry that decides where it goes.
If you find that the conditions in Montreal are favourable, you're going there.
Our paper is to offer those who are going to judge the best," says.
The road to the festivals
At this time, the priority of Denis Turcotte is, however, the promotion of the movie from here.
The Oskares' road is started.
All festivals of the West Costa, which is Sundance, Denver, Seattle or San Francisco, will have to submit the Czech films, give them value and ensure that the manufacturers make interviews.
The Early of darkness had a good picture at 30° Mille Valley Film Festival, a few weeks ago.
It will be submitted to Palm Springs International Festival in January.
Shake Hands with the Devil is in cardler a Santa Monica and will be presented on 30° Starz Denver Film Festival in November.

Will it be rally at the end of the year? The experts, divided by the 'subscribe' crisis.
At least five weeks to disappear the closure of the year, the investors are already cut off the hands while waiting for the traditional rally end of the year.
However, the experts are not so clear that this will be produced.
Banif believes that "after the statistical view point, the month of December in boss would have a positive behaviour.
However, there should not be previsions based exclusively on statistics, but still because in the current context, uncertainty has increased in the markets at least in short term."
Although they are not parties that the carrier bottle in the last weeks of the year, these experts advise that "the bustatal market is subject to the existence of liquidity, it is designed to invest the lack of alternatives with guarantees, especially the fixed revenue, affected by the effect of the huge effect to quality values both in long traffics and in courts".
For this reason, they believe that the boost will have a better bilateral behaviour, not exemption of oliveness "there all because it is not known the impact of the likely deployment of the types of the Fed, given the high level of cross and the risk of steel of inflationist tensions".
Javier Barrio, who is responsible for BPI sales in Spain, coincides that it is not a good time to come to say that he's gonna be rally.
"It's not the thing for much joy," ensures the expert.
Ibex lost nearly 4% of the maximum marked on 8 November when the index closed at 15.945.7 points.
However, not all experts have this very negative vision.
John Solana, intermoney analist, believes that Ibex 35 could close the year nearer than 16,000 points thanks to the restructuring of cards and traditional contributions to the pension plans that are produced every year in these dates.
However, the expert regrets that things will be something different this year because the rally is thinking that the Rally will be added to the second week of December after the constitution punch.
The analist does not consider oliveness will affect the market trend.
By its part, Olucha, analist of Bank Investments, valuates that we are close to technical levels and "for this reason we could see a rebound of the index that could be inspired depending on the EEA's news from the U.S. on the consequences of the crisis on the credit market."
The analist trusts that these are positive.
Analysts are agreed on the time to choose the values that will be charged to bring to Ibex to new maximum cats.
Solana, from Intermoney, claims "This year to touch the great values."
The expert would include the two large banks and some constructors "for when the date comes, the electric sector will be very nice."
While Olucha, from bank investments, ensures that submissions will come from the bank and the industrial sector.
The constructors may also benefit from this rally, if they are driving.
"ACS takes several months recovering positions and we hope that other constructors such as Ferrovial and FCC continue the same way," the expert explains.
The cyclical consumption will be protagonist in the last part of the year due to increased sales in the time of boat sales.
On the other hand, the expert believes that technology will also be done so much, though in this case there is no much representation in the Spanish market.
Five times in seven years
In the last seven years, only two times of December has been a month battery.
The real rally end of the year was lived in 2003, in which bustal markets came out of the crisis caused by the technological bush.
This year, in which Ibex 35 had recovered 28.17 per cent, December recorded a rate of 6.68 per cent.
It will be necessary to see if 2007 is the fifth consequence year of winning (for the moment Ibex is 8,36% from January) and if you are able to connect to its end of year.
Popular will open 200 offices 12 hours a Sunday
Popular has decided to renew a large part of its offices.
In total, 200 are located in the most commercial areas of Spain.
These sugars, which will operate under the Max brand, represent a great change for the bank.
Also for the rest of the Spanish entities, as it is the first group decided to give the wages to put in the opening of their agencies up to 20.30 a.m., and open the weeks from 10:00 to 20.30 from late.
Another group who has also reiterated in several occasions that wanted to extend the hours of its subsequents, BBVA, has not yet decided to give the step.
While it is appropriate to close a agreement with the incidents to close the 75% of its offices the sabbaths in change to open a late, although not the public.
The results of the population experience will be decided for other entities or not to this initiative secondly on trade hours.
This is precisely the goal which is pursuing Popular with the project.
Get the particular customers moved through these areas to make their purchases, pims, self-names and trades from the streets selected to open.
The bank wants to have these 200 open offices in all Spain for about 18 months because there are no new openings but the removal of the existing.
For this reason, the entity will modernize the shops already in commercial areas by adapting them to the profile that presents customers from the different streets.
In this way, the extension of the hours is accompanied by a different concept of the sugar space and a new design, more current, with more lighter colours.
The trade bank license, Ángel Rivera, ensures that this restructuring does not provide a larger investment, although a greater staff contract, because it is going to have six employed by local to eight or nine.
The offices, which are also containing spaces to ensure that the pyms can meet there, will sell non-financial products.
A positive experience for the group
Popular has already initiated its initiative in three Madrid offices.
And experience has been positive, according to the River Anngel.
The successors of the Bravo Murillo streets, O'Donnell and Grand Vía in Madrid have been elected, and seems to be acquired, according to River.
Populate currently with 2.500 Sucursals.
And other 60 working under the Mono credit mark, specialized in immigrants, also with very wide hours, which are even opening Sundays and festivals.
In these locales of PopularMax will not repeat the BBVA model, where several of its offices are accounted for a large non-financial saban for their sale.
'We don't want to do the competition to our customers', notice Rivero.
At the moment, they have reached a telephone agreement to sell mobiles, with outdoor staff to the bank.
Double television for the first time the value in Bolsa of your Previous Rival 3
We've done it.
With that sentence, Paul Vasil, the Delivery of Telecinco, in the market closing, found that the chain leading duplicated the value of his rival, beforena 3.
It's just one aspect of his joy: 'and whatever I doubt is not because we've grown more but because we lowered less', he said.
Even so, he emphasized that in a weak market, 'We fell less.'
Telephone ended yesterday, with an advance of 2.54%.
This gain does its loss in what we're carrying a year by 15,66%.
The value in Bolsa of the company controlled by Mediaset (with 52% of the capital) and participated by Vocent (and 13%) is so 4.488.88 million euros according to Bloomberg data.
His previous rival 3, which driving up to 1.52% yesterday, cut a lower of 40.5% from January, cut half of 2.193.46 million.
The value of the other quoted communication companies is 3.571 million in the case of Sogecable; 2.518.53 million Prisa (Five Days Editor) and 1.779 million Welcome.
According to Vasil, the comparison with Previous 3 is that we are talking about two similar enterprises.
The relative fact is how much we are able to do, on the same market, to what cost and how we reward it in terms of hearing."
The telephone announced the past week that this year was intended to be converted into the first television chain in over 1,000 million of gross public income, according to Joseph Tringali, the Deleged Council of Telecommunication and Publicspay, the filial who manages the publicity of the group.
To make this reported date, the television chain would register an increase in 3,6 per cent in its publicity factory for 965.4 million for 2006.
For its part, the previous 3 net factory increased 1.6 per cent in the first nine months of the biennium (by reaching 734.4 million) while the net income of the television increased 0.7 per cent (630.4 million).
One of the factors of analysis for the best evolution in Bolsa of Telechinco is the highest payment that has remained until now: in 2006, Alejandro Echevarira chaired by 100 per cent of the benefit between their shareholders.
Vasil is sure that, though it is ready to take the decision, this ratio could vary after buying 33% of endmol in partnership with his mother Mediaset.
'We have the official commitment to give at least 50 per cent, even though we have always declared much more.
This year, I hope we are able to leave content of our attractors, which we have already given value with 33% of the endmol.
According to the analysis, the market shows at these moments of certain cansanship.
Lehman Brothers recently reduced its benefits on telecommunication in 2008 to 4 per cent and in 2009, 7 per cent.
The income growth of 10.5 per cent to 8.4 per cent in 2008 and 5,5 per cent to 5.1 per cent in 2009 should be explained.
The same sign has declined the prevision of Prena 3 to 4,5 per cent in 2008 and 7.5 per cent in 2009.

This indicator, which serves after Eurostat to include it in the calculation of the inflation index in the European Union, provides a progress on how prices evoluted in Spain during November.
Its publication answers the European Central Bank (ECB) policy to provide equal data in time and quality to producers in the United States.

Totana's alcald for the preest stage of urban corruption
The Civil Guardia has stopped today at the first hour ofmorrow at the current steel of the Totana murcian municipality (the Popular Party) for its early relationship with the urban corruption detained this week.
In addition, one of the secretariats of the composer and the Chief of the Communities were also arrested.
José Martínez Andreo replaced the past May to John Morales, current popular deputy, and until then Register of the municipality, and that according to the sources of research consulted by the Cadena SER, might be the 'cabecilla' of this track.
Actors continue to register the municipal dependences and the advisers of Urbanism and have no further detention in the next hours.
Furthermore, the letter of John Morales, the main suspect of the stage of urban corruption has been detained at the beginning of this week.
As at last, he informed the SER Cadena, the lawyer of the 'Popular' John Morales, so delighted, was detained to him from Morales' home with an important documentation related to theme.
Moreover, the objective of research, according to the sources of research, is the presuppose of Morales commissions as a change to facilitate the signing of a urbanistic convention with a gallegated constructor company to recalify 200 ground hectures.
At the moment, there are eight people detained.
It is well accepting the candidate of the PSOE by Toledo and presiding the Congress if they gain it
The former Minister of Defence José Bono accepted the advertisement of the President of the Government and Secretary-General of the Socialists, José Luis Rodríguez Zapather, to address the list of PSO for the next general elections and to be President of the Congress in the case of the general elections.
Thus, it was announced by the secretariat of the PSOE, Joseph Blanco, and the own Bono, after the meeting he kept this media at the federal seat of this party with Zapatter.
The Chief of the Executive has justified the offer to the former Minister because "the matter is important to count with the best" in political and good life "the same is between the best."
In addition, it has pointed out that "such seems" that the lack of political will be the candidate of the socialist group to preside the Congress, if socialists are coming in the next elections.
It would well be replaced as President of the Congress to Manuel Marin, which published the past 15 November its decision to not be submitted to the next general elections and to leave its road in the active policy to be dedicated to combat climate change in the university.
The former Minister recognized that the President of the Government has not left to stress that he returns to political prosperity since he left it two years ago.
Furthermore, he noted that, as citizens know who would be the Economic Vice-President if the PSOE has gained the elections, their party wished to announce who the Congress will preside in a " Transparency Act".
If the charge is reached, Bono hopes to become the Chamber in "the house of respect and not of the blasphemy or the cry". And to make it that "the citizens always appear more."
"After it seems unfortunately that the only local of Madrid where you can't speak with quietness and so-called is the Congress, the President of the Government at some time interrupted you in the Senate 26 times."
He also had the words of the election for your current President, Manuel Marin and "Sin good to do" and didn't want to see your position to not fall in what, according to what his adversaries might see as "prepotence".
Climate propaganda
Since the movement against climate change is inadmissible to persecution both the sceptics of their predictions and the priorities of other political and social battlees, it is obliged to show an iron coherence.
And more a leader of movement is the President of the Government as Zapater and believes that this fight is more important than Islamic terrorism and it is still proposed to sign a "new contract with the planet".
This planning requires you to explain why the action, or inaction, of its Government has decisively contributed to Spain in the uncompliance of Kyoto.
Whoso is the responsible of the incompliance, in which sectors has been produced and why his Government, the contract with the planet, has not denied it.
In addition, you need to explain with the maximum clarity to Spanish what are the actions you will take to break the climate change.
What enterprises will be affected, what citizens must be changed, what individual energy and collective services we will have to do, what economic consequences will be.
Or, whoever will be sacrificed and who will pay to save the planet.
But it hasn't been, nor will there be such explanations.
Exactly because it's trying to sacrifice and pay.
The climate change measures, real measures, are impulsive.
Costs, inconsistents and threatens for business accounts and individuals.
Until the census of the PSOE suggested has appeared so dangerous to Zapatter that has been pressed to deny it.
Or whether it is, it is to save the planet with nothing, with pure propaganda, with empty slaughters of any real consequence.
Consequent phrases, commissions, committees, protocols, new charges.
With contracts with the planet, this lord is so useful for electoral campaigns that neither speak nor denunciation requires nor requires but worships the ministines and inspiration.
Always it is limited to be a contractually virtually contractual part and it does not imply that we move into bicycle or we reflect the abanic.
Detention of the alcald and the head of the local Totanian police for a predominant stage of urban corruption
The Civil Guardia has detained the housing of Totana wall locality, the "popular" José Martínez Andreo, the head of the local police, the secretariat of the meeting and a hostile company for possible urban crimes, have reported today sources of research.

Furthermore, two persons were not detained but are imputed in the sumary, which teachs the Justice number 1 of Totana.
The first arrested six have passed today to the court provision.
According to the sources, the former Register of Totana and today's autonomous PP parliamentary, John Morales, is investigated.
Furthermore, the former woman, properly from an inmobiliary agency registered today in Totana, has resulted in the same way as the current female of the old registerer, living in the capital Murcia.
The Nuarian Group, the Vigile lawyer and businessman Manuel N.A., was detained in Niger (Pontevedra), as Paul José M.G., Director of Immonuar, integrated agentship in the mentioned group, and through which the soups would have been performed.
Research is carried out by the Urbanistic Delits Unit of the Civil Guardia Unit, whose agents, notably detainees, have been held once records, most in enterprises relating to detainees and places in Madrid, Vigo, Murdia, Pontevedra, Las Rodrids (Madrid) and Totana.

A colleague provides information on the entry into the Criminal Code of Crimes on Internet Downloads:
A. The download of a song would be offended with a pen of six months a year.
On the other hand, if you're stored in the discos on the value of lower than 400 euros, it's just a lack of absence (Article 623.1).
B. If you rolled in the tent up to 1.000 euros, the wheat is already crime, but the pen remains less than the lack of download (Article 234 of the Penal Code).
C. If you run a car and return it 40 hours later, the pen remains lower than the download (Article 244.1).
D. It is less serious to participate in a peel that is involved in the exchange of compacts.
Participation in a dark river has a pen of three months a year (Article 154 of the Penal Code) and exchange would have six months to two years
(Article 270 of the Penal Code).
E. The sexual axis in the work is less serious than down a DVD film, under article 184.2 of the Penal Code.
F. The distribution of films protected by copyright and without authorisation of authors is more punished than the distribution of minor materials (Article 186).
Finally, if my colleague is in the truth, someone goes out of his hand, a very long hand.

My header doctor extends me one of its articles on rare investigations entitled: 'The money produces brain activities, especially if others receive less'.
Or whether the feelings generating the monthly payment of the workers depends on what they gain the fellowships.
The study has been carried out through tomographic resonances at the University of Bonn, and the results are published in the last number of sciences.
According to Bernd Weber, author of the study and director of the Neurocognition Group of the Institute Life–Brain, in Germany: "The strongest activity was produced when the participant was correctly responding and his partner was fair."
The investigators noted that if the two asserted received the same payment, the activity was moderate, but if one received the double, the activity was greater.
I don't know if I'd like to ask this conclusion.
Balkan fiscal
The Pontity Cart takes eight years to continue implacable to the Balkan war crimes from the fiscality of the Criminal Court for the former Yugoslavia, located in the Haye.
His mandate ends at the end of the year, and Carla will go with a farmer sabot, because the main responsible for the murder of Srebrenica, where 8,000 musulman boss died, the former General Ratko Mladic and the former leader serbosium Radovan Karadzic, are still free.
His names are in this list of which the documentary of the Swiss producer Marcel Schubbach, the Carla list (2006), which, with the ritmo of a police thriller, continues the work of the Swiss fiscal in New York to pursue the huge crimes and pressure to the Governments involved in extending the circle.
What's it supposed to me?
The car insurance, covering the conductor before possible symptoms, proposes an important expenditure that will depend on different factors such as age, sex, karne angle, civil state, vehicle type to ensure or use, among others.
Keep the car only is the principle.
And it is that selecting the appropriate car insurance is even more difficult than selecting the vehicle model.
First of all, we must have clear about what we are talking about.
Car insurance is an agreement between a insurance company and the insurance.
This commitment is materialized in a insurance contract, which determines that the company receives the value of the first agreed as a change that is responsible for the obligation to pay compensations in the case of license.
The first is the price of the insurance, which is set in account of different factors, such as age, sex, antivity of karne, civil state, the type of vehicle to ensure or use, among others.
Safety companies set their prices according to statistics, so that more likely to suffer an accident, more contribution to subscribe.
That is why both older than 25 and women must pay lower prices, since statistics reflect that they have a smaller symptom independence because of their skills.
Furthermore, by throwing the receipts, companys have reached the conclusion that married people have less accidents than sunway conductors.
The use of the vehicle shall affect the frequency, and with this the probability of having some kind of percentance.
Increasing frequency, the probability is increased.
There are many changes that securities take into account the time to establish the price of the first.
That is why the conductor must learn the situation to choose the car insurance that is better adapted to its profile.
We will express the most significant variables at the time of selecting one or another type of insurance, so that it should also be adapted to the characteristics of the secure provides a reasonable price.
Young ages of 25 are found with different inconsistents at the time of contracting a secure price, such as the reduced conduct and the anti-country experience.
Although the ideal to be well secured is an assurance for any risk, there are other economic options.
The most preceding drivers can oppose any risk with franquity, so they get the coverages of an assurance to any risk but to a more effective price.
This class of convention would suggest that the customer pays a part of the amount of the sister.
"The part of the volume of the lift that provides the client will be preest in line with the value of the first, which will be higher than lower the amount", specific Luis Noguera, maximum responsible in Spain of First Europe, online insurance mediator.
Another option is an enlarged thirds, so that the customer will ensure the protection against damages caused to thirds, although not before the caused in their own car.
Furthermore, it would be covered by road, fire and loss of the vehicle.
A council.
If you're less than 25 years try to be careful and avoid the sinisters as possible, since this will be repercussioned in the goodness, you can reduce the safety cost in the future.
A goodness is a reduction on the basis rate that has the company.
In contrast, penalization is a recruitment on that basis rate.
"The provisions and penalisations will depend on the company and the benefit of it.
If the company has a good year can be allowed to increase the provisions," says Noguera.
In the past of the 25-year franses, the conductors have it easier at the time of contracting a insurance, since the uncertainty index is reduced thanks to the accommodated experience.
For this reason, the most recommendable is to contract any risk with franquity.
"Otherwise young people can't use the pre-acquired experience in an accident, and even at the time of conduct", he assures the director in Spain of the European Society, which adds that most of the accidents are produced in the second year of conduct, once last the newsletter.
However, if the customer is married but still does not have children, it is preferable to negotiate an assurance for all risks, always and when its economic situation is allowed, it is clear.
For their part, marriage with children are considered by safeguards such as public with less uncertainty indice, so the recruitments will be less.
In this case, the best secure would be one to any risk with franquity (as that may be of 300 euros), or, when there is a high level of goodness, one to thirdly expanded from the third year of the vehicle's life.
"There are performed a more relaxed conduct and have a greater acquiring power to allow the luxury to assume a greater amount of franquity," sentence Luis Noguera.
For jubilates, a security risk is recommended (with 150 euros) or a third-party extension in the case of a high level of goodness.
It must be said that the car insurance is something important, not only because it covers the conductor before possible symptoms, but also because it represents an important expenditure, because it is essential to study appropriately the security that more agrees to us according to our personal situation.
The Celtic is looking for a point that equals the eight
Milan and Celtic are missing this Monday in San Siro in the search for the lack of their respective objectives in the closure of the 'Champions' bond, since Italians served them to be first and the choices to arrest their classification.
The Italians are ten points and have already certificated their step at the fifth day with an empathy in Portugal, while the Celtic has nine points, but still needs another to ensure that the Shakhtar, with six, has the Benefit, who has four, does not go forward.
These two parties from the Group D will be played a week before the end of the sixth day, as Milan has to discuss the World of Clubs in Japan, where the day 13 in semi-finals is to be searched for a plate for the end of 16th.
So this group will be closed before the rest and the starting in the Joseph Meazza seems to be the most expected result, even though the two teams will try to go out for a victory, since Italians will not want to speculate in the house and the Celtics to know that winning would remain first and will be secured to a better cross in eights.
In the whole area of Gordon Strachan, he could also serve a delay to be classified if the Shakhtar did not win, but it can't be relied because the past is for the Ukrainians, who lost the week last in Glasgow (2-1), but gained (2-0) in the other direct dual.
Thus, mylanists will try to smoke him the night to the shoes, who confided to put up eight times in the restructured Champions League and successively, after precisely disappeared in that round the past campaign with a Kaka gol in the prolongation (1-0) after 0-0 of the ida.
To wait for the victory of the 'rossoneri', the Shakhtar is only the triunfo in the case of the Celtic, both to put up eights and to follow the UEFA.
And it is that, despite the last and without options to follow in the maximum European competition, the third area could achieve a victory, which would play the UEFA.
20,000 people assist in Vancouver at the first concert of the tour of the Spice Girls
The Spice Girls started in Vancouver (Canadá), before about 20,000 spectators, its first round since they were released in 2000.
'Posh Spice' (Victoria Beckham), 'Scary Spice' (Melanie Brown), 'Baby Spice' (Emma Bunton), 'Sporty Spice' (Malley Chisholm) and 'Ginger Spice' (Geri Halliwell) declared a little before starting his concert in the GM Place of Vancouver that the group's meeting is "brilling".
A 20,000 persons were deceived to present the consent included a video containing the history of the group that was angered at the end of 1990.
The meeting and the world round are consistent with the launching of a new album that collects its main success and two new songs, 'Headlines' and 'Vodoo' in Spain'.
The five integrants of Spice Girls went out to the scenario, wearing a brazalets that had given them the husband of Posh Spice, the British Soupist David Beckham.
The advisor was found between the public that was buried by the GM Place, although Victoria nervous had been prohibited days before.
At the beginning of the spectrum, Victoria Beckham noticed that the British astroke "n't seen our vestuary, for nothing, so I'm nervous about what it's going to think about the spectrum."
'Sporty Spice' whose out of the group in 1998 "for the differences between us" caused the disolution of the fifth two years later, also expressed his nervism during a meeting with the press, two hours before the start of the spectrum.
"I was scared.
It was nervous, but I saw the sense of the world has changed, the feeling of the Spice Girls has changed.
And I thought why not, so I'm glad to have taken the decision," said Chisholm about the group meeting which she desolted nine years ago.
The song also pointed out that with time, "the things have been fixed and we want us much."
But many things have changed since the Spice Girls recently acted together in 1998.
To start, according to the CTV TV, the group came to Vancouver in a special airport of Virgin Airlines.
At its airport arrived, he was waiting for a kid's army.
Among the five summer seven children.
After the concert of Vancouver, the group will act in California (EEU), in San José (the 4 December) and Los Angeles (5 and 7 December).
In Madrid will act on 23 December.
New fears on gas between Russia and Ukraine
The debate increased by the gas price between Ukraine and Russia has increased the risk of the export of fuel to West Europe.
Most of the gas exported by Russia to the European Union (EU) is directed through Ukraine, so each rock between both nations is a source of attention.
Kiev warned that if Moscú increases the gas price, Russia needs to pay higher transfer rates.
A previous debate in the past year reduces the EU states.
The last dispute between Kiev and Moscow occurred with the Ukraine Government and the Russian state, a monopolic owner of gas, Gazprom, trying to record the amount of money that Ukraine had to pay for Russian gas in 2008.
Gazprom stated that it would cover more in Ukraine, since it has been committed to pay a 50% additional in 2008 for the gas coming from Turkmenist neighbourhood.
Analists say it might be that Ukraine pays more than 40% for Gazprom imports.
"It's important for us to use our arguments as one of the most important gas transits during the conversations", said the Ukrainian Economy Minister Anatoly Kinakh to the Reuters News Agency.
"The changes in the gas prices should not be related to our arguments on the levels of transit rates [West Europe] to Ukraine."
The last great dispute between Moscú and Kiev, Gazprom, cut the appointment to Ukraine in January 2006.
This means a fall in exports to Western Europe, which was fast higher than prices.
The Russian gas represents the fourth part of the EU supply.
Russia has the largest gas reserves of the world, but a good part of it is not yet fully developed.
As a result, Gazprom complements its own delivery with Turkmenistan's gas and other former soviet nationals of Central Asia.
NHS "a testing for foreign workers"
A observer said that the SSN needs to control the registrations of criminal pre-dependents from outside Europe.
The recommendation of the General Audit Robert Black came after it was checked that a foreign doctor was related to the aircraft of Glasgow in June.
Black also showed her concern that the election NHS had no exact idea of the amount of foreign staff with account.
However, its report indicated other controls carried out correctly by a sample of five health authorities.
The general audit has paid the amount of foreign staff contracted outside the European Economic Area, because of the attacks on the airport of Glasgow.
Bilal Abdullah, 28, an Iraqi doctor of the Royal Alexandra de Paisley Hospital, was arrested in the airport after choosing a jeep at the doors of the terminal airport.
He was one of the three doctors who acted at the Old Bailey video conference in October, accused with bombing car in the United Kingdom.
NHS is expected to carry the pre-use cheques to the candidates to ensure that they meet qualifications, experience and authorisation to work in the United Kingdom.
Although the Scocia Health Council uses "Dislocation of Scocia" to carry out the controls of criminal passengers, the agency has no jurisdiction to get this information outside Britain.
The report of the General Audit recommends, among other measures, that the meetings should contact the Office ' s Guideline, which helps employees with criminal controls in many countries outside the United Kingdom.
"When we find some of the personal records with evidence of these controls, this is not a rutinary review", says the report.
Black states that the Swedish NHS has a high level of compliance with its own employment policies, but notes that " Our report sets out the areas that can be improved in order to ensure that information is available in the number of foreign NHS staff."
The President of the BMA Scozian, Dr. Peter Terry said that it was "more likely" that pre-employed cheques could identify NHS potentials that could make terrorist acts in the future.
"The report suggests that the pre-employed cheques operate in NHS Scotia but it is not clear what is the value added of the recommendations made," explained.
Exceptional health authorities state that foreign persons are currently accounted of 1.161, most of their doctors and hospitals
But the general audit warned that the number could be higher, partly because the meetings have problems to identify the employees who account for undetermined residence authorisations.
The research also found that the NHS control procedures established in Ayrshire and Arran, Grampian, Greater Glasgow and Clyde, Lanarkshire and Lothian were widely fulfilled.
This includes passport controls, work permit and qualification cheques.
The Scolate Government is currently re-examining the policy and management of foreigners' pre-operation in the NHS.
The Health Secretariat Nicola Sturgeon stated: "There was a great interest that this work would be carried out by the terrorist attack of Glasgow airport.
He added that the elected government, together with the health meetings, could consider the recommendations of the reports and that this would be reflected in the update of the pre-employment control guides for all working groups, including foreigners, which were planned to publish the next month.

The data of a European space ship in order showed the most similar planet as a gemal of the Earth as previously observed.
Venus is the nearest planet to the Earth.
The two planets have similar size and occupied similar orders, although Venus is slightly closer to the sun.
For millions of years ago, Venus could have been similar to those who made the Earth a living planet, now believe scientists.
But the effects of carbon dioxyde and the winter effect, atmosphere erosion by sun radiations and slower sun rotation sent to Venus to a very different type of development.
Today the planet has no water, the temperature of the surface is enough to spread the plot and is erosioned by the raw winds and rain torments.
The results of the European Space Agency for Venus Express, which has studied the planet for a year, offers a panorama of how the Earth could develop catastrophic changes because of climate.
Professor Fred Taylor, from the Department of Physical University of Oxford and one of the leaders of the Venus Express mission, declared: "They are explaining why the climate in Venus is so different from the Earth when there are two similar planets.
"Our new data can build a scenario in which Venus started as the Earth, probably with a living environment that has been a million years ago."
Police described "inriched Urin"
A kilometre of radiactive material that states is rich uranium, was driving yesterday by Slovak and Hungary police.
A police portrait declared that three persons were arrested and the material was considered.
The effective could not confirm if he was rich uranium but said that he could have been sold for $1 million (480,000 sterlin books).
Still open
Mitt Romney says that it is not worthy that the candidates answer the questions of a snow money.
However, republics for the Presidency eventually access to maintaining a debate in YouTube, in which common and current voters have a number of questions on video and send them to their distribution among candidates.
No of the questions presented in the spring of Wednesday 28 November were more riddle than the snow money that asked the democrates concerning climate calendation in the discussion of the YouTube Republication Party.
But the questions, and the answers, this time, reflected many of the state of the party in face to the elections of the next year.
You don't know exactly how the CNN producers, co-pa-padged the debate, chosen YouTube videos to show those candidates to appoint.
But the first average hour of discussion, the longest dedicated to one subject, was focused on immigration.
The subject is one of the strongest topics for the Republics.
CNN requested a group of indecisive voters to submit the dial when they heard ideas to be pleased: the emisors noted a few approval when candidates talked with extremist arguments.
The more hard words exchange in the night was between Rudy Giuliani, the national pioneer, and Mr. Romney, which has been pointed out in the critical investigations of Iowa and New Hampshire.
Mr. Giuliani is trying to decline Romney's reputation because he was angry with illegal immigration when he was in New York.
He attacked Mr. Romney, accurated the former Massachusetts' leader of illegal immigrant contracts to work in his house.
Boths have responded aggressively when they asked whether some candidate could support an "amnistry" (forgiving illegals to regulate their situation and give them the possibility of obtaining citizenship).
The smaller candidates like Duncan Hunter, a Californian Congressist, and Tom Tancredo, a Colorado Congressist, agreed with the topic.
No one has the word to be nominated candidate, but both remain in the road may be because both warned on the issue of immigration before others.
At least in immigration, and in general terms, candidates share views: increased monitoring in borders, intolerance with illegal immigrants.
This topic, together with the fear of the toxic players of China and other concerns on the outside, helps republics to forget, or to minimize the divisions between liberals and Christian conservators.
But the debate was indirectly transformed when other topics appeared.
Mr. Giuliani asked why he supported the control of weapons in the past.
John McCain and Mr. Romney discussed whether the inmerging in water should be considered torture.
One person asked whether the candidates believed in every Bible’s words.
This brought Mr. Juuliani to go to the position that, though the Bible was his favorite book, he was not literally believed in the history of Jonas and the Balin.
Another person asked whether Jesus would support death penalty.
Mike Huckabee - now, against all the expectations, firstly in the recent investigation of Iowa, thanks to his Christian conservation of long date-- said that death penalty was painful but necessary.
When he was pressed to answer if Jesus would be favourable, the river said that Jesus was too intelligent as to be candidate in the elections.
The road is still open.
Mr. Huckabee increased in Iowa, in line with the rehabilitation campaigns of liberal Ron Paul, and its comprehensive statements of the middle debate.
They two have gone out of the fund, because the two sides of the party did not agree to the most famous and traditional candidate.
In 1980 and 2000, a candidate joined the early and convincedly with a winning message on the greatness of America, satisfiing both sides of the party.
This time the game is divided and the result is far away from being clear.
Laboratories
Gordon Brown has discovered another day when he's hungry; but also urged
As political scannings continue in England, this is not particularly interesting.
It seems not to be sold influences, or it is exorbiting hotel accounts in Paris, nor caught from extramarital feet.
But a rich business man has been made contributions to the English government party, over $60,000, sterlinic libraries (1.3 million), nearly four years using false names, and that the party did not declare it.
Two months ago, when the first minister had chosen to call for a election, denialing the British intelligence and declared that the views had not influenced in its decision, the hope was that a strong and effective government would be provided.
But instead of that, as Vince Calbe, the liberal Democrat with growing engineering, because the fear of Mr. Brown has been Stalin to be Mr. Bean.
Northern Rock's rescue, a bank in problems, demonstrated regulatory weakness and judge poverty at crises.
Malicious proposals to change the tax code have made the business groups together against the government.
The fiscal authority lost 25 million personal data which discovered an inimaginable administrative chapter.
A three of reared generals launched a moon in the Lares Chamber, protesting against military courts in the costs: being armed force ministers is, calling for a mid-time employment.
Now they are the many donations of David Abrahams; Peter Watt, the General Labour Secretariat (and previous compound) has already been sent.
Nothing of this means that Mr. Brown is irrevocable to the exit.
Governments can reach an inflation point after they are unable to rule.
People don't believe them as political, but usually depend on their unbelief when a new boat gets control.
Once it is clear that the first minister can't improve the things, which are not a long time, this suspension is more than: public officials start to fall; grant ministers are exposed; the press seeks evil news; and the government is defensive and is not focused.
On the one hand, Brown's position is particularly difficult, because, on the other political leaders, it cannot defend that it is new.
Although I wanted to renewal Tony Blair, it was his highest tenant.
The problems of Northern Rock and the registration tax are relating to the decisions Brown made as an eritable cancler.
And even when it is not directly invoked in Blairish's contracts - or "effective for partners," the research on the financing of political parties - the voters may assume that if it is.
However, Mr Brown's situation is not so bad as it looks.
The balls are not so bad as the Tories want to show.
As in Mr. Bean, nobody died, nor was drunk directly.
And the medium, though painful, is to give the naturally stalinist tendencies of Mr. Brown have always promised: a reliable and brutal government.
The new donations political scene is a good example.
Mr. Abrahams, who compares its donations with loved data, says that he doesn't want public recognition for his well-being.
This may be so, but the decision does not take it.
The laws against anonimate for large political contributions are clear and there is a clear reason: the public has the right to know who is buying access to those who have power.
Mr. Watt, who said to know the agreement of Mr. Abraham, and that he was not illegal, apparently will confront Jon Mendlesohn, head of fund refund that was asked for donations in October.
But Mr Brown has not been involved until now: there is nothing that he would suggest that he knew these actions, although the gap of payments was made after he takes control of the office in June.
Until the first minister has made half of the work.
It was quick to condemn its party for violation of the law, but it was divorced in the decisions by a family matter, an investigation commission on the matter conducted, in a good measure, by a judge and an obisp.
In this case, morals are not complicated.
If the law has been violated, it is a case of police.
Furthermore, there are other things that Mr Brown should do, as to find a permanent and independent head for the Commission of Standards in the Public Life, because he has not had one since six months, and also must be pressed by a real reform of the financing of the parties.
This will require a slow work of workers with the Tories, and perhaps a statement to the special financial situation that is with the incidents - measures for a party such as Mr. Brown.
But he must face some partidist facts.
The conservators now have a good level of support in the surveys; he has two years to gain voters; and the only way it can move to the victory is in acting with an imposable hope and strong competition.
Card timbers
The crisis of the hypothetics is infecting the American market of credit cards?
When there is blood in the water, it is naturally that some dorsal wings are emotioned around.
Today, the American housing market is in crisis, depredors have their views on the market of the country of credit cards.
The analysis in Goldman Sachs calculate that the losses in credit cards may reach $99 million if the crisis of hypothetics underlines other consumer credits.
Contact signs are already seen.
There is both an increase in card charges as well as in the crime rates, which reduces the percentage of the wages that have not been enhanced or have more than 30 days of delay respectively.
HSBC announced the past month that he took 1,4 million charges in its financial business to the American consumer, partly due to the weakness of the card providers.
However, it's very early for the pánico.
Delivery and crime are lower.
According to Moody's, a qualification agency, the third quarter of the crime rate of 3.89% was almost a percentage point under the historic average.
The deterioration in rates may be explained in part by technical factors.
A change in the United States safeguard law (2005) gave place to a breastfall falled in the requests of quibra, which at the same time represents a large loss of credit cards; the number of requests (and therefore, morous) would be growing again, or may happen that the conditions for providers were engaged.
The industry also reports strong payment rates, showing how much their debts pay consumers each month.
And confidence in credit cards and values supported by assets is quite firm, despite parliasis in other financial areas.
Dennis Moroney de TowerGroup, a researcher, predicts that emission volumes for 2007 will be about 25% higher than last year.
The direct infection channels of the crisis between the hypothetics subject and the market of credit cards are certainly existing: consumers are pleased to load debts to credit cards now that credit entities are falling.
However, the emisors of the credit card are more than liquidity-related than the active values, so that prices infringement do not necessarily add a change in the credit capacity of the providers.
They can even work to profit the emitteners.
The incentives for consumers continue to love the hypothek describe whether properties are less than the value of the price; and as a result, the payment of the debt of the card is under the list of priorities.
The emisors of cards may also respond fast and flexiblely to the difficult conditions that the suppliers of hypotec, changed interest types or changing credit solds.
This in theory should reduce the risk of rapid retail of actives.
"We're not gonna stop a day and evaluate all the princes again," says Gary Perlin, Captain One Finance Chief.
If an immediate infection of the subprise on the market of credit cards is impossible, the risks of a sustained decline are much more real.
If the home prices are lower and a constraint of credit will lead to America to receivity, the industry is deeply encountered by a serious future.
We need to keep watching these backsletters.
Brittanic offended banks in Enron case
Three British bankers who were judged for their responsibility in fraude with the former head of the Finance Office of Enron, Andrew Fastow, were declared against this mercury.
David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew were originally found unnotic of seven fraude offices for collaborating with Fastow in a secret financial operation in 2000 to enrich the cost of employees.
They were sent to judgment in January.
But during the hearing before the jurisdiction of Ewing Werlein Jr. of the U.S. District, each was sentenced as a fault of fraude.
The three old executives of Greenwich Natwest, a PLC shot group in the Royal Bank, became a census in Britain by the extradition procedures that have been held for two years.
In the United States, its case marks the final flow of an investigation launched after the decline of Enron in 2001.
At first, banking offices had been warned in 2002 to Fastow, which was the objective of a government investigation on Enron fall.
The accusation against bankers - doubled the "NatWest Tres" - a statement that came to Houston in 2000 to find a fraudulent scene with Fastow and his earlier helper, Michael Kopper.
Greenwich Natwest was invested in a subsidiary of an Enron Society controlled by Fastow, which was the artist of a mirror of fraudes in Enron, which helped its inspiration of fall in the quiebra.
In 2002, the bank valued the interests of the cereal subsidiary, but the three Britishs knew that he was valued at the top.
A company under Kopper control bought the bank interest in $1 million.
The bankers paid to Kopper $250,000 for interest in that company.
According to the accusation, Fastow was falsely represented to Enron, as the energy company would pay $20 million to Greenwich NatWest for its parts of the subsidiary.
But the 20 million remained in hands of British bankers, Fastow and others.
The bankers cut 7.3 million, while Fastow, Kopper and others received approximately 12.3 million in accordance with the accused.
In January 2004, Fastow was sentenced by two conspiration offices at Enron's colapsy.
The British trial was arrested three months later.
Fastow is doing a 6-year-old sentence in a federal prison of Louisiana.
Kopper is filled with a three-year penalty and a month in Texarkana.
Each of the three British bankers should pay $1 million for living in the United States while the judgment was held.
Enon, one of the seven larger companys of the nation, stated in bankerroat in December 2001 after years of truck in account, could not hide the debt of millions or seem to be outcome of their business.
The colapso lost thousands of jobs, more than 60 million in market values and more than two million in pension plans.
The founder of Enron, Kenneth Lay and the former executive manager, Jeffrey Skilling were undertaken over the past year after its roles in the company's colapsy.
Skilling is filled with a sentence over 24 years.
The conspiration of Lay was suspended when he died from a heart attack last year.
Not below to Moscow
The price of a Gulfstream G550 airport, equipped with a Rolls-Royce Royce motor and sufficient fuel capacity for Moscow direct flights to Los Angeles, starting $54 million.
But this is a small cost for some of the rich Russians.
"He has a capacity to 18 passengers," said Dan Firer, representative of Gulfstream.
"But no one asks this model of many seats because it is for family private flights or for a company presidents."
Mr. Firer was responsible for the Gulfstream Cabinet on the past summer in the Millennium Feria, a 4-day consumerorgy held in a center of events in the nearby of the capital.
Besides Gulfstream, other 200 leather providers had installed their exhibition stands, waiting for crossing the new Russians to all types of products, from the arteoned tastes to the car parks of diamonds, 50 centavos.
Mr. Firer carefully looks at a Porsche-alarmed porce-anarned in the neighborhood of his own."
"It's a beautiful car, but it's a novel and cold compared to us," he said.
"Apart from the United States, Russia is the second largest market for private aircraft."
The Russian capital appears to Dallas when he was in the pop.
"We lived the same in 1890, when some occupied Americans came to meet in Europe, where they were seen as materialists," said Marshall Goldman, Senator of the Centre of Davis for Russian and Eurasian studies of the University of Harvard.
"Come the Saudians of the 70s and the Japanese in the 1990s, Russians are emerging as the largest consumers and guests of the world."
The most exclusive luxury marks in the world are looking for their part of the past.
On the other hand of Moscow, this week will be held a conference on the luxury industry with Donatella Versace, Tom Ford and Bernard Arnault, President of LVMH, to interchange ideas about how to sell luxury goods in markets such as Russia.
(The conference is organized by the International Herald Tribune, property of the New York Times company)
Russia has 53 million dollars to make a total of $282 million, according to the list of Forbes of the most rich people.
Furthermore, the second degree include 103,000 Russians whose money is reached to $670 million, according to a study of the evolution of personal riches in the former Soviet Union, written by economicists of the Centre for Economic and Finance Research, a local thanks to the local view.
(The World Bank said that 15,8% of the Russians were under the substantive level in 2005.)
"There are hundreds of thousands of thousands of people in Moscow - and why we're all here," says Nicole Marais, representative of sales and marketing of David Morris, the London joyer.
It stands at the wrath for the first time with the Russian distributor of the brand, the Soho Jewelry group.
" Women are impesiblely prepared and men are very worthy."
Visiting the feast night of Sunday, clothed in late road, two race goods agents, Evgenia Yumatova, 21, and Svetlana Turovtsova, 26, described their customers and them as a thousands of people.
"I'm looking for the cars and I'm trying to decide between the Infiniti, the Mercedes and the Porsche," said Yaumatova, who was leaving the design road that used as a veteran dining network with Joan Rivers.
The feria has the aim to be attracted to the new rich, the type of buyers that would be ready to stay several hours in a store that mixes brands from Cadillac Escalades, plate boxes, pearls of Mövenpick, pools for cart pools, apartments in Dubai and teddy bones of Gund.
The general public can buy 30 euro bottles ($44,57).
"The Russians are interested to learn what mark is the most precious and best," said Mr. Gijrath, who was patriotically sitting in a state of the real Dutch Porcells Delft, before a reconstruction of a wall size of Rembrandt's painting, made of blues painted in hand.
"Of course, Russians are more interested in the "bling-bling".
In fact, the vendors said that the Russian rich of more trajector (10 to 15 years, for Russian standards) changed their gusts from calling logs to limited edition marks, which would not be expressed in a commercial war.
Nevertheless, several thousands of people: thousands of effective, emisors of thousands of tourists or, they fill the pasts every day.
And some of them buy.
At the first night of the celebration, Roman Ershov, the King Koil bed director, said that he sold two colk systems of $70,000, every one, a chamber's fashion, a cacher and a cotton intertained with gold heats.
Also at the first night, Mikhail Lyubiumov, sales charged for A1 Moto, company that equips high gama cars with ad hoc warning systems, said that the company had selled the Porsche anarnjed, $170,000 to a million Russian.
For Sunday, Andrei Karapetian, President of L.A. Connection, company that changes cars for specific requirements, said he had sold three car parkings with rolls royce Phantom in $55,000 everybody.
He showed the reporter a car wheel, designed for the owner of a Russian casino, with included rays of color Swarovski cristals, so that it would be assembled to a ruled road.
Cost: $22,000 for four roads.
"The Russian Millennium who wants avestruz roads or a retirement of his wife's female kitchen, will not necessarily lead on these roads," says Mr. Karapetian.
"He's going to keep the car in your garden, close to other 30 or 40 cars."
Even though many of its Russian clients are rich, Mr. Karaquian explains that the sentence " Russian millennium" does not mean exclusiveness, due to the oil of prices of the real property.
"If you bought a apartment in Moscow three or four years ago, it's probably a thousand, at least in the paper if it's not in effect," said.
"There are more of them than you think."
Those who were not thousands could at least be rich by supporting the Continental Alliance, a Russian sign of assets.
The company made four red phone chains (Bernian style) filled with false bill piles of a million dollars.
Azad Karryev, the company's marketing officer, said that his team had pressed 500,000 false tickets for the Millennium Feria.
The visitors stopped shopping money pills, asking their friends to take photos with their mobiles when they were driving on money mountains, or embalking a couple of millions.
"You see, in Moscow, everyone can feel like a thousand", says Karryev.
Cyrugia "capuza" could be caused to death in New Jersey
It was the day before the action of thanks when Ronald Livingston looked through the restaurant "A little more healthy" and saw how a ambulance went up by White Cape Cod, two below doors in West Scott.
Immediately, it appeared a car from the police's car.
And then another.
"There you saw the ambulance," said Mr. Livingston, restaurant supervisor, that middle day.
"It was when I knew someone died."
The authorities knew that the dead woman was Olga Arroyo, 41 years old, the director of the department of the Newark police director.
Now the investigators are trying to determine whether she died because of a procedure carried out by an unlimited plastic circle, which is not yet identified by the police, but that she worked in the 212 Av. West Scott.
The authorities still do not determine what caused the death of Mrs. Arroyo, but they wait for toxic test, although the results will not be available for a few weeks.
Mrs. Arroyo was a police director, Garry F. McCarthy, since September 2006, and his voice was family for many in the department.
"There was faithful, worker and tenaz," said Mr. McCarthy about Arroy in a telephone interview the middle of the middle.
"It was my guard."
She'd protect me."
Mr. McCarthy said that Arroyo was the wife of Jimmy Arroyo, a former police officer in Newark who worked for the Alcohol Beat Commission and left two sons of 14 and 11, and a daughter.
Eileen Walsh, the fiscal of the Condado Union, Theodore J. Romankow, said that the detectives are trying to determine whether Mrs Arroyo died by a non-profit procedure.
"This is one of the possibilities," said Walsh.
"It's a current investigation."
The authorities said they had reached the house near 3 P.M.
On November 21, they found Ms. Arroyo in a sofa.
The death was declared in the place.
It's been more than one week, and the authorities said little about their research or the owner of the house, named Flor Margarita Castro.
Mrs. Walsh could not say whether Mrs. Castro has been asked by the authorities.
Researchers are trying to determine what part of the house has been used as medical consultations.
The middle, no one answered the door in the house of Mrs. Castro, where a rocket is located on the front of the house, and a ladder ladder on the back.
A blue tampon labeled as "vainillina ethyl" - used as a substitute for the vainilla in food and perfumes - was found at the door of the car, on the side of a door leading to the steel.
Two mountain bicles clothes on one side.
Mr. McCarthy said that when he came to Newark after 25 years in the department of the police of New York, Mrs. Arroyo was an unbelievable help to know the new island city and its red political culture.
'There would say,' you have to watch with him or with whom," said she.
"It's always been here when I was, and even when not.
It's pregnant."
The Federal Reserve will be expected to raise the rates to rise in the Bolsa
The actions were led to both sides from Atlantics yesterday after the market is expected that the Federal Reserve is expected to calm the conditions of credit for the interest rates, which were increased with the comments of the Vice-President of the Central Bank.
In London, New York, and through Europe after Donald Kohn, two of Ben Bernanke President of the reservation, it will state that policy factors must be "flexible and practical" in response to the continuing tension of the financial markets.
In a clear efforts to calm the markets in the middle of growing credit bottles, Mr. Kohn said that recent turbulation was "in part inverted by improving the market at the end of September and during October".
If the trend continued, it would increase the possibility of additional adjustments in the financial conditions for real estate and business, Kohn said.
Comments were taken by investors as a sign that the reservation is ready to inject fresh capital in the U.S. markets and to make shorts of the type of interest, to stabilize credit conditions.
The comments also helped to calm Wall Street in the middle of bad news for the U.S. economy, such as house sales that reached the lower record in October.
The consequences of the financial turbulency was focused on a notice of Bear Stearns, the investment bank that will cut 650 job posts, which is equal to 4 per cent of its total work hand, in a global cost reduction to compensate losses of their investment in the sub-prise hypothecs of the United States.
It is expected only 20 of these posts to London, where the bank uses 1,500 people.
In New York, the industrial average of Dow Jones went up to 331 points, or 2.55%, closing to 13.289.40, while the broad S-P 500 index was 2.65%.
In London, FTSE 100 was under 165.5 points or 2.7%, at the end of 6.306.2, adding more than 39 million sterlinic libraries to the value of the first order of British companies.
Germany’s Dax index was 2.6 per cent, and CAC40 in France was about 2.3 per cent.
Before, the reappointment of the credit tension on the markets has been delayed after a strong demand in a fund substance for three months of the European Central Bank, which considered these costs to the European commercial banks at 4.7%, the highest rate since April 2001.
The pressure to the England Bank to follow the operating of the Federal Reserve and the ECB and to inject extra funds in the value markets in London, tended the credit and rates of the prices to three months "Libor" between the British banks, meaning the highest rise since September, from 6.59% after a constant submission from 12 November.
England takes with judgment the requests of Owais Shah and Ravi Bopara
There are two dilemes, each one's so hard as the other.
Who should hit No. 6 by England in Kandy this week end, Owais Shah or Ravi Bopara?
And, no one is less important against the first test against Sri Lanka, who should take the decision?
The second question is relevant because David Graveney, the Chairman of the selection which is in terms of this title, at least, is here to help Peter Moores, the trannel, and Michael Vaughan, Captain, to decide; and also because the main office of Hugh Morris, director of England, is starting to make offers to become national elector, and if not, in a part of time.
He who does not allow the sixth bath place will be unfortunate, but life is often unjust and sport also.
It is not easy to take what a man does on the top of his profession, while another never goes beyond the lower level, sometimes because of the lack of luck more than capacity.
Not only in the crystal, the election is difficult, since judgments are required to be subjective.
Is this the right time that Bopara is rising up?
Is it just for Shah if he's doing it?
The same question could be done in another aspect if, says John Edwards or "Tubby" Banerjee, two brilliant young executives with good levels and who know the business well, would have been promoted to the tabler: there is only one of them.
Who should say what a good level is for a crystal player, unless he gives him the opportunity to dance or noise the next chance?
The figures of course have a great influence in decisions, but they also have opportunities.
Inside a team, a cricket player must take the eye of the captain at the same time to take a "winet" and a batterer to get opportunities to change the order if you want to have an impact as a player one day.
But capture the eye of the electors is most complex.
There were many who improved the past time, for example, James Anderson, who certainly played in the first test even if Stephen Harmison states for "fit and bowls" as the wind in the networks.
Anderson took 32 tickets of first class in 33 cars for each to win a place.
Chris Tremlett took only 29 in the middle, but both have had their high moments and can wait for more than these.
Shah or Bopare games in the Asgyriya Station can only be a question of view.
Option can break or make a man's road, or can mean a small difference.
Four years ago in Sri Lanka, Gareth Batty played in every test and did well in the first, with 5 whiteks and 40 carriers, but Paul Collingwood was fighting to establish himself at the same time that came to become a player of importance, and even though notice a double hundreds against Australia, it can be understood.
The probability is that Graveney, Vaughan and Moores, after a further discussion at the today's meeting at the Agiria stadium, will follow their conservation institutes and will encourage Shah's most experience on the excellence of the young Bopara.
There are arguments for both.
For Shah, he's a brilliant and precious test of principles of 88 in Bombay, 32 hundreds of first class in front of only 6 of Bopara, who, in 22, is more younger than seven years, and has excellent advances against the bowling spin.
But Shah made only ten cars in its two turns in May to West Indias in the test in Lords, his house as a player of the Middleex, and this caused a immediate rejection of the electors when Vaughan recalled his place for the next meeting, seemed to have taken from his "batting" something of electan in Bombay.
On the other hand, Essex's team is glad to live in the swords.
He takes nothing in the cricket field and his attitude was resumed as when he fought his vehicle in an exhibition for the England Car Car Car Car Car Cars, Volkswagen.
He suffered lessons of smaller importance and, presumably, a shock, but the first thing that he had done was to bring out his Vodafone (counted, of course) and called Alastair Cook, his team partner who looked at the distance, to tell him with excitation: "Do you see this?".
Bopara is the best player, you're included its rebalad step to have effects in their players that seem to satisfy it, since battle with confidence and ability.
To choose the man appropriate is one thing, to choose the best time, another.
Maybe this is the real art of the selection.
My inclination would give Bopara his opportunity, what does not mean Shah will not overcome, as suggest the tea sheets, is he who plays here this week end.
Buses bring the refugees back to work - and the fight against Al-Qaeda
The first bus with Irish refugees in Syria began to reach Bagdad yesterday, expulsing the elections that were left without effective extension, and those who hoped that the city returns to normality.
Some have even returned to fight the warriors who led them out of their households.
In the Mansour Bus station, even before the arrival of 800 people from Damascus in an official sentence of the government composed of a dozen bus, the terminal was full of Syria and Jordan refugees who returned to private transport.
"I decided to go to Syria after they killed many doctors in Bagdad," said Saah al-Qubaisi, sunset doctor.
"I see today what I saw on the TV and what I read in the newspapers, about the happening in Bagdad, and that's safe now."
"They say that the Mahdi Army left kill people," declared, revealing the chief military of Cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who ordered his troops a momentane stop.
Qassim to Atwani, who asked for 38 years and teacher in the sun area of Amariyah, returned with its two children because it was impossible to renew their visa in Syria because the Syrian regime does not want Iraqi working in their country.
His neighbors in Amariyah called him by phone to tell him that a friendly force of EE.U. helped to bring Al-Qaeda out of its bathroom to the west of the capital, and urged him to return.
One of the receipts coming from Jordan was the chief of a sun tribe who had been conducted from his house in Sleikh to the north of Bagdad by a granted attack after urged citizens to rise against Al-Qaeda.
He came to fight.
"Two days ago, some of my friends called me and told me that they started an anti-Al-Qaeda military in Sleikh and that they needed my support and my fellows."
"Therefore I came back today," Saaah Alu Obeidi said in 62 years.
Many have been acquired by the growing calm in the capital since the EEA troops have acknowledged "related civilians", armed and working in cooperation with the U.S. military forces to defend their neighbourhoods.
But many declared that the denial of visa and the lack of money in Damascus had returned, where more than 1.3 million Iraqi were established in the past years.
Salaam al-Samarai, of 51 years and the father of three children, called to the common suspicion between the electioners, which Nouri al-Maliki, the first minister of Chile, asked to the Syrian Government to impose restrictions to the visa of refugees to impose people to return.
More than two and half million people believe they have escaped from the country because of the sectary quarters of death.
"We were well until Al-Maliki visited Syria and urged the government to put the Iraqi visas to make them strong to return to Iraq," said the sun.
"I can't believe in a government that supports the criminals who burned my house after I left it."
A part of the reason for the end of violence is that sunbys have been expulsed from the Chile and against-border zones, restoring tension.
There is a fear that an olive oil of refugees makes overseas the sectary tensions and begins the fight.
The small Sarre, good education.
The smallest federal state is the first in vocational training, even lighting by the international guidance of its higher schools.
As in the whole country, the Sardinians are not only a educational field.
"Tomorrow explained for fifty-year-old to a non-Saralandian we are not French"- that was the ironic motor on himself of the smallest federal state for its fifty-year-old.
At the same time, France and Luxembourg have a great role in the Sarre educational system as in a study of the German Economic Institute (IW) called "Picture Monitoring Institute" took the fifth place.
Thus, traditional schools have good relationships with neighbouring countries.
The University of Saarbrücken was founded in 1948 by the French.
Until today, students can end here with two or three diplomas.
Therefore, the percentage of foreign students is of 15, 6 per cent.
However, the number of students from Sarre is higher than the average in upper schools. Many of them do not have a bacteriat.
"A Sarre is using the vocational education system", says Axel Plonnecke, the educational expert in the German economy Institute (IW).
More than five young people have his bacteriat in the School Professional School. So, results that Sarre is 7 per cent above the national average.
In contrast, the variety of opportunities for professional-academic education is very wide.
The offer of dual roads, regarding the number of people, is the best in Germany.
Despite practical training and a growing demand, the number of in Ingeniecy Sciences was a third in the last years.
This was the reason why the Ministry of Education of Sarra has committed up high schools to make more publicity for Ingenie Sciences.
"In addition to the first PISA study, we do some reforms in general education schools," said a portfolio of the Ministry of Education.
Thus, the Government introduced comparative evidence throughout the country.
In order to start children to study the last year of the project called "Kita-Jahr", it has no cost. While soon, this model follows the other federal states.
The comparison with the following studies will show whether the performance of students has increased.
According to the 2003 PISA report, the number of school development students reduced from 29 to 20 per cent.
But, in general, the Sarre did not improve much as other federal states.
In Baviera, students know better calculating.
For the disgusting of the Sardinians, the PISA report does not compare the knowledge of foreign languages, although in this field they could achieve good results.
Although the Sardinians are not French, the neighbour language is a binding allocation in the Secure Education Institutes.
You have changed the time.
Approximately in Venezuela there will be another hour hot different than the rest of the world.
On 9 December, the Chairman Hugo Chávez leaves to amend the hour in the South American country by stoping the average hours.
Chávez is currently staying as a coomous in Spain.
As notified by the Public Boletin of the Venezuelan State, according to the new law, the hour will take place at least four hours GMT.
So the South American country will have a timely hot that there is no other country in the world.
Among other things, Chávez, as an enemy of the United States, justifys its decision to say that the United States will impose the world's obligation to change a full hour.
Furthermore, the middle (local time) Chávez announced the rupture of relations with its neighbouring country of Colombia because of the action with rehenses.
The Nationalist of Left said that there would be no relationship with the State Head or Colombian Government until the Álvaro Uribe Conservator continued to be the President of Colombia.
"My dignity is not allowing me to do this," said Chávez, which is proclaiming a constitutional reform where the citizens of the oil country must decide on Sunday in a referendum.
With this reform, it could be quite expanded its power in the country.
The reason of the conflict was the decision taken by Uribe by retiring the mandate of Chávez in the negotiations with the Marxist warrilla in which it was the issue of release of rehenses.
Sunday Chávez said that Uribe has made the decision to Venezuela.
He also speaks much about Chávez.
A new calling tongue causes sensation in the country: "Why don't you call?" it is the frase that they have already downloaded average million people.
This sentence suggested the King of Spain that was painted by the continued interruption by the peoples of the left peoples in the last Ibero American Summit.
In 2007 the reduction of real wage threat to Germans.
According to a prognostic, this year a decrease of real wage threat to German employees, despite a strong coycling.
The experts present a large number of reasons for a pestician prognostic.
In accordance with the calculations of the Hans Böckler Foundation, German employees should be reported in 2007 with a lower real salary account than the previous year.
"The fault of this is the weak evolution of the wages, the increase of the tax on the added value and the stage of the prices of food and energy", reported the "Picture" Gustav Horn of the Macroeconomic Institute and Research of Economic cycles.
The new loads of unemployment insurance may also be correspond to employees.
The Minister of Finance Peter Setinbrück said to the journal "Neue Ostanbrücker Zeitung" given the current situation, the intention to reduce unemployment insurance load of 3,3% after one year to another is fair and reasonable.
Of course, the Working Office has not to reiterate a disgraceable situation, asking credits and subsidies to the Federal State, according to the words of a political of the German social-democratic party.
The March was publicly made that the inflation rate with price expansion in the food sector and the petroleum derivative sector has reached the highest level for 13 years.
By comparing prices in the past year, they increased a 3 %.
Venus: Brother geel of the Earth.
Despite his atmosphere, Venus is the most likely planet of the Earth, something that has not been planned until now. The European Sond "Venus Express" discovered races in the atmosphere and remotely in the poles, the same that also appear in winters in the earth.
For three years, the investigators had the suspect that there were races in Venus.
But now the European sond has brought new tests: he discovered electromagnetic on the side of the atmosphere. In Venus, the races call from a height of 54 kilometres of a cloud and behind another, account Criss Russell of the University of California in Los Angeles to the scientific magazine "Nature".
According to the famous model of the origin of the life of Urey-Miller, the rays caused life on the earth: the warmings could have caused reactions in the ocean that, on their part, had been given origin to the aminoatous who are the basic components of life.
In Venus, it is not so: if any day I live there, that would have to be in one of the first évolution states," Sean Solomon of the Washington Carnegy Institution.
Today, on Venus's surface can't have life: Atmosphere pressure is almost 100 times greater than on Earth and on the real temperatures of 500 °C, in order to achieve temperatures under cereal.
"It may be, Venus is a "Diabolic" gem of the Earth, but still being a gemelo," said Russell.
The main goal of the "Venus Express" mission is to respond to the question why Venus, so similar to the Earth for its mass and size, has had so different evolution.
As since the nine years there were no special missions, only for the research of this planet, the launching of "Venus-Express" in November 2005 was a very important step for Venus research.
The latest results of the investigations that are to be submitted in many articles of "Nature", according to the view of the investigators, are not only subrayed by Venus’s unity in the Solar System.
"This also shows that neighbour planets have more common characteristics with the Earth we had decided," reports the ESA.
Despite the already known temperature winds in North Poland, researchers discovered in the south of the Polar region also a glass formed by the clouds turning faster.
This phenomenon reminds wind streams in the high earthquarters of the poles, as described by a team of researchers of Joseph Piccioni of the Italian Institute of Special Astrophysical and Space Physical Institute.
The second planet of the Solar System has the almost equal mass to the Earth and with its equatorial diameter of 12.000 km is almost so large.
This planet also called a star of flat or evening star around the sun nearly 225 days.
But his rotation period is slower: one day in Venus is equal to 243 days on the earth.
Although Venus with its superficial temperatures of 460 degrees and atmosphere pressure of 92 bars is not much easy to the Earth, scientists are part of the basis that both planetes had been formed in the same conditions.
In the two planets, the water was aglomerated on Earth, but in Venus was moved to the universe.
While the carbon dioxyde was converted in carbon stones on Earth, Venus forms the majority of the atmosphere.
Koehler defended Merkel's half with Dalai Lama.
Koehler, Federal President, is in the end of the wheel between the parties by the receipt of Dalai Lama in the Federal Cancillery.
He criticised indirectly to the German Social Democratic Party for its attacks to the Federal Canciller after half in September.
Horst Koehler, Federal President, is concerned about Germany's reputation, and he therefore requested the great coalition to end this piece by the receipt of Dalai Lama.
"In this case we should not present us as a separate nation of UNA," Koehler said the "Handelsblatt" journal.
At the same time, Koehler showed his understanding about the receipt of Dalai Lama by Angela Merkel (Party of the Democratic Union) in September.
"When I have a great respect for the difference between cultures, human rights are absolute victory for me," said Koehler.
Everyone knows that Germany must act with a great balance in the meteria of the external policy, subsequent the Federal President, defending Merkel for the request he received by implementing a new policy with China.
"The Federal Canciller did not take the distance of the traditional course of a Chinese policy.
China also knows", said Koehler.
Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Minister for Foreign Affairs (Social Democrat Pattery), had directly shown its urgency by Dalai Lama's receipt and because of this, it was attacked by the members of the Union.
In addition, Steinmeier criticised the Union for its operating policy in the external matter.
The receipt of Dalai Lama in the Federal Cancillery caused great income in the Chinese relations.
So, the Chinese Government not only left the invitation to Peer Steinbrueck (Social Democrat Pact), the Minister of Finance of Germany, but also, according to the information sources of the magazine "Spigel", assigned the strategic dialogue of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of both countries.
Wen Jiabao, Chief of the Chinese Government, requested the Federal Canciller Angela Merkel who recognizes this receipt of Dalai Lama as an error.
By confirming China's position, Wen Jiabao said that China would not accept European politicians to receive the religious leader of Tibetians in their official position.
The actions and words of Dalai Lama showed that it is trying to divide Tibet and the other Tibet region of China, which now includes other provinces.
Averages that there will be troubles such as France's events.
Boats with police on the streets, shots, car cells: Wolfgang Schaeuble advises that troubles will be made as France's case.
The Federal Minister requires everything possible to ensure that social instability in Germany is not moved to the streets.
The Vandods were made barried, disappeared by the police: after serious threats protagoned by young people in France, the Federal Minister for Interior Affairs, Wolfgang Schaeuble (Party of the Democratic Union) fears similar trends in Germany.
"We have to fix TAMBIEN that social problems in our country do not take the violent form."
"There we have to take it seriously," said in the "New Presse", published in Hannover.
Not all young people are deployed in the continuous change of social reality.
The Federal State, the Federal State and the Communities are already working closely to solve these problems, said Schaeuble.
This concerns not only the integration of immigrants.
"From the Integration Summit to the Islam Conference: all this is now giving its first fruit."
It's still early to get the end of the alarm.
At the same time Schaeuble indicated that German suburbs had the same constructive and social problems as it happens in France.
Young people have protagoned serious troubles on the streets with the police to the north of Paris by nights.
In Tolouse also burned cars and public buildings.
Kenan Kolat, the President of the Turkish Community in Germany requested greater efforts from the Federal Government for integration.
Colat, in view of troubles in France, advises a imitator effect.
It is true that the situation in Germany is not so explosive as in France.
Nevertheless, the actions are necessary.
Colat indicated that the paro indice between young foreign origins less than 25 years of age was higher than the average.
There must be more training posts.
Subraya Colat: "We need to give a perspective to young people."
The President of the Turkish Community added that in Germany more than in France "we are a great social control in the family", more than the French country.
Furthermore, most of the young people of foreign origin do not want to destroy what their parents had built here.
Colat thinks: "But we have to have care."
There should be "allowing youth's opportunity to get faster than a job or professional training".
As long as the night in the parish suburb Villiers-le-Bel passed peacefully.
For centuries of police participated in action, a helicopter who overlooked the territory.
The competent authorities informed three detentions, as well as burned boards and cars.
Since the previous day, a team of almost 1000 police is taking care of security.
After seeing a suburb, Michelle Alliot-Marie, the Minister of Interest Affairs announced that the police will take rigorous measures until it was necessary.
The Monday night at Monday about 80 police were killed for troubles in Villiers-le-Bel.
The trouble continued the next night in Tolouse.
The disturbance started by an accident of traffic in Sunday, where two young people died.
According to the information provided by fiscality, the death of young people was not due to the police.
In the Kingdom of Angela cloud.
The very far action of the reality of the Federal Canciller, shows that coalition in terms of content has come to its last point and that there is no need to wait for nothing else than it.
But in what country lives Canciller?
After its disappearing action, indifers and without much content in the general debate of the Baja Chamber, it must be said that she should not live in the country that should be governed by it.
With regard to the reply made by reiterately dedicated to actions in external policy, the Canciller rejected it with a pre-sessional sentence.
He said that it would be a province and thus showed that he not wanted to understand what the criticians interested.
In the Baja Chamber, it was very clear to everyone expressed that this reply was appropriate.
It could not be a minimum interest, nor any kind of feeling for the country's problems.
But instead of this, Angela cloud has been presented in this way: a very high policy that runs into the external policy and remains there without anything in particular.
Example: Prevention of climate change: it has been a great deal with the decisions taken in Saintndamm, but it does not say anything about how these objectives should be done here in climate issues.
In general, this way to appreciate himself, for two years, the Chief of the Democratic Union Party has not been able to allow so modest.
Because it begins with expressions to get a impuls to people.
And so causes its public image for the practical conception with which the problems without going through the wheels are solved.
But in the Kingdom of Angela the internal problems are little valued.
Children's poverty and concerns for workers with lower wages?
Only it is to speak on this subject using subordinated prayers.
It is impressing how many times it is wrong to speak when it is the addendum for children.
And in this case, Merkel needs more than three attempts to be able to formulate a more or less good sentence.
It began to strike "such as if it was in a unknown territory," when it was more concrete information.
The section is attacked.
The two favourite, Rudy Giuliaani and Mitt Romney, have made an enthusiasm in an overwhelmed discussion of pre-represidential presidency of YouTube and now only a candidate of the external side.
Since a principle, trends are noted between candidates.
Mitt Romney responded to his adversary Rudy Giulliani that he would become New York to " a refugee site for illegal immigrants".
This, on its part, answered with serious prophecies: "I want to say that his own house was a "poerto" for the illegal." Judiani answered the former Governor of Massachusetts, saying that he was who performed illegal immigrants without papers.
The candidates have an attack: as until now the republic group has no clear favour, the eight previous presidency use the debate in the CNN, especially in order to disappear their adversaries.
The small videos of 30 seconds, rolled by internet users who were sent to Youtube, have no much content.
"In this way we left Hitler to get the power," was John McCain's reproach to his adversary Ron Paul, the only one of the meeting he insisted to get away immediately the Irak troops.
Romney also receives many critics by the veterians of the war in Vietnam, when it refused to recognize Waterboarding as torture, a method of interrogation, allowing a person to simultaneously die.
The reactions of the public in St. Petersburg in Florida show that so long the most important issues of the campaign are others, not only war in Iraq, or debates on torture.
The public has always been strong when they loved the conservative values and refused the tax submission.
So you can look better where the weaknesses of both favourite are.
"In that time I missed me," Romney explains composed and asks for people and the public of the television for being a defender of the abortion in 1994.
Judiani, on the other hand, didn’t know what to say when they asked him what he thought about the literal interpretation of the Bible.
For the first time, Musharraf is un uniform.
One day after his demission as the chief of the Army, the President of the Pakistani was sworn as President.
Thus the eight years of military government in Paquistán were completed.
Thursday Pervez Musharraf, President of Paquistán, took a jury for a second mandate of 5 years.
Pescatani television directly transmit the ceremonie to the Presidency Palace to the Islambad capital.
Musharraf swore to respect the constitution and act for the welfare of the nation.
The Middle Ashfaq Kiyani has transmitted its mandate to his trust and, in this way, accepted international pressure, especially by the United States.
Eight years after being done with power with an incredible military slaughter, the former governary state is the first time as a civil leader.
With his complaint to the Chief of Armed Forces, Musharraf fulfilled the main condition of the opposition and the West.
The other requirement is the end of the exception status, which was proclamed by Musharraf on 3 November.
According to Malik Muhammad Qayyum, the general fiscal of the state, after the jury of Musharraf, will soon announce the exception status and fulfil the second condition of the West.
Since the exemption status was proclaimed in the Supreme Court, there were many participatory jurisdiders of Musharraf. The past week the Supreme Court rejected all resources before the new elections of the Chief of the Government on 6 October.
While, in an attraction to a military congress in the North Wateristan region, five soldiers died and four others were wounded.
According to the military portfolio, a bomb triggered on one of the streets in the border with Afghanistan.
Return the Krautrock funders.
The most famous German band in the 70s continued its activity: three members of "Harmonia" participated in a concert in Berlin.
As a recesino was made a copy of "Live 1974" which was written in the best time of the band.
In those times, they were very famous in foreign countries.
The assistance of these three gentlemen to an official food caused the sensation.
Each of them has their cahite, their cups, and over all its bottles.
He sits in the middle of the Dieter Moebius who has 63 years and is dressed with a white bed.
On his left is Michael Rother of 57 years, who has your port and guitar.
On the right hand, looking at the hearing, it is Hans-Joachim Rodelius, 73 years old, which is very occupied with the control panel.
Each contributes to their sounds, among them there are even rhythm.
Sometimes, without any intention, these sounds are converted into a music piece.
It looks like this doesn't hurt the gentlemen.
Something very emotional for Krautrock's attractions was the fact that the Harmonia band returned to make music.
What you need to resist here is the following: the questions with preciseness have shown that the name of the band was relaxed in the mind of people, but it was not so special as after 32 years the public's surrounding it so much.
But why cannot Germans also spend their live ledding over the sixty-year-old?
Besides all, because the Equipe Krautrock was always more valued in England and the United States than in their own country.
When the entertainment industry granted a "Echo" music premium to the members of the Colonia band Can 2003 for his life work, in the room the surprised faces of the German pop artists could be seen.
And when Red Hot Chili Peppers thanked the band La Düsseldorf and Neu!, all opened the mouth with a friend.
Later, Michael Rother was the time in the scenario during the Red Hot Chili Peppers concerts as if he had been an old friend (of the band).
Notice in your country and recognition in the foreigner, is only one thing.
There is a problem to recall this band, because the thirty was only two years, and in those times it did not achieve a great effect in the public, however, it had received afterwards thanks to the others.
A time ago, Moebius and Roedelius had done music with the Conrad Schnitzler artist and had a name, Cluster, who promised a lot of name.
At the beginning they touched in the steel of Berliner Lookbuehne.
Then, for economic reasons, they worked with a music company in Duesseldorf, which was patronized by a church.
During a time, Rother had a workload and then worked a guitarist in the New Band! He made an improvement of the name of this German band that in those times he was too radical.
In 1973 Rother followed the music of Cluster to Forst in Weserbergland.
There, in Alten Weserdorf, which is a destruction of the XVI century, they live as refugees from the city.
Life mode was less ideological than in Common I, where Roedelius was able to leave his position.
It was more than a life of an artist full of surprises.
As they say, one day there appeared a Harmonia Harmonia song partnership of Ottenstein on the basket, which resulted to be a good name for the art.
There were also disagreements in the use of the name of Harmonia.
The first album was called "Musik of Harmonia" and the second "De Lux".
Although the music was quiet and simply, the band had financial problems.
Life as artist was not just to know himself.
The "Live 1974" CD was recorded during a concert in Greecem. Someone remembers that, in this record, almost 50 people participated in this record.
Then Rother expressed his desire to propulse Harmonia and make it when trials.
For Roedelius and Moebius this requirement is against the coasts.
In 1975 the band announces its separation.
Rother has finished placed on the topics of exterism and guaranteed its existence with albums as "Flammende heart".
Cluster revived the eighteen years, and since that time he had more successful than Harmonia.
The direct recording of the album in Griessmer, that needs to thank Greenemeyer.
Your music company Greenland has been made as a goal to build this own German contribution to save it as the live music.
Like Roedelius's work, also the Neu band! It was again discovered.
The presentation of Harmonia as a band has place in the House of the World Cultures in Berlin.
The band was subsidied with public measures of the Wordtronics festival.
There is Julian Cope, English, the old punk and the author of the Krautrock Sampler manual.
There is also Dr. Motte, the inventor of Loveparade.
Thus, all the influences of Krautrock to the next pop music are present.
Harmonia takes the position of a sugar-band, a place that was empty.
The sentence of Brian Eno connected with the special music filled the room: "This music is the only certain music, it includes the future."
There are photos where Harmonia appears with producers in a finca.
The history of the leather development is shown in the white and black photos, where tools are seen with cables.
There are three veterinaries that began to improvise again.
They do nothing else than fix microphones to the body and the batteria to produce extraordinary tone with the help of the impact devices they had built with their own hands.
Currently, electronic music is so that it should be.
Three people deep in the technology.
But that doesn't change anything.
Besides Bárbara Morgenstern, in a musical environment he touched, and in a good moment of enfasis, it sing "Aaaaaaaaaah!".
Krautrock already was a term of English original.
But he never was rocking.
Gender origin was not searched in blue, but in music schools (Can), in technologies (Craftwerk) or from arts and social conventions (Cluster).
Who's crying "68!" is also right, but now Harmonia keeps quiet.
The scenario is very well reflected about what is already clear.
Where is she starting and where is the music over?
This can break the nervous or give a rapid luck moment.
Only Richard Gere's lack of Chinese.
Two films "The Hunting Party" and "Moerderic Peace" are once again dedicated to the war in the Balkans.
But the two did not have a lot of consent.
Or the concepts are much fixed in actions and stirotes or the two films are too emotional.
Richard Gere with his "The Hunting Party" can not help this case.
At the beginning, there was a good news: Karadzic and Mladic, war crimes, continue to hide themselves in the mountain of the Balkans, but exactly there, in the inner darkness of the country during Bosnia war, the acteur Richard Gere was discovered again.
We had finally lost a man in the eighteen years, because nobody wanted to see it after its pleasing and a little important role in women films and after many press conferences on budgetism.
Now, suddenly, Richard Gere is the most important argument to see the movie "The Hunting Party- when a caviter becomes the way heavy" (Why today the titles of the films have to be so long and disappeared?).
The film has a wonderful presentation for the view: in the background, his reporting role in the war is the presentation of what Richard Gere could do, if the destiny and the film industry wouldn't have been so mercyful with him. He was a man whose best time of life had already past, that as a monument of the destruction of his decade was stored until now the most of his love.
"The Hunting Party", despite this triunfo, together with the "Moerderic Peace", which is the German production and will also be presented this week, is only a series of films without success on war in the Balkans.
You can tell the "Moerderical Peace" movie in a few words: it is two German soldiers in Kosovo (Adrian Topol, Max Riemelt) who want to save a serbia of Kosovo francothers, one of them acted very fast, and it also leads to love it.
The sense of the film is paid by actions and tirotes, although we celebrate that serbies are not present once again as the only offended ones.
The film is like the German series "Alarm was Cobra 11" without self-opist, but in war situation.
In the example of "The Hunting Party" can be investigated, because in fact there was never a good film on the war in the Balkans.
On another moment, with another director and with another guilty author (Richard Shepard in two charges), the story of the United States reporters in the war that is going to detect a crime serbia of war called "zorro", probably might be a new "Apocalypsus Now".
So, the stories are surprisely similar: small teams are two-fold to the mountain to carry something that can't do the army and always make a journey.
A reason for the phrase of "The Hunting Party" is when at the beginning presents us to Simon Hunt, to whom he doesn't let him just be a circle with heart.
No, the guilty also provides a lovely adventure with a muslim boss that will be killed later.
Then "The Hunting Party" is very far from the reality, especially when in the last five minutes the reporters with a slightly improving that couldn't achieve the OTAN, CIA and all of the heads of the world, which was capturing the crime of war and leave them to the museum boss to come from a fair form.
It's so bad that they are gaining to the international court in La Hague based on crimes against Chinese logic.
However, the purpose of the film is actually a deep human.
The film wants to condemn the fact that Karadić and Mladić are still free, and it highlights that Americans and French are not really concerned about persecuting them, because they have political arrangements between them.
Sometimes the good and evil are so similar, so one comes to the head a very famous poem of Brecht.
In this poema, it is a mascar of a Asian devil: "In the great arrogs of his face you see, shareing feelings with him, which is hard to be evil."
In the films like "The Hunting Party" there are also these demons but they show that hard is to be good.
The problem is not only in the gender of war films in the Balkans.
A few years ago, he published that all Irak films were fiastics in Hollywood.
It can also be added that there has never been a good film on South Africa.
When a star is placed by a crisis region or mine field, it appears something like "Rangoon" with Patricia Arguette, "To the other side of all borders" with Angelina Jolie or "Damants Bloods" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
All these conflicts may have occurred in a short time space.
They have to pass at least tens until Hollywood runs a good film on the burnt offering, for example, the "The Schindler List".
Some films already need more time. The classics such as war work in Vietnam "The Deer Hunter", "Apocalypse Now" or "Full Metal Jackett" in their times were not held by unanimation as master works.
Today, perhaps we know too much about global conflicts, and so in our times every mortality (Masenmord) is presented directly in two home televisions.
And that's because the gusion authors do not have the smallest repair (which is necessary for power) to tell good stories.
"Ser or not be" or "The Great Dictator" were finally so good, because Lubitsch and Chaplin still didn't know that so bad was the Nazi regime.
Maybe it should not be a good person to ruin a movie.
Maybe it may be like the Lawrence Norfolk newsletter, with your sarcastic view and away from a artist.
When they asked him about the paraleisms between his historical "Dictionary of Lempreère" and the war in the Balkans, he answered, "This must only be changed to some things never change."
Great cities will always be dangerous, men will always be murdered cruel and in Yugoslavia will always reigne the war.
From Beust receives the negative critics on Olympics.
Hamburg home has received many criticians from the political and economic for not asking the Olympics of the Verano.
Many want to continue fighting competitions in the acute sport section.
But Beust remembers that it should be realised by estimating the possibilities.
Hans-Joerg Schmidt-Trenz, Director-General of the Hamburg Trade Chamber, revealed this statement as "not good for economic location".
In the last time, there was no other project in the large city to promote both motivation as well as the idea of the organization of the Olympic Games.
"In this objective, political impulsion could not be maintained, sporting at the same level."
Schmidt-Trenz requested the Senator to not forget this project, but to find a new long-term application "which refers to another time".
The middle of the Ole van Beust made its statements that Hamburg's ambitions in the organization of the Olympicic Games of the Verano would not be performed until at least 2028.
"Hamburg does not decide on the request for the Olympics, but that it decides the German Federation of Olímpic Reports", says Van Beust in the WELT ONLINE.
He reiterated the decision of the Sport Federation (Sportbund) at the beginning of December on the request of Munich for the Olympic Games of the winter of 2028.
"This preference means for us that in this period of time, that we thought to have up to 2028, from the realistic point we will have no opportunity."
Despite all, this dream didn't end forever," said Beust.
The Hamburg Sport Federation (HSB) regrets the statements of Van Beut.
This gives the impression that in the next 25 years Hamburg he doesn't want to ask Olympic Games.
"It's too fast to leave the opportunity, if the plans are upset at this time," said the Verter Ploß, director of HSB.
A complainant of the request was contrary to the statement of the head of the Senate who had been received in a receipt because of the general meeting of the German public Federation of Portuguese Schools (augment).
Alli von Beust designed the request for Hamburg for Universitys in 2015 not as a "restitution" of the Olímpic Games in Hamburg.
Only last week the High School Sport Federation appointed Hamburg as a candidate of the request.
The German Social Democrat Party (SPD-Bürgerschaftsfragment) responded to the Senator that he would not use the so valuable time for the construction of houses in Hamburg.
"Olympics or house construction", said Carola Veit and Jan Quast, Members of the German social Democratic Party.
While SPD always required an integrated Olimpia planning for the small Grasbrook and then the use of built houses, the CDU underlined the importance of maintenance.
At that time, the request for Hamburg for Olympic Games of the Solar 2012 caused a great enthusiasm.
But Hamburg has frauded because of Leipzig.
They're not the wood boxes.
Who mentions the terms of Sweden and wood cake, thinks in Ikea, but doesn't think about Andy Warhol.
Oh, yeah?
Currently, the tree boxes produced in Sweden are like the shadow that deeps the list of Warhol works.
Most of the nine and four Brillo-Box of this list are false.
After a few months the Swedish "Expressen" period would have the doubt about the authenticity of Brillo-Boxes in 1968 of Andy Warhol, the Moderna Museet of Estocolem made internal investigations and came to depressive conclusions: the six "Brillo-Boxes", which the former director of the museum Pontus Hultén gave to the Moderna Museet, are false, and almost a hundred of the others of the "Estcolmo" type, which are in circulation on the international art market, are also one.
Prehistoria is too complicated with a confus relationship between art and patented productions.
In 1964 Warhol created in New York his first "Brillo-Boxes", he painted red, blue and white, with the same show that they had jabson powder cartons.
According to Warhol, in the exhibition of his work of 1968 in the Moderna Museet museum, there were hundreds of the Brillo cards. This did not Warhol (for expenditures), but they were brought directly from the "Brillo card manufacture".
It was not art works, but examples (which were only some objects) exposed.
In that year, 1968, Warhol allowed the production of a Brillo wood chamber in Sweden, but they were not exposed in the Modern Museet Museum.
The Witnesses of those times now speak that almost 15 cases, who at that time entered into the history of the art and the subast as originals of the "Brillo-Boxes" of the "Estcolmo" type authorized by Andy Warhol.
In some subsystems, more than $100,000 were bought.
The problem is that after the famous manager of the museum Pontus Hultén had made false statements that in Sweden in 1968, it was produced and exposed almost a hundred of the wood cakes that Warhol had left them.
But in fact, 105 cases were produced in Malmö for Hultén and for the exhibition in San Petersburg.
Warhol's already died for three years.
Lars Byström, the Chief of the Moderna Museum Conservators, invested six Brillo-Boxes property of the museum, and also three of the Swiss private property that were manufactured in 1968 in Estocolmo. Firstly, they were printed and disappeared their appreciated plates and then painted them on the oil with the pincel.
On the other hand, the structure of the copys of the 1990 shows that the painting was applied with a rock without directly printing the plastics. In addition, it is not the painting of the oil, but the acryl painting.
"These cases have not been authorized by the artist and must be removed from the official list of Brillo-Boxes of Andy Warhol," says Lars Nittve, the Moderna Museo Director and adds that if the Authentication Commission "Andy Warhol Art" in New York will not reach any conclusion, the Moderna Museet will classify these six cases like exposition objects.
In July, the Board of Audition announced formally that these "great accuses" were accepted in Japan's powder boxes.
But since that moment, everything remained in absolute silence.
The rebel soldiers are riding in Manila.
In the Philippines, the rebel soldiers who had been engaged in a hotel in Manila and had required the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
Antonio Trillanes, who reproached the President, the electoral corruption and fraude, said a reporter that could not respond to the blood.
The Trust soldiers in the Government had dedicated the hotel using the laughing gas.
Similarly, two hundred soldiers were attracted since a few hours ago in the building.
As soon as the half of them, among them, Trillans, had judged the Thursday because he had tried to a state attack in 2003, which ended in a fracase.
The negotiations had been closed, so soon it could be paid with some 30 symptoms.
Apparently, the military police who had to monitor him had passed over and followed their move.
They entered the "Península" hotel and demanded the fall of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo.
The government troops blocked the bar around the Noble Hotel.
The Chairman called for an urgent meeting of the Security Gabinet.
Norberto Gonzales, the National Security Counciler, condemned the behaviour of soldiers.
"The people's heart," said Trillans.
"We call people to pass our balls."
General Danilo Lim, who had before gone the Scout Reangers election troop, said that little the other military troops would want to follow the journey.
The major government criticisms called the Thursday to a great manifestation against the President.
Since months, his government receives reproachs for corruption.
In 2003, the financial district in Manila was a place that had all the attention to the engine that was attempted against Arroyo.
The resurrection occurred after about 24 hours because the army wished to participate.
Since 1986, the Philippines have been at least seven attempts of state attacks against the Government chosen democraticly.
The United Internet will be the largest accession of Versatel.

This means that both enterprises have maintained all the options, especially the participation of the anonymic society in Freenet.
The negotiations between the United Nations and Freenet on strategic association ended at mid- November.
This "Game" with Freenet that will be for many months and is not very understandable part of the German market consolidation of Telecom.
