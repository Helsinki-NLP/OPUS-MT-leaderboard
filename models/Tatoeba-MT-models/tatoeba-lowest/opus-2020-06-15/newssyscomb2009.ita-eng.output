The trionfo of the right peoples in Austria: in total 29%
The prerequisite of both parties existing in the large coalition and this marked strengthening of the right-to-right people parties have brought, secondly, the first provisional results, the previous parliamentary elections in Austria.
The Austrian Popular Game (EVP), within which the position of the current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously vacilling, immediately lost.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the future of Austria (BZÜ), Kärnten Jörg Haider, is preparing the trionfale return into national policy.
According to the provisional results, the country's strongest party remains the socio-democratic (SPAU) with 29.8% of the votes, however, with 5,5% of the last elections in 2006.
It's still worse for EVP, which lost 25.6% of the votes almost 9%.
These are the worst results of these two large parties in the Austrian history of the Afterguerra, and especially the literally catastrophic result of the populations, which have caused previous elections.
At the beginning of July, when the EVP left the coalition, the people were in preferences before SPAU a significant advantage.
But the electors have evidently punished them because they have defounded the government.
In the first reactions to the results, there have been speculations on the possibilities of the President of the party, the Vice-Chair, Wilhelm Monterer.
The observers believe that they may have come on Monday during the extraordinary convocation of the direction of the party.
This evolution may be to facilitate the most likely path through the electoral result, which is to renew SPE and EVP coalition .
With regard to the strengthening of both human parties on the right-right and liberal parties (FPAU), 18% and BZE the 11% of votes, but socio-democratics have immediately revealed the concern of another 1999, when people agreed with the collective government, the FPUC was still unified in 2005, which had been directed by the European Union.
On this evolution clearly plays Haider, which has already declared that it is ready to cooperate with any party and presume a return to Vienna into national policy.
In the Parliament has also been able to enter the Very Party, but it is slightly falling down between the austerritical political parties from the third to the fifth place.
No other party has apparently overlooked the slope of 4% and has not entered into Parliament.
Blackenberg: Relations with India you can refrigerate
If you couldn't solve the problem with the chemical scientists who have been accused of the illegal collection of the lack in India, the Minister of Foreign Czech Karel Blackenberg would have reported a certain refrigeration of the Indian Czech reports.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after today's meeting with his Indian Omologo Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it would not be solved, then it would be a certain refreshment," he founded after the meeting she had been held under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee after negotiations said that executive power can differently enter into the legal factors.
However, he mentioned that in the case of Petr âvácha, which was assigned by the “accusation and punished with a lot, the central government can negotiate with the local in Dardjeeling that falls under its jurisdiction.
"Your problem could be solved," said the Minister.
According to Mukherjee, for Emil Kučera had been condemned for three years of prison, to remember a “Emil Kučera above.
Then you can ask liberalization and wait for the sentence in liberty.
Blackenberg confirmed that his partner expressed the same way during the negotiations.
"Recommends the request to the Court of Major then it will be possible to obtain grace," said the Chief of the Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech Party can enter into the complaints is to provide the "comprehensive legal assistance", the Indian Minister.
At the same time, he said that such support is already provided by the Indian Party.
"We have the greatest interest in maintaining the best relationships that are transmitted to India for many years.
The Indians also admit it," said Blackenberg.
At the same time, as she said to 周TK, before his partner stressed that the Czech Republic gives a great importance to the problems of the census enthusiasm.
"We really consider a deep fault of the conclusion and the accused of these Czech scientists," said.
The Minister refused to respond to the question if he had obtained from Indian the promise to take care of the matter.
"I got relatively many promises," she just found.
A Czech Judge in the battle for Sea funds
It is close to the electronic card on the wall on which Australia has been designed and the adiacents of the sea zones.
But it is not interested in the continent, but at a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
The island belongs to Australia and together with her the sea-based foundation.
The area is at the same time as the continent itself, says the Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, which is part of a team of 33 workers of the OSN Division for oceanis and marine rights.
His head, the Ceco Director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is going to follow his exhibition and adds something as much.
Doubts the desire to work and “enthusiasm.
The sea fund is still hiding a little known world of natural resources.
It’s possible to find oil, metallic, and other mineral materials, but also unrecognised organisms that are now leading the key for the discovery of the medicine against cancer.
The largest foundation of the earthquake
Costa State began to provide interest in the sub-marin territory.
According to the OSN Convention, they approve the laws on which they have made an agreement in 1982 in Montego Bay in Jamaica.
It is mostly the area of such continental platform that is often extended to several hundreds of kilometres from the cost of the concerned.
The Convention has a exclusive right on all the resources of continental platform.
"In few words for continental platforms, the part of the sea fund and its subsoul, which is a natural extendion of the continent under the sea.
The exclusive economic area is extended beyond the territorial sea often over 200 miles of nautics," he explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country presents before the Commission to define the size of continent platform should be accompanied by a very widely technical-certain documentation based on many cost-based investigations and measurements.
It is the result of a preparation of many years.
" One of our tasks is to provide the Commission a legal and technical-professional assistance.
The Commission has addressed 5 requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the three last nominations have been successful," added Mikulka.
The recent success of Australia, which has significantly expanded its marine property, has registered a global economist.
However, the New Zealand has also gained us - the surface of the sea fund, which has been granted by the Commission last week, of approximately 1,6 kilometers square, therefore more or less than six times greater than it is.
All and two countries have invested in the research of millions of dollars.
The benefit, which will fruit it in the future from the sea funds, as they are repromised, will be invaluable.
Others will gradually submit their requests.
They can do this for ten years since it was ratified "the Montego Bay Convention".
Where the continental platform begins the area of the ocean fund that the Convention has declared common heritage of the humanity.
Four times no one had a exclusive position.
The right of extension in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the Sea Foundation is not Klondike," says, extracting director Mikulka," because its individual parties are legally demarred and their contractally established. "
The Cheques in the Pacific
A part of the Sea Foundation is also of the Czech Republic today.
If it is separated with other states of the 'ex Soviet block' under the common organization "Intercean metal".
This has bought in 1991, according to the Convention, as well as the investors of few other States, the status of the "Poneering Investor".
He has the right to extract in the area ClarionClipperton in the Pacific Ocean Extended Pacific between Mexico, Hawaiii and Kiribati.
The area studied by the ‘investeur’ and less larger than the former Cecoslovacchia.
The fund is broken, it's almost a submarine replica of Tatry.
"The 'E' may be extended on the total surface of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich bed of polymetallic agglomerates containing nikal, rain, cobalt and manganese," explains another Indian lawyer Pakshi Rajan.
A worker of the division of Macedonia Rober Sandev takes a repercussion to show it.
It looks like a little patate or a bit of fantasy, a legendary sham, like in the legend of the Golem Research.
German special units were present to release the obstainings
The Egyptian government had requested aid to Germany for the release of obediences. The experts then arrived.
When the situation became critical, special units were ready, but they were not intervened.
In the circumstances of liberation of the 11 secured European areas, there are more detailed information.
The Ministry of Defence and the Interior have participated in the special German units on the scrutiny of salvation.
In addition to the military specialists, the GSG9 units, the Federal Aviation Police, the Federal Criminal Office as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution.
As reported the portrait of ministers on Monday evening, the German units are not intervened because the Sequers, seeing the danger of a force intervention, have released the obstacles to escape.
The Egyptian Government accepted the assistance offered by the Germans to join them as directly on the place.
"We haven't arrived for luck," says a carrier of the minister.
Attractors took a group of travelers on 19 September in south Egypt: 5 Germans, 5 Italians, a Roman as well as their 8 Egyptian fellows.
After the removal in a wilderness area in the south of Egypt, the boats were deported in the border area between Egypt, Libya, South and Ciad.
The identity of complaints until the end remained secret as well as the details of release or possible reimbursement payments.
Furthermore, the released have arrived in good terms to Cairo.
Steinmeier said that the released obstances are under the protection of the German Ambassador.
It has not been explained on the details of the release.
There was no information in Berlin for when they returned to Germany.
According to the "Picture" journal, the 5 holidays and special units should be flighted with a military airbus airbus and reaching Friday in Germany.
American representation room rejects the saving package.
The first camera of the American congress just missed the packet of 700 ml's savings for financial markets.
Dow Jones fell down.
By 206 to 227, the American representative house rejected the government's saving package for financial markets.
Despite the appeals of the American President George W. Bush and the political of both parties, there was no majority for the programme, with which the caos of financial markets should be made.
In a dramatic action, the supporters have tried to desperately convince the criticisms of the weight of 700 billion dollars.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the treaties, has provoked Members to consensus, even though the plan was impopolated.
8. It is difficult to have a recognition to avoid something that has not yet arrived.
While the Dow Jones' goal was over 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason of the concerns of investors was that the State rescue pack could fall.
Before the end of the vote, then after announcement of the fault, it is resumed again.
The experts are now waiting for other serious turbulents on international financial markets.
In order to ensure that the programme entered into force is necessary to be welcomed both in the room of Members and Senate.
Promotors register numbers in increased reservations
It seems to be a good winter for German tourist operators:
According to a study, the rental on travel reservations for the next months in comparison to the previous year has been clearly increased - for the advertising winter season more than 30%.
Although we see the weaknesses of joining the desire to travel Germans standing on an investigation remains solid.
On the reservations for the winter season, the travel agency registered more than 31% than the same period of the previous year , as has known Monday the German association for the DRV tourism in Berlin .
According to the investigation of the GfK market research Institute, there are also an increased reservation rate for a month.
So the exemption of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would be approximately 11%, reported the DRV.
For these results, the GfK figures are, which are a monthly analysis of the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies and makes statistical projects for the whole market.
It would also be the travel bookings carried out until the end of August 2008.
Because of the weak quota's weakness of the dollar, the travels in the United States would be requested, he reported the DRV.
Here the increase of reservations would be one third around.
It would also be a special journey request for the Germans, Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as the internal locality to Germany.
Overall, all the travels included have a high quota, explained the President of the DRV Klaus Laepple.
In view of increased costs for energy and food generos, the costs in this case would be better calculable for customers than for individually organized vacation."
Consumers could gain money through, among others, booking discounts made with strong advance or even offers, has explained Laepple.
Even the exact months would have registered eight-time reservation numbers, as compared to the year before it would be again registered a result of the factory - even though in a further study, the number of the technicians who have entered a travel, compared to the previous year.
My first time at Ottoberfest
Hits of Ballermann, a winter of a litro and vip in Dirndln arrested.
A detachment to Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I have actually not much in common.
You are bionda, televisional moderator and puts a Dirndl made on measure .
I have the white hair, I'm studented, and my clothes is second hand.
But one thing comes to us: just 3 minutes to Wiesn, the photos are already starting against us and screw photos until to fill the memory of photo machines – very luring, and this is my first visit to Wiesn.
That's how your friends are doing.
The Dirndl of two money seems to reach his goal.
As the Wiesn tourist and actually in the north of the equator of white salts, the sense of welfare in the coast/habit until today remains in the limits.
And instead, once you arrived to Theresienwiese, it's nothing serious.
Similarly everyone take the Dirndl or the skin screen; no one looks shot or wears – everything perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl's grembole gathers foreign views at the stand of the sandals at the chocolate.
A monochense notes me that I would have taken the grembole in wrong way: "To the left you're free, to the center of six virgins, right you're undertaken, behind widow."
Immediately I'm the flower back to the left.
It's all right," he says and smite.
Others do less spectrums of flirt- and indossy soft softs, on which "To drunk to get dressed!" and throw the cloud district against one who is not invited.
The boy is called Bob, coming from England and also visits the Ottoberfest for the first time.
It's "gorgeous," with a smooth "oooooo."
This tells me, after he was released from his mouth of wine from a litro drinked before.
Just close to one of these ironists, of which everyone thinks it is a pattomy.
Bob is one of these famgers "Wildbiesler".
Others don't have the luck to escape the alcohol in this way.
The eight of the evening walk in the brass on the feast of the feast, who have to bear the poor.
The sisters are each time in brain – always 4 to the time they move a covered tent bar.
This works as with most of the Wiesn visitors: you will be empty, you will return full.
He who lies under the tank in this bar with alcoholic rate in the blood, doesn't see.
"They are the day, where goarnimmer packn," one of the healthys shot me into the baraonda.
Life of an incident identified by the police
A 63-year-old woman died in hospital after invested by a vehicle when he walked to Essex was identified.
Carole Paulson, by Chemsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the incident on Friday on Shenfield Road in the city.
You've been brought to Queen's Hospital, Romford, but she's dead a little later.
After the incident, a 51-year-old man was arrested with the desperate guidance accused.
It has been issued on caution.
Turkey is enlarged by diplomatic horizons
Before Turkey tried to enter into the European Union, the European powers were concerned of falling deep in Turkishland.
On the eastern part of the Bosforo, perhaps 20 steps in Asia, there is one of the most beautiful remainings of this imperial ambition.
The Hidarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-reinsizional style.
This is at least what the tourist leaders tell you.
The building is on horses between the end of the platforms with a tour on each of its corners, looking at the world as some German province municipalities.
The stone is shot.
The whole building is decaded.
But once in the card card office, there is no doubt about the size of the company of what was the most western past.
The station opened in August 1908 from a German consortium, Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retail to the imperial game, wanted to make his ambitions to dominate the Middle East through this rail that runs to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond that today, Saudi Arabia.
But the imperial ambitions in Germany found during the first World War.
His rail came attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and its irregular Arabs.
Related isolation from the circumstance region, generated by the fulger limits of the fresh war, is passed
British and dominant forces went out of Egypt and shot the Turkish and their German allytics out of Palestine and Syria.
And there were bad news for the Hyderpasha station.
In 1917, a train of munitions shot out by destroying its tetto design.
Turkish sources say it was a sabot.
From then he went slowly in disappointment, widely over of history.
But today, this rail speed for Anatolia and all the eastern points, they serve -- at least symbolally - to demonstrate the more larger diplomatic horizontals in Turkey.
The Governing Party of Justice and Development - the AKP - has created a new foreign policy for the country.
Related isolation of its circumstances, generated by the ends of the fresh war, is passed.
There is now a new engagement policy.
Once noting the Turkish Government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian actions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To appreciate the parameters of this new external policy, I fell on the bed vagon for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the main experts of the AKP external policy, the Turkish Parliament Suat Kiniklioglu.
On the next morning - about ten hours and half after - after a bubbles course on the streets that produced the old world falls of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I came into the Turkish capital - proposed as a new city for a secular status to turn the backs to his ocean past.
But the AKP with its well-known islamic radice represents an exhibition in the Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspects in the West, more notably in Washington.
A taxi leads me to the General AKP, a ultra-moderne structure of stones and steel - built to this - in a surrounded surrounding on development, surrounded by built trade centres and power passengers, where manager is full of business - both men and women - meet them to make contracts from the first morning.
The Kiniklioglu Suat may be a central policy of almost every other political party in Europe.
Composed, cravate, I'm sure you've got a Blackberry.
"The goal of the external policy game is now to reintegrate Turkey with its neighbors.
"The fred war was an annoalia," he said to me.
Turkey was thrown out of its entrance.
Today you must watch east and west at the same time.
It wasn't one or another.
They must be both.
"But sure at a certain point, "I ask, "The Turkey will decide?"
"The Turkey," says, "I don't want to address the choice."
Then emphasises a point that almost all with whom I have spoken here have been remembered: the links of not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and around the Black Sea, are benefiting to Europe and the United States as well as to Turkey.
With Turkey on the boat, the message seems to be, the whole Europe can metaforically run these railway lines towards east Asia and the Middle East.
Once again to the Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think that the two German gentlemens, Mr Ritter and Mr Conu, who watched this built building for 100 years ago.
How much it would be surprised that the Middle Eastern Europe can now be in the hands of Turkey.
And while I look at the terminal for the tragic that brings me back through the Bosforo, I remember that Turkey has always been called "the sick man in Europe".
Then at least it seemed not to be sure about what continent has to be forwarded to this desperate country.
Remember: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: as the musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, 11 September) has been loaded the Guildford Philharmonic Orchester and the core.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the next year he founded his wonderful young core, Proteus.
It was supposed that they were under-21/ under the 21-year, but when the Proteus shouted his end in 1979, many of us were more than twenty-years -- we just refused to repay to the core.
The name "Proteus" (the metologic to be mutable) represented the good will of the core and the ability to address everything that the music presented to do, both madrigals and Mesiaen, without compliance or with all the orchestra.
The musical versatility generated by a so young core was often sorrowful, always enormous, and it was all because of the inspiration of that man and the enthusiasm for the music which was absolutely constant over the years.
How often it was told us from death to "lance that is music to speak for himself."
He said, "The composer knows what he wants.
There's everything in music.
"Therefore sing it!"
His technique in the use of the bathroom was absolutely clear and precise, although never dictatoral nor flowery.
Everything was the musical standard, he made it always higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If you had to appoint a supervisor would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew it very well during the two decades in which the Guildford Philharmonic led to 1982.
During the past 40 years and more I have regarded more than 100 of its concerts, and I can honestly say that I have never been in disagreement with one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Handley had that rare combination of personal size and modest.
He hated the directors of the orchestrans that, in his words, simply "while around the world one or two well-killed horses."
He'll miss so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett wrote:
Your nerology of William Woodruff (25 September) indicates that "In 1946 he re-examined economic history in Oxford and in 1950 became a researcher in Houblon-Norman... studying the same time for a skill in science, a letter and a PhD".
This results from the note of the author of Woodruff in Beyond Nab End, but it is not correct.
From 1946 to 1953, he was an student of economic history at the University of Nottingham, who completed a PhD team on the British Game Industry industry, overseeing Prof. J. D. Chambers, and later published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He passed on 1950-51 as a researcher in Houblon-Norman, and the summer of 1952 to the University of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he continued to leave Nottingham for Illinois.
Because Woodruff chosen to hide this part of his carrier, you don't know.
J. Vincent Resino at Philology Faculty
"Recommending the show of José Vicente Resino "Flamenco and Life", because its photographs in white and black, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
My attention to simply and the force they transmit, even though the protagonists are being treated with particular respect.
A show that it is very feeling.
You can take magic moments."
Second summit by Honda's superstitious Honda
The Honda will begin the marketing of the second generation of the Jazz model.
If the previous model had already been added to great inhabitability, this new monovolume has a larger internal space.
To everything, a raffined mechanism will be added, which increases the comfort of guidance and allows for fuel saving.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Even though the new Jazz presents a very similar line with the previous model, changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among others, it is the pen of reporting an innovative design, a new platform, larger size and new mechanism.
However, before transiting to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after the entry into the first generation market.
Therefore, a first comment is that Honda has renewed this model in shorter time than those used by other producers.
Although Jazz model is less known than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in fact of sales.
This is exactly the case of Japan, where Jazz was the most saled car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Just in Japan, almost a million of Jazz units were sold since the lancement.
The second market was the old container, with about half million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes that the new Jazz will allow you to increase sales in segment.
In 2007, if Japan’s company has sold a total of 83,000 of this model, the estimates were added around 100,000 cars, adding an increase in sales of 17% in the European market.
With regard to the Spanish market, the Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz units since 2002, which corresponds to 6.7% of the total of Honda sales in Spain.
With regard to the new generation, the responsibility for the Spanish daughter is expected to sell around 2.000 Jazz units in a year.
Just the arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to reduce a good measure the shot of sales in Spain.
In fact, the company's responsibilities intend to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 sold units, either 4.000 less than in 2007, with a 16% square.
Despite the increase in sales, the Honda has increased its market quota in Spain, reaching 1,8%, over 1,6% of the past year.
In addition, the Japanese society is expected to reach 2 per cent in 2010.
To enable us, the Honda trusts in the arrival of another new model.
It is Insight, a hybrid at five gates and compact format - 4,37 meters of length - which Japan's society hopes to sell about 200,000 units throughout the world.
For the markets and in accordance with the estimates carried out by the Japanese producer, 50% of the insight sales will be placed in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be paid between the old container and Japan.
The trade launch of Insight is intended for the first months of the year, immediately after the presentation in society in January in Valencia.
As regards the first generation, the new Jazz is grown in all its parties.
His length reaches 3,90 meters (5 centimeters in more), width 1,69 metres (two centimeters in more) and the intervalle of 2.50 metres, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained invariable at 1,52 meters.
In addition to the increased size, the living inside is also expanded.
This benefit results from the entry of a new platform, and on the other hand from the entrance of the fuel serbate in central position, a solution adopted in the previous Jazz model.
Furthermore, the capabilities of the box – docked by double background - sales 399 litres, or else, 19 litres more the capacity of the first generation.
It is noted that these are the measures of the version 1.4, and that the capacity of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 litres.
Other improvements - beyond external elements, such as posting leaders or the possibility of uploading the panoramic vitro - are an improvement of accessibility to posted chambers.
The doors allowing access to post positions are opened by a 80 degree, compared to 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
Furthermore, motors in this second generation of jazz are new.
At the time of marketing, this small model is proposed in the models with a benzin motor of 1.2 and 1.4 litres.
Mechanics include i-VTEC technology that allows to lower consumption, produce less emissions of carbonoxide, optimize the mechanical and at the same time keeps high the motor couple in all its phases.
The model from 1.2 litres allows us to use a power of 90 cv to 6.000 rounds with a maximum of 114 Nm. to 4.900 rounds.
The propulsion – that in previous Jazz reached 78 horses - use 5,3 litres of fuel and produced CO2 emissions approximately 125 grams.
As regards the previous propulsion, which was used in the first generation model 83 horses now are available 100.
Jazz 1.4 to 100 horses reached a combination of 5,4 litres of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emitted.
The "Ape car" to avoid collections
In the development of technologies for the prevention of accidents, Nissan has inspired, this time, to nature, and in particular to the assumptions.
The Japanese society has created a robot, which, for example, takes the flight of the assumptions, can avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, or the first step towards collection technologies.
The technological engineers of the Nissan Motor Co. developed this small robot in collaboration with the Centre for Science and Technology of the Pre-University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director-General for Public Tecnology and Research and Development of Brand Management, BR23C is an enlargement of the Scott of Security of four areas produced by Nissan.
This robot is intended to improve the capacity of preventing collections in the vehicles of the producer house.
During the flight, each species creates a own personal space of oval form that is very similar to the Nissan security excuse.
But the most important thing is the eyes of the skins, in order to see in all directions with an angle over 300 degrees, which allows them to fly without interruption in his personal space.
In order to recover this visual functional functionality, engineers have put on a point what they have defined a localization laser (Laser Range Finder).
This mechanism identifies the obstacles that are before BR23C for a race within the two metres and with a maximum of 180 degrees, calculates the distance than the object and sends a signal to a microprocessor that immediately allows to prevent the collection.
"In the time in which it describes an obstacle, the small robot follows the movements of a skin and immediately changes direction by turning on the right angle roads to avoid the collection.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the evasion manual is totally integrated.
"If it wasn't so, the robot would not be able to respond with sufficient speed to avoid the obstacles," says Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Mobility Laboratory and Engage the Head of this project.
On the difference of a pit, the robot can't turn to the top or downward, and even in the diagonal; it can only be moved in two sizes and in the direction where it can turn its roads and does not use infinite directions and ways like the apics do.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, beyond acceleration and acceleration, so that the small robot could avoid collections.
"This device only needs to develop information every second and act from these data.
You do not require the memory of information or the intuitive logic of the previous hands, therefore you can work without interruption and only a couple of KB memory dozens.
This can be surprised, but we are not talking about memory gigabytes, and even about mega."
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for the current prevention of collections, a technology that Nissan auspice will be series in the cars within ten years.
The robot uses battery for litio polymers, which are more read and more dure than the type of litio ioni.
Another future potential application of this technology may be the integration of units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the leader to destination by avoiding the obstacles present in the path.
Trema before asking a premium
We need to recognize that the Department of the United States's Teacher, except we have many capitals to intervene, is not certainly a privilege of engineering.
Besides the crisis and to avoid the fact that the Americans engaged in the banks with uncertainty, they created a funeral and instructive game for the users of the network: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the "Hotel of Credits..." or the problems.
The teat appears of this system and, in particular, its receptor needs to put into think not one, but two or three times before asking a receipt.
And, above all, where to do, that probably is the primary goal.
Of course the information that the game provides is useful, but it is little detailed.
It is more than a page for adolescents than a large public site.
What happens if the game is complete?
Well, compare a song room in the hotel.
It's always something, because to buy a better house if you don't even speak...
Morgan Stanley opens the MUFG's capital
Morgan Stanley announced the subscription of a agreement with the UFJ Financies Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest nine billion dollars in a share of 21% of participation in the Society, news after a net lower of its actions in Borsa.
One week after the end of an provisional agreement, the two banks explained that the MUFG would buy 9,9% of the assets of Morgan Stanley's assets at the individual cost of $25.25, or a amount of $3 billion.
The price set is lower than 19% to the accountable value of the tits at 31 August.
The MUFG will also invest six billion dollars in the acquisition of convertible tits to a conversion price of $31.25 and ensure that 10% benefits are made.
Morgan Stanley stated that the global operation would be carried out on the basis of an average of $29, or a lower percentage of its current course of 28 per cent.
However, on 17.00, the title Morgan Stanley was lowering from 6.79% to $23.07.
"This strategic commitment is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley in bank holding company", explained John Mack, Director-General of the American group.
Morgan Stanley has adopted this new status last week, which should allow you to distinguish its actions by taking them under the control of the Federal Reserve.
Its commitment with MUFG also confirms as the current financial crisis costs the largest names of Wall Street to adopt a more smarter attraction than that previously.
Monday also shows that in the last days the agreement was amended: Monday last Monday, Morgan had just announced the sale of 20% of its Japanese colossed actions for a sum of $8,5 billion.
"A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshide Mizuno, Executive Director of the MUFG, she explained: "We thought our participation quota would be exclusively composed of ordinary actions.
But in view of the current situation of global and market economy, we have chosen to minimize risks and protection."
Based on the average price paid, the MUFG will open Morgan Stanley tits at a lower price than 7% of their accounting value.
And the operation would lead to an investment at least 20% of the diluted equity."
The Agreement provides that the MUFG may become the average of its preferred titles in ordinary actions if, during a date period, these times were exchanged over 50% under the fixed conversion price, or about 47 dollars.
Morgan Stanley ensures that the MUFG capital would allow you to collect investment opportunities, strengthen its budget and increase their liquidity.
However, a group's carrier refused to provide specifications on the strategic projects of the two new allegeds.
After MUFG investment, Morgan Stanley should therefore establish a solvibility coefficient for animal One, approximately 15% of the best sector.
Morgan has expressed that "really" added its budget from the end of August.
In the last weeks, the group was hard tested, which saw the value of its actions, while risk insurance costs immediately imposed.
However, the refluence of Monday remained at a high level, about 12%.
The week last the Goldman Sachs, only another superstit" between the large Wall Street investment banks after Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the remark of Merrill Lynch, announced 15 billion dollars, partly at the Berkshire Hathaway group of Warren Buffect.
Rafael Correa in Quito, this Monday.
Founding the republic on a socialism right at the XXI century.
This is the common project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Evo Morales Ecuadorian and Rafael Correa.
Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the last to refer to the project of a new Constitution.
The mission has completed that 64 per cent of the elector's electoral had voted to the referendum, on a basis of votes equal to 80 per cent.
According to these results, the "no" was 28%, while 7% of the votes were no one and 0.7% white cards.
If the draft of the Constitution is adopted, the half of the votes should be obtained, more one.
Sunday, two songs carried out to the output of the electoral seats and a estimate of a non-governmental organization had announced " yes", where it was 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa had otherwise revealed in the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his constitution project.
The "Constitution has trionefastly," he assured, congratulated with the ecuadorians in the area of the Guayaquil Governor, 280 km south-west of Quito.
As always, Chávez and Morales welcomed Rafael Correa, as has done its chile oomloog Michelle Bachelet.
The scrutiny, which has been done fully in accordance with the electoral observation mission of the United States (OEA), was based on a text of 444 points to consolidate the "new socialism" defended by the President.
This draft of the Constitution grants the power of the state on the economy, reserved it the "pronouncement of the development" of a country which lives essentially of the extraction of the oil operated by large foreign companies and accordingly of their currency.
In 2006, the project agreed more power to the head of State, which will be elected for two consequent mandates of four years, will be able to disappear the meeting.
Correa has already announced the intention of endeavouring this amendment and to reply its candidate for a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also states the free free health and education services, which the President has started promoting in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives under the threshold of poverty.
It also prohibites the presence of foreign troops, which will end the Congress between Quito and Washington for the use of an ecuadorian basis as a point of starting for American anti-term operations.
The 19 hosts freed in Ciad
A Egyptian command launched the rescue to the eleven tourists and of their eight followers ten days ago.
I'm at Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian prisoners held in the wilderness for ten days have been reported on Monday, afternoon, health and health in Egyptian capital.
On the morning, they were released to Ciad from a Egyptian command.
Apparently, the hosts arrived at the military base of Almaza, near the Cairo International Airport, on 15 and 30, at the edges of a special airport.
On the board of an elicotter, it was immediately transferred, without allowing any interview to the pressure, the Maadi hospital, a danger of the Cairo residence, to be subject to analysis.
God of "good health" and not has been paid any remnant "a Sequestrians", declared on the road of the Egyptian Minister of Tourism, Zoheir Garanna.
On 19 September, during a safar in 4x4 feet of the Ouanat mountain, financed with Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hosts was slapped from a hidden on the other 35 unknown secretractors.
The group was formed by 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and a Roman – and eight Egyptians: two leaders, four authors, a border guard and the manager of Egyptus, the organising agencies of Safar.
An Egyptian security responsible said that 30 members of the special forces, on the boat of two elicotters, had launched the removal during the night, a little before the alba.
"They have been shots, half of the sequestriers have been killed, while the others have escaped," said he who had asked to keep the anonimate.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the "ampo" unit were mandated in Sudan, where the German and Italian commands would support them.
The Minister of Italian Externals Franco Frattini stressed, by Belgrado, the importance of the role of secret officers and of the special forces of Italy.
We must admit that if we have obtained this result was due to professionality and effectiveness of men of our secret services, special forces," he said, not to add other details.
In addition, the payment of a remuneration has been paid.
On the first day, the Sudanian army of pattuilla said to have interfered a 4x4 vehicle on the board of which the secretrators were found and had killed six, including the chain of the rulers, and had taken two.
According to the army, the Sequers would be bound to a Darfur rebel organisation, the movement for the Liberation of Sudan (SLA_U), immediately dismissed by this last.
Letter- The silent majority of the culture
On the first page, a debate on the financing of the culture focused on the current electoral campaign.
That's better.
But a part of our cultural life remains in shadow.
Who will be proposed to declare the wages granted to small museums, archives, archaeological slaves or national historical places that do hunger?
What politics will remembrance the federal government that is overcoming monuments and heritage buildings?
What in Quebec, such as in Canada, we do not have trues and their laws that are actually keeping our heritage?
Did you know that the French government puts three million and half euros for the only restoration of the Chino castle in the Loira valley?
Instead of our neighbouring Americans, it is the Constitution to say that the protection of heritage is part of the national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by each citizen, by any political authorities and by any government department, and all that of common agreement.
In Quebec, at the Federation of History Society of Québec, at least 40 000 volunteers who, in 211 companies for the safeguard of historical, genealogy, archives and heritage goods, maintain, with four money, private archives and archaeological sites.
They are exactly those who often defend our heritage, which protest with the energy of disappearance when real estates and decision-makers attain with their bulldozers our remaining and forgotten cimiters.
When will the right space be reserved to history and heritage?
Benelux governments are born a part of the Fortis Bank
The Benelux states help by partial nationalization the Belgian-Irlandese Fortis bank, which has ended in difficulties for first in Europe for the United States market crisis: the three countries will provide 11,2 billion euros to the financial Institute - insurance with interests also in Hungary.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and Netherlands at the end of the week have been agreed at the maximum level, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Competition Commissioner.
In the euro area the first major crisis in the context of the challenges discussed by the international financial market for more than one year is that of the Fortis Bank, and in a certain point the decisions taken in this regard can be made a previous.
In accordance with the Sunday Decision, all and three States will delay almost half (49%) of the bank quota present in the country.
The bank will sell almost certainly part of its interests, including before all the assets, especially insurance, from the Dutch ABN Amro purchased a year ago.
Last week the actions of the Fortis began with a vertical crowd, serious crises of the Institute were then presented in the second half of the week.
However, the analysis are agreed in the view that the bank with 85,000 employees is too large to allow you to go in fall.
Friday bank actions have falled nearly 12%, the lower point than 14 years.
The value of the actions is reduced since January more than two thirds.
In view of current action prices, the whole value of the group is approximately 14 billion euros, but according to bank leaders, this value is not real.
The Business Research imposes the Fortis action crown on the uncertainties of the extra European market due to the assignement of the American Plan of $700 billion.
Monday, the title was slowly resorted.
Vendiday Philp Dierckx was appointed a new Delegated Officer of the Bank.
The financial Institute has also searched for private acquirers but no one has been presented with a meritable offer.
The Belgian government already previously assured that investors should not fear to lose money.
The bank clients have not been distributed, the filias have not been assigned.
In Hungary, the Fortis Fortis owner of self-employment and has also bought leasing books.
The flood in the pollution
In America, people's health insurance providers, based on the data of medical acquisition, often refuse to stipulate a insurance contract.
Experiences of privacy have said that the data market is revealable.
"There is a private program according to the use of medicine data, in any case, depends on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is how to fill volp pollution – write Washington Post circling Richard Dick author of the program to follow the requirements of medicines.
The insurance companys subordinate the insurance tariff and the number given in case of synthses to the status of the client's health of the event and if they are too high, the risk does not shoot the insurance.
The customer had to be undertaken to a medical visit, and the contract was stipulated only after the outcome of the review.
Dick 10 years ago has found a more economic proceeding: on the basis of the client's identification code you can easily have information from the medicines which medicine has bought in the last year and half and from this program proves which diseases are suffered and in which health conditions they are found.
For example, if it is regularly acquired large amounts of colesterol reductors that means that the fat level is in an inevitable practice and is classified in the highest risk category.
There are various versions of the programme, some are also determined by the multi-related risk survey, so the carrier does not remain much, even if there are little difficulties.
Among the contrary, some medicines are used for more purposes, for example, some composers are useful against emirates or heat vampires, but are also effective against depression.
This last, from the assurance point of view - commercial, as a risk factor, the first two no.
For the request and development of the data, companies were formed partly and these, before obtaining the medicinal information necessary, ask the patient’s approval.
Now, the authorities are obliged to do so, even though they haven't infringed much for non-gency.
Some recently said are also preparing the result of laboratory exams and link them to medical consumption data to provide a more precise image of the status of patients’ health.
You always have access to the data and parallelly the control of the use will be always more difficult.
There is a law on privacy, but its validity is only extended to health services and insurance.
For the Congress, there is a proposal for a law that gives the control authorities to the data service undertakings.
Richard Dick believes that it is not enough: for this reason he developed a program that links the data to the approval expressed by the person concerned.
Another question is that the person concerned cannot dismiss the approval because the insuranceers otherwise do not stipulate the contract.
Then at the end, the gallines are confidenced to the wing.
Global marginal menu
European Union and India raddoppian trade
Since the European Union and India are partners that are particularly negotiating, even the order of the ninth meeting to the top has been dominated by this subject, above all the other global problems.
Today, there will be a French-Indische top that will be first place of the nuclear cooperation.
The European Union recognizes the fact that India becomes a major democratic power to which it should be mentioned in international affairs, but Member States have not yet been able to decide whether to support or not New Delhi as a permanent member in the United Nations Security Council.
So it has not been stressed at this issue in the ninth summit organized yesterday in Marsilla.
The French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as President of the Union, José Manuel Barroso Chairman of the Commission and Javier Solana High Representative to the foreigners, received the Prime Minister of India Manmohan Singh, which found the agreement to raddoppi in five years, which is an increase in EUR 100 billion, the trade.
Considering that between 2000 and 2007 the exchange of goods has resulted from 25 to 55 billion, this is not too ambitious.
Consequently, they have unified the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements, so the air traffic can also take the way in future.
India at the end of 2009 would like to sign the liberty of trade agreement with the Union.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the agreement.
The goal is to balance, because the EU is the first trade partner in India, but New Delhi is only the ninth place between EU partners.
The top has dedicated attention to the global factors.
At the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and the terrorism, the last condemned in all its forms of both parties, and reiterated the convocation of a United Nations conference.
They urged the conclusion of the Doha Round commercial conclusion, even though both the parties have had a role in the fall of this.
The EU has confirmed the continued energy and climate programme, so it would like to reduce at least 20% in 2020 emissions of nocive substances.
India is also agreed on this, as well as on the fact that it would be necessary to establish a comprehensive contract to the Climate Conference for the next year and to reduce 50 per cent of the production of green gas.
They also want to strike the increase in food prices and have supported the convocation of an international meeting to review the financial crisis.
The first Indian Minister will today be requested in the French capital where a bilateral meeting is prepared to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of atomic energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that in order to build Indian nuclear reactors, the French disasters will receive an exchange of the value of 20 billion euros.
According to the information of our printing agencies, the agreement would be 15 years old.

I found Steve Fossett's airport a year ago
The aircraft of Steve Fossett was found, the billion died on 3 September 2007 while he was flood into the wilderness of Nevada.
The rocks were returned to a 3000 meters of height, in the Nevada Sierra of Mammoth Lakes, between California and Nevada.
But there were no people in the airside.
Madera County, John Anderson, fled the doubts that remained: "The aircraft has been placed, we have sent a team, and now we have confirmed that it was exactly about what Steve Fossett was flighting the day in which he was disappeared" he said in a printing conference.
The sceriffo has therefore stated that no human remainings were left or in the air, nor in the surrounding area.
The billion, 63en, was died in February.
The American Transport Safety Office (Ntsb) had known that some hours after the advertisement of the crime was sent a team of investigators, which then identified the device: it was just Bellanca 8kcab, dispersed from 3 September 2007, when Fossett was disappeared from Yerington to Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, in California, not far from the Nevada border, some personal effects of Fossett were returned from a couple in the presss of their inhabitants of Mammoth Lakes.
It is two documents with the name of Fossett, both of them emitted by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, of money in steel and of a pit.
Fossett's research was interrupted a month after his disappearance.
The billion was acquired a place in the history thanks to a long series of princes.
In 2002, at the sixth attempt, the first man was to complete the world round on a aircraft: two weeks in solitarian aircraft.
Three years later, he made the world round in the air and without square.
Between the many records, even the one who had flighted at 15,445 meters of height, above the Ande, but with a copoat.
Glk, the publicity that don't look at you
A Suv out of the schemes with a original design and well defined by decade lines, large surfaces and net corners.
This is, in synthesis, Glk's last birth between the "compacts" of the star house with which Mercedes-Benz tried to give a newswind in this area.
It will also be inspected and not conventionally the communication that will accompani the Suv Glk launch, available at Mercedes-Benz showrooms from the next 17 October.
This is how the public battery that will accompani the new vehicle will start an inadequate communication mode also through a 3D receipt campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automobilistic brand.
A project of maxi-fissions, artistized in three different steps, which will manage the central way of the Milan Shopping, Corso Como until 15 November.
The first stage of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic visious and thanks to special eye distributed in Corso How you can see the new Suv in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, watching the image will be the impression that the car is out of the demonstration.
Next, through the use of Elumina8 new Glk will be illuminated in different times in all of its details, then returning to a single image.
Mercedes, of course, is trying to introduce something again in the stereotipate field of the automobilistic communication.
Is this form to stumble the interest of future acquiring futures?
Here are the Italian Hooligan
From Triveneto, they risk the Derpo.
But who are these 150-200 kids and girls who are now ashamed by Italy? They are part of the "Urras Italy" group that follows the National Azzurra and that, for the truth, never had created overseas problems.
He never met with adversary tips.
The extraction of the group is right.
Promotors are from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
These in Sofia are added groups (a few units, actually) from Campania and Puglia.
There are three-color bands where the citys of the military origin are: Saturday night they have been taken to be not identified.
They inspire the English tifose.
In Bulgaria, they have found a tifose of true Nazists, the Levski.
The Figc had provided Italian 144 tickets for the game: all appointments, so easily controlable.
And the Viminale had all controlled them: among those parties for Sophia there was no one with an ongoing Dispo, no one who had been infected by the frequency of a stage.
At four aggressive tips, which had previously delayed by stadium, was rejected and prevented the transfer.
The Viminale is currently expected to read the acts that will come from the bulgarian police and then take actions: in this case, it is possible to give the Derpo for at least five years to the arrested or to those who have been identified in disorders.
An international weapon that prevents not only the Italian stages but all Europe.
Our hooligans, insommate, willn't put foot in one stage.
Good luck.
But now there's fear-emulation: that's that the fewer than one hundreds and others are added.
"We must throw this fire immediately and not read the ones in this way," support Viminale.
So, "oother goodly open in view of the Friday National Party to Lecce."
In fact, there is a small point of supporters in the Italian U.S.
Tomorrow, the Observatory meetings the Casms, which can also be mentioned on a section of the Asysse, such as secret services, which is concerned with stadio problems.
"The hearts of Duce-Duce and the thick arm during the island of Mameli? In Bulgaria isn't heavy..."
This thought (which really little happy) of Sunday Mazzilli, for a few weeks, Director of the Viminale Observatory (has taken the place before Francesco Tagliant and then from Felice Ferlizzi).
Forward Mazzilli was out of Trieste, where there was an Utras Group's supporter nocle, founded in 2002.
It's true, as says Mazzilli, that in Bulgaria has not tried to bring the Duce but certainly the behaviour of these 150-200 tiffs was ashamed.
"I don't do the sociologe - add No.1 of the Observatory - the cases must be admitted in the country where the fact comes.
Until now, this group was left in line, now we will see what happened and we will value for the future.
But we're also talking about the fiss at the inner of Mameli: they're not weakened, but if you let me not be educated..."
