Barack Obama will be the fourth American President to receive the Nobel Price of Paix
The American President Barack Obama will move for Oslo in Norway to pass 26 hours and be the fourth American President of the history to receive the Nobel Price of Peace.
The diploma, medaille and cheque of $1.4 million will be given to its exceptional efforts to strengthen global diplomacy and cooperation among the nations.
The Chief of the Blanche House and his wife Michelle will spend early in the Norway Metropol and will have a programme charged.
It will first come to the Nobel Institute, where he will first meet the five members of the Committee elected it in October between 172 and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple planning then provides a review with the King of Norway Harald V and the Queen Sonja.
The visit will meet its summ on the afternoon of a solemne ceremonium where Obama will receive the premium reward.
It will be the fourth American President to receive it, but only the third that will be deprived by the Committee's initiality.
The White House informed the progress that Obama would speak about the war in Afghanistan during the price redistribution.
The President does not want to avoid this subject because it is aware that he receives this price as a president who leads a war in two countries at present.
He enhanced war efforts for a few days ago by sending additional units to Afghanistan, and no of its criticians will be forgotten to stress.
In the ceremonium, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a cheque of ten million Swedish corners (approximately 1.1 million euros).
He has not yet decided that it gives the work of well-being, but it is not yet a concrete decision.
Its programme will then be engaged as well as its wife to a bank, including the King and the Queen of Norway, the Chief of Government and 250 other inviteds.
Obama was rather restitious at this price at the beginning.
For example, he mentioned the feeling of not merit it fully.
He also repeated several times that it is not a price for himself but for all those who defend the same values as he.
From the announcement, he said that it would be a "invitation to act."
A defender of the nature accused of scanning
The Litom's police has shouted the president of the Association Society of Protecters of the nature of Litom月ice.
On several times last year, he called for several construction cancer procedures and asked for the money of the investors for his personal benefit to exchange his call, Alena Romová, a Port of the Litom's police, said.
The President of the Society of the Protectors of the Natur of Litom月ice is Lubomír Studnička.
It is currently detention and risk until three years of implant.
Three of the wastes are not to the parfum in Brno
In Prague everybody can trip its drinking bottles, while in the villages of South Moravie you fall on three-three benes to each coin of the street.
And in Brno?
There, you should take a few minutes before you can find the appropriate Benens.
I don't mean we wouldn't trick all the waste in Brno.
But I have the impression that the municipal advisers of our city, the second larger city of the country, are not sufficiently interested in this problem.
Brno is at the age of stone of three of the waste not only because citizens are still able to throw the paper, the sight and the PVC, but especially to see the number of Benens dismissed to these wastes.
Have you already tried to throw a plastic bottle in the city centre?
It's all a science, which needs mostly time and nerfs of acid.
The only place I found for now is the place of Moravie before Potrefena Husa.
That Mr. Undka and his colleagues don't want me to, but it seems very little to me.
Without talking about the fact that in other towns of the city it is not a symptom.
So to end, many of my friends do not drink their waste.
Parently.
It makes them a trot to come to the goods.
It doesn't get me out of them.
I myself, after a feast, I proposed to go to throw a few white and PVC bottles.
Besides I haven't seen any red color benees.
Hopefully, I found the right place by taking the tram.
That said, the waste would be abolished.
It's after all the Brno center, who is worth representing the best city, right?
It is likely that ecology and an expertise are not too interested by Brno's socialists.
You are intended to buy the city a first place in hockey link that makes the city shame in the whole country, instead of buying some additional goods and proposing the three of more first materials for a greater Brno.
I'm pleased to comfort my impression with official statistics after translating a moment on the Internet.
According to the EKO-KOM Society, Brno is really the worst of the South Morovia region.
The Paroube budget has been removed from retained money and disease consents
After the left has increased, despite the opinion of the government, farmers or employees, it may be that there may be no money for pensions, feedings or housing disappearances.
But also for the interests on the debt of the State or international judicial procedures.
This will increase the problems of those who will go over in the second half of the next year, the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota.
When social democracy and communists imposed increase in certain classes, they were based on the fact that the government will make impressives for sensitive expenditures, pensions or disease congés. "There is only to address the problems later, to minimiz the field," said Janota.
It is necessary to know that the money affected the interests to pay is even higher and that it should be refunded early or later.
The State does not actually have the choice to know where to put money.
If it does not lower social aid or expenditure, it should increase taxes.
To all those that the left has currently increased: pumps, institutes, farmers.
And then, to their children.
People will touch them and must not be afraid of their pensions or their disease insurance, including 1.8 billion.
But at the expenditure of a larger finality of the State - the next year, it will therefore not fail 163 billion in the cases, but more.
Despite the efforts of the Minister of Janota, the debt will increase more rapidly and with it, the costs related to interests.
The State will need money to repay and it will not be sufficient to slightly increase TVA or to reduce maternity congestion as the government has made it in its anti-deficient package.
It will also miss five billion to buy road constructions and iron paths because of money transfer to some groups of elections.
This is mainly a decision-making and enthusiastment of which projects are not possible to reduce costs.
On the other hand, that's not free.
This means delaying or stoping thirty large cancers, and the pre-payment of the European Funds is also in danger, according to the maintenance of Karel Hanzelka, port-Spoil of the Department of Transport.
The SSD proposed to solve the very adverse financial deficit - it will be in the divisions of the EEC (forgiving and distributor of electric energy), which the State is partly available and will have the transport fund.
The question is that the amount of divisions is never certain and in any case there is a weak.
Last year, these are 18 billion who have been shipped from the EEC to the budget.
Every year the divisions serve to pay the removal of ecological disappearances, to complement the pension accounts or still serve for the refund refund reform that is prepared.
Furthermore, this actor increases the real deficit of the higher budget of 5,7 per cent of the GNB in accordance with the EU rules.
And it's far from being the end of the transfer carnaval.
The budget for various damages to the victims of communities and crimes, even the housing speeds, reduced almost three billions.
It is not sure that the State could act without that money.
It's a lotery.
If we lose an international proceedings, we will have to pay it, find Janota.
The Minister will then evolve the department, or, in the worse cases, to touch the Government ' s budget reservation.
There is also an absence of hundred million in the State fall project of a value of two billion, which must be able to follow on online which are the costs of each administration.
The first stage will begin in Janvier.
If the Minister of Finances were not yet found, the project should be stopped and sanctions would be placed, Janota noticed.
Your next smartphone will maintain two operating systems
In the future, the United States consider a portable phone that will allow user to pass from a operating system to another by pressing one button.
Projects that have been revealed appear as promises.
It's enough of a button and you pass from Windows Mobile to Android in a few seconds.
This is precisely the goal of the VMware American society, which is mainly concerned in the development of virtualization software for computers.
We will allow you to manage two user profiles at the same time on your port phone.
You can change among them, you can distinguish them in staff and professional
The two will work at the same time, said Mr.inivas Krishnamurti of the VMware society in an interview for the computer magazineworld.
He was presented in November last year and has been made a first demonstration ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones does not take any effect from the fiction.
VMware has already reported a test version to journalists, a smartphone equipped with two operating systems.
This is a Nokia N800 modified with a 128 MB RAM memory, which had simultaneously implemented the Windows Mobile and Android systems mentioned.
The development of new technologies for mobile phones is fully expensive.
VMware company currently collaborates with European and American operators in providing the virtualization of smartphones, and customers should have access to current 2012 devices.
The dream in the mountain snow snows hotels
Desolation tracks can only be difficult to the operators of disappearance.
The lack of snow dissuases people to reserve their ski stays in hotels and pensions.
In fact, it is always possible to disappear rooms for all hiver dates, including Christ and New Year.
We have a lot of visits on our site.
International offers, request prices, but they do not encourage to reserve for the present time.
And if they call us, they just ask if there will be the snow or the bottle in Noël," said Martin Jandura, operating the information port.Info.
If you want to pass the New Year from his dreams to XXXpindlerv Mlhow, it is better that it should not be retained to reserve.
If the economics are given priority and the quality of the accommodation is only going to pass, then we can try to wait for more days.
The hotels of Špindler are currently proposing only one week stays for the Nouvel An.
I think they're going to try even a moment to place them, but they're going to find them and will accept shorter periods.
And then the number of free rooms will quickly diminish," said Jandura.
The Vrchlabí Tourism Agency also proposes free bed for all hiver periods.
On the week of Christmas is the most interesting of us for the time, it is not completely sold.
It remains still free, say, half of the rooms in our offer.
That's why we have already prepared a few stays from Christmas last minute," said the director of Ingtours Peter Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi Agency can also propose the New Year in Krkonoše, but there are less free places.
In the first fourteen days of February, the remaining hivernal stays are also sold averagely.
This year, the interest for hiver stays has been negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in Kkonoše.
People are waiting for it to fall.
Nobody wants to go through the hill to the mountain without snow.
If the tracks are revealed during the week, Christ will also be complete," said Sheefert.
Inverse, the busy of the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Snćkou is lightly higher than last year.
We have an improvement of at least 5 percent.
We have a few latest places for the New Year as for Christmas.
There is a great interest in the holidays of Janvier of Polands and Febber also sold," report Karel Rada, Chief of Pec's best Hotel.
The Omnia hotel near the central parking of Jánské Láznć is also 18 percent during the New Year period.
Nevertheless, half of the beds remain empty in Christ in the most recent hotel of Jánské Lazní.
This year, we were welcomely surprised by the month of Janvier, where we have already been sixty percent of occupation at the present time.
Février is a little lower for the moment, but since the snow will fall, the interest for stays in the Krkonoše will still grow, certainly, indicated the Omnia Hotel director, Erik Sporysch.
However, the hostiles of the Kkeronoše must not hope more snow.
Thursday he will make more fresh and if there are breakfasts, they should be nervous on the mountain.
But afterwards the time should be resolved, report Jićí Jakubský of the Hradec station of the Tschech hydromeoreological Institute.
United States: Recurrence is wisdom mother
It is even comic, the challenge assembled with which Barack Obama, the President of the wise reputation, reproducted the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, which he considered himself as a simple.
When he ended to translate his doctrine if he was warmly waiting, he warned that he had collected it to the carbon paper since the Irish scenario of Bush three years ago.
Not content to use in the text even many times the expression "comm in Iraq" does not have any heavyness, which is, to use the title of Bush of Janvier 2007 as a title of his own talking: "And a new way forward"
At the same time, he personally criticised the idea of Bush to send new strengthens to an Iraq consumed by civil war as "related and catastrophic decision in its consequences."
Nevertheless, the following months showed that Bush ' s strategie, which was implementing campaign Commander ' s recommendations, was the only possible and potential to success at this point that the new newspapers are not talking about all Iraq.
This has not improved Bush's reputation, it said, objectively speaking, he left his successor a better favourable situation than we couldn't hope.
Barack Obama hopes that the miracle will play again
These are the commanders of campaigns who requested an increase in the military contingent, including the commander of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who has even seriously criticised the responsibilities of the White House, despite subordination conditions.
He requested 40,000 men to make the situation more favourable.
The Chairman has been held for three months but at least a better option, at least has exposed the general of 10,000 soldiers.
It has been successful to extract the promise of 5 000 additionals from the part of Europe, even if it was about 10,000 in the origin.
The most challenges in the whole Obama strategy appears to be its intention to remove the armeds from Afghan from 18 months and to end all this process of these three years. All Obama's doctrine provides more questions than it provides answers.
Many doubtful that an increase in half will lead the same fruits as the progress in Iraq.
Despite brotherly wars in the past years, Iraq's society is relatively well organized and its leaders honor the agreements.
The Afghan situation is launched by the opposite exact - can't be accounted on person and no treaty is respected.
In these circumstances, it is difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, used to change directing to the day in accordance with them.
Political institutions, although officially funded, will not only have the dust behind which the patriarch relations will proliferate.
It is unlikely complex to balance the interests of the various ethnic groups, taking into account the lack of clarity for reports, which are still combined by Pakistan and Iranian influences.
Even the foundation of a "satisfactory state to act", which is the basis goal of the operation, seems not very real.
The timely horizontal of the Obama Strategy makes its voluntary voluntary.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only made it and is currently on the side of the chaos.
Only a purely romantic heart and outside the reality can be convinced that the small soldiers sent in the tumult of the war for their "prompt return to the house" will bring a true miracle there.
From a political point of view, defining a date for the retirement of the troops is purely unrepensible because the Taliban will consider it as an indirect fall of the American debt.
The last Summit of the OTAN showed that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan was negative.
European policies do not know nor want to explain their elections in which security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the Hindu Kush mountains.
Another factor capable of enhance the situation is the evolution of Iran's events.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and strengthened sanctions had no effect on Iran, the Americans will find a very difficult issue of a problem resolution through the use of military force.
For example, the time that, according to Obama, America will come to the victory retreat of Afghanistan's troops.
However, every solution of this type will lead to a dramatic return of the Afghan situation.
The only quiet for Obama is the fact that he remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore it is still enough time to plan a new strategy, where it would be a total fiasco.
Goldman Sachs bank leaders will no longer receive prices in liquid money
High leading employees from the American Bank Goldman Sachs will not receive this year of premiums in species.
The company has announced it to react to strong criticisms in relation to its salarial practices.
The group of 30 key leaders will receive actions instead of money, which they cannot return before five years.
Actions may be removed to leaders in the case they would take too much risk.
According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is so put in head of the effort to reduce payments with long-term performances in Wall Street.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the global sense that it is necessary to take, has indicated the old Douglas Elliott of the company JPMorgan.
The matter is available in details, added it.
The Goldman Sachs bank has become the target of critics after being set at almost 17 billion dollars for primes on the first three quarters of this year.
For this year, the total amount of premiums will probably exceed $20 billion, depending on the announced measure today, according to the Reuters Agent.
With the arrival of the financial crisis, the strong premiums in the bank sector have become a significant political subject in many countries.
Great Britain announced on Friday that it was counting to affect an unique tax of 50 per cent of banking bonuss over 25.000 books.
France prepares similar measures.
This year women have obtained Nobel prices in all the horrest areas of physics
These are five women, a record number, who today received Stockholm from the hands of the king of Sweden Charles XVI Gustave the Nobel prices in technical disciplines and literature.
Besides the four scientists, there was also the German writer of Roman Herta Müller.
Two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider received with their compound Jack Szostak the Nobel medicine price for their research in chromosomes.
The chemical price was decreased to the Israeli Ada Jonath with the Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Staitz in order to explain the structure and function of ribosoms
The last laureated has received the Nobel price of economy, America Elinor Ostrom with its partner Oliver Williamson, for their analysis of economic governance.
The only technical discipline that had not been wandered this year was physics.
This price has been delivered to the scientists of Charles Kao for his research in the field of the optical fibres and George Smith with Willard Boyle for their introduction of CCD pumps, which are currently based on all digital, fax or astronomic devices.
Each laureate has received the diploma, the Nobel medal and the acquisition certificate of the criminal reward.
This has reached 10 million Swedish krones in each category. (approximately 1.1 million euros)
If one of them contains several laureates, they will share the reward between them.
The very expected peace price Nobel price has already been delivered to Oslo afternoon in Norway to President Barack Obama.
In his words, he recognized the controversial nature of his reward because it is only at the beginning of his movement and that he is also the head of a country undertaken in two wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In the removal of his policy, he added that war in some situations is essential to obtain peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota intends to deliver. Klaus invited him to the Câteau
President Václav Klaus will receive the Minister of Finance Eduard Janota on Tuesday, which shall submit his stay to the Government of the fact of its disagreement with the State budget for the next year as he was voted by the Chamber of Deputys
It is considered that the budget and may also be the position of Janota at the cabinet will be on the agenda of their performance on Friday.
Claus is also critical to the budget.
According to him, deficit is too important, which increases the crisis of public finances.
It's the presidential Port of Radim Ochvat who informed the meeting.
Janota then wants to discuss his job on Monday with the Prime Minister Jan Fischer.
According to the budget legislation that will be submitted to the signing of Klaus, 163 billion kitchens are a deficit that the Czech Republic should manage.
Nevertheless, the Deputy Chamber has validated the proposals on the left of the money transfer and has increased the reimbursement of officials, social services and direct rewards to farmers.
The Government responded to the proposals of democratic socials that they would improving indirectly the deficit of the budget.
For this reason, a violent disagreement was born between the left of one side, the Government, Claus and the right of the other, which reiterates the future of the fisher cabinet which was formed by agreement between the ODS, the SSD and the Green Party.
Criticals claim that the budget, as it has been voted by the deputy Members, was removed the package of economic measures passed by the fisher Government and which, according to him, must deal with the endeavorment of the State.
Klaus, who can ratify the State budget, but that nothing is obliged, has stated today in a small deal of discussions with undertakings, that policies have recently rejected the "release" of the "referred" deficiency of public finances.
There is now no favourable solution, according to him.
Only a strong government could make an improvement, if it could help a consensus of the broader political parties, according to the President.
The President of the ODS Mirek Topolanek indicated that the budget is running and that the Government should reiterate its future existence.
The Vice-President of the ODS Petr Nečas stated that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the SSD, the ODS and the Verts were not obvious.
In his reaction, the Prime Minister Fischer qualified such words of drastic "verdicts".
The Chief of the 周SSD Jií Paroubek replied to Topolanek, saying that the deficit of the budget prepared for this year by the former Government of Topolanek is running and that it will be over 200 billion krones.
Friday already, the SSD has successfully qualified the ratification of the State budget for the next year.
The People ' s Party was also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman will play Mandela in the new Clint Eastwood movie
Despite critical of the fact that the main roles are played by American actors, South Africans claim that the new Hollywood Invictus film - Invaincu will express many things on the country, its fights and its victories.
The story speaks of sports, relations between races and Nelson Mandela.
Morgan Freeman, American actor rewarded to Oscars, puts the film on the life of Nelson Mandela, inadequate fighting the racist system of the apartheid in South Africa and the first Black President.
Freeman said that it's a nine-ninth-year Mandela who asked him to incarate him in the film.
Matt Damon plays another important role.
I said to her, "If I have to bear you, I'd have to see you personally.
The actor of sixty-third years who was rewarded by a price for his role in the drame Milion Dollar Baby of Clint Eastwood located in the middle of the box has, for example, incarnated leader of a leader of a movement against the slavery to become slave himself, a president of the United States, even God in the Evan All-Puant film but never one of the living encounters and exempts for people as the is Mandela.
The former South African State has been deprived 27 years for its work in favour of the end of apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became the President of the country for four years.
In 1993, the Nobel Price of Peace was decreased.
Invictus is a Latin word meaning invaincu and is the title of a pome of the English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film tells the real story of the joint efforts of Nelson Mandela and the Captain of the South African rugby team in order to unite the country. The President Mandela newly elected that his country remains back and always divided racially and economicly after the apartance.
It is convinced to join his people through the sport and decides to join rugby players who are among the outsiders at the world level.
South African team will end progress in World Coupe in 1995.
Freeman worked a few years to bring Mandela's history on a large screen.
I had no other purpose but to play this role in order to reapprove the most reality, said Freeman.
The greatest challenge for me was sure to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the international political man were in the same region, he would try to meet Mandela, to dinner with him, to be cut before his speakers.
The most important for him was wearing his hand.
I realized that when I blow your hand, I get your energy, she was translated and I had the impression of knowing how you feel, said he.
It's important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays in François Pieiner film, Captain of a national rugby team in which there is a majority of white players.
The actor stated that he had six months to prepare a role in the hard environment of rugby.
For him, his first meeting with Pieiner in his house was a great surprise.
I remember when I sounded at the door of the house, he opened me and the first thing I said to Francois Pieiner was: "I look much greater in the film."
Despite the differences between actors and real models, Invictus has received positive opinions and the Oscars are also spoken of ambitions.
The film critique Todd McCarthy of Daily Variety resumed his appreciation in these words: "It's a very good story, a very good movie."
In film assessments on the rotentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive appreciations.
The mystery of the iron in Norway is decided: Russians tested a fuss
It was possible to observe an unrecognised light phenomenon that was not known above Norway.
The Ministry of Russian Defence has only tested a intercontinental balistic fusion that is not far from the Norway borders.
However, the lancement was still an echo and the type "Bulava", which had to be the privilege of the Russian Army becomes progressively caucheming Russian generals and the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
His presence repeated during the fusion tests did not have the effect expressed on the success of the test flights.
Most of the time, whether Bulava has not been flood, or she has been shot in full.
Russian journals speak of "Bulava" like "missel who don't want"
A missile that don't want but he's lighting
The 13th test was normally deployed.
It's only at the end of the flight there were disappearings on the apartment.
This is apparently the engine of the third eras of the fusion which has explosed.
This time, "Bulava" was undertaken by the nuclear submarine Dmitri Donskij, which was on the surface of the Blanche Sea.
This type of missile may be just ashesed in fire of a moved and smooth embarchment
This is why the mystery light above the Norway caused by a non-identified flood object has actually been defected by a "Blava".
On the other hand, the Norwegians didn't know that it was a Russian fussy.
The generals argue that this time, we can't absolutely speak of echo.
The first two stars of the fuel resistant and the abortion touched only the third.
In previous cases, motors have known deficiencies in the first age.
Even though there was no test lancements without accrue, the direction of the Ministry of Defence believes that only six on thirteen were exchanges.
This rate of success of almost 50 percent is therefore imposed by optimism generals, and therefore they still say that a Bolava will want without problems and that it will even bring 10 hypersic nuclear noyals from a total weight of 1.15 tonnes.
Legendary Ftissov signed an annual contract with the CSKA Moscow
The Legislative Defender Viatcheslav Ftissov will again be presented in a professional match of 51 years.
The ancient world campaign, olympic and detentor of the Stanley Cup will be able to deliver his CSKA Moscow team in the need and will likely enter his entrance at the vendredi game against Petergrad.
Féssov, which ended at its quarantine years in 1998, is the president of the CSKA for hour.
After Denis Kuliash, we need urgently another defender.
Féssov is regularly involved and agreed to help the team.
We still need to make some details on the form, states the coach of the Sergey Nyemtchinov club, which is in AP agency.
It has not been specified if the table of the hockey Legendary player will be only one match.
I think Ftissov is one of those who are able to strengthen the mental of other players, said Nyemtchinov.
According to AP, in the case of his return on the glass, Ftissov is so the Russian professional player of hockey the most oldest.
In NHL, the legendary attacked Gordie Howe has played an entire range for Hartford and has obtained 15 goals and 26 assistance.
The most aged famine Fitissov, Kassatonv - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best busy players and among those with the most successful.
Under the colors of the Soviet Union, he decreased the gold to Olympics, seven world campaign songs, he triumphed the Canada Cup and the June World Championship.
In the second part of his card, he also collected the damage in NHL where he held the Stanley Cup twice.
He is a member since 2001 of the Hookkey's Hookkey Time.
Hyundai heard the syndicats and canceled all additional hours
The direction of the Hyundai use of Nošovice agreed with the syndicates to cancel all additional hours.
It is exactly because of the frequent additional hours that the syndicats have declared a state of emergency wheel on Monday.
Petr Vanцk's use of Hyundai confirmed it.
However, the direction wants to be agreed with the syndicates on a Saturday working this year yet.
We can't reject our production plan, it is essential for this reason that additional voluntary hours have been proposed on Saturday, 19 December, knowing that there would be two teams, Vanak said.
The Site Sedmička.cz indicated that the company proposed a 400 cheque knowns to workers who were part of the Saturday team.
It will also be admitted for the day working on 28 November.
The company, according to Vanak, decided to change how to motivate its employees in exchange of additional hours.
If they receive the Supplement for more hours, or they may have a removal of replacement on 28 December and thus extend their end of year's festival at Vanaq.
Furthermore, all employees present on Saturday will receive compensation for transport costs and summer.
In view of the fact that the additional hours were the most urgent and warmest point in the comments and re-additions of unions such as employees who spontanly stopped production last week, the direction took the immediate decision to cancel all additional hours for December of the month.
By last week, the vehicle employees were forced to work nearly more two hours in more than eight hours.
The syndicats account to cancel the state of green after the signing of the Agreement.
The following negotiation between the direction of the car and the syndicats must have been held on Friday after midday.
The syndical leader Petr Kucha had said in mercy that they were ready to stop the state of grass in case of agreement on their refunds and signature of a common document.
The situation in the uses has culminated last Friday when nearly 400 employees have been spontanly led to a result of more inadequate hours.
They also protested against the bad wages and disappearance conditions.
The direction has been defended by the fact that employees had to be added to complement vehicle production impairs.
During the announcement of the lunchday, the syndicates also asked that the employees who stopped the production would not be subject to any sanctions.
Independents request the company to reduce the past time in additional hours to minimum.
Furthermore, they want a remuneration of 5 000 krones (209 €) for those.
The Hyundai car use of Nošovice now operates 2.000 people.
It will start the production in series in November last year.
It has produced approximately 800,000 vehicles until September this year, with a production capacity of 200,000 cars per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that functions on HIV viruss as well
A team of Czech scientists and Germans test new combinations that can accelerate the proliferation of HIV virus in the body.
The main benefit of the improved substance is that it also affects viruses that have already developed immunity for medicines.
In some cases, the fact that combination is not so intense on the current virus variations as well as some medicines already available.
It is not possible to heal AIDS at present time.
However, the life of diseases can be extended radically by a mixture of medicines that prevent the multiplication of HIV virus in the body.
However, their consumption is a series of secondary effects.
Furthermore, the repression of this multiplication has the development of resistant viruss on which medicines do not have any effect.
The work of experts of three institutions, the Czech Republic's Academy, the VãCHT of Prague and the Heidelberg University opens the way to face virus resistance.
They have shown that metalocarburian substances have acted on the protein responsible for the multiplication of HIV virus.
Metalcarburians are an assumption of bush, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
This combination blocks the development of virus in a different way of all medicines employed to now and therefore could surround the problem of resistance.
The work of researchers leads them to discover new "améliorated" substances on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanical of their connections on virus proteins.
Metalcarburians have a unique threedimensional structure: two rows to multiple parois are formed by bour, hydrogen and carbon atoms and associated with metallic atom, in this case the cobalt.
A translator and resistant virus.
HIV protection is a protein of HIV virus that is essential for the virus life cycle.
Without the division of HIV virus caused by HIV protection, there would be no infective infection of virus mortals.
If the HIV protection is stopped, the virus propagation will also be stopped in the patient’s body, investigators in a press communication published by the Czech Republic’s Organic Chemical and Biochemic Institute of Academy.
In their work published in the scientific magazine Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pieces of cages (cf. table) are linked by a court of organic chain, which is then systematicly modified.
A little lower but more reliable.
The effectiveness of this series of HIV proteins has been tested in tests as well as on its resistant variants, obtained by HIV patients.
On the current version of enzyme, the effect of metalocarburians is not as strong as on clinical medicines, but it does not fail to resistant versions against which current medicines are often ineffective.
Metalcarburians, with their unique action mechanism and other properties such as the biological and chemical stability, their low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are therefore interesting combinations to address more to the development of effective medicines against HIV, said Pavlina ◆ezáčová, Directorate of the Structural Biology Laboratory of Organic and Biochem Chemical Institution and the Academy of Molecular Science Genética.
Deputy around the budget. The ODS takes it to fisher, who defends himself
The President of the ODS (Democratic Democratic Party), Mirek Topolanek qualified the budget ratified for the next year and according to him, the Government of the First Minister Jan Fischer should recognize its existence.
The Prime Minister has qualified the proposals of the Drug Dictator ODS.
He says he takes time to analyze.
The ODS Petr Nečas' port stated that the idea of an administrative cabinet supported by the RESSSD, the ODS and the Green Party would not eventually work.
According to Nečas, the Chief of the Government should decide whether it is a member of the Deputy Chamber to support minority concerning the fight against the growing deficit, or whether it is concerned to remain in its functions with the help of the parliamentary left.
Neč noted that the ODS and democratic social positions relating to the problem of public deficits are diametricly opposed.
The Deputy Chamber has ratified the budget for 2010, however, with the proposals to be amended by the left of 12 billion corners.
The Chamber has increased the money for the salary of officials, the functioning of social services and the direct rewards to farmers.
The grief of the Government against Democratic Social proposals was the fact that they increased indirectly the deficit of the budget.
The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion kitchens.
The ODS left the room before the vote, listening to the Government's wishes as a modified budget is less bad than an integrated budget.
Determination and usefulness
The Minister of Finance Eduard Janota spoke of deception and feelings of continuity, Minister Jan Fischer said that the Government will still reflect the current situation.
Neč is convinced that if Janota had been in the case of ratification of amendments proposals, the situation could be different.
According to the Czech Television, Janota took you on Monday with the first Minister after his transition to the government:
He indicated that he asked if he would stay in his functions.
It is the reason for the negotiations on the budget.
If fisher decides to continue to fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the representatives of the SSD, who have put on the budget changes, have not been placed in the Government.
The First Minister should also state clearly that it will delay if the Chamber raises the other laws that increase the deficit, for example, those affecting disease insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Service Act.
Topolanek: Ministers named by the ODS are not caused.
This is the case of the Chief of the Fish Government and the whole Government.
The Ministers named by the ODS did nothing prejudice, signed Topolanek in a textual communication from the United States.
He recalled that the Vice-Ministers of certain departments were claimed by TOP 09, which had voted against the budget.
Neča emphasized that if the fisher decides to give its demission to the fact that fighting the deficit of the public finance, " it is in fact logical and correct that it is based on the left majority currently in the Chamber " .
This said, it should not be expected to support and tolerance of democracy.
I have not thought and once it will be on the agenda, then I will sanctify it from the Chamber to the journalists, the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, just elected by the Democratics.
The first Minister Fisher took place on the afternoon for a debate of the European Council in Brussels.
The ODS went back to the request of the first Minister.
Neča emphasized in the same time that the ODS would likely vote against the modified budget if it had not expressly requested the Democratic Democratics to allow the vote of the budget.
We do not have the feeling of being orphans, are we not little children, responding to the question whether the ODS had not undertaken the reproachs from the Chamber of the Party to the Chamber or the country in the negotiation of the budget.
I noticed that my vote would have done a standard.
I already knew when I refused my mandate that what would follow in the following months would be a bottlement of the Chamber and a destruction of all that was positive, Topolanek replied in a person.

The history of South Africa concerns all, according to Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
The new hollywood film from Clint Eastwood comes in the next days, the title is Invictus (the official title of the Czech is Invictus: Neporaćený), and tells a part of the life of the former South African President Nelson Mandela.
The role of the fight against the worldly known apartment has returned to Morgan Freeman, which has been chosen by Mandela himself for the incarning.
The second male role of South African Legislative campaign was granted to Matt Damon.
With the arrival of the film in rooms, criticians and public returns are hearing.
Nelson Mandela
His full name Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in Mveu in South Africa.
In 1988, the Sakharov Price received for his freedom of mind, then received the Nobel peace price on the sides of Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
The film contains great hopes because it is presented at a time when South Africa is fully prepared for the crack of football world, and otherwise because the media are concerned with new concerns about increased racial conflicts and discrimination by the majority of the black power.
According to AP Agenty, reactions in the new film are at the highest positive time in South Africa, despite the frequencies of reservations issued to the main roles where "pagan" of hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is, however, taking his own terms, fiery of the film.
I revived this role for many years, and I was well prepared.
I've also met in personally Nelson Mandela for power - as we say - get from his energy, did he indicate at the first official film in Los Angeles?
I think it's a good thing if you have the opportunity to remember the film the personality and the message of Mandela.
This is the story of the Republic of South Africa, but it is about each person he has awaited.
Port the rugby National rugby Team
The film based on the history of the Roman of the British writer John Carlin was the title being freely translated. In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the piece that gave its creation to the people unless the South African Defender of Human Rights during his mandate.
Morgan Freeman therefore tried during the film to collect two racial groups of a long-divised population, and also, as Nelson Mandela was in 1995, the national maillot of the South African team on the pelous of the world's cup, which the South African was then brought.
In order to be shown on postlot pelouse, which was considered in South Africa as something holy, Mandela had been long-grouped fourteen years ago, mainly white public and was recognized by white populations.
Let's hope that the football campaign will succeed to join people again in one nation, has indicated the rugby Chester Williams player, who was the only "near" of the national team in 1995.
It remains to see whether the South African situation will improve.
However, South African white are sweet as recently confidenced it in an entrepreneur for LN Christopher Dawson, a rugby fan who fled to the Great Britain.

According to Lukáš Marvan, there are six units operating on the fire.
They were designed to allow the transformer to consume himself, but they revealed their opinion and learned the fuel with a mixture of water, mousse and special substance.
The cause is a technical standard, a internal short-certain of the transformer.

Jančura will be complained for diffamation against the three prefixes of the SSD
Radim Jančura, owner of Student Agency, will today be deemed to spread to three social prejudices.
And concretely against Michal Hašek of the South Moravie region, against Radko Martínka of the Pardubice region and against the prefect of the Olomouk Martin Tesaík region.
Jančura indicated it in the Dvacet minute of Radioiornali.
The complaint is related to the attempt of the company to explose regional iron paths in certain regions.
However, all regions have ended by signing long-term contracts with the Czech Chemins.
All three attacked us and stated that the ends of the mouth are done, while it was only offered for what they wanted to themselves.
They claim that we are more sweet than the Tschech Chemins that are not true because we know the prices of the Tschech Chemin Chemins which have been signed last week.
So there's no longer than we're defended.
It's on the exchange of calomnies on the Student Agency, said Jančura to Radioãurnali.
He also indicated that no region has undertaken in agreement with the European law.
We will prepare for this a complaint for the European Commission.
Hašek believes that the complaint of complaints by Mr. Jančura represents the follow-up of his median spectrum which serves free publicity for his society and his person.
I am of course ready to defend my name and name of my region and I call the other prophecies to do the same.
I think this will be the opportunity to clearly show that it is just Mr Jančura who manipulates the public opinion and reiterates false and mental arguments concerning regional ferroviary transports, Hašek says
Jančura has already been informed last week that he will invest a few millions of krones in a publicity that will mention the unfavorable developments of the regions.
He stated to Radioãurnali that he would stop the campaign after Christ and account it to take it after the New Year.
He stated that the campaign would see corruption in wide meaning.
Jančura understood its campaign after the regions agreed to confid the Chemical Railway Chemins for a command of approximately 150 billion corrones, without an appeal of offers.
According to Jančura, such a way is illegal and contrary to the position of the European Court of Justice.
According to him, his critics of rail transport in the regions have even brought to Jančura threats from a Deputy of the SSD.
The only threat was that if not stop, our bus licences could be lost.
It was presented as Deputy of the EEESSD, I don't know what it is, but I will not say his name, said Jančura today at Radio
Impact vaccination against pneumocoques will be free and capable
The vaccination against pneumatics will reduce the old customs from Janvier.
It will be the first to be free and at the same time facultative for families.
The voices already arise, saying that a binding vaccination would be more effective.
The preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against culminants.
The pharmaceutical Institute has already defined the maximum prices to pay disease insurance.
The specialists also see clear in the vaccination process.
A new vaccination.
Free vaccines for the children of August.
Since Janvier, children born last year from 2 August may be vaccined freely against pneumocoques.
The condition is that they have not been vaccined yet.
If the vaccination has started last or early year, the following vaccination should be paid itself.
The first vaccine dose should be administered between the third and the fifth month of the child.
Last year, a quarter of families has voluntaryly vaccined her children against pneumocoques.
Nevertheless, parents payed 1600 krones more for a dose.
Youth vaccination requires four doses.
The experts say that disease insurances are of 300 to 450 000 krones in vaccine doses each year.
However, they are economic about medical care that non- vaccined children needed.
To date, the State was estimated approximately 500 000 krones per year for all the vaccination of children.
Rebursed vaccination was introduced with the "Janota Package".
Pneumocoques are the cause of inflammations of the average ear but also serious infections with mining inflammations and blood implantation.
According to hospital surveys, up to 28 dies of children of less than 10 years caused by pneumocoque infections.
Tschech Republic, approximately 40 other countries have introduced vaccination.
Is the vaccination obligation?
There are advice on a present vaccination obligation for the future.
From Janvier, it must be regulated by the insurance and capacity.
For example, the President of the Association Nalas Rudolf Kalovský indicated that a binding vaccination would be more positive.
Its association has longly promised vaccination against pneumocoques.
At a international conference to which our association has participated, specialists have not really satisfied that we have a facultate vaccination.
That's not ideal.
On the other side, we are happy to impose at least that.
I think it is a direction to follow Calovský said.
But the Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination process against pneumatics.
We are not absolutely considering it for the time, said his Port-in-law Vlastimil Mršeć.
The facultative vaccination has its unconvenencies, claim doctors.
Hana Cabrnochová, Chairman of the Specialization Society, recognizes that a vaccination based on the volunteership is based.
If all children were vaccined, it could be considered a reduction of vaccination renewments "To the situation where the vaccine costs such a sum I understand the decision making the vaccination facultative" said Cabrnochová.
The specialists suggest that, since the next year, more than 80 percent of the new parents will be able to vaccine their foods.
The vaccination against pneumatics also marks a rupture of the fact that it is the first vaccination of children which is financed by insurances and not the State.
Cabrnochova explains that insurances should release funds for prevention, and that would have been operated on future medical care.
Doctors should buy their products themselves
However, this is related to practical penitentiaries, relating to the purchase of vaccines.
The original intention was to buy vaccines by insurance, doctors receive them as other vaccine products provided by the State.
However, some deputates feared that this would allow the insurances to "decrease the amounts of disease insurance".
Thus, the doctors must buy the products and wait for the insurances to pay them.
According to estimates, the pants will individually invest approximately 40 000 krones per month in vaccine, which is an important sum.
It's going to be easy, according to Cabrnochov.

The son of Frank Fractta, acknowledged example, was defended to flight tables for $20 million (12 million GBP) in the museum of his father.
In Pennsylvania, the police stated that Alfononso Frank Frazetta was interpelled while he loaded 90 tables in his vehicle and in a remorque.

The Labour defends the increase in budget tax.
Ministers have defended the increase in tax and the reduction of expenditures provided in the pre-budget report, despite the criticals of opposition, enterprises and unions.
The Tories stated that Alistair Darling "ha lacked" an opportunity to show that it was serious about the reduction of the deficit by reporting its decisions to the elections.
The Chancelier has also turned the flowers with the lower salary and average salary.
Among its main proposals, an increase in 0.5% of the Social Assurance and a $% fund rate for public salary from 2011.
The anger of the Social Assurance
The syndicats protested that lower salary is punished by a recession which they were not responsible and noticed that the "problems" was announced.
The reduction of social insurance, which will allow about 3 billion GBP per year - has put the world in anger, because it is a tax on employment while the objective should be a relationship of the economy.
The increase, reserved to those who gain more than 20,000 GBP per year, will touch approximately 10 million workers.
PRINCIPAUX OF THE PRINCIPUTION OF THE PRE-BUDGET
Social insurance will still increase from 0.5% from April 2011
Economy will reduce more than the 4,75% waiting for this year
New 50% tax on banking bonus
The increase in tax benefits of the society for small companies has been left
Electricity and Eolian taxes
Increased pensions of 2.5%
According to Trésor's estimations, a person wins 30,000 GBP will lose 90 GBP per year and a person wins 40,000 GBP in perishing 190 GBP, while a person gaining 100,000 GBP in an increase of 110 GBP.
The Ministers stated that their objective to reduce the deficit before 2013 was "fair decisions" but stressed that 60% of the wage of additional taxes would be less than 5 per cent of employees.
Stephen Timms, the Secretary to the Treasury, revitaled a tax increase and emphasized that a reduction of expenditure was a "water in the ocean" compared with what was necessary.
"These figures are important. They will allow us to divide both the deficit, what will be absolutely essential during the next four years," said the BBC.
Mr. Timms said he was confidence and the growth of the economy would restart in the end of the year.
However, the provisions of the Labour on Economic Growth - which will affect the amount it will be imposed and the speed to which the deficit will be combined - have been unfortunately established after the Chancelier was obligation to revise its first numbers.
In its allocation, he stated that the economy would probably lower than 4,75% this year - much worse than the decline of 3,5% in April - while the immune would be more than 3 billion GDP for the pre-evaluation.
"opportunity missed"
The Conservators who will launch this Thursday a new publicity campaign against the Labour Debt crisis said that the project of immigration by 789 billion GBP during the next six years was not viable.
Ministers have not been able to present a credible plan on the way to reimburse, added, eligiting the difficult choices until following the elections - which must be held in June 2010.
"They didn't introduce any significant thing on what they were going to do", said Philip Hammond, headquarter of the Cabinet Treasury. "They had the opportunity to do it and they missed it."
" The important advertisements will be made after the elections, either the winner "
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
The Labour stressed that schools, hospitals and police will be protected by the following reductions, in contrast to the proposals of the Tory, which would lead to a faster and significant deficit.
But Lib Dems stated that money was recognized through the increase of taxes and the reduction of expenditure would be used to support the costs of the next year and not to reduce the deficit, supporting the plans were "buildinged by wind".
Nick Robinson, Political Director of the BBC, stated that the advertising calendar - such as an increase in inflation for certain invalidity benefits in April next, mentioned above- would leave the Chancelier's face to prostitution accuses, the money was just recovered in the next year.
However, the Labour stressed that additional aid is provided while people needed the most and that the situation will be revised in September 2010.
Budget
While the Ministers had not published the details of expenditures beyond 2011, economics stated that it was clear that the restrictions of public expenditure would start to feel only in medium terms.
The very respected Institute for Fiscal Researchs (Institute of Fiscale Experiences) stated that the numbers of the Chanceller in the future involve substantive reductions in many areas, including potentially transport, higher education, science and defence.
"The pain is just reported," said his Director, Robert Chote.
"The most important advertisements will be made after the elections, whatever the winner," added Roger Bootle, economic adviser at Deloitte accounts.
"This was a false pre-budget report.

The men were arrested in a raid house in Sarghoda in the East of Punjab, announced the American Ambassade in Pakistan, BBC.
The FBI said he was concerned to know if there were the same men who had been declared lost from their home in Virginia State last month.
The Ministry of External Affairs said that it was also seeking information on those persons.
Three of them are presented as a Pakistan Ascendance, one of Egyptian heritage and the other of Jemenite origin.

Amnesty condemns Iranian abuses
In the past twenty years, human rights were so little respected as never, in accordance with the Amnesty International Association report.
The report presents the "recurrences of violations" by the regime before and after the Chairman elections of June.
A man stipulated in the report claimed that he had been shot and burned with cigarettes. Another said that he had been missed by violence.
Iran rejected previous criticisms concerning its non- human rights respect.
The authorities stated that such criticals were politically motivated.
Millenniums of people were arrested and thirty were killed in Iran, after the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had conducted the greatest public manifestations since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Decades were condemned against prison penalties and the prosecutors claim that at least five persons have been condemned.
Jon Leyne, corresponding to the BBC in Teheran now, stated that at the beginning of the protests, the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei recognized some of the abuse allegations, ordering the closement of the Kahrizak detention centre.
But since this time, the authorities have not taken any critics, said our corresponding.
"Fusse confession"
Amnesty International reported the case of a teacher of 26-year-old, Ebrahim Mehtari, who has been accused of 'Travail with Facebook networks' and has protested against the results of the election.
"They have often shot me on the face," he was town.
"I was burned with cigarettes, in the eyes, on the knee, on the head, they missed me to execute and humbled me."
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left into the street, always in blood and half awareness, said Amnesty.
In August, the candidate, losing elections, Mehdi Karroubi, stated that demonstrators held after the election were punished to death in prison and others were punished.
Iranian authorities refused the accused of violence, but they admitted that abuse had been done.
Amnesty also focused on the case of an old detentioner who said had been sick in a container with 75 other persons for more than eight weeks, in a center of detention in Kahrizak.
Amnesty agreed that the Iranian Parliament and the judicial equipment create a committee to investigate post-election difficulties and the Government's response, but she stated that the mandate and powers of those organizations were not clear and that the results of the Parliamentary Committee had not been publicized.
The Group said that at least 90 persons had been arrested in the past three weeks in order to prevent other manifestations.

They always and we
Islam may be French?
Multialism and pragmatics in a Latin State.
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Some readers will be addressed by this new book, wondering the last work of the author, "Why the French does not love foulard" (2006), an eligible and well documented study on a problem that has divised and worried the country since a 15-year-old years and whose effects are still reacting today.
The last book of Mr Bowen presents a greater and more ambitious track.
Good anthropologue, he is not just wanting to know what politicians and media say about Islam in France, but what happens today in the country.
Over a few months in the muscles, schools and institutions that are now providing in France what M. Bozen calls "musulman spaces" for 5m-6m of musulmans.
He is very well aware of listening and reproducing discussions between teachers and teachers on the matters concerned with them.
Should a musulman marry in a muscle or magie (or both)?
The evolution and homosexual rights should they be teached to young musulmans?
Can a musulman marriage a non-musulman?
Can a musulman use a banking system based on interests to get a ready?
These are practical problems, stated that, which are the most daily, rather than the political dramas concerned by media.
The author identifies a new generation of immuns, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown from the great public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, a Arab musulman born in Switzerland.
This new generation tries to open the debate on how to be a good musulman and a good citizen in modern Latin society.
They can't stop the debate until the end.
Conservators do not believe in the idea of a French or European islam.
Intelligents and actives who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are generally agreed with their lawyers of a cleaner islam Sunni associated with Saudi Arabia, who are a small part of the musulmans of Europe.
M Bowen believes that the values of the Muslims and the layout of the French could be compatible.
But a compromise can only be obtained with the efforts of each camp.
It is asked by the French politicians (and the gardenian intellectual election as virulent of the layout) are actually committed to the pluralism.
According to him, the Muslims have not been disappointed, compared with Catholics, Protestants and the Jews who also had to make historic compromises with the Latin Republic.
In addition to a growing pragmatic, he describes a "emerity of key values".
Islam may be French? After reading this book, we have been trying to say "Oh, but not yet."
The darkest view of the world
The Arctic changes faster and more dramatic than any other place on the planet.
The glass that composes it is to be founded at an alarming speed, which brings a life that cannot survive otherwise.
Petrole, gas, expéditions and fisheries are shipped in new open waters with diplomats, lawyers and now writings in their silling.
In "They are a mixture of glass", Richard Ellis, writer and illustration, a natural story of the Great Great Symbol, the Polar eye.
A well-known of the history and complex fisheries policy, he described the long tradition of experts of the Architek who made their evidence by closing white eye.
The meeting of the Amiral Nelson, then courageous attempt of 14 years who had not to fight that the point of his muscle is certainly a myth, but the rest is true.
The young weapons, captured while they were born by their mother, just killed, were attracted and sent into zoos and circles.
At the beginning of the twentieth century, a famous spectrum appeared 75 ours at the same time.
Even today, the dimensions of a zoo are usually a million of the surface required for adults. Climately indicated: our living polar in Singapour became green because of the aliges that were pushed in its swimming pool.

Mr. Ellis tells the stories of other stories and stories and is often regarding the threat that the slaughters represent the survival of species.
Although in Norway, America and Russia, murderers continue in Greenland and Canada, where helicopters and Indias in motoski are using powerful fuels to escape them.
Ironically, it's in the north of these two countries from the ransom that glass will remain longer.
In his new book, "Applace the glass", Alun Anderson, an old editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and fearful resume of the Arctic Science and a captive view of what might be the future here.

Marines, among 6,000 persons who put corners on tombs in Arlington
The first class De'Angello Robinson, 19 years, made a travel of seven hours in bus to put a simple coron on the tomb of a soldier he never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from Camp Johnson to Jacksonville, in North Caroline to the Cimetière Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the tombs, this day was dedicated to greeting men and women who, one day, were on their place.
In a few months, from where we will be sent, we're lying to their place, Robinson said about the fellow soldiers.
If it happened to me, I would like someone to do the same thing for me, that's why I'm just trying to show respect.
It was one of the 6,000 volunteers to be gathered on Saturday morning to put corrones on the tombs of the Veterians, in different sections of the Arlington Ceremony cemetery.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, in the Maine, decided to decorate several hundreds of tombs in the cemetery of Arlington Ceremony.
Now, to continue the tradition of 18 years, Morrill and his wife Karen, each year travel, stoping in different cities on their way, to organize memories in honor of military and terrorist victims.
Worcesters also found a non-satisfactory association, Wreaths Across America (Squaronnes through America), which has the aim to promote the event in all other States.
This year, the volunteers placed more than 16,000 krones on the tombs of the cemetery of Arlington, around the Pentagone, on the tombs of the Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, the Battery Park in New York City, and on the site of the Memarian for victims of the United Airlines in Shanksville, Pennsylvanie.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation Foundation foundation gave more than $150 000 to buy and transport the krones.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old from Westminster, said that she had been traveling to Arlington in the honor of her husband, a dead carrier military.
Although her husband wasn't buried in Arlington, Hunt said that for her, this man was a way to thank those who were sanctified.
It's a small man who can make civilians to support our troops, said she.
It's like to visit a family tomb.
Emitoused in a variety of warm clothing beds, volunteers were marketed between the skins and the streets of the cemetery.
Volunteers had chosen old tombs from the First and Second World War, and from the Vietnam War, since those are not so often visited as the new tombs, the organizations said.
The humor was on the optimism, while children played, and the couples were holding with the hand, taking the feet corners on the green tombs.
Each round corner had a green colour, with a small red snow box on the top.
Nearly, he planned the silence of Section 60, where most of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are inhumorable.
The United Nations Service has given 1 000 krones to decorate the section, but the sharp humor of current wars undertaken the area.
People weep without hiding, others prayed, and families and friends supported the cold air.
Some read the names fat in the stone while others thought to see the small black and white information cards, focused on the humble earth for those whose tomb had not yet been completed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers in dreams, on the tomb of his son.
She was part of Zanesfield, in the Oio and had eight hours to come together on the tomb of Marine GuneryDavid Shane Spicer, died in July.

A American citizen arrested by the Cuban authorities
The cuban Government arrested a American citizen who distributed mobile telephones and computers in the country, confirmed the services of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
The citizen, who has not yet been identified, is working for development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for customers such as U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
The Advisory authorities and the U.S. Interest Section at HUM try to have access to the detention arrested on 5 December.
The specific accused have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor may be arrested in pretext to be "dangerous".
All revolutionary activities, including moderate protests and critical writings, lead to the risk of arrest.
Anti-governmental graphics and discourses are considered as serious crimes.
Cuba has a greater blogger community, conducted by Yoani Sánchez, popular commentary that is often written on the way they are married and followed and harceled by government officials.
Sánchez has made several requests to leave the country to receive rewards, but it has always been rejected.
The detention of a American citizen may be able to increase the tensions between the Communist Government of the brothers in Cuba and the Administration of Obama, which continues a "double approach" to improve relations with the island.
The annotation of the resort was first reported by New York Times, Friday evening.
The new American policy calls for the Cuban Government on concrete steps, such as liberating political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, so that the United States could make it like.
Mobile phones and portfolio computers are authorised to Cuba, although it is for new and desired goods in a country or the average salary of a staff is $15 per month.
Only this year, the Cuban Government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones; they are mainly used for texts or for a 15-minute conversation.
On the island, the use of the Internet is extremely limited.
It is available in luxury hotels and for foreign visitors in the country, as well as in some inhabitants of the government, such as universities.
Cubans who want to connect are often to communicate their name to the Government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
The detention of a American in Cuba is rare.
Most American races in Cuba are behind the bars for crimes such as drug trafficking, Gloria Berbena, attached to pressure at the U.S. Interests Section in the HUND.
Berbena said she could not provide more information on the arrestation.
Arrestation and detention are a great mistake.
A activity that, in any other open society, would be authorised -- freely distributing mobile phones -- is a crime in Cuba, Jose Miguel Vivanco, programme Director of America of the Human Rights Watch Group, which recently published a serious report on freedoms in Cuba, called "Neuveau Castro, even Cuba", referring to the installation of Raul Castro as a leader of the country to replace Fidel, his old brother.
According to Vivanco, a accused is often arrested, sentenced and imprisoned the same day.
He said that any solution would probably be political, and the Cuban Government often causes negative reaction to the United States when both countries start to love a better dialogue.
The Palestinian authorities prevent compliance to send men to Afghan
Samedi, the Palestinian authorities reiterated a organization intended to prepare a compliment to send five men from North Virginia to Afghan in order to kill American troops, saying that they hoped that this case would allow a significant network of terrorist recorders who are directly on the Internet to search for radiated young men.
The investigators claimed that they had a hidden insurgent personality known under the name of Saifullah who invited these men to Pakistan after they found it when one of them made comments approving terrorist vagos on the YouTube website on the Internet.
Those men were led by Saifullah who tried to help them join the back-country region of Pakistan's tribal ceinture, driving al-Qaida and its terrorist training camps.
But a representative of the secret services of Pakistan who had been informed on the case on Saturday said that Saifullah had not succeeded to convince the commanders of Al-Qaida that these men did not participate in the complement of the CIA to import the terrorist network.
In fact, they were isolated during days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the polluted mountains of the North-East became a refuge of terrorism.
They were considered as infiltered agents.
That is why they were rejected, a representative of the authorities expressed to the condition of keeping anonymatic because of the confidential nature of the case.
The representative of the authorities stated that men were decisive and that they were always trying to obtain the authorisation necessary to obtain the entry into the Al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by the Pakistanian law forces.
The case of these five men -- who remain in Pakistan and who are questioned by the FBI -- stress the crucial role of recruiters in the identification of potential terrorists and may be more important, in the determination of persons in which they trust.
Since September 11, 2001, secret services had priority to filter men in the Al Qaida network.
The recorders of the organization play the role of barriers, rejecting the entry of those who do not show serious commitment and those who may be speech.
According to the analysis, potential American records are studied nearly by Al-Qaida.
But they also are very attractive for the group because of their potential access to American targets and their promoting value.
However, Evan Kohlmann, NEFA Foundation's expert in the United States, stated that terrorist groups should also take more attention in the last years in the choice of people they accept because the secret services of the United States have become experts for their recruitment methods.
If you're trying to filter someone in these groups, how better how to follow its recruitment model as many others have already followed? said Kohlmann.
The model is the one who is more on the Internet.
Decades of thousands of protestants in Copenhague require a "action" for climate
Decades of thousands of protestants have marketed in the streets, on the same day, asking a more important action on the climate of the part of the negotiators working in the Bella Convention Center of the City.
The number of demonstrators was estimated to 100 000, but 250,000 according to the police estimates.
This event has been relatively peaceful, although a small number of massive actives had been deployed by some explosives near a whole of governmental immigrants in central.
On the same day, when few things happened during the United Nations's discussions on the sponsored climate, thousands of activeists have been marketed by the city, posting out in English pancartes saying "There is not a planet B" and a Spanish, explaining "The Terre says it's enough."
Several celebrated protests, including the top model and photograph, Helena Christensen, who stated that traveling to the birth country of his mother, Peru opened his eyes on the decisive problems that the country should face because of the impact of climate changes already happen."
It's one of the reasons for which I decided to join me to the great walk -- to make the word and to start calling to leaders of the whole world to take fair, ambitious and binding decisions, said she.
It is not an easy task, but it must be a business, it is no longer possible to avoid it.
The police prevented the demonstrators to come too close to the Bella Centre and said that she had arrested 19 persons on the reason that they were taking a mask or that they were in possession of pocket cattles.
The police prevented the demonstrators to come too close to the Bella Centre and said that she had arrested 19 persons on the reason that they were taking a mask or that they were in possession of pocket cattles.
According to a past who requested anonymic because of its implication in climate discussions, the activeists who carry out mass and black clothes have made a number of explosives near the main channel of Copenhague, which is around a few departments.
They laid them close to the immune, said he, adding that they were first the fusions, then followed by "which large explosions".
Inside the Congress Palace of the Congress, people were meetings around television screens to follow the walk throughout the afternoon.
But it seems that the demonstrators did not succeed up the knowledge of key authorities such as Su Wei, representative of China for the climate.
When he asked if he thought a manifestation would have a positive impact on international dismissions, he answered English, "Actually, it's something I don't know.
Then he continued in Mandarin, explaining "The event being important, I can't hear what happens outside."
He noted that the walk could seem to be negative or useful according to the perspectives.
It shows the interest of the great public and various sectors on climate change, said he.
On the other hand, "It can also say that they are tolerating negotiations or that they are free of others."
The test results show the differences between races
The Federal Report of the past week on Mathematic results introduced a good news for the public schools of Washington D.C.
Although the District remains still far behind the head institutions, the report shows that Grade 4 and Grade 5 (cm1-cm2) are higher progress during the previous two years than in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But as regards the latest numbers of the National Educational Development Assessment (National Evaluation of educational progress) is the remaining difference between African and white results on local and national plans.
The middle results of Grade 4 (cm1) in WashingtonD.C. increased from 262 to 270 (in a scale of 500), but those of their Afro American class-American camarades have increased only three points from 209 to 212.
Successed disagreement increased between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points.
The progress of the African African progress in Grade 8 (4th) remained generally constant, only one point from 245 to 244.
The average result of white test results has not been included in the test results because the sample was not sufficiently important.
The overall view for a six-year period is not more encouraged.
In 2003, the difference between the black and white class of Grade 4 (cm1), when the first NAEP report of the District was published from 60 points (262 to 202).
Although the results achieved by children in the two groups have increased during this period, the difference only reduced to 58 points.
The last week, certain defenders in the District expressed concern that the higher highlighted by the Directorate of the Guideline of Education of Michelle A. Rhee and the Maire, Adrian Mr. Fenty (Democracy) were promulgated by white students that were already good elements.
This would mean that we have highlighted the aggression, taking into account the elements above the scale, what is problematic and green, said Jeff Smith, Director of D.C. Voice, a non-satisfactory group that defends equality in the District education.
I don't have pleasure for one or two gained points, Kwame R. Brown (democratic appearance), Member of the Council of D.C. and whose daughter is in Grade 4, in Eaton Elementary ( elementary school).
Although critical of Rhee management style, Brown stated that the test results message was that the middle schools (colls) of the city have needed awareness.
Truly, you're always wanting to see the positive signs and I respect it.
But whatever fears is that we don't know enough time and energy in our middle schools (collections).
Rhee said that the District should continue to find better ways to respond to the needs of students in difficulty.
This car, for example, has been formed some teachers to use a new reading method, the Wilson Reading System, on the schools of the elementary end cycle and the start of college, which have not integrated the bases of the early reading in their school courses and are sufficiently late in comparison with their camarades.
Every day, the Mathematics program for childrengarten classes (Maternal) in Grade 6 (6th) provides the focus on games and real life experiences, such as they have been set in the District by the former responsible Clifford Janey, which should also be credited for the progress of NAEP reported last week.
I just think we have to continue to work in order to provide better interventions to these students under the class, said Rhee.
Others say that the NAEP ' s results are aware of whether Rhee can continue to eliminate the general results of the system by providing money and resources for schools with less good results to reduce disappearance.
It is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, says Bruce Fuller, a former of teaching at the University of Berkeley in California, who studies the results of the town tests.
The conventional policy solution is to establish your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest Washington villages.
This objective may therefore have political repercussions that lead to this important programme.
But the problem, of course, is that as the other school superintendent, she is trying to serve the average class of white and blacks.
We will focus on the development of a good school system.
We need to strengthen our neighbourhood schools so that all families, wherever they are originaries, will be ensured that their children may get an excellent public education.
Janey, now Superinting the Newark Schools, said in an interview this week, that one of the key elements to reduce success disappearance was the duration of the traditional public school today in Washington District, to be in competence with the Charter Schools.
He said Janey, who has come to an agreement with his teachers' syndicate the last year to get 185 days in order to consider a "start point" to get a further increase in the next contract.
High-level education for a future promise
The bus stopped in Gettysburg College with a long slightly.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12 years old, down and knock a moment of eyes to see the white pillars, bricks and green pills.
The parents of Graciela could only end the lycée in El Salvador.
By recently, Graciela himself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, had never laid his feet on a university campus.
So, while she and other group students in Grade 8 (4th) studied Gettysburg where the school fees were $38,690 per year, his attitude was less than the newly impressioned student than enthusiastic.
Over here I'm going to study! Graciela said that would like to study the doctor, while the guide would lead them to the entrance of the immutable sciences.
Youp, really? She said, when he has given him the low ratio teacher of law - student.
The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh visiting children during their trip of discovered three days and now they had completely integrated the message: The question is not to know if you go to the University:
The question is where.
Although this issue is still wide for the large number of children born Spanish immigrant parents who have left the lycée where parents have become adolescents, they are also hundreds of thousands to benefit from university education that will allow them to enter into the middle class.
In fact, "the second generation of the "sept generation" on five posts his study at the lycée -- a notable success if both their immigrated parents, most of Mexico or Central America, are entered into the United States without having completed the lycée.
Their success is important, say researchers, they open the way to the next generations that will play an important role in the work hand of the country.
Researchers who studie the battery claim that they have natural restraints with school and an unnecessary need to succeed.
A number of parents are also those of which are set up high objectives for their children, and they find ways to compensate their lack of familyship with the American schools.
The mentrat programmes also play a very important role in helping Graciela and millions of children as to reach to the university, particularly if its efforts are regular and long-term.
When you look at children from low income families with parents who do not have experience and skills to help them to navigate in the system, any intervention, at any time, will not help them, said Patricia Gándara, researcher at Davis, University of California, who studied Latin American students.
We must think that we have a network of support for these children, from maternal to the lycée.
The Federal Programme which has funded the visit of the University of Graciela is a good example.
In the name of GEAR UP (preparing you) it provides more than $300 million per year to local school systems to organize the preparatory programs at the University that begin when students of lower income families are in middle school (Collège) and continue until the end of the years of lycée.
Since 1999, the programme was followed by more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent in the University, according to the American Ministry of Education.
The Irish Penal Ministry has agreements with 10 foreign petrol societys
Despite the concerns of violence and political instability, the Iraqi Government has succeeded with significant petrol societys in order to rebuilding its infrastructure in difficult times during two buyers that have been completed on Saturday.
The 10 agreements obtained by the Ministry of Irak with foreign petrol societies suggested that China, Russia and Europe are on the point of playing a major role in the relief of the Mediterranean Industry Industry Industry, invalidated by ten years of war and sanctions.
American societys are repaired with a participation in only two of the 10 fields of acquiring.
Seven American societys had paid to participate in the second buyer that started Friday.
The only one who had put a kitchen was lost.
Two American companies have received contracts for fields undertaken in June.
The low representation of the American petrol gentlers in the opening of the petroleum sector in Iraq override the analysis.
Finally, Irak opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of American societys, there were Asian and European companies who open the road, said Ruba Husari, the editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, a website of information on the Internet.
There will be a lot of time before another offer is made in Iraq.
The concerns of the security, which are coordinated by mass-coordined bombardements, March, and political instability, while the American military troops have escaped the American petrol societies, preventing them to enter with more strength in Iraq, which has the third largest reservation of brutal petroleum in the world, say the analysis.
In some cases, American societys were disappeared because of their rivers, particularly China and other energy companies controlled by a government, of which the work costs were significantly lower and that were more ready to take risks because they had not to take account of actionnaires.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies to get contracts with the Ministry.
The most important American societys, such as Chevron and ConocoPillips, who have maintained strong links with the Iraq Penal Ministry and have brought him their technical advice, are empty hands.
The Russian society Lukoil and Gazprom were the two main actionnaires in two of the contracts granted this weekend.
China National Petroleum Corp., detained by the State, has more encouraging contracts than other companies and is re-repared with important participations in contracts for two main fields.
We all know that China is now being a major economy, as well as a technological power, Assam Jihad said to the Ministry of Peace.
We are confidence that the Chinese society will be equal with its competences and will achieve its commitments in Iraq.
Pre-selected enterprises have been offered by barrier offers that were then compared to the barrier rate that the Ministry agreed to motive the production above of current levels for each field.
One of the main organizations of Al-Qaida would have been killed in Pakistan
It seems that a American mission, who had slain the border with Afghanistan, had killed one of the Al-Qaida Operations organizations this week, said vendrees of the United States of the Anti-Spioning authorities.
If information is confirmed, this would be the second murder attack against one of the terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of the two Arab men suspected that they had been killed by a couple of missiles launched in their car Friday, near the city of Miran Shah, in the North Waziristan province, according to American sources and Pakistan authorities in the region.
The local authorities stated that the mixtures had been thrown by a CIA's CIA type without pilot aircraft within the anarchical tribal border of Pakistan.
They conducted a white car, leading to the Afghan border, when the car was attacked, said a member of the Pakistani secret civil services, expressing the Miran Shah phone.
Representatives of the authority stated that the suspected local warrants were thrown on the place and quickly confided the remaining "country totally disqualified."
The local authorities were totally impossible to verify the identity of victims, but the two American anti-terrorist representatives gave non-specified evidence that Somali had been part of the dead.
Somalia was described as one of the military military organizations of Al-Qaida, leading terrorist operations from the Group outside the Afghan-Pakistan region.
Its role was to organize complements around the world, stated one of the authorities who wished to keep anonym, focusing on the sensible nature of air bottles within the Pakistan's territory.
In view of its central role, this probably understood conspirations of attacks against the United States and Europe.
He followed the strategic designs of Al-Qaida leaders and delivered them into terrorist attacks plans.
A second representative of the American authority stated that Somali had rapidly progressed in Al Qaida's lines and had very good relations with other extremist groups in the region.
It may not be known of the great American public, but it does not decrease the threat it constitutes for us and our allegeds, said the second official representative.
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second important person of Al-Qaida or the second leader of Taliban killed since September, when a similar attack killed Naumuddin Jalov, leader of a military function in the tribal ceinture, and three other operators.
The rhythm of the attacks carried out by the Drones of the CIA has reduced from the age of about six operations per month to two, according to the figures developed by the Long War Journal, a website modeled by a non-satisfactory group.
This decline may have been needed to improve terrorist groups that have progressed to reduce their vulnerability while also imitously killing suspected informators, states the site.
United Nations Special Send to Kaboul was retained
The United Nations special sent to Afganistan, Kai Eide, said Friday, he would be released from its post in March at the end of an extreme mandate for enlarged corruption allegations during the United Nations presidential elections supported.
The Eide start is inter alia while the Administration of Obama decided to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afganistan.
The sentence of the United Nations said that it supported this increase, but he expressed concern about the United States calendar for a remedy of troops that would start in 18 months and that would oblig the other NATO Governments to remove their forces.
We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the good signal to the Afghan and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a phone intertainment of Kabul.
Our commitment must be long-term.
The Norway diplomat has also pressed the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international officials with assistance to political transition in Afghanistan.
The military increase must be covered by civilians, said he.
Eide said he was not released but would just respect the commitment he had taken to his family in March only two years to Kaboul.
He said he wanted to prevent the United Nations.
The Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon now knows that it is time to find a replacement.
I just said it was better to start looking for my replacement, he said Eide.
When I came here, there was a vacuum two months between the departure of my predecessor and my arrival.
According to the representatives of the United Nations, Ban has already started seeking a replacement.
Representatives argue that the name of Staffan di Mistura was town; it was an Italian-Switzerland citizen, which recently had presumed a United Nations mission in Bagdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a French who previously directed the United Nations peacekeeping operations.
The Reputation of Eide in Afghanistan has been tested after his former adjoint, Peter W. Galbraith, who was accused in September to encourage the President Hamid Karzai during the presidential elections and to deteriore the evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide refused these allegations, but he stated that Galbraith's accuses, which had been recruited -- "There have dismissed the mission because there had already a good dose of scepticism in respect of the international observation of elections."
Eide stated that he had proposed the appointment of a civil representative to coordinate the assistance of the American forces in Afghanistan.
He also emphasized the United Nations responsibilities to allow its successors to embark more staff from the United States and other Western countries that were not assigned to the Afghanistan mission, saying that it would allow them to give more trust in the way their money is payed.
Eide expressed its frustration on the limits of its powers in Afghanistan, saying that the hard United Nations building regulations were able to provide new talents.
The rules of the United Nations are such that I could recognize only one person since May, said he.
It's a catastrophic, and it can't take it.
Gates: Iran must submit additional sanctions
The Secretary of Defence, Robert, Mr. Gates, said in Friday that the large global powers would soon impose "weak extra sanctions" on Iran because of its incapacity to engage in nuclear ambitions' talks.
Gates, expressing a party of 300 American soldiers to North Iraq, during a week visit in the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, disastered the event of a military action against the Islamic Republic.
There is no good option in Iran, said he, in response to the question of a soldier on the event of such a disappearance.
One of the things that I felt most, is that if I learned something in Iraq over the past six years, it's the incredible side of war.
The Administration of Obama considers a set of sanctions that would be on Iran ' s military and political election, but Gates reported that some of these sanctions could also affect Iranians from the street.
He stated that a "all of motivations and punishments" could be necessary to convince the Iraqn government that it would be at least good security with nuclear weapons, because "the people would suffer extremely those sanctions.
Friday, in a declaration of the White House Port of Robert Gibbs, the Administration joined European leaders in a warning that Iran will face the “probable” consequences if he does not bring its nuclear programme in compliance with the United Nations Security Council and its Monitoring Agency, the International Agency for Atomic Energy (AIEA).
Iran continues to say that he wants to develop its nuclear experience only in a peaceful goal.
In Geneva's talks, on 1 October, he stated that it would reiterate the dialogue on reduction of its nuclear programme and accepted a major part of its enrichy uranium stock, with the experiencing fuel experiencing for a medical reactor.
The Administration has made such an agreement, through developing confidence on both sides and winning time for negotiations.
Since Iran appeared to be disappeared from the tentatives of agreement - in part, the experts say, because Iran’s leading leadership is divided on the fact that they are involved or not with the United States.
In most cases, I say that Iran's raising faces some of the proposals of the international community for which they actually had given their agreement at the beginning of October, the international community, including Russians and China, has made themselves together with what they had not considered, in terms of additional important sanctions against the Iranians.
The President Obama set up on 31 December as a limit date to Iran to answer the proposals, before it turns to other options, including the continued action by the State Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton called "augmented sanctions".
In a Thursday declaration made in New York, Iran's mission described what it was called “the no foundation” of some members of the Iran Security Council on nuclear activities and stated that it was agreed to continue talking with the United States and five major global powers, “for a long-term solution”.
Gates, who had to return to Washington after Friday, met in the morning, the Prime Minister of Irak, Nouri al-Maliki, before taking the flight for the rich Mediterranean region of Kurdish to fight the army responsibilities in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil.
There are tensions between the Kurdes and the Arab majority in Iraq, particularly regarding borders, property rights and income share.
Gates urged both parties to reduce potential conflict in order to avoid all late overall of the American plans for reducing the number of US troops from 1115,000 to 50,000 before the end of August month.
Gates also wants to calm the anxiety of the Kurdes on the suspension. The American authorities townd Gates to say to Massoud Barzani, President of the Regional Government of Korea: "We will keep your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq."
We won't leave you."
In the old Chinese, a change of direction
Wang Weijia and her husband grew around the spectrum of propagandas, "The Mother's earth is too fat to accommodate more children" and "An child more is a tomb."
They have even learned that the Government of Shanghai, alarmed by the insufficient rates of their town and the older population, have been radically changed by this age and began to encourage young couples to be more child; their reaction was immediately closed and closed: never.
We have already given all our time and all our energy to one child.
We have no second, said Wang, 31 years old, Director of Human Resources and who had a son of eight months.
More than 30 years after the introduction of the unique child's policy in China, creating two generations of unique children with good games and feeds, named the "impersourcity" crisis of the population, threatening the country.
According to the United Nations, the average nationality rate has falled from 1,8 children per couple compared to six when the policy has been implemented.
The repartition of the population is intended that the number of residents of 60 years and more explosive will be 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 per cent of 2050. This is higher than the average average of about 20 per cent.
This diséquilibre is still worse in the coast cities with a very teacher population, such as Shanghai.
Last year, 60 and more people represented approximately 22 percent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the nationality rate was less than one child by couple.
Xie Lingli, Director of Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission of the Municicicial Population of Shanghai and the Family Planning Commission) said that the fruit couples should have children to "to help reduce the proportion of the older population and prevent a lack of work for the future."
Shanghai is on the point to become "such old - but not so rich, but - that the developed countries like Japan and Sweden said.
A progressive attitude
In 1978, Chinese policy of the unique child is, without a context, the most contrary obligation imposed by the communist government.
The couples who offend this policy may have to pay colossal amendments - until three times their annual income - and to submit discrimination on the workplace.
The Chinese authorities assigned the police to help the country to avoid dangerous tendance for its natural resources, while human rights lawyers described abuses in the implementation of this policy.
In rural areas, some representatives of the authority have forced women who were embraced from a second child to avorte.
Furthermore, many couples had been used to selective avvorts leading to a boy ratio - girls anormally high.
In the past few years, the population responsible authorities gradually adjusted their position on the policy of the unique child.
In 2004, they provided more exceptions to the rule, including the residuals of the cities, the ethnic minorities and the cases in which men and women already are unique children, and in 2007, they have added many of their hard slogans.
Qiao Xiaochun, professor at the Institute of Population Research (Pékin Research Institute), said that the central government authorities recently discussed more radical changes, such as authorize couples to have two children if one of the partners is a unique child.
In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage birth.
In some time, posters inciting families to have only one child have been replaced by detailed regulations that have the right to have a second child and how to make the request for authorisation.
The Government of the town has assigned the responsibility of family planning and volunteers to meet couples, homes, and to spend prospects under their doors.
He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would wish to have more than one child.
According to the family planning responsible, the response was deceived.
Reply response
Although those who are responsible in a rural city of Shanghai say they have seen an increased demands for couple cards wishing to a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change.
The Huinan community, with a population of 115.000 people, for example, is still received only four to five requests per month.
Shanghai's officials, deceived that, despite the country, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still planned to be about 165,000 -- lower than 2009 but lower than 2008.
Feng Juging, Responsable to the Family Planning Committee in the Shanghai community, said that financial considerations are likely the main reason for which many people do not want to have children.
They want to want their first child, said she.
Yang Jiawei, 27 and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26 years old, said they would worship two children and have legally authorized them.
But as many Chineses, they only have minimum health insurance and life insurance given by the government.
Without social protection, they say, the decision would be unreasonable.
The Western believed that the policy of the unilateral child is a problem of rights, said Yang, a construction engineer whose women were embedded from seven months of the first couple.
That's true, we want the chance to have more than one kid.
But the problem is not only the law.
That's the money.
Other couples have psychological reasons to explain their hesitation.
Wang, Human Resource Responsable, said that she wanted only a unique child because she was one of them. "We were the family centre and were usually all careful of us."
We do not have the usual to take care of someone else and we really don't want to take care of others."
Chen Zeian, 42 years and owner of a translation society is the most cruel.
For pairs working to two, from average class, which reduce the rate of nationality, he said, it must be enormous for the success.
People of 20 or 30 years have grown by seeing their parents fighting at the first time of the capitalist Chinese and do not want themselves to have this style of life, said he.
Even one child asks a lot of time for his parents, he said.
A mother must leave at least two years of its social life.
Then there are space problems -- "You need to change your apartment" -- and planning -- "When your child has only 9 months, you need to write its CV to get a place in the best mother."
Most of his friends are ready to this experience once, said Chen, but not two.
Our generation is the first to benefit from a highest level of life, says he.
We don't want to do too much sacrifices.
The United Nations Group has draft plans for the reduction of emissions
The climate conference, sponsorized by the United Nations, has been characterized by disorganized affections and mutual receipts -- is returned under the fire of the vendredi ramp, due to the publication of a document that highlights the ambitious reductions of gas in the next 40 years, with industrialized nations that raise the majority of charge, in the next time.
The text that could provide the bases of a final political agreement to regulate the gas effects, has stressed the remaining obstacles, as it cleared the way to take.
But it was seen as an important advance in the negotiations lacking time, with more than 100 leaders of the whole world reaching the next week to Copenhague.
A special working group of the United Nations, the text does not say how rich countries would give the poor to support climate, current and long-term rise.
And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how developed economies and new emergency economies could reduce their carbon production and what would be the higher limit of the increase in global temperature that those responsible would be ready to to eliminate.
He gives great flexibility to the process, said John Coequeyt, representative of Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutiar, which revised six pages of the document, studied a text of negotiations of 180 pages to focus on what the Executive Secretary-General has described on the climate change of the United Nations, Yvo de Boer, as "the complete image".
It shows the guidelines of an possible agreement in which industrial nations collectively reduced emissions in 2020, from 25 to 45 per cent compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries in the same period would reduce their 15 to 30 per cent.
Commonly, the countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 per cent and 2050.
The European Union also reiterated negotiations, Friday, promised to provide $3,6 billion per year for the next three years to assist the poorest countries to adapt the impact of climate change - to support inondations and driving or to avoid deforestation.
However, Friday, the same verbal changes have been made, which have held the negotiations since the last week.
Todd Stern, Representative of the United States to the climate negotiation, rejected all discussions with respect to the reduction of greenhouse gas from industrialized countries, comparing voluntary efforts made by the main economies, if they had not been funded by developed countries.
This change is the signal that Obama's administration becomes more hard to China than Bush has been, two years ago.
The United States will not sign an agreement without efforts and action of the main developing countries, says Stern who also regrets that the text is not sufficient to ensure that reductions could be checked by external observers.
Stern made its comments a hour after the China Minister for Foreign Affairs, He Yafei said that the chief American business negotiator, whether it was "exactly unrepensable" to have said early in the week that the United States would not have financially helped China to fight climate disappearance.
With future economic trajectors of the main global powers in the game, disabilities appear at the same time within the third world and between the industrial world and the emerging economies.
The current battle concerns the saving of individual economies than the salvation of the planet, with China and the United States with respect to their respective obligations, while the poorest nations stress that the two decades of countries the most influently ignore the scientific impératives to act more comfortable.
Ricardo Ulate, a Delegate of the Costa Rica, said that it was not surprising that the main powers were fighting to know who should arise the costs of the reduction of smooth gas, although the vulnerable countries had become more aggressive in their attempt to make the large emittors responsible for their actions.
It is really a game in which a new economic heromon is developed, said Ulate, which is also advisers on the climate for Mexico and Central America for International Conservation.
Some of these most vulnerable countries in the impact of climate change showed that they would continue to draw pressure to get a legally binding treaty in Kopenhagen, although most of the major participants say that negotiations will lead to the minimum, to political agreement.
The Pets Alliance, which meets 43 members, has prepared a proposal for a treaty of 24 pages, early Friday.
Artur Runge-Metzger, the Climate Unit of the European Commission, said that the action of the small island States had "private political pressure on the complete political process" in part as they are now unified and ask for energetic economies such as China and India to act.
Debates have become an urgent case, while delegates focused on the fact that they needed to solve most problems in particular before the leaders of Governments come to an agreement.
High-level officials such as the Indian Minister of Environment, Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese Vice-Minister were descended from their aircraft and dismissed in the Bella Centre to assist home meetings and information conferences in order to make appeals that will be studied during the next week.
The real image of the meeting -- during which 13,000 people enter and get out of the Congress Palace every day -- the Guitar activists present night spectrums from countries that are under them and that proposals are revised and distributed on paper rather than by emails -- is a real challenge.
The intensity is only increased: almost all major ministers are here and not later than Wednesday, 60 government leaders will be in Copenhague.
We enter into the core of the Grands, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, Vice-President for World Conservation Policy.
The hard weights come.
In Great Britain, the first train at 225 km/h will re-define the Monday syndrome
On 5:13, Monday, a stage of sifflet will cause the night to report the start of a train that will mark a revolution of transport to Great Britain.
The first high speed train from the country will reach 225 km/h, while it will get away from Ashford, in the city, London St Pancras, about 93 km in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, Minister of Transport, will be joined by Lady Kelly Holmes on the boat of the first Javelin train outside London.
It hopes that the new service will allow the Great Britain to integrate an international network of speed and reliable trains and will reduce the major Middle-Base, Northern and Economics.
The losses will cause flowing cities, the duration of business travels will be at least long and the past of the airport and the train will reduce national carbon emissions while reducing the embodies on roads.
In theory, the three main political parties adhere to this project.
But the ten billions of books required to build a new iron network, the inevitable planning battle and the environmental dangers risks to be removed by the British speed lines.
According to The Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to achieve a factuality report to Lord Adonis on 30 December.
This will allow you to get a detailed card from the innerary of the next stage planned for the high speed network.
The new linking line in London to West Midlands will be disined in the five meters of the urban area and sites where the environmental impact can be controversed.
In the campaign, the plan will be designed up to 25 meters of the final engineer.
HS2 is also planned that HS2 provides three options for a greater speed network, going to the northern.
Lord Adonis will answer the summer.
Privileged options are set before in a Y configuration for which a high speed line will go to West Midlands.
The line will be divided in two to or near Birmingham, with a branch that goes to the West Pennines in Manchester and the Ecosse and another going to the northern east, to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle on Tyne.
A unique line will pass the Ecosse.
"It seems to be the best performance option," said a rail professional.
When this ends, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first branch, which will not open before 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a journey.
The proposals will allow the train to travel to 400 km/h, making the fastest British network in the world.
The initial trace is designed to allow 400m long trains and to transport 1100 people.
Up to 18 trains per hour can work on a London line - Birmingham.
A terminal to accept 20000 passengers per hour would be necessary.
As data of space borders, it is intended that an existing race will be increased to receive the high speed network.
The experts of the rail industry state that only St. Pancras International or Euston offer this opportunity.
Lord Adonis will announce whether he thinks or not that the project should be established, but longer public consultations and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general selection.
Even if the machine starts, the network should be built partly.
The trains will first be obliged to run out of the high speed lines on the roots existing in the north of Birmingham, keeping travel periods between London and the Ecosse above three hours.
This solution seems to be the best to ensure a train flight transition, which is a reference point for rail revolution.
Contributors pay 75,000 GBP for Tory orange
Alan Duncan, the main member of the Tory parliament, has paid the contribution of thousands of books per year to remuneration the cost of an orange he built in his home of its circumscription.
The respondent of the party, restored by David Cameron to be denied that the members of the parliament were "entry," increased its impressive of 75.000 GBP to build an extension in the second house in Rutland.
It was authorized to pay additional interests, amounting to hundreds of books per month, to the contribution.
The Communication authorities have received complaints at this time and have not been asked by Sir Thomas Act, who has achieved a supervision of the expenditures of the members. Last night, Mr. Duncan said that the complaints could not be "for clear or more".
Mr. Duncan, one of the richest members of the parliament, is the owner of a house in a village of Rutland - Melton's circumscription.
The advertising houses were sold for about a million books.
The re-cause includes a kitchen, a room and a food room, but the Emotions Office said that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
In the last year, he added a veteran to the house, described it in his plans as an orange.
The neighbors describe it as a "wind for the pleasure".
Mr. Duncan has not been requested to provide an exemption for an increase in the recent survey made by the Committee on Privileges and Standards of the Communities on the provisions of pre-related immunities.
The Committee has denied it in the last month of any complaint of non-respect rules after an investigation on its expenditure.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan has amended the legal security of 271.406 GBP of its ownership of London to the home of its circumscription that he bought in 1991, the year before it was a member of the parliament.
The documents published this week show that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately 1.400 GBP for months of immunity interest until March last year.
In April, its requests increased more than 1.800 GBP per month.
Mr. Duncan's interest rate on the improving RBS has not been changed at this time, suggesting that all increases had to be funded by 75,000 GBP.
The standard variable interest rate RBS was from 7.94 percent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March, this year, without movement since now.
The last publication of the Communications authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to ask 1.250 GBP in May.
Mr. Duncan has lost his responsibilities office of the fantastic cabinet in September, after a journalist under covering his own film to explain that the members of the parliament should survive on the budget after the expense of expenditures.
"Actually, it's national now, you have to live on the budget and you've been treated as "of M...e"
He said, "I paid my money on my garden and I asked a little part based on what was right.
And I could've been able to ask sacredly, but I didn't do it."
The member of the parliament, from its former post in the past, began to explain its expenses in May after he appeared that he requested thousands of books for his garden before being agreed with the cost office that this might be considered as extreme.
A activist created a £ thumb in the M Duncan petroleum, to protest after he was revealed that he asked 4.000 GBP for three years.
I was concerned about the increase of the immunity, last night, Mr. Duncan said: "It was for capital improvements, approved by the cost office then by law."
He added: "There is no problem of deployment or development or use of rules or any thing.
It was in fact clear, in the rules authorized, etc.
It couldn't be just or easier."

Brighton is a place where creative and vibrant, and we are trying to experiment and represent this through spirituality."

The Minister of National Education Luc Chatel said in an interview to appear in the DDD's Sunday that the history and geography were "forked" from the reform of the general lycée, despite the removal of their obligation to scientific terminal.
The first students will have every four weekly hours and the same program for a shared shared culture, Mr. Chatel stated.
For the Minister, "account of hypocrisy" because, according to him, "the S child is no longer a scientific polar" but "in large way, it concentres the best students."
The ES and L can't remain sub-filters of the S, still pointing out: "I have no longer heard many stories and intelligents of the lack of terminal geography in the lycées."

It also reaffirms the project to remove the school map from 2012.
In Normale Sup, experts have 15 minutes to convince the climate
Fifteen minutes to speak of the Copenhague Summit: it is the challenge that John Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on Climate Evolution (GIEC) invited by the Ulm Regional School.
John Jouzel, also the Nobel Price of the Peace, has ensured the first conferences "Ernest", a day created by an expert intervention, 15 minutes each, filmed and open to the public, found a journalist of the AFP.
We wanted to do something that was attacking people and to give them to know more, explained in marriage of the Edouard Hannezo Conference, 22 years, one of the organisms of this day that throws his name from the students from the school's fish.
It is chosen a twentieth of interventors among the experts of their discipline and it is selected for their charismatic side, as specificed.
With regard to the climate disappearance, "It can talk about hours, but you can also talk about key objectives in a few minutes," said the AFP Jean Jouzel, which was expressed without notes, but by the assistance of graphics, before a fifty-seven people.
This is part of our scientific role, he emphasized, hoped that the hearings will find that "the Copenhague Conference supports a extremely serious scientific folder".

Payment recruitments: the wrath of prison supervisors, planned actions
The prison observer syndicates called on Friday to the "General Mobilisation" to require the payment of this year's end feasts and additional hours whose payment was repealed in January for budget reasons.
FO-Pennantary (2th observers syndicat) asked for staff that will not be served to demonstrate onmorrow before pending institutions and "blocking" to "defend flight of their duties".
The CGT-Pennientary (3th Independent of the Professional Training) calls them to "come together in general meetings in the various prisons for strong mobilization", judges "honorable and unacceptable" in December of the "againing hours, night prices, Sundays and feast days" working in October.
And the first syndicat of supervisors, the Federal Federal Independent Union (Ufap/Unsa), "he calls for general mobilization (...) to resume merely and anger".
The Office of Criminal Administration and the Ministry of Justice explains that additional hours have been increased in 2009 and have not been paid all, but they assure that the rests will be paid in January.
Chancelaria expressed a day ago that Michele Alliot-Marie had sent a post to supervisor syndicats to ensure that this payment would be carried out the next month.
I don't ignore the efforts provided by staff for the operation and modernization of our criminal system, the Minister of Justice in this mail.
I requested the direction of the criminal administration to establish a set of measures without time to ensure that this situation is born from a bad assessment of the number of additional hours does not be reproduced in the future, added Mrs Alliot-Marie.
The payment of December will therefore be small, except for the management staff benefiting from primary functions and objectives, the Ufap/Unsa has deployed, for which "budgetary constraints have good two".
It is a clean scandal, the FO Interregional Union of Marseille, announced its decision of boycotter to the new order "All meetings and meetings".
Personals will not work on their daily and feast days if those of the month of October are not regularized in December, idem for additional hours, also threat FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At the time that our tasks and missions are increased without enhance our effectiveness, it is more likely to take it to the staff denaries, the CGT-Public of Bordeaux believes.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some less damage than others.
But in all ways the account is not, noted the Secretary-General of Ufap, Jean-François Forget.
For Christ, Obama said to offer "the more chocolates" than those he receives
The American President Barack Obama, who attained to pass his first Christmas in family to the White House, confided to the "Papes" of the small Oprah Winfrey screen that he had a simple line on cadals: "I give stuff more than those I receive."
In the context of a special emission that will be distributed on the ABC chapter, the President and his wife Michelle offer a view of how they hear to celebrate the end of the year's festival in their new and prestigious stay.
Even Bo, the small fellow at four patches of the family will be part.
The Father of Christ also loves Bo, he thus stated Michelle Obama, explaining that the dog would be "incertainly" a gift, according to expenditures of the emission distributed in advance.

It's just later in my life I realized that it was the one who gave me this ballon.

He would have wounded two passengers, apparently heat: a thirty-year and a quarter, this last grief.
The scenario remained confused in the evening.
He was armed by two courts to speak that he was taking in croix behind the dose, explained on the place one responsible for the alleiance in the Highs-de-Seine Arnaud Pressé.

United States: the lawyer of Polanski reiterates the abandonment of the pursuant
The French-Polynian lawyer, Roman Polanski, called a new Thursday in Los Angeles, California, Western California, the abandon of the persecutions against his client, currently assigned to residence in Switzerland for a mourning case over 30 years.
Chad Hummel, the lawyer of the "Pianist" realisant, has appointed three judges of the appointment core of the second district of California of serious proceedings at the time of facts, in 1977.
I call on the leave of charges here and now, said Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of the judge responsible for the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, "we were cold in the dose."
According to him, the judge Rittenband -- died since -- would have discussed, before he had made his sentence, with a prosecutor who would have told him that Roman Polanski merited the prison -- which is a serious crime of procedure.
This debate was revealed in the document "Roman Polanski: wished and desired" (Roman Polanski, searched and desired) of the mouth of the applicant, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells had finally declared the end of September to the author of the documentary.
In the case that the cour would not leave the pursuant, Mr. Hummel revoked the holding of a proceedings, which would allow him to submit the evidence of his argumentary.
The prosecution has reiterated the argumentary already developed in the first instance, namely that any leave of charges could not be seriously studied until Roman Polanski would not be present before the court.
The cinéaste, aged 76, was escaped in the United States in 1978 before the sentence was sentenced for “unlawful sexual relations” with a 13-year-old.
He never throwed his feet to the United States since.
The adjourner of the comite of Los Angeles Phyllis Asayama, has thus declared that Roman Polanski was "the way to be here to hear."
In this case, will you like to send the message, not only to (Roman Polanski) but also to other accused, which is possible to escape?, asked Mrs Asayama.
For her, the kitchen "refers a favor to the core, while degrading its authority".
One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to make their decision -- also emphasized him "and there were other alternatives to escape."
Mr. Hummel was not the only one to ask for the delay of persecutions against Roman Polanski.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also called, once again, the end of the persecutors.
Recognizing that his customer does not support any increase in the case of Polanski, she added: "Persans in this room can't say that the procedure was right.
Thirty-two years, it's enough."
Roman Polanski was arrested on 26 September in Switzerland for American arrest mandate.
After more than two months behind the bars, he was assigned to reside in his Gstaad chalet, at the expectation of an eventual exhibition.

However, the indexes have been released by a new progress in the dollar, over two months before the euro, which was "poving down the significant sectors in the economic situation", Owen Fitzpatrick from the German Bank.

Johnny Hallyday's news are very positive, according to his son David
Johnny Hallyday's news "we are very positive," assured Friday his son David at his arrival at the LA airport where he had to go to his father hospitalized for a few days.
The news are very positive.
It's very strong, it's really good, said to the David Hallyday pressure at his out of the airport that brought it from Paris a little after 13H00 local (21H00 GMT).
The son of the cantor, the detained air, assured that he was going to make the Cedars-Siniai hospital of Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a successful infection to the operation of a discreet heritage on 26 November in Paris.
The cantor was "managed this night in Los Angeles for a reason of comfort, to prevent it to suffer and to manage his treatment," said the press service.
Johnny Hallyday was already put in artificial coma by the doctors of the Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted on Monday for a successful infection in the operation of a discreet heritage on 26 November in Paris.
The cantor had to be reopened in the Thursday night because of important lesions resulting from this intervention.
Her wife Laetia went on Friday in the French lycée of Los Angeles where their daughter Jade was learned to assist a school spectrum, found a photo of the AFP.
Head of ortohopedic and traumatological chirurgic of the hospital of the Pitié-Salpester, Yves Catoné, announced that he would be coming on Monday to Los Angeles at the cantor.
The producer has vitally committed the Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the Neurochirurgian who operated the cantor on 26 November at the International Clinique of Monceau Park.
We told us that it was a mask.
The chirurgians of Los Angeles said they were outlined, said Mr. Camus.
I heard of a possible proceedings to come, said he.
John-Claude Camus said Johnny Hallyday was "partition too fast for Los Angeles, with the authorisation of the Paris chirurgian".
I had this doctor online who assured me that there was no problem for this trip and that was surprised, since I had two discreet heritages, he added it.
Before the beginning of RTL, he indicated that the cantor was apparently "part without drain, without anything", after his parish operation.
Dr. Stefane Delajoux is very known in the artistic environment.
He had operated the actrice Mary Trintgnant in Vilnius, a few days before his death, in a clinic of Neuilly-sur-Seine where he triggered at the time.
In 2007, he also operated the Charlotte Ginsburg actrice to restore an hematom following a cerebral hemorracy.
But it is also a doctor to the severe reputation, condemned to several republics from justice, in medical liability dossiers, as well as in fiscal and explosive fraude.
My Olivier Metzner, the lawyer of the Mediterranean order, condemned him to be " a man without groups" pursuant to "regularly" before the Council of the Order, which is "not to be recommendable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stefane Delajoux expressed on Friday by his lawyer's drink, David Koubbi.
He stated that the intervention was "perfectively deployed" and that post-operative reviews were "normal".
The "non-emerragic" operation and therefore did not require a drain ownership," he added.
In any case, the tournament of the cantor, whose health nuts are multiplied since this age, seems to be between parentheses.
Of course, a reprise from the tour on 8 January (a Amians, ndlr) as provided, appears very short, said Mr Camus.
UDF association increases tonn and sumes the New Centre to do not use its silk
The UDF Association, controlled by the MoDem de François Bayrou, reiterated on the OPA attempt of the New Centre, Hervé Morin, on the scene of the former giscardia, in order to continue to use it on any support, under the penalty of prosecutors.
Hervé Morin publicly announced its intention to recover the UDF silk, judged that François Bayrou didn't defend his political heritage after holding her hand on the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is part of the UMP, was also planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NN.
In order to support its start, he received the support of the President Hervé de Charte (ex-UMP passed to the NCC), which returned the property of the UDF mark to be the first to lay down in 2004 to the National Institute of Industrial Properties.
But Friday evening, the UDF Association Office, controlled by the friends of François Bayrou who do not hear to be delayed, is gone out of his silence to start a staying to the minister and the deputy, calling them to do so more to use the silk and to transmit them the property of the brand, in punishment of judicial prosecutors.
You have multiplied, in the last days, the statements indicated that you would propose your political movement to +represent+ the UDF scell, written the association in a email signed by 19 of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez del MoDem, as well as Senator Jean Arthuis of the Center Alliance.
You also have thought to follow your military material and on your website's maintenance, the name of this movement, the +New Centre+, the slogan +l'UDF today+, also find the subscriptors of the mail.
As you don't know, you don't have any right to use this seal, it explains the UDF office that continues to remove the NC to "immediately remove the name of the UDF of any support and (son) web site."
He also requests Hervé de Charte " to transmit the property of (la) mark to its laws. "
If you were not done, the courts would be undertaken to respect UDF law and legal rights, the signatorys.
In their post, they explain that UDF is a political movement since 1978 and remember that Mr Morin and his friends had "the choice" to leave it in 2007 "for creating a competitive movement, such as others did it in 2002, to create UMP".
The New Centre, therefore, has no right to use the UDF seal (EU for French democracy).
They also recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 with the MoDem accession for three years and the creation of a office to defend "the material and moral interests" of the training founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
With regard to Hervé de Charte, continued the office, "forward he put the brand," he was "more adherent from UDF for three years," but at the UMP.
It benefits scandalally and fraudly of the depositoy of UDF accent to exercise it for its account.
This indelicateness is in fact to turn to delict, denial, before we go on the GN strategy: "There seems to us that in political, such as in life, it is more worthy to make a name by itself than to try to get out of the anhymic by taking a name to which we have no right."
Business Liliane Bettencourt : François-Marie Banier will be judged for weakness abuse
The Court of Nanterre decided on Friday to judge the artist François-Marie Banier in order to determine whether, as appealed by the daughter of the Liliane Bettencourt, he benefited from a state of lowness of the otogenary for the spoil of a part of his force.
The photograph of 62 years, known for its star photographs, will be judged on 15 and 16 April 2010 for weakness abuse, a punishment of a maximum of three years of immigration penalty and 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will be a proceeding in this case worth a saga on one of the richest familys of France, where mother and girls are all deceived by holding the crowds of cosmetics the Oreal.
But the 15th correctional room also commanded that a medical expert of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87, should be collected by three doctors.
The main herories and actionnaire of the Oral has always refused to submit to such an examination, in any case, in the terms proposed by the Nanterre Park at the investigation.
Friday doctors should submit a report before 10 March 2010, inter alia whether Liliane Bettencourt was able to be low and what periods.
I think she'll get it.
I'm going to talk to him, told Mrs. Bettencourt, Mrs. Georges Kiejman.
For its part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, welcomed the decision of the court.
It is an excellent new (...) The expertise will demonstrate that he (M. Banier) has handed the old lady that we need to protect.
Since two years, the unique girl of Lyiliane Bettencourt has committed the prosecutors to the Penal against François-Marie Banier, photographer and artist, that she has accused that she had benefited during years of the weakness of his mother's mother to get a billion of euros in form of cheques, life insurance contracts or master tables.
On its side, Liliane Bettencourt has always been manipulated by the photograph, that she thinks as a long date friend.
While the court had to consider the acceptability of the action undertaken by Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers had sometimes turned to the great Friday family disappearance.
The lawyer of Lyiliane Bettencourt therefore made a statement of three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to its notebook, in which she had said that she had disappointed the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In the 2003 post dated Liliane Bettencourt added, as a lawyer: "Do you can explain my daughter I wrote to Banier once, two times a day for fifteen years.
Françoise, I never could talk to him since his marriage was married."
For its part, the parque of Nanterre reiterated that the complaint was not acceptable to act, since a judge of the guards refused the last days to make the request to open a proceeding procedure for his mother.
Liliane Bettencourt 'a full ability to act in justice, it is not protected and has no tutor.
No one else has to act on his place," said the representative of the Public Minister, Marie-Chrsetine Daubigney.
The Court finally decided that it would be declared once the proceedings would be held on the receipt of Ms. Bettencourt-Meyers.
Managerial Revolution or End of Economic Intelligence?
If nothing changes in the governance of the major French enterprises, our fight for the development of economic intelligence would have been vain...
Since more than ten years, the attitude of the management of the large enterprises in terms of its employees, recalls the position of consumers' position before marketing revolution: it is to engage partners to "valuators" defined above as it was another time, to impose consumers of products thought by Usiness technicians.
By putting the customer into the heart of the company, the marketing revolution has sent the market market survey strategies on the place, although the authorised attempt to impose products unconnected from the factors of client preferents regularly come!
A demobilization of employees can be deployed in a mortal demoralization.
Sucides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the emerging part of a much more general phenomenon, which particularly affects the frameworks.
This demobilisation is seriously involved in the development of all the intellectual functions of the company, including R-D and, more, of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IA "requests all stakeholders (...) a proactive start and a prospective vision"; it requires employees a commitment that authorized management receipts are fully contrary.
This is why we call for a manager revolution that would be to put partners into the company’s concerns in the same as the customer.
Relation to internal opinion investigations
Internal opinion surveys – as the questionnaire submitted by Orange to its employees- will they encourage this revolution in managing practices?
Unfortunately, I'm afraid not.
- First because I could find that, in the face of a new situation, every structure event eventually happens, after good decorations, to do priority... what she's always done.
- Then, because authorism – one of the pathologys of the power, grows proportionally to the importance of its own skills.
- Finally, because most leaders have a simple vision of human behaviour.
They have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
They take, by intellectual comfort, old behaviorist theory reactived recently by the "unional" neurosciences" states and widely diffused, at their insuff, by studies and media institutions.
Thus, suggesting that it is possible in the way the "sic" of the framework commitment, a recent investigation of Ipsos made in the Figaro.fr conforts the leaders in a post of mechanistic governance, unadapted today.
Identify and measure mobile factors
In contrast, the manager revolution required for the good functioning of modern enterprises is supposed to approve a final vision of human behaviour.
It is to integrate, in any reason or practice of governance, a fundamental consideration: for employees, the commitment for the company is only possible if it appears clearly as a way to achieve a part of their dreams, ambitions, their projects.
Currently, only the studies of the motive analysis are currently accepting this concept of employees' motivations.
These studies showed that they judge their business by based on a predetermined dox, which allows them through their pre-determined image of the company to assess what it offers to achieve their projects of life.
Due to the identification and measurement of these mobilization factors, business leaders can control, predict and anticipate their social performance and deliver human resource management on the place.
They are thus creating a well-developed field for co-ordinated development of a strong and efficient economic intelligence.
Oslo Discourses: the "right war" goes from right to Obama
American right welcomed the talking of Oslo's speech by Barack Obama, satisfied that the Nobel Price of Peace 2009 has defended the concept of "good war" against the United States enemies.
The conservators, which browned the price appointment to Mr. Obama on 9 October, applaimed the presidential talks at the institution of Sarah Palin, former candidate to the Vice-President in the elections of 2008.
I loved what he said, said Mrs. Palin, a Egyptian of the right neighborhood of the Republical Party at the US Today, adding itself to the topic of the "pleasant war" in his memories of being published.
The war is of course heard the last thing to my opinion that the Americans want to have to do, but it is necessary.
Should these terrorists be stopped all over there, is it awaited.
Mr. Obama, who entrusted the two wars of his pre-decessor George W. Bush in Iraq and Afghanistan, worked on Thursday in Oslo to justify the use of force, a way to explain its decision to send 30,000 additional soldiers to Afganistan nine days before.
Another adversary of Mr. Obama, Newt Gingrich said that the President had done to Oslo "the very good work."
I found that the talking was very good, he welcomed the former President of the Chamber of Representatives, which highly appreciated the mention of "the existence of evil in the world" in the Presidential proposal.
On some side, I found this speech all the story, said Mr. Gingrich, asked on the radio-emission "The Takeaway".
The former election, considered by some as a candidate possible to the Republical Investment for the Presidential election of 2012, was pleased to have seen "one-left President" to remind members of the Nobel Committee "went they be free and could not make a peace price if the use of the force does not exist."
For Michael Gerson, the old rain of George W. Bush revealed chronic in Washington Post, Mr. Obama spoke "a very American talk".
Moreover to present in "citoyens of the world" as "he always does", "he spoke as a President of the United States," recalling the Europeans "to live in a security bullet that they didn't create and that they do no great thing for keeping it," said Mr. Gerson.
Ambassador John Bolton has qualified the words of "terre, impulsed and without inspiration" on the National Review website.
On the left of the President, the Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich was warned to see Barack Obama to justify the use of force.
When war is made in the notion of justice, it is easily possible to justify the mass of innocents, he has been observed.
However, the pressure of the center-gauch was eligible on the place of the President.
The Los Angeles Times continued to think that Nobel was prematurely admitted to Mr Obama, has qualified its appeal of "super production" even for a speaker known for his talent.
Oslo's talking should serve a road sheet to guide international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression, has been burned with the Californian daily.
Mr. Obama, "ha proclaimed the talking to it," signed the New York Times, judged "to shadow and enhanced."
Routes: Three marathons for a agreement that saves Christ’s appeals
Following three negotiations-marathon trade unions, the Road Sectors and TLF, only the patronal organization to be left until the end, have come on Friday evening to a agreement that ends the word of order and threats that despite the appointment of Noël.
During the Friday signing meeting, the secretariat of State to Transport, Dominican Bussereau, was "joy" of this agreement, after several meetings of negotiations, held on Friday morning.
Following a second night of discussion, the negotiators were left on Friday morning, hoped to sign the text of agreement quickly at the end of early.
And even if three patronal organizations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) were closed the door.
But more than six hours of a meeting started at 11:00 to make everyone agreed and to be signed at 18H00 the text.
The conflict would be very prejudiced for enterprises, "and he was to fear that he was coming to perturb the end of years", said Mr. Bussereau.
The text provides an increase in salary of 4 per cent for the lowerest salary (for local and regional road transport), and 2.9 per cent for the highest ( international transport).
In a time period, for low-sallars " EUR 8,72 to 9.06.
It's not a great thing, but we are far away, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Whether we're going to order our warrants that there's no blocks, no blocks of the centres of ravitalization.
But we can always have some calculating ones that are not content, he added.
Phile Grillot, President of TLF, welcomed " a good agreement", even if it was "effective to conceal the increases on high salary in account of international competition".
According to him, the increases will be from the order of 170 per month for lower loans and from 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
This is the agreement of the good sense and respect of the employees, said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed "a historic agreement".
Richard Jaubert (CGT) said "a acceptable compromise".
The Agreement also provides the revaluation of 3% movement expenditures and the general status of road transport at the first half of 2010, which will include the issue of a 13th month and modernization of the collective convention.
Mr. Bussereau recalled that a decrease of 100 million euros of the patronal charges had made a Governmental amendment to the draft law of corrective finances for 2009, voted on Thursday night by the National Assembly on Friday.
The Government will ask the Senate to vote "in the same term."
The TLF's signing allows the agreement to apply first time to the undertakings attached to this organization, and in a second time, at all the profession, in the case of extension by the Minister of Labor.
It will be "for the shortest time," said Mr. Bussereau.
The opposition of patronal organizations can only delay the process.
FNTR has identified a "dupe brand", because the 100 million euros " had already been promised to the sector to compensate a part of carbon tax".
The Secretariat of Transport has forced us to negotiate in the emergency, not in the conclusion of a shared analysis, but to not contrary to the next survey managers, the Unostra has deployed.
For the other, the agreement may "count the tomb of? a very large number of PMs in the sector in the next 12 months".
RER A: perturbations this weekend, mixed syndicats of the proposals of the RATP
The RER A, the largest urban transport line in France, will continue during the weekend, while a Friday meeting on the 2nd day of the RER and the direction of the RATP has left them on their famine for their first request.
Saturday and Sunday, for this important weekend before Christ, there will be only trains between 10H00 and 20H00, because of a train on two on the central trip (in between La Defense and Nation) and a train on four outside the central trip.
The connection with the SNCF will be suspended in Nanterre Prefecture, which will require travellers to change train.
The Lafayette Galeries, waiting for 200,000 customers every day, rejoiced because "the RATP makes efforts to serve the great stores."
The RER through the west is the Paris Agglomation.
Saint-German-en-Laye and Nanterre in Boissy-Saint-Leger and Marne-La-Vallée.
Friday, about a train on two swimming around at the point hours, and almost not wheat in green hours, as provided.
As Thursday, there was no cooking on the cows, the French were being organized.
Thus at the small morning, Saint-Germanin-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less frequent than ordinary, including the fact that there was no college and lycéens.
In Boissy-Saint-Leger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, 29-year-old, explicitly was raised "a thirty-year early, to be sure to arrive at the time."
Saint-Lazare had not known saturation, the SNCF, which had planned a headquarter of agents and forces of order.
RER A operated by the SNCF in provenance or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or went from Saint-Lazare to join the metros.
New general meetings of guests will be held on Saturday and Sunday, which will consider the results, judging "maigre" by unions, a meeting with the Friday direction after summer.
The Director of the RER proposed to negotiate a specific protocol for RER A on all aspects, work time, carrier deployment, etc.
This is not what the leaders want, which claims a lower premium, according to Thierry Garon (Sud).
The RATP also sets its first proposals between parentheses, signed the CGT, noting that the direction was "not to address a problem while at the roads and SNCF is done."
A new meeting is planned on Monday for "a broader review of the terms of occupation", the RATP stated.
What has done as well to the unions that the company was "moving users from the week-end".
At the morning, some 150 leaders had entailed a establishment committee at Paris.
This is how the direction, which rejected all the discussion during the breast, had suggested "for a deployment matter" the meeting.
Conflict threatens to extend the RER B on Tuesday, after the delay of a prejudice by Unsa and Independents.
The syndicats require a price of 120 euros (Unsa) to 150 euros of EUR variables (CGT, FO, CFDT, Southern, Independents) and are degrading the working conditions on this line to the daily millions of travelers.
RER's leaders, all in the second part of the carrier, touched from 2.200 to 2.700 euros and 600-650 euros of primes for decayed hours, daily and feast days.
Turkish justice disappears the pro-cased parties, far-related decision of consequences
The Turkish Constitutional Court proceeded on Friday the dissolution of the main pro-cured party of the country, a decision which has been immediately followed by manifestations of anger in the Kurd community, the south-west of the country and Istanbul.
This decision is likely to comply with the task of the Government, which is being handed on the course of the current community to try to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for Democratic Society (DTP) was dismissed because it was a "profit of prejudice to State independence and its indivisible unity," said the presidency of the Chairman of the Hasim Church, in terms of four days of delimitation.
The decision was taken together with 11 judges, while a qualified majority of seven votes was required to proclaim the dissolution, Mr. Kiliç said that 37 of the parties frameworks, including his President Ahmet Turkk and the President of Aysel Tugluk, are banning the political life for a period of five years.
The judge also announced the resurrection of the parliamentary immunity of Mr. Turkk and Ms. Tugluk and the confidence of the Treasury of the goods of the party.
The DTP has 21 seats to Parliament (approximately 550).
His leaders had prevailed before the deputy that the deputys would leave Parliament rather than sit as parliamentary without label.
The decision pursuant to a procedure launched in 2007 by the Prosecutor of the Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya Court, which granted the DTP to obey the 'directs' of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many countries.
A number of observers believe that the DTP is the legal political vitrine of the PKK rebels.
However, the party assures that there is no organic links with the PKK but refused to qualify the terrorist organization and calls the Government to negotiate with him.
The Court's deputy interviews while the Government is being able to throw his hand to the Kurd community by proposing a series of measures enhanced its rights, to try to support the PKK and end the conflict.
The DTP leaders stated that a dissolution could lead to a recrutation of tensions in the South-East-Anatolyn, where many manifestations against the conditions of detention of the Chief of the PK Abdullah Öcalan were dismissed in warming with the police in the past few weeks.
Since the announcement of justice, thousands of manifestators were gathered to the locals of the DTP in Diyarbakir, the large city of the south is in majority of Kurdes.
The forces of the order have thrown lacrymogenes and used water canons, while demonstrators launched molotov cocktails or stones, with frozens.
A hundreds of people also appeared in Istanbul.
After the spectrum, Mr. Turkk stated that the decision of the Justice would "approve the disappearance."
Turkey cannot solve this issue (kurde, ndlr) by prohibiting a party, said he at the press.
The Government, formed by a party under the Islamist movement, also deployed the decision.
We are opposed by principle to the closement of the parties.
This is nothing solved, said the Minister of Energy Taner Yaliz.
This decision is a total torpillage of the democratic opening launched by the Government, commented the Ahmet Insel political analyst.
Of course, it is possible to be added to a PKK reaction.
Thursday, the PKK returned a attack that had killed seven soldiers three days early in the north of Turkey, one of the most murderers of the last months.
The first snows can fall
What Wolfgang Brauburger wants, is a well-related hiver.
But the responsibility of the service of deployment and road deployment (FES) provides that it is not to embrace citizens.
It's just so that agents could test the vehicle technology and learn them well.
And according to the meteologs, it might be for this week end.
More than 300 agents and 120 vehicles are ready to touch the snow and glass.
The EESF follows a very developed plan here.
Mr. Brauburger explains that since it was to deny on the city of Francfort and that the temperatures are descending down under the grain, the large railway vehicles are 20 main spins (Itlandic names A) .
This includes large movement roads, main arts, such as the New Route and Hanauer Landstraße.
It also includes pompary access, common transport engineers, pioneer areas and roads like Atzelbergstraße.
The EES agents start their service at 3:00 a.m. morning.
If necessary, 1040 kilometres of neighbouring must be flourned with a wheel funder that adds well at 3 hours of time.
This is why the EES service starts at 3:00 a.m. to decrease roads when it begins the traffic of journal migrations.
There or it becomes more difficult, it's when the snow starts to fall at 7:30.
This poses problems, tells us the responsibility of the deployment and saving roads "for no car rental vehicles is ready to leave the vehicles".
Then, if it is no longer, we are concerned about access roads and roads of disappearance, such as Council-Beil-Straße.
Second paths and bilateral roads are finally coming.
Mr. Brauburger knows that this is still a few complaints.
To 5:00 a.m. the EESF Pedestre team is running to decline the dangerous areas and transitions.
With regard to cyclable tracks, the EES services can usually not be occupied.
Mr. Brauburger states that there is a special service in Francfort to monitor the state of the ponts between 22 and 4:30.
As the glass is very quickly formed on these surfaces, salt vehicles are interfered since temperature descends below 2 degrees.
It also happens that the police calls for this special service if necessary.
Dinosaure beverage
The Tawa found a look like the other fleshy dinosaries: this bike measured approximately 2 metres of long for 1,50m of high, his next members were powerful, his allonged crown was along with acquired and recovered depths, his short arms ended by guns and had a long depth.
If this species had lived a few million years later, it would have nothing exceptional.
But as Sertling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and its colleagues in the Thursday Science magazine, Tawa found is one of the first dinosaries containing these morphological characteristics.
This animal lived 215 million years ago in the New Mexico, which had been part of the overcontinent lands, Pangee and was present to the ecuator.
Sertling Nesbitt says that the Tuwa's revealed new day the evolution of the first dinosaries.
In fact, it refers to the parental links, the distribution and the characteristics of the latter.
In 2006, Sertling Nesbitt entered flights in the company of other Palestologues on the Gohst Ranch site north of the New Mexico
Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History of Utah and a member of the Flood Team tells them that he was sometimes to find a thirteen of obstainings in a day, which is absolutely unique for a seditional breakfast dating the Trias.
Scientists were very quickly noted that a part of these osses was of a new species.
The flowers updated the remaining five specimens.
An discovery that confirms theories on the starting of dinosaur evolution.
Researchers were baptized by the name of Tawa according to the word of Hopi's Indians for the God of the sun.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an exclusively discovery: Trias’s dinosaries flowers are extremely rare and limited to some fragments of incomplete oils.
All experts in Palestineology do not share this enthusiasm.
For example, Martin Sander of the University of Bonn does not find that this discovery is particularly spectacular, but it provides it to confirm some theories concerning the starts of the dinosaries evolution.
According to the current state of knowledge, the dinosaries appear on the earth about 230 million years ago.
However, most of the elderly fossils are fragmented and incomplete, which makes very difficult classification of all first dinosaries.
The experts are requested among others at which time the saurians were divided in three major groups of development: theopodes (carnivors) who include therriness and the vegetables appeared later and which descend from the birds, the sauropodes, the long couch, and those that are apparent and the ornittic herbs, which are part of the species such as the turtapits and the stegosaure.
According to S. Nesbitt’s studies and colleagues, Tawa is one of the first theopodes .
This species presents a interesting report of characteristics at the first and developed time, said Mr. Nesbitt.
The researchers found indices that let me think that Tawa found a small aircraft in his bones, as well as the birds descending from the teropodes.
These small air pushes facilitate the respiration of birds relating to mammifères.
It seems that in the Tawa, the greeners were also partly filled with air.
According to Randall Irmis, Tawa is one of the elders theopods with small air bags in his bones.
As the appearance of Sauropodes' largenesses also had air bags and light ossature, they may be thinking that their common angle was already available for this good innovation.
Three follow-up migration steps to North America.
As the most primitive dinosaries lived in South America, the researchers concluded that the Saurians appeared there.
Thus, the three large evolution legends were divided and divided from South America to the rest of the world is to say all the land that forms the supercontinent Pangee.
This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the Palestinian team has also discovered the remaining of two other therapies that are not particularly visible to him.
Three species cannot descend from a common age that would have been mixed, advanced researchers.
Alan Turner of the Museum of Natural History of New York and Coauteur of the News Science Students said that there would be at least three migration vags to North America.
A few contradictions have been heard.
Martin Sander, a Palestine in Bonn says there is an elderly species, the silene, living in the current Poland and belonging to a group appeared to dinosaries.
According to this, it could give an erroneous vision because there is a large number of dinosaur fuels in South America which have been reserved while there is not practically any of other continents.
In the same way, how dinosaries have come to become the dominant tetrapodes of the secondary age while they proved from a relatively rarely collateral line of the race of the reptiles, there is still a mystery today.
At the time of the Trias, the dinosaries shared their habitation with many other reptiles, such as the anticipation of current crocodiles and many other saurians.
To the end of the Trias, the dinosaries were divided on the whole planet, which promotes the development of many kinds of new species, while others, which were evident, dinosaries disappeared between the Trias and the Juristic.
However, such success is not forever.
To explain this transformation, Martin Sander sees two hypotheses.
There could be a massive extinction to which the dinosaries had overcome alphasis while other reptiles had been lost.
Or then, the dinosaries were better adapted and they could therefore eliminate the competition on the field.
Anyway, such success is not forever.
150 million years later, the fall of a favoristic meteory enhancement of an animal group that was also developed during the Trias, which since that time was slightly in the shadow: it was mammifers.
Vienna Solidarity in Sao Paulo
The list is long and there are signatories of the whole world.
There are those professors of the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California.
There are these courses of the University of Naples, Quebec, Edimbourg, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Brussels.
The evacuation by the police of the Casino University of J.W. Goethe de Francfort makes vagues over the whole planet.
278 teachers and teachers of the University of J.W. Goethe, but also other higher educational institutions in Germany, Europe and North America and South America expressed their solidarity with the protestants of Campus Westend.
In a German statement and in English, they condemn the intervention of the police claimed by the Governor Committee of University.
Last week, the President of the University of Werner Muller-Estler had evacuated the buildings occupied by students and teachers in the grève after the walls and art works were barboushed by graphics.
Five students were blessed during the evacuation.
The signatory judges that degradation did not justify "such violent intervention from the police command against students and teachers who organized their own courses".
The evacuation represents an "unacceptable expected" to the freedom of research and education.
The fact of focusing exclusively on the acts of vandalism is only to "delegate and criminalize protestation" and attempt to forget the reasons of mobilization.
The Governing Committee of the University was thus subject to discussions that would still be essential.
The course charges require immediately imprisonmented criminal prosecutors.
Most employees did not participate in degradations.
Protecting law
The Greeks of the Services Sector and the German Criminal Confederation (DGB) show the solidary students.
The protests are only the legitimate expression of a growing concern for our own future, said Alexander Klein, regional secretariat of youths of the Green Syndicat.
With regard to the Minister of Sciences of Hesse Eva Kohne-Hörmann (CDU), she took and caused the action undertaken by the Chairman of University and Police.
We appreciate the President of the University.
Any degradation and degradation of places is completely acceptable, said she to the Regional Parliament in Wiesbaden last Thursday at the current time emission.
We understand the sense of protestation, but we do not accept the Vandalism, expressed the CDU parliament of the Regional Parliament Peter Beuth.
The parliamentary groups of SPD opposition, Verts and Gauche (the left) did not share this opinion.
The CSU takes the pretext of some peinturned walls to criminalize protestation, Janine Wissler of the party La Gauche (Linke)
Instead of reflecting student arguments and refunds, they are evacuated.
The Party La Gauche presented a motion that was subject to the Minister of Interior to submit a report on the conditions of police intervention.
New Silicon-valley
During a long time, she was secret city reputation, prohibited the Western visitors.
Lahanograd, one of the ten districts of Moscow, was under the soviet regime a secret searching place, under strict monitoring.
Today with its 216,000 inhabitants from the Moscow centre, the community has the reputation to be the Soviet Silicon Valley.
It is in places of production and research in micro- and nano-electronics.
Since September 2008, the representatives of Shanghaiograd created links with Riedberg, French science place – with university institutions and the innovation centre of Francfort (FIZ).
There were re-ciprocing and middle meetings from the representatives of Nicolograd and Riedberg ratified a “Etroite Cooperation Protocol”.
The signatories were the Vice-Minister of Moscow Juri Rosljak and the Prefit Anatoly Smimov de Eugeneograd for the Russian delegation, Edwin Black Chair of Project Section for Francfort.
In 2010 the representatives of the FIZ and the SMEs, with the strong scientific research, will go to Ontograd for a seminary.
Academic Science
This is a sustainable scientific exchange.
But also economic relations.
It will allow the FIZ companies to enter into the Russian market in full expansion.
In turn, Russian scientific societys want to obtain contracts in Germany.
Kenzograd is the seat of famous Soviet Research institutions and companies.
The Institute of the Electrotechnical of Moscow, the large Sitronics and Rossijskaja-Electronics.
The community was founded in 1958 as "planed socialist violence" for arms research.
Lakeograd (Literature Traduction "Green") gives its name of the collars bound in the heart of which the research centres are imposed.
The S21 project: a free for Stuttgart
It is not sufficiently high in the scale of the Stuttgart 21 project.
For its partners, this is nothing less than "new heart of Europe".
If you want it. S21, it's more than the flowing of a railway railway, more than a colossal construction project that will extend the heart of the Bade-Wurtemberg capital, in a chaos unexpected of cantors for a ten-year-old chaos.
Stuttgart 21 is born from the wind of the 80s.
The heads of the lines, with full city roads, had the reputation at the time to be the relations of the transport technology of the XIX century that had the effect of sabot of the modern rail traffic because there was a lot of time to take the places back to the front.
Arrival, stop short, go - that's what you need to do.
That's why the heads of the line must disappear: in Francfort and Munich.
And in Stuttgart also: a train past railway, which is in mid-chemin around the Trans-European Magistrale of the Trans-European Rail between Paris and Budapest / Bratislava from where the slogan "Europe's coast".
The achievement of the S21 project will really begin, although the 80-year-old visions are not conform to reality for a long time.
Even the most ambitious planningers recognized that the cost, in order to foster the rise in the respective capitals of Hesse and Bavière, was exorbiting.
Actually, the heads of the line are not more really able to make income and exit problems since there are modern trains, turnable with authors and car-pilots to the two extremities.
However, the achievement of Stuttgart 21 is now launched by the new inter-city line to Ulm.
Regional and common policies have taken it.
The railway company is part because it is the contribution to the risk costs of the largest infrastructure project of the Federal Republic and not the public company.
This project is relatively fair to urbanism.
We get a urban space that – if you believe the graphics of computer planning plannings – it will be very green.
The S21 S21 system is required.
The past race and expandment of the section are designed for a trafficking of people to whom it was assigned - and it is typical in the 1980s - a huge growth.
At the same time there was no good market competition yet.
Modern traffic policy should first focus on the strengthening of goods traffic as rail transport is much more respect for the environment than by road traffic.
But the new treatment, with its objections, does not match goods trains.
S21, and it is much more serious about indirectly well of other rail projects.
For example, six billion euros will be incorporated in the sub-project.
It's the official number.
Experts think that 10 to 15 billion are more realistic.
One thing is sure, in the next decade this money will lack for other switching and ingorgement points in the network.
The list of the Department of Transport mentioned in the sixty large projects.
One of the most important is the expanding of the section through the Rhin Valley of 180 good kilometres.
Since 1987, this line is built at the rallenti.
It would really be urgent to support here based on the campaignon.
But the S21 project is the effect of a liberality sabot.
The Rhin Valley's Ironics is in a way to become the globe of the extinction of the traffic of international goods, and it is in full heart of Europe.
The Government considers the judgement made on the airport
In the Regional Parliament of Wiesbaden, the Government of the country has expressed the opportunity to call for the Court of Administrative Court of Hesse on the prohibition of night air flights.
The Minister of Economy Dieter Posch (FDP) announced that the CDU/FDP coalition had been responsible for experts to consider the legal view point of the judgement provided by the Administrative Court and which is a document containing more than 400 pages.
The Court of Kassel had justified in a written document that the country should adapt the regulation on the prohibition of flights in the case or the draft construction of the north-west aircraft of Francfort airport would be achieved.
The authorisation for 17 aircrafts between 23 and 5 p.m. is not compatible with the legal protection of citizens against night aircraft.
The coalition should be decided on 4 January if it wishes to make a provision against the sentence.
The critical opposition of this time and attempts to press on the representative of the Government to make the provision to the Federal Administrative Court of Leipzig.
The SPD Parliamentary Group SPD Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel invites the CDU and the FDP to return to their promise made before the elections and that consists of prohibiting the flights. However, this will be shared as a total lack to a given word.
It is very difficult to be authorised to hold his word, said the Head of the Verts Tarek Al-Wazir by encouraging the FDP Slogan "We hold our promises."
The Minister Dieter Posch rebukes Schäfer-Gümbel' reply that the Government of the country is trying to authorize even night flights using "avocary and roublardises".
It is needed time to carry out a specific legal review.
Coalition does not wish to decide on the basis of a "premised fast impression".
The decision must be legally reliable, says Stefan Müller (FDP).
The interpretation of the opposition concerning the statements of his fraction on the prohibition of flights is completely erosioned.
US banks reimbursed aid
The large American banks, which are very touched by the crisis, are deprived from their related links from the State.
The Bank of America announced that it had fully paid $45 billion (more than 30 billion) in euro aid granted under the Tarp Saving Plan.
The CNBC American television chain informed the report that Citigroup was also intended to reimburse the aid received.
Business institutions seek to disappear imposed restrictions, which meet the acceptation of the amounts, such as the limitation of goods granted to leaders and the higher cost regulation.
The Bank of America launched a capital increase by the sale of titles to investors who reported to him $19 billion cost money.
The rest of the sum comes from the bank that are well filled with the sale of several branches of other sectors.
Wednesday last night, Kenneth Lewis, the Director-General of the Bank of America, expressly thanked the US contributions: the capital injection has significantly helped overcome a difficult period.
The bank Institute had presumed its capacity by acquiring the Märrill Lynch Investment Bank to the most stronger than the financial tourism.
The Citigroup also plans to provide money on financial markets to liberate the State's entirety.
The American Bank could therefore start a capital increase in $20 billion since Thursday, reported the CNBC chain on banking environments.
The Citigroup port would not wish to comment this information.
In June, the Goldman Sachs banks, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley were reimbursed by the public funds they benefited.
Accelerated selection
Finally everything happened even faster than planned.
On the occasion of two weeks after the active movement of the Chief Nikolaus Brender Chain of the German Chain, the Successor is already appointed.
The Committee wished to vote last night to carry out the appointment.
Peter Frey, who guides the Berlinian ZDF's editation was the great favorite.
However, the chain didn't want to confirm - officially - the vote so that it would not prejudice the procedure.
However, it seems that there was also the intention of not to dismiss the expectation of the ZDF Markus Schächter in the case that the proposal would not be accepted by the Administration Council.
Frey, who is the Shotcher candidate, had needed the vote of 9 members of the Commission on 14.
The result of the vote was not yet known in the closure of the edit.
Two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed the Administration Council to extend the Nikolaus Brender contract for five years but it was rejected.
Only 7 members of the Council were stated favourable to Brender recovery and 7 others had voted against. Brender's Decree represented a cook that was a pre-visable for Schachter.
In fact, the CDU, which is major to the Administration Council, has already left to hear several weeks before the vote, would not wish to return Brender to its post.
It is Roland Koch, Minister President of the Hesse country, who had organized a link against the Chief Director.
He refused that the contract of the Headquarter's very estimated redactor should be extended by calling on the fact that the audit rate of the CDF information emissions was lowered under Brender.
This is why protests still have been done, almost to the vote, enhanced the growing political influence on the GDF.
At the end, there were 35 experts in public law which were in the debate and who believed that the way of Koch was anti-constitutional.
But that wouldn't serve anything.
Peter Frey: Who is he?
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied political sciences, pedagoggie and Roman languages (Spañol).
He then worked in South Westfunk (Renania-Palatinat radioorganization) and Frankfurter Rundview (German National Port) and the German.
In 1983, he became director in the ZDF first in the newspaper magazine "heute-day" (aujourd day).
Then it continued: from 1988 to 1990, he was added to the editor-en-chef of time; then corresponding to Washington in 1991/1992, then and until 1998, he was head of the "Morgenmagazins" (emission of bimenual information presented in the morning); until 2001 he was responsible for the foreign policy service of the ZDF and then head of the Belarusian repair.
After the disgrace of Brender, when he was just elected to be a journalist of the year by the specialized Medium Magazin, the Verts announced that they would submit a constitutional complaint.
The adversary of Koch to the Administration Council, Minister President of Rhenania-Palatinat Kurt Beck, said last week that the countries should transform the Intergovernmental Treaty to ensure that the proposals for insuring personnel could not be blocked by a partial political majority.
Nevertheless, Beck is not intended to request the rest of the political persons members of the CZF monitoring committees.
Peter Frey, the probable successor of Brender had desperately managed to the Administration Council by criticaling the Committee with the vegetation in its Brender's decision.
With this journalistic independence, Schächter was able to propose it for the director-in-chef position without losing the face, so that the Administration Council could eligible it, without soubting to place a political party.
In the side-representations, Frey is classified to the left.
Great cleaning in university studies
Particular success for students: after a year of educational educational training Ministers of Education and Cultural Affairs in the countries decided to demonstrate more coherents: in a meeting between the Ministers and Delegates of the Conference of Records, an agreement has been established on the point that the conditions of work of students of Bachelor and Master should be improved.
For the future, students should be able to come at the end of their studies.
In particular, they have agreed to address the weight of the reviews: a unique review must be able to close the chosen study module.
Furthermore, the work load should be recalled to ensure " realistic and acceptable proportions".
Political authorities and higher education institutions wish to facilitate the recognition of universities and foreign reviews.
In addition, the countries are forced to organise more flexible structural requirements for Bachelor and Master's Bachelor's campaigns.
At the regional level, there should be no regulation different from a country to the other.
Reviews
Since the beginning of the studying protests in the last June, the Ministers of Education and University Records have the expression to "studibility" mode.
But for the first time, this expression seems to take a concrete significance.
The accreditation Board decided to reduce considerablely the number of reviews: "Each module must usually be able to be concluded by a unique review," may be read in a document of a thirty pages on future admission conditions to university cycles.
Reinhold Grimm, Chairman of the Advertising Council, said that by reducing the delay of reviews, it should be possible to stop the delays, which significantly affected the studyability.
The "studibility" should be the decision-making criteria of the study organization.
The modules as the foundation must be examined so much to see if you can't avoid this sense of awareness that you are often feeling in the course selection.
Hamburg / Berlin - According to the latest knowledge in RAID about Kunduz, the opposition believes that the Minister of Defense Karl-Theodor to Goodtenberg (CSU) is a crime of delivered trumpet.
Students should "ve the opportunity and maintenance margin needed to allow and foster personal initiative."
The new regulation will relate to access to new university cycles but will also be adapted to existing cycles.
These cycles must be "accredited" every five years, but it means that it is only in 2015 that all cycles will be reviewed.
There are 10 competent accreditation agencies in all the Federal Territory, depending on appreciation advised by countries.
In October, the Ministers of Education had made a certain pressure on countries to seek agents to ensure that programmes were not too charged and that the review regime was not too close.
In some countries, universities and high-specialized schools have already been heard with their regional departments to take appropriate measures.
Rhenania-Palatinat is the only country that has given its agreement to grant more means for the development of the Bologna process.
With these funds, universities should organize tutorial programmes and strengthen pedagogic orientation offices and review offices and international relations.
The countries and universities provide a budget of 10 million euros.
On the beginning of 2010, the Government wishes to submit to Parliament a amendment to the Supreme Education Act.
Following this, there will be no longer one review to close its studies.
Research organization should be more flexible, and the recognition of notes of other higher education institutions and access to Master must be simplified.
To this end of the next year, the "studibility" of all university cycles will be considered.
Thursday last, the Government and opposition again discussed the issue of the conditions of study in the country.
The decisions have been evaluated but criticisms have been heard.
The Federal Chairman of the University of Socialists has stated that he would wish that the organization of educational policy no longer takes place in the future "after the closed doors" of the Ministers and Ministers of Universities.
At the latest after educational gap, students as interested persons should be able to express a little explanation.
The future of the higher education has been received the support of the President of the Delegates of the Conference of Records (HRK) Margret Wintermantel: "The experience of students is very useful" said she in meeting with the Ministers of Education of countries with which HRK works on a common reform project.
For the syndicat of education and science (GEW) the decisions taken in Bonn will not be far enough. It calls on the right and opportunity for each Bachelor diplomed to include a Master cycle.
Andreas Keller member of the GESW Directorate Committee also requests that countries provide Bachelor students today, tomorrow, there will be enough places for Master studies and the conditions of study as well as possible.
Thus, the countries must make more course charges.
Nevertheless, the Ministers of Education did not express the possibility of access to Master.
More than a low page note on Herta Müller
This is by these words "Arivé in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control..." which begins a work of the Werner Söllner poety, in which he has thematised in bold letters, the experiences of a disident occurred in Germany who gained liberty but at the same time lost his language territory.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat in Romania, was first teacher of German and English in Bucarest and, afterward, a collection director in a young manager's edition house before being installed in Francfort on the Main.
Söllner received several litterary prices; in 1993, he had the very conviviction of the Goethe University of Francfort and since 2002 he was the Hesse literature Forum at the Artist house of Mousursm in Francfort.
He made a lot of him in non-literator cycles last Tuesday, at a congress in Munich, whose theme was "The German literature in Romania in the middle and the mirror of your dossiers Securitate".
Söllner apparently detached and disabilized, made a statement in which he was recognized before his colleagues of German-Rouges, such as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Womendorfer, who had cooperated as an informant for the Political Security Policy.
Söllner received the German price in 1989 together with some of the participants.
The tests were inadequately started in 1971.
I am, Söllner concludes: “Therefore someone who has not sufficiently resolved its intimidation tests.”
The Worner Söllner poetite is Walter Informer.
At the same time with the honor of the Nobel price for Herta Müller and its former literary disasters with the mechanisms of the dictatorship power, the literary scene is expanded and particularly the community of German authors originating in Romania, in a case which clearly shows the abismos and the base of a political system based on police monitoring and implantation.
Werner Söllner is, as soon as you can say according to the current knowledge, not only criminal but also victim.
In his own folder Secure, IM Walter played a role, ensuring Michael Markel literature specialist after the confession of Söllner and returned to the positive influence of IM Walter who had interacted in his favour.
"He could throw it out of all the difficult situations at the time," said Markel.
Markel felt the moral need to make this comment.
The form in which Söllner made its statement and before this public was expected, however, having an old disident of his cooperation with the Roman secret services is not really so surprising.
Germany has already written Herta Müller in July in the magazine “The Time” after reading the 914 pages of his own folder.
It may be supposed that the victims will have speculations and sometimes have proved what real names the names of Sorin, Vicu and Walter were recently covered.
On the contrary to Germany where the consultation of the maps of the Stasi is a reliable process, the attitude of the inherent of the security folders is still very confused.
A systematic clarification has been stopped against and released in the past years.
It is only in 1999 that a national advice with the Birthler Institute was created to work in the simulation of the CRSAS archives, but the refund of the dossiers has been overcome.
Since 2005, there is a law defined by the management of the archives.
That the influence of old members of the Security in Romania is still very large, it is confirmed by the interview of an elderly responsible for the Safety of Temesvar, which, after the advertisement of the Nobel price to Herta Müller, expressed a tremendous delayable towards the laureate.
She had a psychosis, and finally we asked her only once.
The infamy of the power thought it could express himself here, without any genius, under the cover of the freedom of expression.
Of course, unlawful questions are linked in the case of Söllner as it happens as often in a hidden fault.
Why now? Who has been spolled? The reaction made by hearers at Söllner's audience hopes that after this chapter will be defined more by a soup to know that by accusations and feelings of shame.
On the geness of the work of Herta Müller, who has received the Nobel price here, is more than one low page note.
Tumultes at League Champions
There was an impression that a representative had arrived there, threw to four balls that had all right from a day of Christ Sympa, on which the producer of sports articles had stolen its goods when the new VFB Christian Gross trained at least the quarter in a Mercedes class C, which he just came to call, an orange plastic sac of the supplier's hand.
The man, whose cold clothing had taken attention, was led to lead to the city who was still foreign.
Otherwise our fifteenth year would be able to take the flight itself – he didn't drink alcohol and he wasn't any luck anymore.
He had been a nice evening, but tomorrow he had to take the work.
Because now it was going to start.
The words of the Switzerland that three days early were clear: “We have reached the eighth end” is to say in the bond of fields through our 3:1 against Unirea Urziceni of Romania, but we do not have to let us rise by the success. This will be a brutal fight to not retain."
The "growth work" is waiting for us tomorrow.
There, it is to reply to Mainz the results of the bond of the daily fields.
And we need to overcome the weaknesses that reflected the surface after the three expert objectives of Marica (5.), Turkish (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.)
Title of the type
The eighth end of the Champions League (match to 16./17. + 23./24 Feb/February return 9./10. + 16./17. March) will be held on December 18 to Nyon.
The joy of the opening function of the Successor of Babbel was therefore modified.
And the joy was not only moderated at the one who had a chance, who had transmitted to the professionals of Stuttgart detained, an unfair motivation and pleasure to play.
I was seeing the players and I told them that they should focus on their attractions, I consulted them to be more comfortable, explaining the "polombier of souls" – Gress - the receipt of the success that sounded so well that hadn't done any effects with the Master Babbel.
He discovered a certain magie, aoua Jens Lehmann-partisan of Babbel - "On the foot when a new impulsion is sometimes happening things that we would never have believed it."
And Sami Khedira, who, after weeks of pause for wound, turned to the root of the best player through his dynamism, tried to describe the "phenomenon" founded by a "frais wind" and the working method of the new chief: "It's someone who passes to the action and requires discipline.
That's what we need in the current situation."
But obviously Babble had missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart has not yet passed the head, keeping the Horst Heldt manager
For the moment, VfB Stuttgart needs especially trend.
As Gress, the players and manager keep survey the victoire against totally overfit and defended Roman invitations.
They also gained in Glasgow before four days later had a bad wake in Leverkusen with 0:4, objected Khedira.
Horst Heldt, manager, reported that they had well reached one of the targets of the season but there were others who were still far away.
We haven't gone yet.
That Heldt's day of his 40th anniversary had not the heart to make the feast, even after the first home winner since three months, is from the events of the weekend that a television of the buts Lehmann garden interview just before the start of the game.
There are decisions that others take and not Jens would be contrary to Heldt, in response to Lehmann's surrounding crisis.
He accused the direction of slowness of style and said that she decided to change training under pressure of puberary fans.
Lehmann was also judged as a sign of lack of sovereignty and jalousy that his day of free after the matches was deleted.
The statements of Lehmann were “signed by a clean ecoïsm”, he focused Heldt and announced the consequences for the warrant.
They don't have to be friends for life for these two quarters.
In all cases, they were agreed to all the rest, that without the pre-related work of the group, the strong representation of sports and fighting would not be possible.
Babble and his assistants were "for a greater part in the success" returned Heldt and Lehmann in crowd – and even the man in the Water bag.
World weight Championship
Heat fight in Bernee: Kevin Johnson's challenge caused a verbal and gradually the Vitali Clitschko world campaign.
But after 12 hard rounds, Ukraine defends its title of the world's hard weight as follows the WBC version.
On the onenimity of judges, it is imposed to the points.
Hamburg – Vitali Klitschko maintains its title of the world's lower weight campaign.
The WBC Federation announced that in Saturday, the 38-year campaign had brought a victory to the noise of judges against the American Kevin Johnson (120:10).
For the third time, Klitschko defends its title since its square road in October 2008.
Before the Ukrainian had already reported the title of the WBO and WBC world campaign.
Unfortunately he did not succeed the KO so much.
Klitschko, 39 times winner in 41 professional battlees, has advertised it twice because of woundings.
The challenge of Johnson has accepted its first debt at the 24th fight.
In the Berne Arena, before 17,000 showers, the Great Clitschko has especially decided to say the fight, from the top of its 2,02 metres, by its left.
Johnson, of a ten centimeter smaller that, before the dual, had announced the end of the Klitschko sea, successfully avoiding the clamps of the campaign, and thus began Klitschko to enter into the game against the degrading right.
Johnson, too passive to a challenge, has particularly tried to go through the rounds.
Although he continued to provoke Clitschko in words and in his hands, it's only very rarely the campaign.
Even though he was the second boxer after Timo Hoffman in 2000, he overlap the distance of the 12 rounds with Kllitschko.
The challenge had done a lot of noise in the Swiss capital before the fight.
He denied Clitschko the trafficking of “zombie vilain” that is not really capable.
During the weed of Friday, the campaign couldn't prevent Johnson to provoke him to fall his sunlight moon “to see his eyes.”
Fourth victory from Klatschko's comback.
Klitschko was again imposed at its fourth fight since its first time of October 11, 2008
After an approximately four years, he shot Samuel Peter's nest at the time and received "sa" wBC ceinture that he had to first leave without fight.
This year, defending its name of champion, he refers to the fight against Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba and in September against Chris Arreola of the United States.
"I just took a bit in this fight and I'm perfectly", said Klatschko to explain its rapid return on the ring.
Its reality is to try to meet the four most important titles in the family.
His brother Wladimir is a campaign of WBO and IBF.
But it's the British David Haye who, deployed the great Nikolai Walujew - 2,13 meters - in November, take the WBA ceinture.
That was, Haye had canceled a match against Vitali Klatschko, which had to be done in September.
It seems that his promotion society is intended to play this match at the Wembley stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
The front attack of the opposition: the head of the Verts Parliamentary Group, Jürgen Trittin, accused the Minister of Defence Guttenberg in the case of the Client Office.
The SPD and La Gauche (the Link) parties request the chance of explaining.
Hamburg/Berlin - After reviewing the latest information on the Kunduz Air attract, the opposition tried to the Minister of Defense Karl-Theodor to Goodtenberg (CSU) that some facts have been released.
The Minister intentionally "formed a contravergence" on the murder frappe of two-citernes in the last September, said Head of the Parliamentary Group of the Verts, Jürgen Trittin, Saturday during the emission of information of the ARD "TagesView" chain of 20h.
Of course, that means he's lying.
The order of killing was given to a total violation of the rules of the International Security Force (ISAF) security assistance force.
This is, in substance, the content of the report available by OTAN and read by Mr Guttenberg, said Trittin.
Friday last, according to new media revealments, the goal of lafrappe was actually, not to destroy flighted trains, but to eliminate two important Taliban leaders.
According to the OTAN investigation report, 142 persons were killed or wounded during the American Air attack which had been launched at the request of the German Colonel Goerg Small Commander of Client.
The Verts, SPD and Gauche asked on summer Angela Merkel (CDU), to speak in the shortest terms before the Federal Parliament and to reveal what Goodtenberg really knew about the incident.
Jürgen Trittin and its colleague of the Verts Renate Konast are the view that Ms. Angela Merkel must clearly say whether the targeted massacre strategy is part of the federal Government's policy, if the chance, the army and the information services have approved this new strategy.
The Government's speaker door rejects these criticisms.
The chance has not affected the Army ' s interventions in Afghanistan, he said.
Samedi, the voices were stronger to express suspicion on the real reasons for the reform of the Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and the State Secretary Peter Wichert, as was submitted by the Ministry.
According to the SPIEGEL magazine, the information they had sent to Goodtenberg on the attack of cyternes was correct and complete.
Officially, they would have dissumed the existence of the NATO report and have hidden the Minister's views.
In the environment of the two high officials, however, it is allowed to hear that they have informed the Ministry of Defence on the existence of several reports, including a document of two pages of the Small Colonel and a report of the military police.
The "Frankfurter Generaler Sonnday Zeitung" reports that Wichert would have requested intertemps in an email to clarify the facts.
Until now, there is no answer.
Samedi, the Ministry did not wish to comment these accuses and returned to the Federal Parliament's investigation Committee, which would be the following merced to bring light on the facts concerned.
The Dream Worlds
Some see, clear, images and hear voices that no one else can see or hear.
There is no only in psychic diseases, or under the effect of drugs, that the limits between imagination and reality are confused.
As these phenomenons appear during the sleep, it's all right.
When we are alone in our assemblies rooms, we can add us without entrance to dreams and the most foolest fantasies.
However, the one who, earned, makes the dream state experience, understands and sees things that others don't perceive, rapidly reputation in our Western world of being stuff or drugs, or at least be a original.
Such images and voices appear not only in psychic diseases or under drug effect.
It's our imagination that is caused: it's the same neutral activity that allows us to conceal houses, piece tables or write Romans, but sometimes imposes the limits between dream, fool and reality.
A conscious state, taking the form of a dream, can be presented in the most different forms, in the best cases it is called visions, the worse of the fool.
However, even though the deterior and effect distinguishes, the visions of the Hildegard of Bingen Mystics, the drug experiences of the Nouvel Age Carlos Castaneda, the second states of Chamans, psychoses and hallucinations are imputable to very similar processes.
There are hallucinations or disappearances when the balance, neuro-transmetrors of the brain - firstly dopamine, northernline, serotonin and acetylcholine - broken and that the interaction between the different parts of the brain is perturbed.
Complex hallucinations and dismissing thoughts are very often shown during a psyzphrean psychose.
The earthly attraction force has no longer power on the person.
Since antiquity, philosopouses and doctors have always been thinking about the relationship between fool and dream.
For Aristote, the hallucinations were a form of dreamed dream; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatrie, founded in 1861 "a great comparison between fool and dream," for Sigmund Freud the dream was even " a psychose with all irregularities, imaginations, disappearances and sensual illusions that compose".
We are in automne 2001 when Henning T becomes a person of a designed band.
His body is in two dimensions to criard colors.
Earth attraction has no longer power on it, it plans at the ground of the plastic.
He feels a bit.
After him the creatures of avenged devil, grimling, the mouth insanglate, showing the depths.
They pursuant him, giving him pieces with hard flavory bottles, throwing him against the walls, it feels painful in the whole body.
Thundering voices, evil ones, cry out of walls and radios.
It can no longer support these voices that insuchure and humble.
Henning T. rash two chambers of his steel chain, actually a bottle and angle on a plate set.
He goes up on a bathroom and passes the bottle around the couch.
He knows.
The bucket's detaching.
That's what you need to read, crying with the voices in a crowd to shoot the tympan.
Today Henning T. to 40 years, he lived six anguous psychosis, the last 2-year date, the first of almost 20 years.
It was depressed by the LSD.
The diagnostic: psychosous spizo-effective, paranoid, also is menaco-depressive, is taking medicines against depression, hands, spizophreen.
He learned to live with his disease, he married for three years.
During the psychose, I lived terrible fears and deep desires.
The illustrations are a cruel reality.
One percent of the population suffers at least once in his life of spizophreen; in psychiatric clinics, the most frequent disease after depression.
In a smozphreen crisis, the persons concerned can no longer make the difference between the internal world and the outside world, they are found in an excitation status, which make it possible to suffer alucinations, megalomany, relative fool or persecution.
It is very close to hear the voices – the voices that command, who comment or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not rare.
The person concerned cannot take the distinction between the interesting and the indicative, the brain can no longer filter the perturbator signs, the conscience is naked under the senses.
As the dream, psychose opens the eclips to a marriage of ideas and fantasies about the deepest beds of conscience.
The perception of the reality in the psychose is focused on the subject, according to professor Thomas Fuchs, Chief of Psychiatry of CHU of Heidelberg (General Psychiatric in University of Clinics) .
Spizophreen is in full centre of the situation, even with a meaning that it was covered.
At the same time he finds a passive role, it is like in a dream, surrounded by events and can't act on them actively.
That's why spozophreens often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated.
In general, they do not have the possibility of adapting reality, illusions are a cruel reality, wake up is excluded.
Make experience once in his life of a hallucination.
To the difference of the dream, according to Fuchs, "the senseral and space structure of the reality that has been achieved during psychosis, is fundamentally stored."
Those thoughts and delivery hallucinations are based on reality, the live alienation has occurred in a real framework.
Why does our brain do this kind of caprioles, it's always an enigm for the searchers.
Exceptional situations can lead each one to lose the perception of reality, according to Fuchs.
But only a small number of people will develop a psychosis.
It seems to be a genetic predisposition to spozophenia, but jumeal studies have shown that Genes are not the only decisive factors.
Researchers believe that the persons concerned present cerebral lesions.
It is supposed that the neuronal maturation of the brain is perturbed at a previous stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during the growth, it explains Fuchs.
But the remaining unexplicitly, it is how the nucleus of the neuronal system is produced and surrounded that it does not appear for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience may be a decline of psychosis, if there is no predisposition.
In the same way, hallucinogen drugs can spread psychosisms because they act on neurotransmittors.
When our brain is crazy.
What's crazy, he said to us, professor of psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that the psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take unreasonable medicines to disappear, while others buy strong drugs to sell it.
The pleasant or disagreement of illusions is often just a point of view.
Kasten gathered the reports on the hallucinations and the phenomenons of illusory images for ten years: the past year he published his results in a workshop called "The irreleal world in our head".
Hallucinations are well part of typical concomitant phenomena of psychosis, but also of a number of other pathologys.
Those psychological problems such as border or depression, but also migration, epilepsy, plaque sclerose, alzheimer disease or crâne traumatism.
It is surprising that in some circumstances, even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations.
The hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of fragments of memories that are usually inhibited.
They are forming when the brain zones that treat sensual perceptions are hyperactive or not sufficiently refreshed; when our brain is chaffed but also when there is no stimulation.
Drugs can solve this state as a cerebral lesion or a psychose.
But also lacks of stimulus, stress, chagrins of love or other exceptional mental states.
In recent studies, one third of the participants recognizes that they have made at least once in his life the experience of a hallucination.
In 2005 Sarah K. at 16 years, she lives a small city of Mecklembourg-Pameranie earlier and goes to the lycée.
A young girl's going to make it normally.
If there were no images and voices.
During the recreation, it comes that a young boy, missing, at the long hair of cattle, addressed his word.
When she answers her camarades look at her, it's surprised – no one else can see or hear that boy.
They think that young girl is a lunatic dream but Sarah K doesn't dream, she's sure.
She's enlightened, listening and seeing that boy all she can see and hear the girl sitting next to her on the bank.
It may even have its presence at the moment.
It's a nice feeling, she finds this young sympathy.
Are you crazy, she's asking you sometimes.
But she knows that this young man and the other visions are not real and that they're going to disappear again.
The night appearances are generally fearful.
Although visions are weak.
When it is in class, it comes that it can follow the course because the professor is just to present a new student in his eyes and ears while it is invisible for the others and that the professor is visiblely explaining equalitys in the table.
The night appearances are generally fearful.
When, in the darkness of his room, it is waiting for the sleep that happens too rarely and too later, it can not often do the distinction if it is cleared or dream already, if the images she sees, the grimping faces or the young girl with bloody rings on her arms and the legs are open or closed.
Let me quiet, she cries to these creatures.
She didn't talk to her parents or friends, but they would take it for a folk.
Automatically 2009. Sarah K. today is 20 years old.
She had her shot last year and she lived with her friend.
There's one year the hallucinations stopped.
Since she entered into contact by Internet with the Kasten psychologist she is very well knowing that she isn't crazy.
The fool is also an art work of desire.
When someone is socially isolated or does not have enough stimulation, the probability is great that he has hallucinations at the end of some time.
I guess the brain isn't enough busy, so there's an animation.
Sarah K., unique girl, feared other children when she was small and often played alone.
Her hallucinations began when she learned 13 years, that the man she called Dad since she was in age to think, wasn't her true father.
These are the same cerebral areas which are active for visual and acoustic hallucinations, and for real impressions and sounds, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to make the difference between the illusion and the reality. "Each experience", according to Kasten "a place in the brain, the reality is formed from there.
Hallucinations are also images that shape in the brain, that's why they seem so real."
For Kasten, the night dreams are also a form of allucination.
The hallucinations of healthy persons are not essentially different from those in angulated psychosism.
At the inverse of spizophreens, the mental person is able to recognize that fantasms are not real images.
That is why Kasten advises his patients to cut the hallucinations as a particular talent.
There is only one step between dream and allucination.
In our world’s too focused on the conscience, he was unfortunately tended to take the imaginative experiences for pathologys, according to Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and Heidelberg's Heidelberg’s physic clinic and psychotherapiece of the hospital of the Nightingal Florence in Düsseldorf.
A psychose is a serious, painful, but also containing something positive, creative - fool is an art work of hope.
Schmidt-Degenhard studied the form of unroid experience, a special form of the change of conscience cleared by the dream.
Menroides are very complex seeds that are seeds that are seeds as real by him who lives and that he can't differ from the dream even when he is in the state of Eve.
Menroid state is demonstrated during traumatism or in extreme pathology situations such as the patients affected by polyradiclepathie who fully conscious are experienced by motor paralysis.
According to Schmidt-Degenhard, when a human being is mixed by a loss of himself and the world, due to a total and sustainable unability of movement, he replaces this real situation that leads to his life, by its own imaginary world that is disappeared from reality.
It's a mental term between dream and alllucination.
As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change in the world has happened but the real situation is represented in the imagination.
In fact, it is an intensive form of means and interpretation in a situation in itself in an unlawful way of organization that has been given to us men to not smile in the lack of the loss of conscience.
Everything is even far later in memories.
The Zurichois Peter Cornelius Clas, artist history also describes his unroid experiences in his book "Changing of heart" as an action for conservation of the soul.
He has 49 years old, when his conscious part of a travel of a few days after the operation of a cardiac valve followed by a transplantation; its body is condemned to remain in reanimation.
Clussen walks into a world that he created from all rooms, visit foreign places, travel in time . It sees in old man's reality in a railway sanitary, a robot on his horse on his health.
He lives through age among nobles that produce blood-based drugs.
He is removed by a Greek to Motor, who takes him into his country, he overlooks his hospital bed in the Alpes neighborhood and meets a core maffia.
He completely bound in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in his memories.
According to Clussen, these internal travels are mainly different from all dreams.
The dream is a entirely different state, which wrote by describeing what he had been alive.
In contrast to dreams, the memories coming from mental trips are extremely clear and very detailed even in years later.
We can even say that they are much more different and more intensive than real life.
The intensity of this life makes the horizon of our other daily experiences, according to the Schmidt-Degenhard psychiatrist.
The unroids, psychosis, hallucinations and psychelic experiences show us how many of our internal representations of the external reality are even fragilious.
Any change of the state of conscience, resumes the psychologist Kasten "he could cause a deformation of what we call the reality."
An experience that can be also inherent.
The first snows can fall
Burda
At 27 years, children will follow the house of editions.
The appointment of Kallen at the PDG Editions of Burda is an intermediate solution: at a long term, Hubert Burda wants to receive his two children to the press group, said he in the Spiegel journal.
The holding must remain at 100 per cent of a family company.
Hamburg - Long term, the Hubert Burda editor sees its society between his children's hands
The two children will be heritaged to 27 years and are strongly decided to integrate society, said Hubert Burda, 69 years of age at Spigel.
All details have been set out in advance.
The question to know if they will be active in the company later.
It should also be necessary to see if they are capable of it.
It is not possible to impose its children to 7500 employees without knowing whether they have the ability to take care of it.
This would disappear kids as well as the company.
Burda had known last Thursday that he would take away from the Chairman-General since January and that his successor was Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52 years old, is a member of the Administration Council since 1999.
It was first responsible for the technology sector.
Following the Trésor sector, he was responsible for the capital of the company and after the start of Jürgen Todenhöfer he also took the head of marketing, foreign sector, printing and finance.
For the first time, this is not a family member who is on the head of the Burda Editions.
The children of Burda were 19 and 17 years old, her son Felix who would have been 42 years ago.
Klen's name also continues to link the 10 or 15 next years"
Burda explains that the holding must remain at 100% between the family hands.
Destructions have always been placed in families that have been left through a capital bullymy, which have made a huge huge speculation by thinking they could smell always higher.
This was never my strategy.
I never had a dream of universal power, says Burda.
I have not seen absolutely in the country's prerequisite role as it could be Springer, and I have no intention to make part of these international laws such as the Time, these undertakings have been too important.

The form of disappearance, very important to value silhouette, is one of the variables we need to take into account.
That's a few suggestions.
The Fergie Song has chosen an extracted and very complex disappearance. This is not very advised.
Ends and Barcelona, equipped with the electric car
The electric company ends, in collaboration with the Barcelone Accommodation, created the LIVE Office.
This is a project to develop and promote electric vehicle in the Catalan capital.
The "LIVE Office" (Logic for the Electronic Vehicle Inplantation) will define and coordinate the route sheet for the installation of the electric vehicle in the city and place the mobility agreements by implementing initiatives, coordinating, containing subsidies, etc.
In addition, it will develop the MOVE project, promote the electric car, collect the opinion and work of the sectors involved.
Finally, the idea is to launch what will be the transport of the future.
3 'elective cities'
But Barcelone is not the only city that will be involved in the implantation of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are joined to the project.
It is three cities selected by the Government in the MOVE Plan to launch the electric vehicle's installation.
The final electric company has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalogne General.
It is aimed at promoting research and technological development activities in the autonomous Community of Catalogna.
Some of these are energy activities, particularly energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative to which it will end in promoting electric vehicles.
The company takes part in European standardization groups and has an overall additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatter introduced “a future of calmity” for the engine sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapather, introduced “a future of quietness” for the Spanish car industry, which, as mentioned, is the main export sector of the country.
During the presentation of the Government ' s Economic Report by the President of the Government for 2009, Zapatter recalled the measures launched by the executive during the year to support the motor sector.
"No Compatibility Plan for the vehicle sector today, we would have been a landscape of abandonment, with the closure of some of our main production sites," said the President of the Government.
"After this plan and the decision of the brands to remain in Spain, in a very competitive sector, we can consider a future of quietness for the future of this industry, which is our main export sector," he added.
In this respect, he recalled that the Competence Plan, including the Integrated Automobile Sektor Plan (PIA), has provided 800 million euros to the 19 manufacturers and 137 assisting companies, which have mobilized investments more than 3 million euros.
The Chief of the Executive explained that this investment was also intended for the development of new models and for the modernization of existing products and processes.
Zapatter also sets the Government support measures on the request, in all the 2000E Plan, in collaboration with the autonom communities and motor firms.
According to the President, this plan has allowed the average emissions of new Spanish marketed new emissions and has contributed to a strong increase in immatriculation, which has progressed from "40 per cent" in November.

Madrid welcomes the first edition of the International Collection Room, a meeting space for professionals and the passions of the engine world.
This initiative will be held from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Cristal Pabellon of the House of Madrid.

Mazda3 i-top: a sustainable sport spirit
Mazda has to prove that the sports spirit is not disappeared with the respect of the environment.
To this end, it is to integrate the stop and starting of the engine, baptised i-Stop, a device that, at least for the moment, is available only on the engine 2.0 to the essence of 150 horses.
This second generation of Mazda3 is illustrated by the good note she obtained together.
Details, end of the vehicle, accommodation, behaviour, mechanical, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are notable on the new Mazda3.
At the beginning of the conductor, it appears that the seats before present a geonomic and excellent fixation.
The flower touch is also very nice to him.
By continuing with the whole formed by the control table and the console, we see how Mazda has continued in the Japanese tendencies to create a future interior design, with many buttons and commands, as well as red and blue colours.
This style reminds us, partly, the Honda Civic Honda.
That is why we can say that as well, Mazda3, Civity, all two Japanese, are contrary to the sovereignty of the German products, and more particularly with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to overcome.
In pursuant to the accommodation, this Japanese compact car provides more room than enough to allow four adults to travel with a high comfort level.
It adds to all this a great cover to regular shapes.
The automatically stop and starting of the motor, at least for the moment, is available only on the engine which is essential of two litres and 150 horses and manually changed by the six speeds.
This motor is a real happiness. He is obvious by his end, his weak voice, his performance and the master of his consumption.
Although Mazda3 are the most requested models, those who do not operate a large number of kilometres per year should not exclude this i-Stop with essential motor, both for its great speed comfort and for its massed consumption.
As regards the level of equipment, the model selected for the test is the sport, otherwise said the largest number of series.
Among the series equipment, the road-change assistant (RVM) which removes the dead angle, traction and stability controls, speed regulator, photo-sensible internal middle, boats on a large screen screen, station capsulars, independent climatization, light captor, bluetooth and audio bloetooth, as well as 17 pows-aligned wheels are particularly notable.
Furthermore, as if this equipment was not enough, this version had the Premium Pack, which included, for $1,500 more, other elements of the adaptable bi-xenone factors and a BOSE audio system with disk loader.
Conclusion
Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best cars of its category.
It is particularly illustrated by the quality of materials used, by its behaviour and by its high-level equipment level.
Furthermore, those who do not operate a lot of kilometres per year can opt for the i-Stop version only associated with the engine of 2.0 of 150 horses.
The only unconscious of this model is its high price, which is between 21 770 euros for the Luxury end and 23 270 euros for the tested model, the sport.
In contrast to this important sum, Mazda3 will offer us a great dose of satisfaction every day.
“Premier” of luxury
L.A. recovers the red sensual cup incarned by Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars have us more than ever eyeful, with elegant models as well as sexys for Nine output. (Photos: Gtresonline).
Our “Pe” sophisticated as well as habited, had been opted for a shadow “lady”.
FonPeek promise
Peek is extremely limited, it is a device that only allows to look at its electronic mail, without offering the possibility only to see some types of attached parts or navigation on the Internet.
It benefits from its five minutes of honor to the United States, when the magazine Time describes it as one of the products of the year.
Actually, it is more difficult to see it in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for young people.
In contrast to Smartphones, Peek offers a very weak price and a very month subscription, either less than half of what costs, for example, the issuance given by iPhone.
In view of its success, the company launched two new devices: the one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free life data service, for six times more than Peek.
FonPeek, presented here at the event The Web, is the European introduction version and its third incarnation.
It is so limited as his grand-lear sister, but has a surprise.
The price of its monthly subscription, approximately 12 euros, includes roaming throughout Europe.
Those who travel with a Smartphone will already know what represents the fact of rejecting the data when a border is crossed or unrepensively seeking a coffee on the WiFi (or a Fon connection) to visit your mail.
The idea of a fixed roaming to a fixed price is incrediblely self-developed and it makes a long time as it should work.
In fact, some operators have special agreements and travel options, but I would need to have made a physical thèse to understand them and good lunchs to read the small characters.
The memories of the European Commission's repairs to propose roaming tariffs in all Europe have had a pretty sensitive effect.
Outside its country of origin, it is obliged to use the data, and it is not wrong.
What a small device such as FonPeek (as it is always curious that it is called Fon while it does not the WiFi) offers this type of tariffs, means that operators start to think differently and studie different proposals that allow them to rent their data network.
Child is another good example, it includes download of books and other research on the Internet.
Without a subscription and without gallery.
This is a connected device and it is paid in its purchase and not each month.
And this is what I hope to see a day for FonPeek: a purchase option with life access such as Peek has already suggested to the United States.
Not that I want to buy him.
I look at my phone, thank you.
I just want it because I think it is a simple form for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The preferred color of Michelle
The jane is, uncertainly, the favorite colour of the first lady of the United States.
If it was taken to Barack Obama to the President of the United States with a roof and a garment of this colour, she has actually chosen the same to accompani it in the second moment, without sure, the most important of his life: Oslo of the Nobel Price of the Paix.
Michelle Obama had a very similar model in these two occasions: as well as their appearing colour, a jacket shooting to the green with breathing reflets, two times, the holding composed of three pieces: the robe, cloth and clothes, in the same tissue, and was dressed with a large brode or a hill.
Although for a first occasion, it seems that the first lady of the United States follows the silling of the Princess of Asturias and decided to put the same holds.
But the tissue in which the two together are bound makes them very different.
If it was a depth of a depth, in turn, it was taking to Oslo a speed printed.
The accessories are also different: the middle middle mounts for the first occasion, and a similar model, but down, this time.
She's also changed: the hair are now up when she was leaving them the previous time.
75% of the mother who worked had professional problems because of their maternity
Working discrimination has increased in the past years, especially for young people who want to be mothers.
This reveals the study “Fecondity and Training Card of Women in Spain” carried out by the CSIC in cooperation with the Women's Institute.
The investigation of 9 737 women from 15 to 75 years does not have to doubt: 75 per cent of the mothers who worked have seen their limited professional cards because of maternity.
The study indicates that there are many differences regarding the start of life in couple and the number of children, if women work or not and employed types of employment.
Those who do not have work outside foyer, partly working or have a little stable work, are early in couple, have their first growth early and have more children.
However, women with stability employment, mainly in the public sector, refresh the entrance in a couple and the first pregnancy, and have less children.
Women between 35 and 49 years of work have their first child, average, 3,7 years after being installed in couple, and this number is 4,1 in those working in the public sector.
Furthermore, the type of employment that is widely influenced maternity, but less the date of common life start," explains the CSIC Margarita Delgado.
Student level is another factor that increases the disabilities of the age of women and their first child.
Following the investigation, the level of training is higher, more they marry and have their first child later.
The difference also remains among women of the same generation.
For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years, those who have made elementary and higher studies were respectively mothers for the first time to 25.1 and 32.1 years in average.
"Another discipline is also appeared between women, in accordance with their levels of study.
While those who have conducted elementary studies are married and have their first child before finding stability, those who have made a medium-level or higher level studies in this programme and give priority to the obtaining of a stable work as a prerequisitive condition to marriage and the arrival of a child," specifically Mrs Delgado.
Diane Kruger is also good
The Oreal Paris came to add a new name to his jalous list of ambassades: Diane Kruger.
Since the next year, the German actrice will incarnate the image of several products in the brand, encountering the universal division "for I'm good."
The protagonist of Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actors of the international scene, has thus reached other celebrations in the Oreal Paris, such as Linda Evangelist, Jane Funda, Andie MacDowell, Longoria and Spanish Penelope Cruz.
Before it, the latest to arrive in this club if you choose were the Evangeline Lilly actors and Freida Pinto (Slumdog Millennium).
In men, the cosmetic mark also contains luxury ambassadors: Patrick Dempsey (Dree Grey, anatomy lessons) and Matthew Fox (the partner of Evangeline in Lost).
Prices of the British mode
Britishs have a lot to say in the world of mode.
His larger representatives, creators and mannaquins, at home and today, gathered together for the annual reimbursement of their prices in London, the Royal Court of Justice.
Nobody missed you.
The former mannequin Jerry Hall and his daughter, Georgia May Jagger, chooses Meillewise of the year.
Manuel Vincent's poker
Manuel Vincent offers us in Poquer ashes (Alfaguara, illustrations of Fernando Vicente) a thirty-three of "radiography" records who have passed his literary life (and sometimes, other life).
It does not do it according to the previsible and appreciable genre (biographical resume, life and work), but by seeking something similar to the identity of the created person.
The trip is exciting and Vincent doesn't disappear or lighting.
Deeply pleasure, this book is also an emotional invitation to reading and repairs.
I'll leave you here a few instants.
On Albert Camus: "In his pages I found that the Mediterranean was not a sea, but a spiritual cleaning almost physical, the same as I felt without the nommer: the pleasure against the funest destine, moral without fault and innocence without any god."
On Samuel Beckett: "Nhilist, the Algoric Christian, wrote what he had in his blood, not in his head, between immorality and ignorance, with a smokeful poetry humor, disappointed with sense, like the lame of the couch that had falled to kill him."
On Graham Greene: “Our husband was inspired by this woman of an passion that had thirteen years, in the flesh of which he conceived the emotion of the adjourner to the pleasure of the remembrance, a spiritual privilege that consisted of reaching heaven by the way of destruction.”
On James Joyce: "Ulysse was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach. It is one of the summits of eight thousand meters of universal literature, which must be grown by the north face, on which the best alpinists still lack and still take."
On William Faulkner: "It was a strange kind.
To himself, he sometimes said he was the heritage of a territory owner of the comite and otherwise when he was the son of a black and crocodile.
These two dreams were great. ”
On Louis-Ferdinand Celine: "This writer collected the deeply powled cry from a pont by this Munch person to bring his eye to the foundation of the age of the 20th century, in his literary form, and he made it in the escape of himself and calling afterwards with a violent speech to the astics."
On Dorothy Parker: “A one day she grew herself and prayed:“God beloved, I pray you to stop writing as a woman.”
On Joseph Conrad: “On his tomb on his tomb were shoted to Spenser:” The sleep after the disappearance, / after the tempest, / the rest after the war,/ after life, has been rained death.”
On Virginia Wolf: “It also had her depression in her bags.
Her husband was usually accepting that she said to her that Edouard VII was evacuated between the wounds or the birds sing in Greece.
It has never seen a person like that patient and loved nevrose whose literatural talent exceeded the fool.”
Sur Pío Baroja: "What does Martín-Santos do if it's not trying to dissume Joyce at Baroja?
What does Benet try if it's to fuck Baroja by Faulkner?
What is this if it is not to spend the glory of this man to serve him as piedstal?”
An aggression
In the last week, my mother, who had about 70 years, walked out in our area of the city of Funlabrada, when a group of young people between 15 and 18 years passed near it and our dog, a blood-mell, save of the SPA and no more than six kilometres, and without a word, they took two pieces that left the dog grievely wounded.
Our wrath is immense because we don't see what we use to play freely aggressive a small animal without defence, which also was left.
It should be added to this the identity of a woman who was quietly proceeding and who, when she caused those persons, will come to fear for his physical integrity, as an energy that attacks an animal is able to do the same thing to a woman, a child, an older or, in definitively, any person lower than it.
The episode was held at 17:00, a Friday as another, in a usually quiet area.
The dogs have been emoting all the day.
We have heard complaints to the Commissioner of the area even if we believe that this serves a large-chose and not to touch sensitivity, we just want to explain that the murder slaughters were Spanish.
The indignation brought us to denial this fact.
We don't understand what happens in youth so they're encouraging to misstrain freely a animal without defence that gives us the abuse, the friendship and holds our company.
We don't know where the good education and respect of animals and people are going.
Michelin and Fesvial, together for the casket port
The Michelin Pneus manufacturing in cooperation with the Spanish Safety Fund (Fesvial) has launched a campaign to encourage the port of the case, mainly in the youngest motorcyclists, as stated today the two structures.
This initiative is intended to make aware of the importance of the case port, as it is one of the protection elements to avoid harms on the head, or even death, in case of accident in two roads.
Michelin indicated that this campaign included its commitment to road safety, which “after the design and manufacturing of more secure products” and stated that it had contributed to this objective by other periodic and informal actions.
This new Castle promotion campaign in two roads, under the article “To be or not be”, will contain a first stage during which the samples will be distributed in more than 500 motorcyclette garages, to ensure the most wide distribution.
Finally, Michelin emphasized that road security is “un constant concern” for the company, as a producer of pneumatics for two road vehicles, one of its main objectives is to develop more safe products.
The sale of light commercial vehicles
After almost two years, the light trade vehicles market begins to see a little light at the end of the tunnel.
The 9 425 inmatriculated vehicles in Spain represent a 12.6% increase in compared to 2008, and, more important, they represent the first increase in 22 consequence months after the numbers of the patronal syndicat of Anfac and Ganvam producers.
However, the good news must be reported, since the reference to comparison was particularly bad in November 2008, with a decrease of 60 per cent in comparison.
Thus, despite the abundance of the last month, immatriculation accumulated during these 11 months is 40% below those of the previous year.
Since January, if all vehicles entering into the category of light commercial vehicles (received from tourism cars, pick-up, fourgonettes, light cars and light chassis cars) were sold 95 853.
The larger clouds affecting their demand are not so dissoluted, though they are also bought by individuals, most purchases are carried out by small or medium enterprises, which pay almost 100% of the cases through external financing.
In addition to restrictions involved by the limitation of bank credits, other factors should be added as an increase in unemployment rate or the continuation of the bad economic conjunction.
In response to this situation and the difference of tourism vehicles, the 2000E purchase aid have been unlikely served.
In addition to individuals, independent and SMEs who want to acquire an easy commercial vehicle at least 3,5 tonnes with an emission level of Co2 which does not exceed 160 kg in kilometre, may also benefit, but the number of operations speak of itself.
Today, in Ganvam, it was recalled the need for the administration of particular attention to these vehicles and also to industrial vehicles (camerages and buss).
The association of concessionaries provides a comparable year 2010 to which it ends, for which it calculates an injury of sales (to tourism vehicles and 4x4) of 19%.
Aid for emergency release is now obligation
As this has occurred with the ABS Anti-Blocking system and as it will happen with the ESP Stability Control, the emergency aid systems will be a binding element on the European cars.
They are also already obligation to tourism cars and light commercial vehicles, while the remaining vehicles have been fixed until February 2011.
The measure imposed by the European Union is aimed at strengthening the protection of pitons, even if, by its action mode, it can also contribute to avoid many back-offs.
The emergency aid assistant involves an increased pressure on boundaries in the case of emergency detected by the system by the driver's feet case.
But this last doesn't always keep pressure until the end.
According to a study carried out by the manufacturer of components for Bosch's cars, a third of the conductors involved in an accident could not support the free before the collection, and half of them did not benefit from all its force.
Up to 1 100 accidents
The aid intervention, renewing, requires the maximum of the frein system, reducing the distance of which the car needs to be stopped.
According to a EU study, if all cars were equipped with this type of elements, up to 1 100 dead accidents in which pitons are involved each year could be avoided.
This reduction would be even more important with the popularization of these intelligent liberal systems: we are calculated that a synthesis on four and four wounds would be avoided.
In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which, through radar or camera, detects barriers and provides the driver, more easily acts on the flowers.
If the conductor is reacting, it helps it increased pressure on the penal, if necessary.
If it does not respond, and although the collection is inevitable, the device makes the maximum weakness on the flowers to minimize damage.
General Motors resume the Opel Plan until January
While workers of the Opel de Figueruelas (Saragose) were warned by Nick Reilly, the new President of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva would be launched during the first week of April – probably 8 – according to Javier Ortega, the northern American producer has warned that it will need more time to conclude the Opel assistance plan.
Nick Reilly, the new GM Europe president, considers that each plan was approved by the Party concerned.
This may involve that the final document, which will first be submited to the workers and then to the Governments of the countries where the uses are available, will be reported until the beginning of 2010.
However, in the GM, a decision on the sale of Saab should be taken in the next days.
It is therefore not surprising that the Swedish Government has resorted the pressure on the American manufacturer to take a decision as quickly as a result.
GM adds to be contacted with possible new buyers.
One of them could be Geely, who also seeks to acquire Volvo, but the candidate of the Hollandian sport car manufacturer Skyper, supported by the Russian Converg group, is important.
In the case there was no agreement with any of them, GM could sell a part of Saab to the Chinese Baic company.
The decision to close Saab at the end of the year if it is not sold is maintained.
At the Porsche Boxster Spyder flight
In order to conceal their last and precious approximately, the Porsche engineers left from the Boxster S and successed to analyze nothing less than 80 kilometres, which leaves the balance only 1 275 kilograms.
This resulted, firstly, from the automatically threshold that was replaced by a manual bucket to reduce from 21 kilometres, to employ aluminium doors such as GT3, 15 other kilometres in less, to remove the climatism, 13 kilograms, to reduce the reservoir of agency from 64 to 54 litres, 7 kilometres, to raise sports bacteries, even 12 kilometres, and with lightly 19 pounds, five kilometres.
Finally, they refused the CDR-30 audio system, gaining so six other kilograms and replaced the ports by phetes in tissue, evolving the remaining kilo.
Although the model also exists with the double embracing PDK box, the test has been performed on a manual Box of six speeds, mainly on the routes of the secondary network in California, in Mount, with specially tortured virages.
Its behaviour may be qualified only of irreprochable.
The reduction of weight does not prevent the car to rotate on the ground with aplomb.
On the other hand, it was long that we hadn't tested a so small and easy model that guarantees so much security in the virages, including great speed.
It's a small athlete, capable of evacuating its small muscles during the time necessary, until we asked him to sprint, broke, recover, and push his motor again...
This is what we wanted. Thanks to his direction, as specifically, the car will do what our hands will specify on the flight.
And she'll make it with a chirurgic specification.
Sound of wishing motor
The sound of its V6 boxer, with 320 horses (10 more than the Boxster S) is specially successful and can be strengthened with the option "sport" or by a system that changes the motor reduction, already used on the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, or at the stop or in the receipt.
The suspensions are closed, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The clothing of the roads we moved with the Boyxster Spyder was quite low, but the car has well managed the pool nests.
Electronic assistants have hardly acted at the presence of all the trajet, while on some virages we have found glasses at the small morning and graves, later in the morning.
In definitive, a ultra-level car, the most fun to lead and which is much more than a simple change of the S Boxster.
The car will be led to the sale in February 2010 at a price of 70 831 euros.

Baskania offered a victory in Israel
The Laboral Caja has received a triomph at 91-82 visit on Maccabi Electra, despite the many absences that had suffered the Dusko Ivanovic team. It is so located in head of his group, after the great spectrum of Mirza Teletovic, which, with eight to three points, was the best of its team (29 review).
The Vitoria team has composed the important absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov by a large dose of commitment and collective work, even though she had to wait until the end of the victory.
Furthermore, the great habilty since the period, with 16 painters to three marked points, will largely define the final victory.
The game started quickly for the blue and red, which took advantage since the beginning.
The fact that the four first painters of the Vitoria teams were marked since the percentage, he said they had seen on the Israeli field with hot weights.
English and Teletovic were the main artists of the 18-20 end of the first quarter times.
The second quarter time was on the same tone, but Alva's team chosen the internal game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, which was received by appeals and appeals of return to his old home, to increase their benefit to the pause (34-43).
Teletovic already began to take a note as the best player of his team, with 13 points marked, although Splitter's "such as six" assessment was already laid to say that this night would not be the best of Brazil.
But in this match, despite the fact that they were on the right path to the pause, nothing was played, far from there, and the Avala team wanted to remind the Vitoria team that they were not so easily win on their field, and through "the hand of Elias," they succeeded to enter into the game.
Eidson and Pnini were decisively contributed to the benefit of the light (50-49).
Other difficulties
The players of Ivanovic, wounded but far from being dead, needed to take some heavy actions to take the air, and at this time the middle of Mirza Teletovic, which, with three consequenced painters and the assistance of England and Ribas, reduced the account to a rating score (54-67), and that the places had been able to acquire at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
The Avala team went out to play everything for all the last period and English and San Emeterio (60-75) reported that they wouldn't let no one take what they had harmed for the thirty-first minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not resign and try to support it from the line of the three points (70-77).
Despite this, and with Splitter elected for faults, the players of Ivanovic did not dismiss, defended well, and although Israelians were resolved in the last minute (80-85), the part was already played and the victory was run to Tel Aviv for the first time of the season.
The wounds prevent the United Kingdom to deliver battle
The U.S. greeting has lost Greece faced the Olympics and has led the head of the B Group of Europe, in a match marked by the absence of players of the United Kingdom, especially in the internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which easily facilitated the Greek victory.
The Malaga team has not been feared by the ambition of the Paix and the Emirate platform or by the deterioration of the rival, uncertainly one of the most powerful Europe and a large budget.
The game of the first quarter-times allowed to dream the aloes. A aggressive and three aggressive defenders at three consequetive points, two of the mentor Omar Cook and one of the Guillem Rubio who equipped the local team 12-18, at the ninth minute.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of the United Nations, although the original of the local team with the internal game of Bourousis, Vijcic and Schortsanitis, has allowed the point 22-20, at the thirty-minute, when an action, a bagarre start, between the North American meners of Beverley and Williams had introduced the disqualization of both players.
The Greek team began to work by showing its sustainability in the two camps, while the outcome for the battle of the English Joel Freeland pivot and the three personal offences of Carlos Jiménez were weighing to the United Kingdom.
Inner players and Lithuanian aere, Linas Kleizas, with their three points, grew the advantage of 44-32, at the ninth minute.
Unable remonted
The third period was particularly offensive for Olympiacos, which, despite the 19 losses, has been shown up and even reached the difference of the meeting discussed in Malaga 66-48, at the twenty-seventh minute, with a chance to make the head of the group.
UK tried to overcome the absences and the last exit of the economist Robert Archibald pivot, wounded during the meeting.
Despite all these problems, the United Kingdom, through its organization, the panizers at three points of Cook, and the support of Lewis, had a little hope with 66-57, at the thirty-first minute.
But the victory was practically impossible, because Olympiacos had been implacable when the players made pressure and showed their sovereignty in centimeters in the area.

Brazil sets a date for Zelaya starting
The Brazilian Government has set a time for the stay of Manuel Zelaya in its Ambassade of Tegucigalpa.
The Defended President should leave diplomatic legitimation after 27 January 2010 from the official end of its mandate.
Francis Catunda, business officer of Brazil's Ambassade in Honduras capital, confirmed TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the ambassade, where he was refugeed since 21 September before that date.
“He has aware that he must go from 27 January at the end of his mandate, he must seek another destination.”
The chain also stipulated the former official, who confirmed his intention to leave the ambassade before the end of the deadline established: "My position is to get out the fastest possible, logically with the support of the Brazil Government," said Zelaya by telephone.
After the elections of 29 November (in which Porfirio Lobo was elected), Zelaya assured that he would stay in Brazil's Ambassade until January.
However, in the same week, he tried to seek refugees to Brazil.
The operation finally failed, since Zelaya rejected the terms of political exhibition that he had heard to impose the Government of fact presided by Roberto Micheletti.
Thank you very much.
Following the rock days since the last summer, during which the inflation of assets has formed the dominant note on the markets, the uncertainty is again rising again, because it is not surprising because it is their natural state, in a midst where agents take decisions on an uncertain future.
The reimbursement employed by the Central Banks to establish markets was to minimize the debt by the direct purchase of assets and indirectly by giving abonding liquidity at near weapon rates, so that financial institutions buy assets to mobilize.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have been practically completed and, without delaying their non-compliance policy, starting to put a little saving in roads, as the ECB has done, with their adjudication to one year of the next week.
Therefore, investors are sure of the ability of the global economy to maintain economic relations without herodox measures, and we are now to assist in a reduction of risk premiums.
The birds and disagreements of the undertakings are increased again, although they remain very far from the paranormal levels they have achieved at the beginning of the year.
States were obliged to socialise private risk and public debt again.
A further impact on the quality and quality of the United States, Japan and Germany have been chosen refugees by investors, leading to increased differences between the euro area and Germany.
Spain was hardly touched by this instability episode, but then standard & Poor'sa missing a new revision to the reduction of the quality of the Kingdom of Spain.
On the other hand, a little uncertainty is not bad to make the defenders of the moral risk, which tried to provoke again a case of conscience at the responsibilities of the global economic policy that had released the destructors affected by the limitation of the credit to the destruction of employment, while it was necessary to describe a new day of thanks.
However, Dubai's situation is like a tribal fight between the emirs to bring his place to the power in the emirats and we have already seen the case of Greece.
A government that dissociates a public deficit, elections, and a new government that discovers the skin to the rocks.
Prodi made it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barroso.
It would be perfectly irrational that the Ecofin saves Hungary from a non-respect of its external payments at the beginning of the year and allows a Member State of the euro area to not respect its commitments.
It is logical that the Ecofin has encouraged the Greek Government to transparency and makes its citizens responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we hope, we're looking at an episode of normalization of transitional risk premies, after some excepts in high positions, it would be predictable.
In the case of Spanish, as our disparities from the public debt increase in the measure of the European enterprises' obligations, we do not have to worry about us.
If European disappearances were reduced and our people continued to increase, it would be an Spanish idiosyncratic risk.
The Standard & Poor's case is an anecdote. When our previsional indicators are obliging most of the study services to anticipate their relation models for 2011, with the OECD and the European Commission, which return to charge with a Japanese model for Spanish economy, it does not much hope for their warning.
Again, this is all like to constitute a excellent opportunity to buy Spanish assets, even though for the immediate "while is a sure mother."
Connected seminars
The President of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to intervene, before the Sub-Commission of the Deputy Congress, where it was discussed in these days, Spain's energy strategy for the next two decades.
After his intervention, which was followed by the President of the Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Mr. Galán asked for the pressure which he had made before the subcommittee at eight closs.
For the President of Iberrola, Spain needed to invest 50 million euros until 2020 and 60 000 million more between this date and 2030, in the case of the current operational nuclear centres.
If this is not, the necessary investments would not rise to 600,000, but to 95,000.
In the next decade, Iberdola believes that investments should not be dedicated to the increased production capacity, but to the distribution networks and international connections.
Since 2020, the issue changed, and it will need to increase the power.
Its side is also focused on gas centres and carbon, with coal recovery mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this area, it considers that 18,000 MW needed more, with other “assistance energy”.
Galan, who believes that the Sustainable Economy Law which the Government has come to approve is in the appeal of what he claims, not wished to attack the Royal Decree to encourage national carbon consumption, which contrarys the policies of combating climate disappearance.
According to him, there is a long-term clarity in this sense, notwithstanding the 'pontuelles' measures, as the President of Iberdola qualified.
Whatever this is, Galan believes that the decisions to invest, although they are located in a long term, they should start to be taken, because they put some time before the end of their maturity and that a stabil reimbursement framework is necessary for them to deal with them.

The Australian market promises large scanners and privatizations, but there is a great difficulty, if it is the way to acquire a local construction company.
A strategy followed by High High and Bilfinger undertakings already mentioned, except for their Asian references, which remains still an unvalid step for Spanish genders.
ACS is attempt to provide a place on this market through its participation of 30% in high, owner of Leighton.

The calendar set by the administration indicates that the adjudication will be held during the age of 2010 and that the work will begin in December of the next year.

The French competition regulator has introduced a amendment of 63 million euros to France Telecom for its anti-compound conducts in the Caribbean region.
According to this institution, the operator limited the competition on fixed and mobile telephone by signing exclusive agreements, tariffs and consumer confidence programmes.
With this sanction, the old French monopolie and still state business, accumulated more than 450 million euros since 1994, because of the obstacles he made to its competitors.
The infringed sanction has also been increased because the authority which ensures competition is considered that France Télécom has committed similar offences in the past and that it is therefore reciproced.

Their participation in the Champion Ligue reported 476.4 million to the Real Madrid and Barça since its creation
The Champion Ligue became a source of revenue for clubs since his birth in 1992.
In fact, Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona gained 467.4 million, which placed in the third and fifth position of clubs that had the most money in this competition.
The United Manchester is on the list.
The United Manchester is on the list.
The EUFA Champions Ligue does not only support the glory. It is also one of the main income sources of the great clubs.
In fact, the competition has divided 5 362.5 million euros to 105 teams (of 12 Spanish) who participated in the event since the creation of the tournoi, during the 1992-1993 season, according to the EUFA information.
The Real Madrid and the F.C. Barcelona were well served in this distribution.
The white club was the third of the continent to touch the most money for its participation, and the only, with the A.C. Milan, has been sent to the trophea three times.
The current Catalan club, holding the title and last winner of Europe's old Couple in 1992, is the fifth on the list.
The United Manchester and the Bayern of Munich, the two teams who also made the most money for their participation in the last Champions Legue.

On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, with regard to the money reported by the Champions Liga, although it has reported more titles than any other (in the same time, Italy had brought four, English three and two).
Repartition
This apparent paradoxe is explained by the comprehensive repartition procedure of the money implemented by the EUFA.
For this year, Michel Platin's president body provides win 1 090 million through the Champions Legue.
The EUFA will devote 413.1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who participated in classification matches (including Madrid’s Italian) has received 2.1 million.
Furthermore, those who have been able to participate have received 3,8 million in order to be there, over 550 00 euros for each match.
There is also a winning bonus (800 000 euros) and equality (400 000 for each team). Those who arrive in eight ends get three million, the eight teams coming in the end of the fourth receiving 3.3 million.
The four last teams will receive every 4 million.
And the campaign will win 9 million, faces 5.2 received by the other finalist.
Therefore, for fixed payments, a club will gain at least 7,1 million, and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça has hired 2.5 million for the Super Coupe of Europe in August.
Furthermore, there are variable payments, which are dedicated 337.8 million.
This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each televised market.
The Spanish market is one of the most important places and has four attractive places.
The previous year's campaign is 40% of the affected money, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth.
The other party will be paid according to the number of matches played during the edition of the current year.
New Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos.
The New Rumasa Group has reported the details of the acquisition of actions by which it is intended to acquire a maximum of 25 to 29.9% of the Sos capital.
A percentage that does not allow it to launch a public purchase offer (OPA) for the total number of titles.
Consequently, New Rumasa offers $1,5025 per action, which will be deprived in 10 years and which will be paid to 1 per cent per year for this report.
Here, Sos' actions ended at 1,85 euros; the offer of New Rumasa is so that the company is 18% below the market.

The offer is conditioned by the design of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jerez Group gives a period of 15 days for the actionnaires to indicate their interests for the sale of titles.
The CNMV has not been informed of this offer, although the Ruiz Mateos company has stated that she had contacted the regulator.

It is a newly created post that will be directly dependent on the President of the Group.
And it is not out of polemic, since the company remains submerged in the legal battle for the supposed deterioration of more than 230 million of Sus to the Salazar societys.
Furthermore, the possibility that in the next months it is not possible to disappear new fund delays.

New Tools for car expertise
During those bad time and accidents, motor garages are not the only winning.
Every day, thousands of cars under a sinister are returned to a garage, where a expert must assess the lower damage and the cost of repair.
Each left is different, and the calculation of the cost of pieces and work time may be a long and complex work.
Calculation of the cost of a reparation between 20 000 and 30 000 euros, including pieces and worker hand, can take two or three hours.
However, with the assistance of the most recent information tools, it would be a question of minutes.
That is why almost 100% of experts use this type of systems.
Service providers and solutions for synthesis assessment and maintenance are dedicated to the collection of information provided by manufacturers and then to treat them and provide them to their customers in the form of a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, the North American Solar Group, is the leading company; 80% of the estimates are achieved with its products.
The other undertakings in the field of evaluation and development of sector information are GtMotive and Eurotax.
The work with the data provided by manufacturers is far from being simple.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, trade director of Audatex, the company in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides information in a different format.
Furthermore, the amount of data to be treated is to be increased, although in the past five years, more versions, variants and motorization have been launched only during the 15 previous years.
When a new car goes out on the market, these enterprises will work.
This is a very hard work, because we need to catch each of the thousands of pieces of the vehicle and record its prices.
Furthermore, a "intelligent" graphic image of each model on which you can click on the different parts of a tourism car.
If this is a massively sold model, the work may be ready in a week if the process is very fast.
If this is a little sale car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information about 99.2% of the cars commercialized in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models, they have information on the Porsche, but not Ferrari or Lamborghini.
With regard to movement vehicles, the number exceeds 99 %.
In order to carry out the documentation and formulation of databases, Audatex has eight divided centres around the world (in Spain, France, Germany, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of them is specialized in some trademarks.
The national seat is located in Alcobendes (Madrid).
There, more than hundred technicians (in general mechanical experts) work together on three computer screens.
Audatex invested every year 90 million to develop these databases.
Every month, 2,5 million data are registered, and customers receive updates every two days.
The development of this extreme information flux allows those companies to give them different uses and to propose different products.
The most frequent application concerns recovery and maintenance, but in accordance with the countries, there are tools for the management of cash pieces or for calculating the veinal or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide on the value of opportunities cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not propose it in our country, but it makes it to the United States.
In view of the products offered by Auditx, it is easy to make an idea of the type of support that it can bring to the professionals of the sector.
This company offers ten different tools, the product being AudaPlus, the standard synthesis assessment solution for experts.
It contains cars, motors, light and hard industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the rooms, it takes into account the time of repairs estimated by the manufacturer or peinture barms.
This tool is purchased according to its use, for each estimation.
The highest cost is $5,75, for clients that are lower, at maximum 10 times per month.
Then, each insurance company, which operates thousands of experts, negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products, such as AudaVIN, allow the total identification of a vehicle and equipment with which it is issued from the mount chain only by its chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on the vessels of vehicles, and AudaSubastas is a open server to the Internet professional sector which allows you to search for spacious average vehicles.
Its statistics service is very useful to identify trends, realize geo-demographical analysis or to know current trade or model problems.
For example, it is possible to study how many models of a determined mark have been gone to garage for a panne or how serious symptoms have resulted for a given period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company which focuses on the development of this type of tools.
It markets, among others, Gt Estimate, which is also designed to experts and provides digital images, as well as access to the components, prices and time of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Unsa Group, based in 1971, as a provider of services and solutions for synthesis assessment, pannes or devotion support.
The GT evaluation guide is a historic reference product on the market.
The company works with 24,000 users in garages, 3 100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
His case volume has increased by 20 per cent over the past three years, and in 2008, it has made a number of cases of $10.8 million.
At the beginning of the past year, she undertake her internationalization process, with the implantation of a office in Paris.
Audatex was born in Germany in 1966 and was imposed in Spain in 1979.

This service of estimation and sales is exclusively addressed to professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, experts, location companies, guarantees, cases and professional sales that should be registered before the starting of operations.
This platform was created in 1996 in Germany and has been produced more than 650 000 operations throughout Europe, including 500 000 in Germany.
The main markets are in Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
There are now more than 1500 vendors and 4000 experts registered on the site.

Guarantee device in four steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, the Audatex company ensures that the user will receive a dishwasher in only four steps: identify the vehicle, search for the exchange piece, create a dishwasher and generate it.

The database includes 1 034 vehicles, including 666 tourism, 109 all-terreans, 137 motos, 78 fourgonettes and 44 camions.
Naturally, to use it, a computer and internet connection are required.
Once the model is identified by its chassis number, a real graphical image of the proposed model appears then the needed piece is selected.
The user can include variations such as the price of the work hand, majority or reduction, and then it can print the store to send it to the client.
AudaTaller is not an estimation tool like AudaPlus, but a reference catalogue.
