Sterm bodys distract light and warm because of energy created when hydrogen atoms are combining (or condensing) to create harder elements.
Scientists work to create a reactor that can produce energy in the same way.
However, this is a very difficult problem to solve and it will need many years before seeing the building of fruitful fusion reactors.
Stainless hair remains aggravated because of the surface tension.
The surface tension is created because the magnetism between water molecules on the surface is so strong than with air molecules above them.

The lame of a modern glass patient is paid with two extremities with a concave grass located between the two. These two extremities allow better accession to the glass, even when they are inclined.
As the lame's low is slightly incursive, when the lame kisses on one side or on the other, the boat which is in touch with the glass is also incursive.
This makes the patient turn. If the patients fall on the right, the patient turns right, if the patients fall on the left, the patient turns to the left.
In order to return to the previous level of energy, they must be removed from the emagasinated energy exchange to the light contact.
They do it by emitting a small light-leather called 'foon'.
Scientists call this process "modern emission of rayonation", because atoms are stimulated by life light, which causes the emission of a light photo (the light is a type of rayonation).
The next image shows the atoms that emit photos. Of course, the photos are so smaller than those represented on the image.
Photos are even smaller than parts form atoms!
