Seminars against the prosecutor: Cossion of the former visa of Tartu will see the 4 August
This means that it will be decided, rather, at the beginning of September.
The courts of two first institutions to consider the exchange of Semiarian were rejected, but at April, the complaint was adopted in the production of the State Court.
The Tatar Administrative Court, on 12 December 2019, returned the complaint to the complaint, since its authorisation did not enter into its authority of the Administrative Court.
The Court of Justice indicated that the complaint contains the claim for the reimbursement of the damage caused during criminal production.
"Resolve such matters should be procured and a trial court," she previously explained the Corporate of the ERR Chairman of the Tartuba Chairman of Ande Kreitsman.
According to her, Valva Semiarian had convicted this decision in the environment court that, on 5 February, had not changed the decision of the Court of First Institution.
Now you'll have to say the Hosсуд.
According to the protective of Seminars, the jury's jury of Oliver Ness, his client was inconsistently suspected about two years.
He now requires the prosecutors to proclaim invalid approvals in his address and to pay him moral damage.
The cause for the prosecutor for the prosecutor on the specific cases of the Law Prosecutor Margus Gross made to them in October 2017, when the Seminars were held together with others at the moment of the rescueter of Tartu Artem Suvoral Artema was detained to be suspected by the offence of several crimes.
"Remember that when I detained, the security police and the procurement were immediately organized by the press conference and informed the whole Estonian Republic that the leaders of Tartu, one of the most affective local self-managed bodies, were sold.
These public suspicions have caused me about two years.
Now, when these claims and suspicions were found falsely, the procultural does not want to talk about it," commented the Seminars at the beginning of August 2019.
According to Oliver Ness, the Pre-Conference of the Procureur went beyond the legal framework in which the prosecution should operate.
"Attention of catches and sales was false, but it is not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has recently emphasized in his statutes on Russia, as well as in Lithuania that, at the stage of the consequences, representatives of States should be careful in the selection of words that suspected would not be submitted into the role of criminals before the condemnation.
This procurement lies and the presumption of innocentness, which, unfortunately, has not been respected in this case against Valvo Semiarian," said Nes.
“Public presentation of the Semiarian as a serious criminal offence and inconsistent in circumstances when the facts of suspicion on prejudice are still explained, is unacceptable that the presumption of innocentity and injustice with regard to the applicant has been added.”
As wrote by russ.err.ee, the former Vice-Master Tatar Wolvo Seminars would not be engaged in the complaint of the offence, the criminal case against him in July was partly closed.
At the same time, the former officer judges for a conscious violation of anti-corruption legislation in the processing of specially large sizes.
According to the accused conclusion, the former Vice-Partau Vice-President, more than thirty times, participated in the meetings of the City Governance, taking decisions relating to Tatar companies, with the owners or leaders whose Seminars had actively reported at the time of time.
According to Gress, in all these cases, Seminars were personal interests, and therefore he had to take part in decision-making.
Previously, as reported by russ.err.ee, the prosecution made the Seminars suspects in receipt and violation of anti-corruption legislation in particular major dimensions.
This occurred in October 2016 when he was detained together with the other Vice-Chair of Artem Suvorv (Centrist Party).
Then, the procurement and the security police stated that the two visa had some evidence.
After that, both of the reader were detained.
The Soviet work later came to the court who completely justified the policy.
The proceedings on the case of Valvo Semiarian continued.
