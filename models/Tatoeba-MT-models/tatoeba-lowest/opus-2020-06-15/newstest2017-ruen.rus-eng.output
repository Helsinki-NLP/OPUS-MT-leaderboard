What does Russia shows out of the crisis?
The economicists saw the signs of Russia's outcome from the most extended over the last twenty years of recession.
As noted by the Bloomberg Analytics Agency, the RFR demonstrates positive dynamics in the second quarter of HIV was reduced to 0.8 per cent in the year of expression.
This indicator is at least from the beginning of 2015.
According to the last dated Russian economy in the second quarter, 0.6 per cent was declined by the Russian economy.
Recently, the Centre for Development and the Mine-Commonwealth has also stated on the stability of the situation.
Forwards is a slow growth.
In view of the CBD experts, the reception in the Russian economy remained in the past.
"The Index assessment of the Russian WFP said that the recession remained behind, and progress is a slow growth of the economy," said in the Russian Bank, "for what are the trinds?"
The module of BBP assessment at the current quarter has increased to 0.4 per cent, the fourth quart is 0.5 per cent.
As reported by the representative of Mine-Economism Development, during the second quarter, the FDP was held in the second quarter, of 0.2 per cent.
In the second quarter, HIV was a 0.2 per cent to the previous quarter.
But during the square it was stopped: in April he was 0,2%, and in May and June the change of HIV was within the limits of 0-0.15, the representative of the RIA "News".
The reduction of the fall of the Russian economy during the latest five quarters shows that it is "against."
Among other trademarks indicated that the national economy was recognized, Bloomberg calls for the growth of the demand for energy and iron transport, business living.
If you make an amendment that year is high, it is understood that more than 1% electricity consumption may be compulsory by an additional working day.
Let's add to this lower average year temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of cargo transport, but it's difficult to get accurate data, and more than 0.5% of the seasony can also be explained," explains Kiril Jacob from ALOR BORCOER.
There are also other, more clear signs of stabilizing the Russian economy.
For example, the decrease of the price of the pressure.
In July, the index of consumer prices was 7.2 per cent compared to 15.6 per cent in the same month.
Moreover, in the last two weeks, Rossstyle is deflation.
The prices in Russia have declined first in five years.

In June, the rate increased by 1,7 per cent.
The duration of the fall of external trafficking was declined from 32.8 per cent in January 2016 to 20.7 per cent in May.
The positive dynamic also shows the situation on the market where unemployment level has declined to 5,4 per cent.
It was only in September 2015 (5,2 per cent).
Despite the proper situation in the labour market, the question of the real income of the population is to make a better desire.
In the annual expression, the indicator is declined to 4,8 per cent.
This factor can be tolerated by the recovery of the economy because the costs of households are a small contribution to GDP.
Usually, their percentage in the structure is exceeding 50 per cent.
Besides the low consumer activity, the risk of economic growth can also be called a hard policy of the Russian Bank.
The regulatory holds a 10.5 per cent, which is not the most real sector.
The non-agative factor is not sufficiently high investment level, which has the development of industrial capacity.
But generally, it is possible to imagine that, until the end of the year, the RF-country falls up to 0.5 per cent against -3.7 per cent in 2015," says the GC Forex Club Rogova analysis.

The burden fees are operationally decided in public space (and the treatment of the people and reactions are placed on the port of the Government of Moscow).
Many are not just paying daily qualifications, but attentively following what it is written in the house.
The awareness of the population on the rights of the owner and the obligations of resources and management organizations is very high.
Moscow appreciates the accuracy of tariffs for housing and communication services, since a small part of the budget resources is subsequent and loans for many categories of population.
It's probably all together and explains the peaceful situation in Moscow.
Does it go, is it all in the freedom of regional authorities?
Maybe the unlimited must change the place of work?
Turkish hambit.
Can Edgegan refuse friendship with the EU and the United States?
The President of Turkey Regipe Taip Eddogan made the United States Stumpam, urged the election between Turkey and Fethullah Hunghan, the Islamic preacher who accused the public transfer organization.
He stated that, speaking before his parties in Ankara.
Erdogan called the Americans to refuse the support of the "terrorism organisation" of the philosophists.
This is not the first statement from Turkey in which the United States calls for change their position.
The experts believe that the disagreement in Turkey and West is increasing and could lead to a new attempt of authority in the country.
"Raano or later America will make the election between Turkey and FETO ("Terrorist organisation of the philosophy").
Or the organizational conversion of the FETO or the democratic Turkey.
It should make this choice," quoted the Athalia Agency of the Treatment of Edward, which was in the middle of the evening in Ankara.
The President of Turkey once, but has already needed hardly from the United States to fulfil its requirements that they had first been assigned after the decade.
Remember that at the night, at 16 July, high-level representatives in Turkey had been undertaken by the Turkish Army at the time of 16 July, as well as an attempt to live by the head of the State.
However, after the treatment of the population, Rudgep Erdogan was deployed, and his organizations and participants were arrested.
There were some 8,000 suspects, including militarys, who were found teachers and scientists.
As noted by Regip Eddogan, their teacher had made Fatulah Hulen who lived in Pennsylvania in the United States.
Edogan also provided that hospitals could be prohibited and directly Americans.
All the claims in its address were revealed, rejecting Guinea and encouraged the change of tonnes.
The last statement of the representatives of Gosdepa has been published at the visit of Eddogan in San Peterburg last Friday.
However, it has not stopped the President of Turkey, it is constantly on its own and also puts the requirements to others of the Western partners.
"Annara will stop to comply with its obligations under the migration agreement with Europe, if Brissel does not constitute the date of the cancellation of the vocational restrictions for Turkish citizens," said the Minister of Turkey on EU Oмер Chile.
In his words, the changes to the anti-terrorism law, as required by the EU, will be threatened by Europe's own security.
It is noted that the 1 August, the winner-Canner of Germany Zigmar Gabriel required Turkey to stop the ship of Europe's promises to open the border for migrants to facilitate the exchange mode with the EU.
Its words were addressed to the relevant declaration of Chapter IID Turkey Mevlet Chaussilla.
Another proof declaration made in the past term, allowing Turkey to get out of the NATO.
Chapter of the Turkish AIDS did not exclude that the country would consider the possibility of exit from Aliens, unless it had been expected to meet its support.
The decision on enhanced cooperation with Russia in defence area is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries working with foreign states in the area of defence, which are introducing railways," said Chawschall in the Interview of the Anadolu Agency.
Accordingly, Turkey now needs to create its own system of defence based on their technologies, and to cooperate with other countries.
"Today Turkey tried to cooperate with NATO Member States, but the results were not satisfied, and we continued to seek others," said the Minister.
The experts believe that all of this relates to serious differences in Turkey with West and the country ' s reorientation to East.
Chapter of the International Political Experts of Minnesock believes that Regipe Edogan is now conducting its game and could not go to a hard conflict with Western.
He has a lot of license in Western and on business, and in the view of the military (Turquía is an NATO member), so I think that Erdogan will try to balance, keeping the racial relations with Western.
Although, of course, the Americans would like to see this post of a full listed person," she explained AF.ru expert.
In his words, it is not excluded that after the statements of the Turkish leader (or not payment of the EU's compensation, the requirement of the free space with Europe and the removal of Ghana from the United States).
"Rédgep Erdogan is engaged in relations and with America, and with Europe, why they will give it on humanitarian problems, the deterioration of the country's management methods and further," believes Minnco.
Chapter of the Political Information Centre Alex Muhain allows the President of Turkey to change its views with Russia as if it is useful.
Edogan, eight months ago, took a very hard position in Russia and in all ways, seeking welfare in Western.
The situation has been very smallly changed to an opposite situation.
Garantine, that after some time, President of Turkey does not change its priorities again.
I think Erdogan has entered the human diplomatic period.
He will try to obtain a maximum benefit for himself," considers Muhain.
He considers that the main task for the President of Turkey today is to hold the political authority in the country, and that for the time it was necessary to Russia and its partnership with the Polyne Government to stop supporting Guyana.
Turkey needs and the EU, and the United States that control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
The consensus with Turkey will therefore be achieved," he considers experts.
Another view is taken by head of the Asian and the Middle East of Anna Glozava.
Today, Turkey and the EU and the United States are enough tensions, and it is first related to the internal policy that is personally conducted by Edward.
I think that this crisis will be aggravated, and the Turkish leading crisis will try to restart policies as well as Russian relations.
Inaccessible to the President of Turkey, as well as a number of Turkish policies stated that they are willing to change their position on a number of issues in Syria, regulated by Israel, have been an active political interaction with Iran," explained AiFr.ru Glozova, which allows the next step of Edward would normalize the relationship with Egypt.
According to her, the policy, which is now conducted by Erdogan, was the return to the external political concept, which Turkey followed before the start of Arab revolutions.
"Otherwise, in the " only neighbors" positions, Turkey began to develop very actively their relations with the Middle East and Asian region.
It has now been very grateful to visit the President of Turkey in Russia and Africa.
Therefore, this vector of external policy will develop and promote Turkey's positions as well as regional as international warming," considers experts.
The UK believes that Turkey's return to older EU relations will be unfortunately difficult, now the question is whether the EU will be easy to respond to Turkey, which can go to opening borders for migrants and creating the most serious problems for Europe.
Teenagers of young doctors: Calls to new collective protests
The representatives of young doctors were requested to authorize new collective protests in their dispute on the new working treaty.
The Committee of Youth Medicinals (JDC) of the British Medicinal Association (BMA) is intended to request its full Council to support more collective protests from the beginning of September.
JDC said, the ministers could not respond to the work treaty questions.
Gentlemen and Medical Students in July voted for the abolition of the Working Treaty agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58 per cent of its members in secret vote.
In a letter to the members published in Twitter on Thursday, President Elen McCort said that the Government continued to keep the problems that she said had brought to the rejection of the working treaty.
She said: “In view of the survivor, the Chief JDC voted for the rejection of the proposed new working treaty in full compliance and called for official repair negotiations on all your matters.”
In response to the silence of the Government, leader JDC has made the official request for the BMA Council ' s external meeting to approve the unlimited programme of enlargement of collective protests from early September.
Against the fact that youth doctors had participated in six deficiencies in this year, including the first total damages in the history of the State Health Service.
The leader of young doctors of BMA, Dr. Joan Malvana, was detained after voted for the abolition of agreed conditions of the working treaty, which recommended BMA.
He said to members of the BMA that the discussion was a good thing that should be accepted during the meetings before voted 54,000 young doctors and media students.
After the vote of the Minister of Health, Jeremy Hant said that this working treaty would be used for medical workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Allians of the evil ones?"
It was the shot that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Turchia to shot the hands and to announce the official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Virgin Puntin welcomed his Turkish colleague in the building palace in San Peterburg, I have made a sustainable impression that Ankara wants more reconciliation.
It was handy, yes.
But the laughness of Mr. Puntin looked at it, and he's not enough if he's a hot even according to his own standards.
Regipe Taype Edogan, opposite that, in the opposite way, spoke of Mr. Puntin's great second -- five times in accordance with one report.
I lost the account.
He also promised that the relationship with Russia would be returned not only to their recruitment, but even above.
On the next day, one newspaper described the actions of Mr. Eddogan as if nothing was wrong.
I think his enthusiasm was deemed back.
But the deterioration of Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader forgeted nothing.
In fact, the crisis was the first reason he mentioned in the introduced comments: Turkey had a Russian consumer in Syrian border.
The response of Moscow at this time was insufficient.
Mr. Puntin spread the anger of an Ankara's condemnation of Moscow in the back.
The offence was more strong than the proposed friend.
Reconstruction of real confidence will be difficult, probably impossible.
The Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
During months of control of the SIM States, an accurately attack on Ankara has been conducted.
It appeared soon that Turks should be considered guilty in all.
The most serious accuses were of the representatives of the higher guide that Mr. Eddogan's own family was in the illegal trade of the Syrian region controlled by the Islamic State.
He denied it decidedly.
But in San Peterburg, the official signal was made that it was time to move further.
Finally, this meeting was only because Mr. Puntin had received an excuse that he requested the President of Edgegan.
Russia could argue for the gain of his kind.
For Ankaria, the privilege of the reverence is clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all friends that he could get after he was almost disappeared from his stage in the past month when he tried to turn.
The re-terrorism attacks on Turkey apparently have also disappeared it.
There is also an economic reason.
The Russian sanctions have been strongly attacked, particularly the prohibition on a quarter field, which usually brings several million Russian tourists to Turkish camps every year.
The number of ranks fell almost 90 per cent.
With regard to Russia, the tourists and the craft companies here, of course, feel easy when the fields finally resume.
They stand at the end of the season on the Middle Sea.
Even at this week, the public television has predicted more deep fruits and fruits as only Turkish imports of agricultural production will be recovered again.
"Trites there, the roads back here," said in the report of the Yearly Journal.
But the visit also had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara was bad in Western because it was considered a weak answer to the attempt of turning.
Add to this its long-term disappearance of discussions on accession to the EU and Mr. Puntin's step, which is trying to use the deterioration and gradually destroy Turkish connections with West.
The Russian leader, of course, gained malnutrition balloons with Ankara for calling for the support of the elected authorities after the attempt of public transfer.
You mean, this is the data for Moscow, which has its own deeply depressing fear of the change mode.
So, the same thing in this bunching duty at the seaside allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine that one analytic described me as "Aliens of the wicked," two countries who feel rejected and destroyed the West, join forces.
However, despite the public indication of reconciliation, these two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow recently positioned as a peacekeeper, but where Russia and Turkey support the opposite sides.
It may be said to himself that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, two Presidents have given the press conference, they have not even disrupted the topic.
The Chairman of Turkey had intensely fled the answer to their differences, while Mr. Puntin had anticipated them.
There is no clear agreement in how they can find a general language in Syria.
But after months of open impressiveness, and taking into account the possibility of full catastrophe when the NATO members of Turkey had a Russian reactive consumer, it is better that two leaders are at least talking again.
The Kingdom Bank will disappear clients outside Scotland
Brendad RBS should be addressed to the role of the bridge-ofis, according to the Executive Director of the Bank.
The Kingdom Bank will disappear clients outside Scotland.
Ross McEvan told BBC Scotland that the bound RBS was related to global bank ambitions.
The bank departed from them since he almost moved eight years ago and had to be saved.
During this period, the Brendan Strategy used “RBS” to protect other consumer credit banks.
He was supported by millions of sponsored international sports from Cuba ' s six nations on the reign to the whippiece of William Andy Muurrea.
But now it was decided that it was right to allow more national burden to go to the first plan.
The Kingdom Bank will be used with Scotland clients but will not be launched.
In England and Wells, all references to RBS, including the external office and funding board, will be amended to NatWest.
Brenda Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller burdens for the bank service of private persons that will receive more influence — Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr. McEvan gave an interview during the tour of clients and staff in Ivernesshire.
He said BBC Scotland: "Brend RBS finally will be our investment burden and the persons in which our staff will be occupied, because we are now a larger level of the Brendan Bank."
As the bank itself became a global burden, RBS became a global burden.
I say now we have no global effort, we have local challenges.
Each of these boundaries will represent something else in their population groups and our staff will work with customers under these burdens.
RBS has already stated that it would not continue to continue the sponsory support of Kuba six nations, and it would generate a profile of different boundaries in sports.
"It's a close time for us to move the Brendan Bank, as on the basis (we asked) how we focused on the improvement of the bank for clients?" said the executive director.
It's been very chinic three years ago, if we'd say we're going to be a wonderful bank for clients and we'd close all these boundaries.
But with the work we did, focusing on client needs, not our own, I think you see a lot of changes.
We can return these brounds again, so I think the time is close.
The Dictators arrived to 3000 winners in Newmarquet
The Dictor is deployed by the Shampan, after the damage in Newmarquet was led to 3000 wins.
Jakoy Franky Dictator has reached its 3000 British winners in Newmarquet on Friday.
He came to this removing note through his second winner at his home road at the Persis studied by John Hosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is a six-year jacket that reaches the removal in the slides.
He needs to take Mr. Hordon Richards, Dougam Smith, Lector Piggott, Pat Iddery and William Carson.
The thirty chip of the Dictator, who'd ever win at Ghayyar, said, "It's something special."
I'm very excited because my family's too here.
I'm very glad that it happened in Newmarquet, so I've been here 30 years ago.
This is not a great light measure, it's not Royal Ascot's usual evening from 20000 people.
I'm free of business and I'm very unfair.
The Director accepts applaudements when the Proposal has been proposed after gain
Two chips reached such notices in the sacks: Richard Johnson, and the 20-quarter cupion, Mr. Antony Macka, who had more than 4300 wins for the recorded carrier.
Lester Piggot, nine Deerby winner, 4493 winners in Career
France is one of the best jokes of the modern epoche, and it is not wonderful that he reached the notice that many of them reached to him.
He's a strong and strong, but his tactical shooting is different from others in the green room.
He was a great representative for the shock, his enthusiasm and charism have taken factors in this sport a year.
I told France a few weeks ago to Esps, he would have brought 6,000 winners, unless it was only the fucking outcoming and big shocks!
And if seriously, France has introduced a larger part of 30 years in Britain to see.
He's a energy person that's good for British shoes, but more than it's an unbelievable fashion.
France Dictators discovered the extracted mark of the Francism Space with the horses
From the flowers to the swimming scores, France Dictatori is a symbol of British green springs for two decades.
It was shots and falls.
In 1996, he also overlooked the aircraft and had been discussed by the departure.
Three years ago, he began with difficulties when he returned after six months of discussion, but he showed the great power of the will to throw the calls and return to the form.
And perhaps not yet ended for some time, — the Director said previously that it would like to continue to participate in orations at least to 50 years old.
Putin dismisses the Chapter of Sergey Job
The Russian Chairman of Armymond Putin was expectedly led to his head of the Administration of Sergey Iwan.
Job was part of the faithful neighbour round of Pentin for many years.
This 63-year-old was now appointed a representative of the environment and transport.
The Declaration from Crille states that Puntin " had stopped released Job from his responsibilities to the Chairman of the Russian Administration," but did not call the reason.
Mr. Ivan since 2012, Anton Vino, was appointed a predecessor.
Mr. Vino, 44, the former diplomat.
He who was born at the capital of Estonia Tallina in 1972, completed the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MMI) and served as the Tokyo Office.
Afterwards he was the head of the President and the Government's officer, he reported the website of Querella, Russian.
At the appointment, he said, "Thank thank you for your confidence."
I think the most important task of the Administration is to support your activities as heads of States with a view to elaborating legislation and monitoring how your instructions are fulfilled.
Puntin reported a Russian telecanal on Tuesday that Job requested to release it from this post and recommended that Vienna would replace it.
Do you believe the laughter?
It's a move that made Moscow.
Sergey Iwana was one of the closest parties of the Regime Pontina and, as also served in the Council of Security, the CBC.
As a head of administration, he was one of the most powerful people in the country.
At the meeting with President Pontian, shown on the public television, both men stated that the Head of Administration was delayed in their own desire.
But, despite the laughings on the camera, it was a little sure of someone here, especially now, right before Parliament’s elections.
So, are these unprecedented consequences for power?
Nobody knows.
But the official declaration was that the person who ever had acted as a potential President, he was endeavoured to manage the Russian environmental policy, was met with a huge scepticism.
In the comments of Putin, which were published on the website, Ivan said, "I was true that at the beginning of 2012, I asked you to trust you in a conversation that very complex post, even if you were a problem position for four years.
Well, I was the head of the President's four and eight months.
Job entered the post in December 2011.
He previously worked as Vice-Premier Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the State Security Council, as Mr. Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, when Putin was the Federal Security Service Chairman (FSB), which was renewed by the CGB, Job was appointed to his Vice-President.
When Pentain came to the authority, he called Job, including five people he trusted mostly.
Sometimes Iwan was considered to be President of Russia after the second time of Putin, since the third term for Putin was contrary to the Constitution.
However, this post took another close party of Putin, Dmitri Mededov.
The Prime Minister was returned to the President after a period of three and half year.
Thomas Gibson's star series as a crimer after a dragon with a producer
Gibson was a member of the postings on the shows in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studies that produce series have announced its release in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played the Special Agency of Aaron Hotchera, offered excuses in Thursday before his disappearance was declared.
There were creative differences in the fields and disappearance in views.
I'm sorry what happened," he said in his statement.
Details on how the Guibson Personal will be exempt from a show followed by the FBR agents, as expected, will be done later in accordance with the ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios statements.
The 54-year-old actor, which was previously playing the main role in Darma and Greek network, was shown from the first session in 2005.
"I love the Faith as a Crime" and put my heart and soul into it for the last twelve years," said Gibson in his statement issued on Friday.
I hoped to attend him before the end, but now it would be impossible.
I would just like to thank the scenarious, producers, actors, our wonderful team, and, most important, the best adorators that show could just dream.
It is noted that the show will return from its 12th session on 28 September.
Records: Fisheries were landed in the Banf garden
A man from Banfa had returned to the recognition of fish appearing in his garden in Banf.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 fish could be pearls left by water meat.
Baine, living in 500 meters from the sea, has set the scope of this creature to Perikop in hope that someone could make a light on the two-year fish.
Kwinspherry Crossing: The most is now connected to Faiph
The project of $1,35 billion is now to be completed at May 2017
Ingenies connected the north plane and outcome of Queenspherry Crossing, which means that the mount is now connected to Faiph.
It's the first of the four smoke between the carpents, which are now coming to the end of all three kilometres of mount.
The camp segment of Faiph is now 600 meters long and measures 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tonnes, and 20,000 tonnes of beton and 46 kitchen of brass.
The project for $1,35 billion is now to be completed at my 2017.
Kit Braun, Minister of Economy, has visited the area today and was the first ones who walked from the land to the valley.
He said, "It is historical and symbolic moment in the construction of Queenspherry Crossing.
We are all witnesses of the engineering art in this project, where more than 30,000 tonnes of beton and have been used only for the construction of this part of the brass.
Despite the massive size and the weight of the ceiling between the vessel and the brain is a virtual operation with the use of an emergency addendum for the collection.
The total complex of approximately 79 per cent of all the brass is now on the place, for the last sections of the beton clothing was moved to Russia today, which means that it is ready to join the cell.
Michael Martin, the Director of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The mood is always significant.
In this amazing project, this smoke represents the most modern art.
After the last section of the road board and connecting it with the extended breastplain of the northern plate, we continued to close the remaining wearing on the north, or treated by the coast.
This was made by the removal of the north approach to 700 billion of the age.
It was a large operation at the same time.
Scale, because a 222 metres long, measures approximately 6,000 tonnes and should be increased in an axis of approximately 3 per cent.
It's amazing because the allocations on which the team worked were less — over a few millimeters in each direction.
Hopefully, all that's done very good.
salvation in the Salle of Molphre: Three men 'a chance to stay in lives'
Three men have been happy to stay alive, after they had gone out of the fishing ship to England.
The rescue station Moelfre RNLI argued at 13:20 by the British birth time on Friday, after the team saw the results dismissed in the Salon Molphre.
Three men from all forces tried to go to a secure place while their ship continued to walk.
"We've seen their ships around with them, and we've imagined the worse," said the Royal Savior Shift Moelfre Vince Jones.
"Wellfully when we droped on the water, the strong wind leaving him off from them," he added.
Two men were saved through a local fishing ship, and the third men of 60 years were found an extraordinary and escaped in the bus without a rescue.
All of them were undertaken on the boat of the salvation ship and were added to a salvation station.
Jones said: "The three men who are thrown into the water, have blessed that they are alive, and are fully unrealised.
In the ship carrier, he was an aircraft, but sometimes he disappeared from a man who managed the ship when she was crashed.
Somebody missed those guys today.
Pokémon Go, worthy of health and happiness
Be careful to see how to change the world.
Thus, adolescents and children don’t go out in the street to play, preferably keeping their free time looking on the screen, was the fault of many of the last decades.
Pokemon Go disappears people from a surprise and takes into some physical activity.
The time in the screen was significantly limited by television, then videographs and the latest smartphones.
It's so great to see that the technology and activity on the street are not interactive.
I, of course, mean the full impact that Pokémon Go is the application based on a personal, initially created for video playing in 1990 (the result of the generated multi-fold system, play cards and other responsibilities).
As many other pop cultures, this has lost a few years before that new game was available in the United States, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.
Starting in other countries was then detained with the mass-related call that overloaded servers.
In those days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost so much as in Twitter.
So how does it work?
Two words, players with smartphones are going to search for Pokemons that are covered by the GPS and, when discovered, can be "founded" (for your phone scene) or "paymans".
The generation played in the game, being young, was joined to the driving injury and turned from the visions for search.
The game has resulted in significant increase in the number of steps passed by the "normal" person daily.
Cardiogram, application for Apple Watch, which depends on 35,000 users, recently reported Washington Post that for two days since the starting of the game, the number of people who have performed 30-minute tests daily, was 45-53 per cent.
The company don't know who plays in Pokémon Go, it just sees the primary data on the origin of levels.
Many health campaigns that survive people to “deteen 30 minutes”, “to be awaited” and “active every day” have not been revoked, because most health messages are missed and expressed persons who seem unfortunately.
Nevertheless, the importance of physical testing cannot be deemed.
Those who are regularly attracted reduce the opportunities of development to a cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps the correction of weight, high pression, diabetes and a long list of premiums, too long to bring here.
But the Pokémon Go is that she's driving people on the street to do what they love.
Three health foundations are therefore covered: movement, light air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even bring new friends to a pleasure.
Like usually, there are miserable damage that seeks to be grateful.
Yeah, somebody can touch the door.
Well, what?
There's a break.
Despite the application for smartphones, such as Fitbit could and previously see our physical activity, they did not give us the case for jobs as it gives this game.
The newspaper will be seen and the use will be reduced with time.
However, because of the success of Pokemon, there will be more games that will assemble applications and virtual reality with the real world by helping many people to be more active, good and healthy.

Simon Bayles plays the absolute primary of women ' s gemnolist
Forget the pressure.
Forget the fucking.
Simon Bayles is inconsistent for all this.
Dinamics on the pocket.
Unlawful to lie.
He's on the pool.
It's funny everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic Chepyon.
The 19-year-old American gemnastic was high to the title of the absolute firstness of Thursday, placed the rest of the world in a consequenced demonstration under the Olympics ' attention.
His general ballo 62.198 was sufficiently removed from the silver medication and company on the Fiscal Pirate Bay, Eli Raisman and the Russian Bretagne of Alie Mustaffin.
Byls from the United States, it is a timistic burden during the female of an absolute identity on the artistic gemnolist in 2016 of the Olympic Games in Rio-de-Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.
Byles became the fourth submission of a American woman who won the title of an absolute privilege and the fifth, in fact, strengthening her republication as a better of her generation and may be.
She was disappointed when she showed her end-good ball and its long journey was over.
This achievement will be made in the same line that exclusively strictly easily, such as Michael Felps, which highlighted their forms of sport at the new heights:
Byls had been held over the past three years, household in his sports, playing 15 meals of the kitchen of the world - including 10 gold-- with such appreciated programs in their lack of work and accuracy that Mary Lu Retton called her "the greatest gymnast which I ever saw."
One last test was waiting for Brazil, not so much between Bailz and the rest in this area, how many expectations were expected between it and the goods.
Something less than returning to his family to Spring, Texas, with the sweet of gold meal would be considered as an unexpected expected.
Simon Bailz of the United States, the left and Eli Raysman are engaged after the winning of gold and silver, respectively in the final of the absolute indigenous person on the artistic hymnicity in the Olympics of 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, August.
Builds made the first gold in the Tuesday, becomes a beautiful finance record for the springing party of the Coordinator of the National Countries of Marta Kingly.
While Bayles argued that she never looked at the future during her long way on the top, it wasn't exactly like it.
Often, its free testing programs — and which includes its French past — has been set to the Latin American music that would go directly as a house on the street right beyond the Olympic Arne Rio.
It's not a agreement.
The girl who was nice to her grandfather and dad, starting to walk with the child and opened mother of the Emy Burman trainer during visiting the hall where Burman was a trainer, became a force.
She did not play any event of absolute primation from 2013 — a position of luck, which should continue as long as Bayles would like it.
Although Mustafin had received a small advantage with two borrows, it was a mixture.
Hymnastic liver and free testing — where Bailz protects the calling of a kipyone of peace — in the board.
She went back from 15.433 to the pit and ended from 15.933 on the floor.
Rainsman slowly pulled her until they waited for the final account — pure formality — and the laughs appeared around a bright red with white and blue rays for the eyes of Bayles when she thought she had ever recorded in the album for the exhibition.
The Reisman ' s statement was a small place over four years ago when she shared the third place, but had lost the Mustafian brown on the ty-brake.
This time the 22-year captain of the team called Americans, was a lot of progress.
She sent a jacket after her free trial, a return covered that sometimes seemed to be subjected.
With regard to Bayles, the 19-year-old thirst of the beginning of this week is now a new importance:
Police: Three victims of serious murdered during the hearing of music in the car
Two women and 12-year-old girls who died during the death of the first series of the murder of Phineas during the last decade, were sitting in the car, talking and listed to music when they killed, according to the reports of the police issued in Thursday.
Angela Rosel Layner, Stefani R. Elise and the daughter of Elisa, Mallia, were scattered on 12 June when their car was kitchened on the past, the authorities said.
The speaker made approximately eight shooters from the ball, standing from the passenger side, then hiding the other vehicle, is reported in the report.
The police states that three murders, most apparently, are not a result of deployment, since the malicious investor did not take the cells of $2,900 or $2,900 for an adult victim.
The representative of the police of Phineas, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said that the flag had built followers to check whether he was not related to four previous attacks.
All seven people were killed and two others were killed by nine attacks in two primary Latin American areas during four months.
"It's happening in a living area before the house," said Howard KPHO, CBS staff at the beginning of this month.
It was suspected that several vehicles were used, including the core Nissan end of 1990, black BMW end of the 1990 and white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The leaders refused to discover witnesses that brought them to find that attacks were linked to one and the same murder.
Elise, 33, was studied with pains and later ended.
Layner, 31 years old, and Elisa daughter, Malaya, died in the place.
The Witnesser told the police that there was nothing uncertain that they were sitting in a parking car listening to music.
The authorities also published the police on the strike report, which was an empty pikep for half a three-hour killer, and that, as they believe, was the case of a serious murderer.
The followers found the jail and throwed the pocket out of the seat and the figmans cut out of the moon.
The mother of the six-year-old kid with the micro-shake: "There's better."
As the majority of six-year children, Edmund Pixivto loves drinks, plays and, of course, her mother.
But the result of genetic violations that his mother Elizabeth had not known when marriage.
When he first came home, my first thought was -- I can't do this.
I can't do that.
I haven't signed it.
What, actually, isn't true, you're surely signing it," she said.
She and her husband Vincent said Edmund might never know them, and he couldn't even survive.
Some doctors even suggested to put it into a specialized medicinal institution.
"My first answer was, 'I didn't think people were doing so,' she explained Pixivto.
Edmund's going through the carriers.
Edmund wasn't sitting up until he's finished three, and he's not telling it yet.
But he slowly passes some stages.
He's going to go with a special help and bottles to the volocypeda.
He also loves playing with two brothers and drinking.
Elizabeth shows the shot that Edmund's thought for "Follow me."
"We're going to learn his stew language," said the CBS News Pixiv.
But it's not just the usual language of stews — she says that Edmund found his own shadows.
Microtephalia may result in a number of different circumstances: genetics such as Edmund, infections during pregnancy from viruses such as core and Zika.
Symptoms and suggestions can be significantly different.
It's too early about how it's going to live those who are infected by the virus of Zyakia.
The precisely recalls emotional loss because of the undetermined future.
I've always said what's going on?
What's going on?
And she don't know yet.
I really didn't have a prejudice for all life, because I don't expect someone really could tell me.
But Pixiv has a discovery advice for children's mothers with the damaged defects from Zyakia.
It's gonna be better.
You know everything will be better for you.
You'll love your child, and your child will love you.

Why do we need Simon, Gabby and Lori
This is what I call the Women's Olympic County on the gennists of this year and for several reasons.
First, I was on every Little Olympiade from 1984, and the United States were never so threatening.
And second: in this collection key role, three gemnastians play: Simon Bayles, Gabby Dungo and Lorene Lauri Ernends, who have already inspired so many white girls.
The rest of this collection, complemented by Eli Rainsman, who is a Jewish, and Madison Coshan, who is a Catholic, is all being fiered.
This gathering looks finally like America.
This also strengthened the black and Latin American women's presence at the top of this view of sport.
In the past four years, a female gemnasty number was a African.
In the past year, Simon and Gabby were No1 and No2.
It's powerful.
In the past Olympiade, Gabby Dungo was an unexpected Olympic Chepyon, and America was welcomed.
The world could now be a witness of unbelievable statements of the three-quarterm Championship of Mira Simon Bayles, Dungo and Laury Ernends who were unexpected but less virtuous logistics.
In Thursday, Simon became a fourth American undertaking gained by women's absolute primation.
And Eli Rasman's colleague sold money.
We are witnesses of this kind of sport, but he doesn't look like this in the gemnastic sections throughout the country.
Simon, Gabby and Lori chose all the same way as Eli and Madison to form an olimpic collection.
They're a "final fibre", because the next olympic collection on the gymnastic will have only four gemnastes in the team, and it's the last year of Marty Carley's trip.
But in reality, gemnastics are a road sport, and the genesists first are trained in private gemnastian clubs supporting parents who pay the value of education, discretion, travel, form, contributions in orders, guest services (dependings and households) and continued.
Most of these logistics clubs are located in rich profit areas that can support this business.
These clubs are where gemnasts get everything from their triggers, and this is a way and long-term responsibilities for the family of the genostians.
Heymy Burman, Simon Bagles, and Maggie Hani, team Larry Ernends, both triggered their sports from the moment they took the geniussis.
We must create a more acceptable price and accessible gemnastic education to the community of a unmarried number of young girls inspired by Simon, Gabby and Lori.
I found my gymnast fund 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we have already provided free and disagreement of the gemnotics located in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young children (the main, black and Latin Americans) and have been endorsed in national and international chepenon.
In September, we will be enlarged in Detroit (My family) to provide a high-country gemnasty of young people who have the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympian view of sport.
The hyposistics develops the strength, density and coordination for the body, as well as sustainability to extreme work, dissipiness and sustainability for mind.
This assumption shows a positive impact on good health, success in school and work.
The inspiration of this collection will send thousands of girls to take gemnotics, and it's great.
It's so important to take the sports, especially for girls.
Now that's a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simon, Eli, Lori, Gabby and Medisson for this serious demonstration of the Gender Force in the player of the commanding olympic gold and for moving so many girls of different origin to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Young doctors had announced further delays after rejecting the proposal of Jeremy Hanta
The Ministers hoped to conclude disputes on change, agreed with the modified treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 per cent of 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July Hant renewed the plans to introduce this treaty, said that NHS was on the " lower land" and any subsequent delay was damaged to staff and patients.
The first young doctors are transferred to a new treaty, which includes changes of work at night and outcome to improve the service at an extraural time.
Dr. Elen McCott, Chairman of the Teacher Committee, BMA, said tomorrow in a statement: "The young doctors still have serious threats on the proposed treaty, particularly that he is enquirying the working crisis and that he cannot apply to all doctors. "
There were over eight weeks before the first team of the doctors will be transferred to a new contract required progress and the outcome time.
The attempt of VMA to allow negotiations was met by the desire to take action and sometimes a full silence from the Government.
And this, despite the promise of Jeremy Hanta in the past month that his door is always open.
"Jerves Hantu must now act, encourage the introduction and reaction to the danger of young doctors.
If he doesn't do that, young doctors are not in mind that they are ready to organize follow-up.
The last stage, at the end of April, brought approximately 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 receipts, while sisters and advisers were included to ensure the replacement of doctors at the psychiatric line.
The Ministers hoped to conclude the dispute on change, agreed with the changed treaty with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
IMO wants a better payment for 54,000 young physicians who are under the operation of the treaty.
Daniel Mortimer, Director-General of NHS Employers, called for young doctors to not continue deployment.
Mortimer said: "The burdens have a little or nothing, but they have pressure on those already working at the end of the commands and services, and cause concern, physical pain and dissemination to patients, sisters and their families."
During the past two months, we talked to the Committee with young doctors and together with the Department of Health and others, have been positively responding to their threats concerning the role of the oaks and corporate information policy.
Workers hoped that the continued positive assistance to other important issues, such as the allocation of staff, the hypocrisis of education, additional education for those who returned to carrier, the cost of education, mutual recognition of the education plan, academic release and gender differences in medical payment, were recognized how serious employees, England Health Education and the Department of Health had gone to observe the conditions achieved by the MM in November, February and May.
The prepatriate of 2 ox per day may reduce the threat of heart attack
All patients with heart attack are willing to be re-pacted by 2 million per day after the authorities recommended to give it more people and for more time.
The proactive claim of the tokagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent attacks for people with heart-related diseases.
The claim is already defined for 12 months after a heart attack, which reduces the risk of incident or a new attack.
The NICE National Health Service for Britain was encouraged to give him for four years to continue to exclude the risk of heart-sociated problems.
However, now the NEC National Health Service has encouraged Britain to give him people for four years to continue to exclude the risk of heart-related problems.
The heart attack is of approximately 140,000 people in England annually, and four of them are another attack or insufficient.
The heart attacks and insulins are resulting from the clothing of green material on the walls of the arts and the sharing of blue.
If the flower is spread on the part, it may become a cause for a trimba renewing, blocking access to the heart and caused heart attack.
And if the thromb moves, he could move the blood stream and lock the blood to the brain, he screwed the insufficient.
People who have already reached one attack are subject to more risks to get another.
The Ticagrelor, produced by the British Franco AstraZeneca and sold under the name of Brilic, reduced the risk by making less faithful threes.
The draft NEC instruction issued today recommends that people give 90 mg to the past 12 months, and then 60 meters with aspiry two times on the next three years.
Professor Carl Loungson, director of the NICE medical technology assessment, said: “Although there are effective methods of secondary prevention, approximately four people in which a heart attack has already occurred another heartly attraction or inconsistent — often with destructive consequences.”
The fear of repeating may have a significant negative impact on the human quality of life.
There are evidence that the ticketgrelor is consistent with the aspirine Effective in the reduction of the risk of follow-up heart attacks and incidents of people who have already moved a heart attack.
Provisionally recommending the ticketgrelor, we are pleased to enhance the options of treatment available to many thousands who are ready to use it.
Since the information on the effectiveness and security of the tokagrelora, particularly the risk of blooding — for the end of the three years, the project of instruction is not recommended that the treatment should be more than this time.
The CCP authority qualifications allows to facilitate vote accounting in musulman areas
Mr. Tauer-Hamletts Lotphur Rahman was detained from the post in the past year because of the corruption, served by the Government's report.
Political correction has been closed by the closure of the general fixation of the votes in the musulman communities, on the information from the disarmatic report of the Government of today.
The former officer of Ministers, Mr. Eric Picles, is confronted with the crisis of the police, the observers for elections and the administration of cities for the ignoration of violations in the elections by "external sense of racial property and religion".
The former secretariat of the local communities, now the Anti-Corruption King, reported that the damage of the electors in the religious ground was so strong that the police had to allow the borders outside the border of electoral participants to protect the vulnerable electors.
He proposes that the electors should accept personality to demonstrate who they are when they vote.
At this time, the electors must only indicate their name and address.
The report also suggests that the unmended tickets on the fingers of people when they give up their bulletins to exclude somebody to vote twice.
Mr. Eric said that we need to provide the best protection to the visitors.
He calls upon the press to give great access to the local Council documents and decisions adopted by informal committees or working groups.
"It is not only in order to protect mineliness from election, but also to protect the local Government from the opener culture of corruption and financial minority that comes with her on its hand," he said.
The report was described by Duuning Street following the vote in Tauer-Hamlets in East London.
In the past year, the special court considered election issues decided that Mr. Luffur Rahman had to be resolved with a position in relation to a long overall corruption and illegal activities.
The Court discovered that Rahman had "ciniciously proclaimed" religious feelings of his musulman community and had encouraged the criticisms of the racism and the islamics.
Rahman said, "Sir campaign, based on the fact that the obligation of musulmans had to vote for him."
To 300 votes have been discussed or have been the result of the personance when a person voted to represent someone else.
Mr. Eric said that my crime was witnessed throughout the country.
He expressed special threats concerning the offence with the e-mail vote in which the older members of the Muslim community as reported have been pressed on people to vote them for the chosen candidate.
Mr. Eric, on the photograph, made a few recommendations on the cleaning of the vote system, including the requirement of ensuring your personality to prove who you are.
The report states: "The evidence of the pressure provided to some vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular for women and youth, should be voted on the will of elders, particularly in the Pakistanic and Bangladesh communitys.
"It was a danger that... the public institutions have closed their eyes to such a behaviour because of the extreme sense of political correction for ethnic behaviour and religion."
Sir Erik gave 50 recommendations for the cleaning of the system, including the disappearance of political assets from the work of posters to vote in order to stop the vote.
The report, at the review of the Maye, also calls for existing registration checks to prevent the use of the electoral list for immigration and privileges.
The option is explicit to require voters to demonstrate acknowledge the personality before the vote.
Use the unmended cards on the fingers of people as they're just throwing their bulletins to make somebody vote twice.
Provide systematic verifications of nationality to make sure they have the right to vote.
Introduction of a three-year limit on the claims to a automatic e-mail vote.
Admit political parties to campaigns and actives from work with complete votes and post-employment contributions.
To give the police power to establish borders around the electional participants.
Amend the law to facilitate the allegation of the accused persons under the presentation of the People ' s Act 1983.
Make a illegal photograph on electoral parties.
To make the requirements only to use English on electional parts (excluding Wals).
Increased training to ensure that the voters are delayed to go to the home.
Mr. Eric is angerously attacked by the city police and stated that it was "properly", that no criminal accuses were presented after the case of Tauer-Hamlets.
"The setting of elections disabilized Lutphara Rahman and his agent for a long list of corruption and illegal actions," reported he.
He was recognized in the absence of clarified doubts — a criminal standard of evidence — according to a number of reasons.
He also criticizes the unresolved "verifications for the galax" of the electoral registration of town administrations.
Mr. Eric stated: "The past year of the court in Tauer-Hamlets was a sign to continue.
Our nation has an enormous heritage as the mother of the parliamentary elections, and however, a fearful and secret proliferation of election and the state of refusal by some bodies threatened this good republic.

Analysis Bayron McDonald fourth place at the end of the 14-year-old Aay Janah on the free style of 4 x 200 meters of CBC in the direct transport of Olympiadi
The CBC announced to be excused after one of its commentaries said that the 14-year-year-old Chinese powder was "avorted as a bull" and "sweet as a swine" during the ocean.
Commentary Bakon McDonald thought that his microphone was disabled when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the final female stage 4x200 meters of free style.
It could be heard like McDonald, who had brought to the CBC comments command to "detect it with the colour," said, "The 14-year-year-old Chinese pulled the ball, baby."
It's so excited, starting like a man, died as a dog.
Thank you for that.
Aye Janhaan, who was 14 years old, graduated the second phase of the staff of 1:57.79 — 1.61 seconds of medication than the canades of Taylor Rack, allowed the candidates to relax from China.
The volcanoes in all Canada have rapidly reacted on the network after the tonn and the expressions used.

And yet it was an uncertainly and unfair election of words, and Baron is very sorry about what he said.
On Thursday, McDonald was excused directly and tried to explain his comments, stated that he didn't think his words were abused as an attack on personality.

Primark buyer has affected a woman who had an expensive example of the low store of store
The buyers didn't know where to look when some woman had been discovered to look at the carriers at the stage of Primark's middle of Primark.
What even worse, she looked out as she looked at them, put them back on her neck.
She continued to search and died four parks of a lower beach in the store of Bouverie Place in Flaxton.
Magazin Primark of the Buverie Place Trade Center in Falkton, where the woman was a 3-year-old carrier before put them back to the pillar
The mother of the two children of Jenny Davidson, who was at the shop at this time, said that after the example of a low bel woman again, "sat and gone out of the store, he didn't buy anything."
She said, "They couldn't believe what they saw."
Stating in the middle of the commercial hall, she took a pair of carriers from the vitrine, took their own rocks and the rocks and their lots.
"It didn't try to find any other place to do it -- she was just standing there, unfortunate."
"All were standed when she took the carpents again, and she did not like her, because she put them back to the pillar."
She did the same thing with three other guys before she finally decided that there's nothing that she likes, she was clothed and went out.
"It seemed to be worried who had watched her, or she thought of a person who would finally buy those princes that she was like."
The 33-year-old Jenny Davids from Kent, said, "It was opposed to think someone is going to take the house of a princes who have already been sent, but they haven't been paid."

The representative of Primark reported: "Premark knows about the results that happened in our store in Falkton on Tuesday, 9 August."
All of the goods on which it is said were eating out of the sale.
How to protect yourself from attacks with a kitchen by using a cocktail
It's the world that's a bit, but it's a video from Dailymail.com, perhaps, to help you make it a little secure.
We talked to Ron Mizrachi, Master of the Federation in New York to figure out how to work with armed civilians near the distance.
If there comes back or back, this video will show you how to kill his arms.
The first thing that you need to do is return to you to see the attacker and "allow the fire line."
Then you're smoothing the ball between your prepair and the pillar before you hit them in the face of the free kitchen.
Then the tribe should be in the pocket, and the attacker shall be cut off from the pain, you're throwing out of his hands, striking him in the face of the creature, and go back, holding the arms on it.
For the army gone forward, such a way is to select your body from the fire line, take the gun and drag it so that the wounds couldn't shoot.
At the same time you'll move the weight on the ball and touch the aggression in the herd, then put out the tickets out of his sick, before you go back and knock it.
Is it hard?
Look at videos and see how to do this to the Mizrachi.
But remember that the safeest exit from any deployment -- if you're not a magazine Crave-hay, it's to give your personal.
For the traveler Ian Rait, he conducts his language in the most afflicted places of Europe
The British traveller is under its immune system and the severe reefs of the trial, with some of the most huge and distorting places in Europe.
The leading and author book on trips of Yan Rait, 51, from Saffolca, conducted the European banking language, the Greek Pickadily Persis, the delusion button and the Russian public phone to demonstrate the power of its immunity system.
Before the calculation of each object, he used a liminometer to show us and us what he uses.
But the experiment that should be a film called the Pusher-Leisuan Guideline on the Interior Sile has given some wonderful results.
It may be extremely disappearable, but actually there are worse bacteria in the cowboy.
During Europe’s entire travel, Rait spoke with doctors and doctors on the increase of oxygen bacteria and his own health.
Happy pleasure, nothing of the complaint has brought to him more than a bad injury in the rain.
Rait was recognized by testing for its own kitchen, traveling on peace and food for strange and wonderful things.
From public pearls to the smoke button, this task, unfortunately, proved its immune system.
In a film he took away, he said, "I was completely unemployed in relation to my health, and I have thrown many different things in the mouth of the earth, eating the cows and the dangerous water."
Of course, he proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused — a huge Russian public tunnel.
His testing brain demonstrated the meaning of a luxury metre exceeding 4000 units.
For comparison: only the sleeved hands should be within 60.
But there was a Russian public tual that refused to illustrate, after the meaning of his lyminometer was more than 4000 units, while only the mixed hands shown less than 60.
Rait and the Finan Manufacturer of Mole Products, Valio, took a film on the traveler called "The Protector-Leisuan River" on the Interior Sile, which demonstrates the number of bacteries in different places, such as the Tualette
He told: "It's close to one of the best things I've shot in the nail."
Nothing worse than that!
I'm not going to get anything out of it, because it's funny.
"The Protector-Lisuan Internal Sile" was taken together with the Finnish Mole product producer of Valio.
The company provided Ratus Valio Gefilus, containing oxygen bacteria and C and D vitamins, to help accelerate human oxygen bacteria and to develop immunity system.
The former Vice-President Valio for Shoes, Shoes and New Categorys said, 'We really wanted to offer the consumers a new thing.
What would be interested to see, and at the same time it could explain the benefit of the provisions.
We had a brain crap that ended the ideas "Don't call Jona."
They claim that the interest for the health of the kernel is a global appearance.
Instead of speaking of products, we wanted to put them into a great context: good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of the kitchen health and how it is related to the immunity system.
The increased interest in the health of the kitchen is a global appearance, and we have been able to provide more information to the consumers in an interesting form.
I also think the film shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who was a recruiter of the film, added: 'I say so: I would lose the respect to Jonah if he had made some of the things I asked, for example, the negative Russian tunnel shown in the film.'
Of course, some things of Jonah were easy to calculate, and some were quite hard.
I'm glad that some of these circumstances have been able to sleep on the scene.
During the survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 per cent of republics have linked oxygen bacteria exclusively with the good state of iron and oxygen, and 58 per cent said they used at least sometimes products containing oxygen bacteries added.
The huligan family destroyed the Salam, the municipal house of Cornold, a ransom
The Huligan family left his municipal home with loss of $50,000 since they were released for the destruction of their neighbourhoods.
Tann Skeldon and her partner Shane Trebelkok shot out of their objects of displacement in Salam, Cornel, after a long list of complaints against them.
Since they were strictly removed from the object of non-mobility, the housing-building cooperatives discovered that object of non-mobility in the state required.
The stars were left with the smoke, the powders were covered, the mudder was scattered by the pool, and the walls were scattered by the graffiti.
Family is now moved and is supposed to live in a private apartment
Donna McEwa, a divorced in Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid she wouldn't save him.
She said, 'It was an absolute cocktail for people here, and I don't think people should live so.
There are many things that need to appreciate, because this object of non-mobility probably will be known as not a very good aspect of Cornelius.
This family uses a foolish glory, and their name is a foolish glory.
Three children who lived in a timely in movement, and the police reported that the world of the terrible family included droughts on the street with biosbole battles, the pollution of neighbouring areas, drug use, drug trafficking, extreme crises, disputes and disappearance.
Skeldon, 47 whose name was on the apartment contract, received order for anti-social conduct in June.
In several rooms of the house that might be snown found a old moor
The households in which drugs were sold were lost
The meetings say that they had seen dragons on the street and have regularly visited the police
Cornwall Housing was deprived to get out of her house and her partner at this week after the 11-week period was delivered for voluntary department.
The meeting was welcomed by neighbours who said that their lives were converted to the nearby.
One said, "He didn't worry about anyone."
We lived near them 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times when we saw the police here, it's unbelievable.
'Thank morning we couldn't sleep.'
We got up because we've been so quiet here, we'ven't reached it!
Now when they're finally gone, it's gonna be great.
Adam Philip Patrick, Chief of the Cornwall Housing Neighborhood Group, said that the family could not cooperate with local authorities.
Family lived in the house 20 years, with the police and regularly called the police.
Manufacturer and old games have been thrown down below on the growth side of the municipal house.
He added: 'It's a view that the applicant could not accept any responsibilities for the conduct of her and her family, as the exhibition is always the last method of action, which is considered by Cornwall Housing.
It was a very complex case, as the behaviour was predominant, and their action should be terrible for her observers.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police and the communities of Devon and Cornol have made to give us information.
I hope that this development will be a little comfort to neighbourings and will send a sign that a social behaviour will not be allowed.
The physic reported that all three sons lived in a different time, but said that they were all over 20.
Great matrix left in one of the beds of the house after the exhibition
The departure workers now must take the wedding of the smoke around the house
In 2014, the police had built a home and found more than 70 g of coops, as well as the weight of relevant ingredients and 1700 euros.
Skeldon was astraffuan, afterwarded drug ownership in class B to delivery.
She said that money was for her son, Le Skeldon, who died in a car catastrophe in 2013.
After their unfairnesses, Taiwan and her partner are now living in Plattim.
The rooms of many rooms in the house were graphics around the surface.
The police said that they will try to rescue residents who are not subject to the provisions of accommodation.
Angela Crou, from the police of Devona and Cornol, stated that the visit had been clearly advertised to other operators who continue to violate the rules.
'It is a message to those who feel that they can lead themselves without the accused of the accused, and those who cause such a behaviour', said she.
The proper and anti-social behaviour will never be allowed by Devon and Cornol police that will continue to work with partners to protect our communitys.
Turkish came into a terror when a low military aircraft was low.
In the Aviur city of Portuguese, the tourists in the sun were afraid of their lives.
Portuguese Solidarity P-3C Orion of the Military Aviation Agency was unrependly low
The military air forces reported that it had implemented the tripartial flight, but there was no risk for security.
This is the moment when the damage tourists start panicing, while the low aircraft was pushed over the overall floors.
The military aircraft, which is not at the distance of flowers from the pool in the north Portuguese.
The disappearing feet, when they had been understood by the noise of air movements, but have no opportunity to see what is moved through the clouds.
The Institute occurred last night away from the city of Aviation in Costa New.
Daniel Fernands, one of several of the disappearers who published the video of the shopping flight in social networks, said, "He's just past down a little two times, and there was a moment that he's got to be disappeared."
Well, Arroge added: "I'm buried by serphing and I swear, it was a feeling that the aircraft would fall on me."
Tourists on the surface of Aviation were terriblely feared when the aircraft appeared out of the tube and flood to the extremely low height.
The Portuguese Aviation forces today stated that P-3C Orion aircraft had performed a three-five flight to discover the fishing ships on the ground and had to be low as it was the only way to verify them.
Pilli stated that the aircraft was a little lower than usually because of the inconsistent visibility that was not invisible from the nearest forests, but the military air forces arrayed that no one had been undermined.
In those years, the forest flights had damaged the material part of Portuguese, as well as the lives of four people in the Madeira island.
The Portuguese Aviation forces today made a statement that the flat had to be so low in the power of the circumstances — the smooth tunnel and the power of forests that had disappeared the visibility
The aircraft performed a triniture flight, and the salon was ordered to find fishing boats within the job.
The HACS system has already been required for the public, but most of Peterburg restaurants have not yet been implemented.
The checks are more active and the business will be shot up to 1 million rubbers.
For more than a year, Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP, in Russian option HACS) - risk analysis and critical control points - the obligation to use producers and transporters, as well as the company in the field of investigation in Russia as a member of the Western Union (TB).
The testing of the Rosusus Supervisory business began in February 2015.
But until the officers are described only for individual violations of the regulation (see " Document Provision"...).
The non-compliance of the regulation is generally deleted by the undertaking of 600 tunnels for the first offence and 1 million rubbers for the second.
The HACS as a system, taking into account the risk of food products and preventing them, has been made into the United States in the 1960s.
Then it was about food safety for the astronaves.
The system is now used for all food companies not only in the United States, but also in Canada and in Europe.
Since February 2015, HACS operates in the territory of the CT.
The development and implementation of the business system had been four years (the HACS process was in 2011).
However, business officers and officers recognize that most companies have not even heard about this standard.
Unfortunately, we had long been sure that the standards were only regarding food production, but not restaurants, explained the head of the General Board of Elena of the Governance.
Now they're all trying to put it up.
At the end of August, the time was expected for the renewing of the frequencies to Turkey.
But they don't call for a life-related question, since their heading of audience family and children are already ready to school, notice experts.
Alens of the Turkish Agency yesterday sent a letter to the Government with request to allow the records now.
"For many Russian tourists, the question of the collection of quality and accessible marine disappearance is indirect, since in Crossadow and the Republic of Crime, most of the items of displacement have already been protected until the end of September, the authors notice that the opening of carriers in August did not have substantially complied on the demand of the Russian Sea tour.
As reported to the Russian Regional Office of Turkish Union, in the case of Russia's aircraft and Turkey, it is possible to wait for the renewing of the carriers to Turkey for a month.
It is mainly depending on the aircraft.
Technically, the aircraft can be trained in September, even August when the tourists are operationally put into place and agreed with the vessels needed," said Paul Romans, Vice-President Director of Communications and International Projects of the North-West Regional Office.
In his words, the possibility of renewing crafts is a good news, but it is not too important for the market retail, because the main buyers of fresh tubers family and children have already returned from departure and are prepared to school or leaving to other countries.
In the barat season, the tours are mainly the single travelers and pairs.
Several programs can be calculated on those who have the opportunity to relax the spontaneous," says Paul of the Romans.
"In Turkey, there are a chance of bringing many tourists, if it now gives very budget proposals - 50-60 tunnel rubles on two, because there are people who are valuatedly waiting very deep tours," says Varlie Rontal, General Tourist Director of Optio-Travel.
In other cases, it is not appropriate to calculate the main train mass already planned.
Paul Romans also believed that, since the regular flights in Turkey are requested, the crafts will also be met, but the aviation is not to wait.
"The Turkey starts now is the repair of the next season," said Paul of the Romans.
"The opening of the records in Turkey is the positive news for the next season," agreed by Varry Rubski.

The end consumer has faulted: Who actually buys plastics?
The only men of average years love guilty.
Until you have been abandoned to harm the section of the huge comments under the NWSO-Financies, which has been signed out of the factful data.
According to YouGov, a lot of delayed plastics is not a bum among the generations of two-year-olds that want to be a new material object and a mid-year natalgie.
Those who have recently bought a wine album c greater probability are in age from 45 to 54.
Furthermore, those under the age group of 18-24 are at least likely.
This is also not just an emotional event - that has an emotional importance: the elderly buyers have injured more chances of feelings (56% against 53%) and have been unity (69% against 66%).
But are you faithful results?
If this blog was a televisional newsporter, the camera would follow me until I went through the center of the surviving Soh Street, in a shame of cosme, and lowly steeling before the rest, composing hands and say something of an extreme way, "Yes, let's see."
Yeah, let's see.
During the heart of Soho is slowly left to his disappearance and grass — coffee, stores of paperchase are now filled with buildings, some of the independent vendors — a few music stores with fantastic specialists still remained.
I would probably request the camera to stop the next wall, in which I'm close to the different people in some of these stores and I'm trying to assess their age and emotional opposition through monitoring.
The Fourner of Glassgo Stuart, 55 years of which I went from Sister Ray (sheet of data: two young women, three in the middle years) to Reckless Records (reckless records: eight men in the middle years, a woman probably older 20 years) in London to take a meeting, and go on stores to take a few hours.
He's a collector, I'm asking?
"I think yes," he says.
I have about 3000 or 40,000 plastics.
These plastics, reflected above (when he sent me by an e-mail, I didn't persecute him home), walking lines on the walls of his guest.
His reason for the acquisition of such a huge number of albums and singles should be part of his expected income: he can now buy plastics that he could not allow himself when they went out and buy the objects that he sold when he was young and little.
"Much of the things I win -- it's the end of the 60th, the start of the 70th, the things that came out when I was 11 or 12, the things I probably was too young to buy," he said.
He agreed that the one who buys plastics, most likely, the investors who likes my own company added, "I don't smoke, I don't drink much.
It's my weakness.
Welles, 25 years old who worked in Sister Ray, also believes that many clients that he meets are corresponding to the YouGov profile.
He noted, however, the new concern of people who were under the impact of the brush in the SMEs, the people who heard the return and felt the obligation to buy their old plastics.
As a matter of discussions I have, people have been released from their collection as usually in 1998 or 1999.
The customers who have ever sold their wine to buy the computers now sell their computers to buy their plastics," he says.
This may explain a bum between the age of age.
What about the expected emotional importance of the plastic?
A few seconds in the store, such as Phonica, to understand that plastic stores offer a comfortable society with similar views.
According to Usa, some older clients, inter alia, are affected by the unnecessary payment system.
Some guilty beloved may feel hurt from the digital world and prefer to be removed in the condition of the knowledge of the plastics, objects that have a memory of the unemployed youth.
"I think that sometimes it may be executed by desert or possessed by material things as their kind of relaxation," says Wace.
As I'm the collector, I have that, and I think it's too many people.
It's a simple way to take your head.
"We're as their social workers," said a colleague from the clothes.
The ICM survey in April showed that almost 50 per cent of those who bought a wine album in the past month had not yet been listed.
The survey also discovered that 41 per cent of the player that they never use, while 7 per cent, of those who bought a fashion, did not play the plastic player.
At this stage of the new report, I would like to have seen seriously deployed with the Bosnov collectors.
The "Trofe" aspect of renaissance is what he noted Johnny, 42 years old, working in Sounds of the Universe (subscription of data: three men in average years).
" Someone came recently and said, 'I don't have a pill player, but I want to buy the radiohead plastic so we can put it to him," he said.
This is not a large percentage, but it's clearly happening.
The more complex, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a player of plastic."
These are younger people, who are not pregnant, less than twenty who only know that.
In Fopp, who has now put the whole stage of the crime, is a lot more different audience when I go.
There are pairs of 70, tourists that photographs, boys and women in average years.
Although the atmosphere is less unrealised than in the above stores, the last synthetics and pops Wild Beast, and not injury, is lost through the columns — it is pleasant to see the diversity in their customers.
No one of them looks particularly alone, but a painful psychological grain is difficult to establish 30 seconds next to someone.
Elehonor, 27 years old, walked on Fopp a few minutes, considering the various plastics available in the sale.
She's looking for goods, not for money.
It does not work a lot, according to its words, so gathering the plastics not very appropriate.
It's worth.
Listen to music on the computer or another device -- just, but the beauty has guilty -- it's... -- it's got a dream with a dream full of love.
I don't know how to explain -- it's really not again.
My last stop is a store that helped the new generation of lovers to be guilt: the city models.
As long as I create a illustration that I consider the D's shocks, I watch the group of young girls, every minute gathering around Polarid cameras, before the father and his daughter will begin to discuss the buyer of Crosley player.
On the left, a wall that is contained by Adel, Jeffaf Buckley, Emi Uynhaus and Flittle Mc: the timely style and classics, the obligatory plastics for any average collection.
No one looks — perhaps because they're just anxiety, some are so high on the wall, that would be impossible to touch them.
It's the true "sawful guilty."
However, considering that any attention to these items may mean more money for industry and send more clients to the Soho's depth for some time, almost not to what they want.
It is not surprised that the lows of the population, with more likely than most of the time and money are more than the most, are the ground that is the most money of rock objects, such as the hate.
But until my conclusions show that the results of YouGov are at least accurate, at least in the samples of the Soho plastics, they do not exclude the existence of a huge number of women-collectives and beloved guests that exist in reality, stores of plastics and online forums.
They may be working in all schools or offices.
But they are not obvious in the morning of Thursday, springing on the shops on Bervick Strit, prolifering plastics and escapeing views of a 30-year-old false man who depends on the pillars that do not suspect men in medium years.

The French Court refuses the proposal to put a store into the Jungle refuge camp
The French Court rejected the proposal of the authorities of Cale to summ the tens of self-employed stores and restaurants to the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
In court hearings at this week, Kale authorities said that the State should be able to make a total of 72 self-subsidies where people sold goods from the camps, from the sigarat to energy drinks, offers a tea of 50 cents (40r) or a simple observer for a few euros in self-Self-responses.
The prefection of Cale said that these places should be made, because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay the boats, and because they have a fire and sanitary risk.
Gumaniant groups said to the court that stores and restaurants were vital, noting that the free guards proposed by the Government Association and other groups are not sufficient for the growing number of foods in the camp.
They said that self-employed stores and restaurants often provide blood and free food for those who needed it.
The Court of Lila decided that there was no legal basis to cast out people from 72 self-employed stores but said that the problems of the Cal Prefector were fully understood.
Judge Jean-Fransa Molla said that the bacalees, coffee and restaurants played a lot of role than the correction of people who "live in extremely tackle conditions."
He said that space provided peaceful points for refugee meetings and volunteers.
One of the places that were threatened was the child coffee of the book Jungle at the camp, which does not work for benefits and offers 200 foods per day, occupation in English and French and assignment of asylum for hundreds of vulnerable young unfairs without coherence in the camp.
More than 170,000 persons have signed pirates to protect children ' s coffee.
The letter sent to Guardian said that his closure would be a catastrophe for those children, some of which are not old than eight years.
Two prosperity institutions, the Assistants and L'Auberge des Migrants in Tuesday estimated that the number in the Jungle camp has grown and exceeded 9,000 people — the highest of the whole story — after the rare increase of news over the years.

Fiji gave a master class to possess the low, rehabilitation, tendering, play support, leaving lines and huge forces to win gold, their first olympic meal of any color.
The pressure was not too poor in the form of silver — the third in Britain per day — and they could be proud of their efforts in the first olympic tour on Regibi-7, where New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa winners.
Boks' painful wound, 7-5 in the sandwich day, could be returned to be negatively telling them in the pital.
But, we don't see anything, Fiji has winned as much as it can't be one of 15 people.
This may be some comfort for Britain, but probably not — at least one British will spend tomorrow in the golden seam: the Main Many Ben Ryan, the former Chap of England from William.
It was some journey for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost each game at Adel Help Sevens.
Here they've lost everything else.
These attacks will cause pain, but progress will be vulnerable.
Fiji began greatly because of the slaughter of the Britain’s temptation to hide the wolk.
It was like to push on the pillar of carboons for Captain Tom Mitchell and the company, and the World series went up to 5-0, when Osa Kulinasa shot into the hook.
He had four minutes at the hours of Jerryr Tuwai added another tabad on the right flat that was realised.
12-0 and Great Britain grew up to the slope.
The great attempt of Michelle's slaughter had kept a man on the top of Leona Nakara to kill the third, but it just stopped Fiji.
During the seventh minute, Jass Vermuelah made a tabad on the right corner, and Britain graduated 17-0.
Nacaraa added another after the renovation and at the hour there was still more minutes... in the first half.
Bethmod Ravo was then deceived by a few further tempters of the Britain’s closure and a line to get an eye.
Realization brought to 29-0 interruption.
It seemed that Fiji had been born to play in record-7, while Britain still managed to reembols.
That's important.
Great Britain has performed mass replacements for half of the game, and they have arrested the Fijian Lamb... every four minutes that the first half standards was good until Joshua Tusiva passed after a few flat physicians interactions.
Dan Norton took an attempt for Britain, made a tabad on the left corner to become 36-7, but a game was long to go through the South Mora islands, whose fanatics were shots, danced and danced in the tribes.
It was not possible to endure full joy by Fiji’s approach.
Motham Wilem pushed a Fijiian Tutt, who didn't need the locking, and another attempt in the last seconds.
The records were made, the fijians were driving and the Great Britain fell on the gas, completely convicted.
On the same day, Fiji gained the Japan 20 to 5 in his sandwich, and Great Britain went a little from South Africa to the southern Polynell, one attempt to each of the Britain Realization.
Kaill Braun goes out to Boks in the first half, but Dan Norton helping some great work of the line and killed under the balls in the second half.
The latest attempt to hide Marcus Watson, brother 15, from England's team, Antony, has made victory, and finally a silver meal.

Their exhibition was absolute, at the end, their 39th sentence was again unprecedented.
What we seem, two slides sports that slide on the surface of the league are not fully reflected by the nature of the triumph.
For each gold, the bathrooms were prepared with a gradually growing gains that were important, and no hands were more important than the hands of a trainer, which 30 months ago, when he had set a cancer diagnosis, he didn't know whether he would live before to see this day.
As he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had a cancer of smoke, which is one of the things they could operate, and they did it.
If they don't do that, he's gone everywhere.
This could be quite bad situation.
She's a little changeing your kinds to the future.
Williams made a diagnosis in December 2013.
Three successfully he could start treatment in the beginning of 2014 by maintaining the break-up of the graphy, if it could be a right expression in such circumstances.
I needed the payment, so I had to go fast.
It was a style.
I was in the hospital and played at the office — 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at times, while they talked enough.
That's how it begins.
Greece himself is a journey, but it makes it a little more.
The next time after their winnings, the first thoughts were about Williams, who had held a nervous morning, speaking lower than usually in trying to overcome their own survivals.
Staning, Captain of the Arthillerian board with the Afghanistan's service on the pillars, said, "I was an emotional disappearance in this week, perhaps a little quarter, but it's so much."
It just reaffirmes how much this means for me, how many I and Helen worked, and Robin too.
These were three-year-old fantastics with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we would be no one, so great thanks to him, he is the best trainer in the world.
I couldn't ask a better partner for the trip or the best trainer.
Helen Glover and Hicer Stanting haven't lost any race for five years.
This couple provides a tended ritm that their competitors were never able to agree.
Even in the latest 500 metres when the teams of New Zealand and Denmark began near, Stanting and Glover had too much in stock.
We were very in the fass.
Helen said, "Stay in the process, stay in the process."
It's very important that you don't get away now.
We had a good life, and at the same time, we didn't try to do something marvelous.
We didn't wait for the Federators today, we just waited that we could get a good grass and go out and gain this race that we did.
Someone needs a year to decide your future.
The glober must be married in the next month, in its own televisive investigator of the Steve Bachulla.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say it's my last trick.
This would mean too much pressure.
In London, some six months needed to know that I became an Olympic Chepenon.
That was all so new, and I was so thorough.
It needed about four minutes here.
“ I feel so better, ” she said.

Participants are not expected that the Government described the conditions, noting that many players are not risking to be taken for a complex and road project.
Announcement may be announced in August and in October.
The mines have introduced the Government of Disponition and Conditions for the largest non-proliferated gold-building location in Russia of Suh Log (Irkut Area, Resources and Resources) to the two " sources " , known as the situation.
The project is outdoor in the middle of the evening.

The first is at the capital of representatives, not less than 25 per cent of hospitality.
The second is the response to access for foreign investors under the control of foreign investors from the understanding of the FS-57 of the innovation in the strategic society.
According to two FS articles referred to in the draft articles, as already wrote " ה'2 August, the company whose beneficiaries (25 per cent of lower and above) are not low RF residents or have a double nationality.

In the pension market, the largest M-A, "CIT Finnish Pension Administrator" launched the process of integration of four sub-control NFs.
The Gazphoned Pennsonian Buildings will be created by the NFF, with a amount of approximately 373 milliards of rubbers.
On the starting of the process of integration of four pension funds -- the KIT Finnish, the Promogrophoned, the Research and the Gazphond Pensional Coverships - yesterday reported the owner of 100 per cent of the OCT Finance Administrator of Finance.
"Reorganization is implemented in accordance with the ECB in compliance with the requirements of non-abortion of the contracts," said the company.
The integration is carried out on the Gazphond Pensional Couples.
As noted by the NFF Ole Bieloshik, the integration of funds allows several tasks to address: enhance the presence geography, concentration of resources for development, reduction of costs, pressure of the best practices of each of the funds and optimization of corporate management.
Accordingly, the original time of the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
The Gazphoned Pensional Couples will be a larger player on the OPC market.
As at 31 March, the amount of pensioning funds exceeded 373 billion EUR.
As a report on the funds site, their owner 'CIT Finance Pension Administrator' is currently an Anatool Gabrinco (as 65 per cent) and the Gazfand NFP (35 per cent).
However, the unit of the group has been lodged far later by competitors.
Yes, the O1 NPF Foundation Group has exploded the Steelphoned 'staphone' at the beginning of the current year.
At the present, the Joint NFP attends Uralsib and the Russian Standard Funds.
"According in the unique structure, except the reduction of expenditures, is necessary to address structural tasks," notes the NPF "Breach" Nice of Sidors.
The active work on the consolidation of funds from April and the Saphmar Pension Unit of the European Union, the European Union and the Regionphoned NF should be held until the end of the current year.
In 2017, NPF will be joined to them.
"The integration of funds will improve the impact of risks, operational processes and expenditures," noted the Safmar Pension Group.
Peace in the integration of the funds contained by the Finance Administrator of Pensions, the experts may be identified by several reasons.
Until the last time, the NPF could not be earned over 40 per cent from the infrastructure campaigns in which the group was actively located.
After amending the decision of the CBP in March of this year, a number of emittenes corresponding to the regulator requirements, there is no longer limits.
If the whole exit is necessary, one large player can be buyed," the director of ACRA Jurio Nogin's financial institutions indicates.
A number of NPF leaders from the топ-15 activities call for another possible reason of the poussy to divide the field of influence and, as a result, staff designs in the single fund that should agree to the owners of the group.
Yesterday, Anatholis Gabrilenco was not available for commentaries.
The Gazphoned NPP was also not responded to the request.
Although the funds consolidation and unfair measures will be justified by a long distance.
As noted by the Consential Competence Partner Sergey Okolesans, the Gazphond Pennsonion Buildings is less than outlines, access will be able to stabilize the basis of other group funds.
This will be a more successful NPF "CIT Finance" and "Promogrophone" in the building of different OPC sales, as well as the more modern use of GDP.
The need for processes and NFFs will continue to grow, therefore, to double infrastructure at four funds in the unique investment policy, he considers that the director on corporate refunds of the expert GR Paul Mittrofans is incredible.
"The effect of the reduction of duplicant functions will only be resuming the possible expenditures to the integration," said Mr. Mitrofans.
The costs for the integration of the four funds of Sergey Ocultan are estimated by 30 to 50 million EUR.
"The maintenance of four funds of such sizes are about 400 million euros in the year, with the consolidation of the medium-term budget, really reduced by Mr. Ocossalon."
The Russian Protocol was the best dissocian film Pete and his Dracon.
The Royal Arts of New Zealand, a pleasant dragon, an animal history and a cantri style sufficiently to believe again in the old magic, considers the Elena CRASSON.
The scary child was endorsed by the dragon who became a human child and unfair damage, and a given friend.
Pete calls her friend Elliot, in honor of the book of stories, plays with him in a jacket and dreams.
Six years after his left and in the winning license, it would not be differ from the other sense of the forest of Maulla.
In this species of Pita and finds a railway woman of Gres (Brass Dallas Howard), while the Brigade of Gavin (Karl Urban), her brother, aggressively disappeared forest.
Now she will have to believe not only in the existence of Dragon but also help him save him.
Pete's an exciting course to be a person in the ideal Americans who have a rocket, a moral code in the heart and are more heavy than any newspaper.
No person looks like and does not act too terrible to make the slaughter to hate or fear him.
Even Gain, who opened a pleasure to the non-third of his forests, was far away from the unfaithful wound.
The crude dragon was also unrepensed, with a good bulldog, a avian flowers and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon's sadly warm,music, even crowded, and, of course, does not say that it is all time to control, so it is likely to be different from all the known cinemmatic drugs.
The visual image of Elliota and his manager are ensuring such a high stage of emotional concern that in the most tensioned moments they begin to hurry in three hands not only small dreams, but also growing up.
It is a wonderful good and young young Ouks Filli in the Pita's role that is divided between the possible family and the present friend.
And Robert Redford provides a canony damage that would be pleased to have every child literally.
How could David Lowri leaving a fantly lack of the Drakon Pita film in 1977, averaged from the middle to the end of the rock and recalled only by the microx of animation and game film and make it to the most soul film of this year?
Not otherwise as the wonder has helped.
In his image, Lourie from the original, only took two things: the Sirota Pita and Dragon.
The fight remained musical numbers and the major part of strange shoppings.
In this well-knowledge, the names of the Bemby, the Innoplantics and many other lovers of children's hearts.
Disney’s study continues to increase the galerie of the XXI century high-scale rivers.
Of course, Pete and Dracon aren't so ridiculous as the "Kniga Dungles" and there is no artificial misunderstandings found by Kate Blanshit in the new Solar.
But this film has not yet been successful to believe in wonders and goods in the best diplomatic traditions.
Instead, the keys from the lock of the Lawrence Register will receive again for the artistic film adaptation of the "Peter Pen."
"Pet and his Dracone" danced by David Lawrey and the scenario Toby Helbrows have entered a new ambitious project on a non-earned boy by James Barri.

The followers now will be able to put spaces into a evidence basis and to announce the new accused to Alexander the Society.
The second article of the Criminal Code, or remains the same but with other proofs and new evidence, has excluded Ms. Dense.
As reported "a", Alexander School was arrested 29 July 2015.
In June present, it was reported that the consequence was excluded from the accused by the RBC journalist of the formulation of the "disployment of political situation in the part of non-estabilities" and the "proliferation of non-legal ways".
The "Commersantéboscosport" ALACESANDIR ZIELLBERT lived the olympical life in the Olympic village, anspected the house of the Russian collection, rented in the local table and even shot after that WADA test.
Looks like life here isn't dead for a second.
Even night.
The last old time is completed after which the sporters need another hour of half two to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, there is a housing and housing from villages because some atlets have completed their statements and abandoned Brazil and some of them are just coming here.
Well, at 7:30 in one of the temporary trends, the heads of all the Olympic delegations will be taken.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational issues, -- tells the leader of the Delegation of the Olympics Command of Rusland Igor Cassik. - Although the house where we have laid down, considering that the former is being made in the exploitation of one of the first and demonstrated to all verifying, even in the case of some disasters.
So, with a huge water problem, forgive us with destructions.
We were fighting for cleaning for a long time.
At first, nobody just came to get away.
Then the clinboards were coming, but they're just driving some substance in the sex, so all.
They've got them, see some innovations.
Mol, they can't be human.
So we know these pools are upgraded!
The clining company was generally reached, and it was now all of the OK.
The Olympic village is the South Buttoo, the sleeping area, with the other sides of the mountains, with the inherent rock, the water places.
Well, for hope, there's still two metres of iron samples that are swiming out of the automatics.
All in the village can be placed to 17 per cent in 3604 apartments located in 31 houses.
One of the 18th century buildings is the large Russian flag -- this house is fully paid under the need of our collection.
Looking at a small fee at the entrance, you can just determine what problems are apparently for the primary teams of the most educative.
It will be two advertisements: the printing "Cause, don't throw the ticket into the tunnel!" and from the "Premature to the gift of the icon.
It's the hardest in the buckets.
Their pleasure flows are contrary to the browsers: “Infection Notice for Infections to Fisheries to Rio de Janeiro”, “Assistance to the infringement, fall of a different body in disorders, loss of awareness stage of heart-like rehabilitation”.
The text is inside the generally discovered.
For example, such as “Idealization is conducted by disappearance and follow-up.
However, the welcome outcome is not all of them.
There is certainly a center in the location of Russia, which is at any time ready to provide people who have qualified aid, including the dissolution and sports mass.
The Mediterranean center is the own head of our delegation.
The door is the inspiring plate, "we won't."
Well, of course, you know:
All arguments are absolute bridge!
They believe only those who are worried.
Let us less, so the race of the wine willn't come away, Russia won't smile!
And for a further discipline of the spirit, it is announced: “See the loving brothers and sisters!
By the blessing of the Holy Patriar of Moscow and the whole Russian Kiril, a spiritual demand for the sports of the Olympic Society of Russia is carried out by the Protoia of Aleksian Rudy.
You can tell the molebit and the other needs on the phone...
In fact, there is a Centre of Meditations and Religious arrangements for representatives of all competitions.
Well, the Russians, they've got their own time in the privileged position.
With regard to the loading of the nine phase at the fourth, I decided to leave the forest that is recommended to be used during the warming.
And in the dark, the body was pressed on her.
Indeed, these were the climbing partners of the new Clining Company.
I believe that at any time they were ready to move on the sky of innovative sex, they decided to make up a quiet time directly on cold steps.
In the fourth stage, I was waiting for a meeting with the former recognized, Vital Fumor Dubowk, our batteries, who brought them to the olympic gold more than 16 years ago to Sidon.
He agreed with an apprentice, the skill of Europe, of Paul, to show his rooms.
I don't want to think about what the impressions of the russian busy treasurer is in the two places, of course, they're almost increased, but it's not crystal.
Sanusel one in the fourth, but he's slow.
Scott, of course, a sweet, from the teeth, isn't calling confidence, but things can't be put.
"No, well, you're angry, the tea has been over!"--He's leaving with the twins of the Czechs' tenniss of the Czech Town, who met me in the main table.
The head is called, although it was the space of 2.7 per cent, and it was ready to take five visitors at the time.
It's removed by about 60 tons of sports completely free.
The items are the following: "Levels from Brazil," "Largers of the Peace of the Peace, the Asian Watch" and "Peep, Makron objects".
The latest option I considered is used to be a great popularity in our volunteer.
So, I've not found any of the hyganic restaurant units.
- What's the fucking pop?
All right, I've been China's kidding, crazy.
And the teacher.
But in fact, to understand, we're still worse on the short food.
Something can be chosen here, although it's inadmissible.
I personally chose a trick on a pair of fridges and peaks in a tomatic sugar.
Each cup is contained with a table name in three languages, English, French, and Portuguese, as well as the food value of the product and the allergene.
Well, well, to recognize that it was satisfactory.
I don't even understand why this turn is to the local McDonald's place.
Sees, dissoluted, can be said "spair" sports from the restaurant, waiting for our best friends, the World Anti-Industrial Agency (WADA).
The winner of the football has been deployed.
You can say, you can!
To get a gift, you should be right answering eight of ten questions.
- He attacked me from WADA.
But not on that.
So I'm in a patriotic pump, naturally.
The situation has already been discussed on the second question: "If I have received a notice of driving check, should I go immediately to the end-control paragraph?"
I stopped with V, "No, I have one hour."
I've lost, so I mean, sweetness.
It was forgotten that WADA was not to wait.
In general, we need to be immediately.
Well, at the seventh stage, my situation has become critical.
I thought somehow that if I'd be difficult to keep the balanced diagram from my graphic (and I, finally, hard!), I can use bio-additions to get "additional foods to improve my productivity."
No, they don't let it!
The response has been made so that categorieally prohibited, but urgedly, in several proposals.
It won't have to play this WADA!
What's the case, Russia?
Get away from somewhere behind Ethimov, Isbaba and all our covered team.
So I was mixed with the last forces, and I gained an unfortunate football.
You know what you say, ours!
In the winning plant, I got to Fitz's neighborhood center.
Take account of the three-year-olds.
It's 250.
It was surprised that no Russian sports had been discovered.
But maybe it's right?
Let the one who doesn't know what to play!
And there's one of our guys on the place.
Alongside the ocean.
Don't worry, not the shit.
In the pool, as well as in all the villages, where no fountains are, it is an apparate for the preservation of the preservatory.
And he calleth upon him: "Arise with the condens!"
Furthermore, the steel that remembers the hand of the door lock and the preservative produced from the Natural Lake of Amazone is prepared to get out of the apparate.
I took myself alone for memory.
The sports won't get them 450 tons.
The Olympic village has a total displacement center for the festival and festival.
The Olympic Committee has a well-known table in each case, recalling that the Olympic Committee was differently distributed by $3.25 million per day.
The center has videographics, blowing and thiny tables, slow flat and choke and some strange devices similar to videotranners.
That's what? - I'm interesting the company in the form of Ukraine's collection which actively uses a wild player.
I could, of course, just say that you don't want to talk to a man in the form of the collection of Russia, so all.
Here, at least, some strange view of circumstances in the eyes of kids in yellow-block.
The most playing collection is available.
To spend all the village, watching every corner, you need less than three hours.
But if you're going and not going to the electrical, you'll be opened and the house of the Canadian collection with a gun in the entrance and a train with a residual bathroom, and a bike office, and a practical and chimical, and parking, and a colorable store, and a lounge with daily consumption products, and an e-mail with unique brands (and you can't overcome from the Chinese factors), and the bank, and the bulletin and the photochiock.
And afternoon, you have been assembled by the olive tree, which is sweared by different lights in the memory of those who have left this world by friends and parents.
And you're gonna be under a car-consumer that is unordinately widely widely to kill the winters, thinking of the eternal.
That's about the olympic movement.
Someone in this village is not stopped for a minute.
As long as the rest of the Russian world had shocked the disappointment of Australians had not been punished by the American Dream Team, the real painters went to the network.
A few people know that I'm reporting that Ian's Dericho gained gold for the XXXI Olympic games, I got first.
Maybe I'm even the only bracket who saw how it happened, not considering those who have been understood that evening looked at the warning in Carioca.
This can only understand the real deal.
Here you can imagine: the lips of the muscle night.
Societies down - as ever before night, they're going and starts black, but they're very loudly crying to each other.
And it's more dangerous to move the wallet.
In the kitchen, there's no time to go to the market and buy as the winter requested, a new.
There is nothing in the television record, so it just kept on the Match channel, the Peru and any case of the Rossy - although it's almost uncertain.
"Rosie" is the family of repairs, the whole sport there somehow in writing.
There are serials in the ephree directly translates.
The whole evening of a young man cried in the newspapers, of course, on the "Matsch" is the whole evening of a young man cried in the newspapers first about the great hall of the Derigolese-Shanawa, and then about the goat fighting for gold.
It would be logical to show.
But instead of that basketball, the United States of Australia.
I at least can't say anything wrong about it.
Australians were equal and the first half of all gained.
They have been placed from their own majority of the United States.
As a result, it has been lost, but, as it is now expressed, the bactebol olympic tour will not be pregnant.
It's all right, but it's close to the fight against Di France and on the screen without change.
I'm starting to write the channels in a easy patient.
That feels like that, the second time the substraction is shot.
All right, let's go to the cards.
Nothing of the thematic Metche's Phothesis.
Well, I feel that the fight is going to start.
The text and twiss trailings of some of the sports sites do not bear me.
The Court of Justice provides an unexpected, but a slight result.
The Perugo site provides direct technical translation of all types that are now passed.
I call for the feeding, I'm gonna get a gold eye.
The deregularity is a good contract, goes into the cell, and it is clearly starts to take time.
The Italian's pretty out of the removal.
We're on one eye in front, at the end, less than two seconds.
The French Decree is moved to the Deregular, and the time it ends, the Italian brings a school.
Buy!
After a couple of seconds, the olympic Messenger on the phone reports a fourth gold meal.
It's out, I'm the first one who saw it with my eyes.
Those who are unwise, faithful, shared.
The spiritual musulman management (DUM) is rejected from the use of Russian language in dogs.
Yesterday, the DUM captive had to bring his names to fifth preaching only to the tabery to make young carriers "stude their own family language."
The administration states that it is not in any case the right of musulmans of other nationalities.
In some dreams, Kazani is stated that the tatar language does not understand up to 60 per cent of the cooking, including foreign students, migrants and their tatars.
They are concerned that their preaching to the Tatar is not going to the whole hearing.
At the same time, the Dutch of the DUM Tataristan had decided uniquely to conduct fifth preachings in the dogs of the Republic only in the Thai language.
As stated in Tataristan, Camil Samuillon, this should be a style for young tabernaries "To learn his own family language."
"For those who say it's hard, we're trying to organize the tatar's lessons absolutely free," said Mr. Samuillon.
He added that "decision has already entered into force" and today, in all the swords, to preach "the debt to be already in the Tatar language."
He remembered that DHM Tataristan provides the Shour magazine with the standard proclaims in the Tatar language.
The people who are not good in terms, "There can be prepared on them. "
The DAM Tataristan has gathered more than thousands of arrivals in all the municipalities of the Republic.
According to the muscle, the pending preachers are exclusively conducted in the Tatar language.
At the same time, in several мечs, the Russian language was most recently used.
In particular, as the muscle stated, it was practiced in the Burnian, Zakbanese, and Eniler.
However, Mr. Mohamethin emphasized that all students are responsible for both Government languages, independently of nationality.
"Nothing about what a muslim notator can't be the saying," said Mr. Muhammachin, explaining that the preaching itself was not an obligatory, main part of Namaza.
At that time, the ground will continue to read on the Arab, the dogs will continue to be read and lessons in Russian.
At the same time, Raffy Muhamishn said, that there was no serious threat to exclude the Tatar language in the sword.
In addition to other Russian and Tariff languages, for example, Usbek or Tajik, are not used in proclaims in the Republic.
The OHD decision was actively supported in the Executive Committee of the World Tatar Congress (OCTA).
Chapter of the ICT Rinnet Zakior said: "Menses are an important part of our national life."
It would be grieved if the tatar language had gone out of this area.
He noted that the conduct of preaching is only in the Tatar's "release of names" but in the ICT 'related.'
The resolved "aams who have preached to the Russian" are ready to make the DHM decision, but they believe that there are difficulties in the understanding of the sanctuary.
The dream walks and the tatars, and the Russians.
Many do not understand the language.
Of course, they're gonna be scared.
"That's going to break down," says the Burnian-Sword Farhat Maveletdins.
In his words, preach the Russian language nearer even many tatars, since the Russian and the schools, and in deceases, are significantly cautious at the radio.
However, he believes that the sword will continue lessons and lectures in Russians, which are conducted in other days.
We will trust in Allah.
Allah will show out of this situation.
But about 60% we don't know the tatar language.
It's the buckets, the taiwans, and the azerbaijans.
Many are going to us foreign students: Africans, Arabians.
"Why we've been four years after the Russian language," he said to them.
He believes that a tatar preaching will be "authorized to a higher round and won't go to the whole audience."
But we'll take the decision of the plenary.
Just the event of preaching will be another.
But time will be shown.
"If, for example, it's just gonna be easier, because the tatar language is my relative," Habitdull Gallien concluded.

Snapchat's effect criticize as a carrier on the Asians
Snapchat states that this filter is inspired by anamy, but some surpreneurs say that he's rarely unhot.
With the Lenzi tool Snapchat, approximately 150 million users are able to change reality and play with individuality ways that face as an absurd.
You can turn yourself to anonym, dog, or personality to put the picture of Roy Lichstein.
The lines are a huge, incredible instruments that create more than 30 million recorded selfs daily.
Any errors are fast recognized.
Linza Snapchat was criticised in the past when they accused that the annexe had announced a dark hair of persons or encouraged the disappeared persons as an idea of beauty.
So when some users in this week have proposed a line that had confined their eyes, sweet dogs and pumps, some crystals heard this racistic carriture on the Asians, "latolics".
And they were questioned whether these recurrent contradictions to the more serious problem of the company related to differentiality.
In the middle of the reports on The Verge and Motherboard, the next day after Snapchat stated that they had taken this function.
The company was advised: the lion was considered as a mail to animates, not as a carriage on Asians.
But the experts who know about racism did not hear, the lenses recalled abusive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected comparison with anamy.
In an email letter, Grees Spapani, the Korean-American student of artists who have been engaged on photographs, said that the line was "abusive and at least unfortunate".
She added that it was hard to dispute a comparative side of a very rude carrier on Asians and the effects of the filter.
This shows that the filter is not just a voluntary, but a highest degree of the shelter.
Snapchat is not the only company passing through these cultural pushes.
The American culture seems to be infinitely involved for the diversity and integerability, starting from corporative meetings to the Holiday and the diamonds that we are all with.
And the great audience of young people in Snapchat, who are more rarely more than their older generation, may mean that they are more likely to understand.
When one of the Snapchat lines creates an image of an abusive user, then said in the interview on Thursday 25th of Kate Juo, "the course of the events is much more difficult to remain as it was before."
In Thursday Yu, the producer and engineer who work on the middle, decided to remove its account in Snapchat and called for others to do the same.
In the article for the Medium and the phone interview, she said that racial contradictions were a reason of inadequate diversity in the sneepeta collection.
Jah described the primary white management of the company only from men and completed his article chastegom: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Joe wrote, who is the American Chinese origin: "They were not sufficiently white people who could take such decisions or work unleavened people, but they do not take the positions to be secure and open. "
Other surveys divide it by expressing the disappearance that Snapchat did not respond to most of its questions.
The company does not publish information on the presentation of national minorities in its State, stressing its status of private company.
In Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss the racial origin of his staff, but, in the words of a reliable person, the company recently undertake a recruiter to the unnecessary population fields and the active attempts of inclusion of internal resources.
On her side, Jou said she would keep her account in Snapchat closed, adding: "If they really need more users than us to say that it is not going."
The Military Guideline has been searched for the ICB, reported to the Congress Commission
The number of United States Armed Force Commanders changed the intelligence reports to submit more optimistic images of war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the basis of events on the place, reported the Congress Commission in Thursday.
The Interim report of the operational group established by the Republic of the Chairpersons of the Committee of the Covenants of the CB, the Investigations and the Subcommittee for Military Assistents found “a widely distributed disaster” among the Analysis of the Headquarters of the Central Commandment Service, which asserted that managers were conducting their evaluations of American actions aimed at winning over the Islam State.
The Central Command, known as the Centre, is the main military management in the city of Tampa, the Floride State, which controls the American military operations in Middle East and Central Asia.
"Instructions made by the Centre higher command, as usually, have given more optimistic images of the United States anti-terroristic action than reaffirmed the real events and have been more optimistic than the analysis provided by other experts," said the output of news reports.
"What happened in the Centre is unacceptable: when the high manager is an infidel analysis, our military suffers," said a member of the Palette of the representatives of Ken Calver, the Republic of California.
The leading problems in the Centre have reached the most highest organization.
The decade report is detailed in 2014 and 2015, in the description and analysis of the American actions aimed at the study of Iraq ' s armed forces.
While he does not contain the final evidence that members of the Administration of Obama had granted a fatalization of reports, he stated that the analysis felt that the Guide of the Centre had encouraging them to represent more optimistic consideration of the threat by the Islamic State, even known as IHIL or ISIL.
"In the first half of 2015, many presses, statements and evidence of the Central Command at the Congress were significantly optimistic than real events," reported the report.
For example, the Officer of the Centre stated that the large military attack aimed at returning Mosul could already be started in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second to the majority of the Iraqi city, remains under control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is surely known," said a member of the Palette representatives of Mike Pompo, the Republic of Canada.
From average 2014 to average 2015, the highest training service of the United States Central Team was divided by command designers to reduce threats from IHL sides in Iraq.
The Republics created a operational group when they knew that the analytics expressed concern that the islamic State had been qualified.
In the course of the investigation reported by Thursday, more expanded data will be followed.
The additional, not completed at the time of the investigation of the Center, is conducted by the main inspection of the Ministry of Defence.
Representatives of the Democratic Party to the Examination Committee of the Palestinian representatives of the United States have published in Thursday their own data agreed with some of the conclusions of the Republic ' s operational group.
"First 2014 and 2015, the Centre has established a transparently closed procedure for the production of research assessment concerning the IIHL and the guard troops of Iraq," claims the statement of the Chairman of Adam B. Shif, the Chief Representative of the Democratic Party to the Committee.
The proceedings, according to Shiff, “the outcome of learning documents”, have caused a damage to the moral status of analytics and “the outcome is not sufficiently reflected”.
But the Chief and the Democrates claim that no evidence was found that the White House had tried to put analytics from the Centre to burn their arrest under a "covered or political interpretation."
The Daily Beast portrait was presented in the Congress survey on Tuesday.
The New York Times last August added the investigation of the Main Inspector Pennton, opened after the complaints of the Centre.
Leader-Commissor Patrick Evans, representative of Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment the Congress report until the main investigation of the Inspector continued.
But he said that the experts sometimes have been viewed at the contract of integrated data, and the experts and the Ministry of Defence welcomed health dialogue on these vitally important issues on national security.
The results of the investigation have been issued by whether the objectives of the United States ' s bombarding in Iraq and Syria are reached (as it now claims more representatives of the Ministry of Defence).
However, the statements are convicted in the past that the President of Obama may believe that the Central Command provide real assessment of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Lebanon and other critical points.
The critics of the islamic state repeated disputes that have been placed more than ten years ago when the analysis of the Centre of Gregory Hucker wrote a research article, which stated that the administration of President George Water Bush had made a small number of military in Iraq and didn't thought that it followed the second year 2003.
Huker also played a key role in the protests designed by the Islamic State.
Last year, according to officials, the Huker team concluded that, despite public statements on the recovery, the aircraft on the Nepthorgonation of the Islamic State did not lead to a significant damage of the financial situation of the terrorist group, because it had built temporary neffeeterprovisions to sell the black market.
But the opening was not distributed beyond the Central Command, as reported in September of the Times.
The following team of the Centre, General Lloyd J. Ostin III, has been criticized in the past year after the witnesses in Senate, which many deputates have been extremely optimistic to war.
General Ostin went away in April and was moved to the Central Command.

Both teams are sent to the fourth, and the result of the game will determine who will take the first place in their group of six teams, and who the second.
The gain will escape to meet the strong team of fellows in Holland, the leaders of the other group, a little погод when the fourth game begins.
The Sabbath game shows, however, that the Americans here have made a noise of their unexpected series, four years after they took the last place of the 12 teams in London games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, the Pennsylvania State, first took a cheque for herd when she was three (the elderly sisters played in this type of sport in Drexel), and joined the national collection in the age of 16, became her youngest player in history.
She missed Olympiad 2008 when she had not been elected to the final composition.
Then, 2012, when it wasn't involved with her and her team partner.
In the next year, Coig Parkham, English, was appointed a trainer, and all began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical training," said Bam.
We had no such productivity in London now.
We have fully changed our views.
On Thursday evening, Beth opened the first half of the game with an unfortunate hand on a short distance.
India went to play without a unique gain in the tour, but the team had shown himself a surprise of the hardness and maintained the account 1-0 until the end of the third period when Bam took an initiative in their hands.
She made a long step on the left side of the field, then shot down the middle and sent the ball to the gate, so the US gave the best to 2-0.
Melissa Honslas added a final hole in the middle of the fourth period.
"Subs" gain was the first tour for the United States of Jackie Brigs, who was leaving one head in each of the first three winners.
She's in a busy.
Like Beth.
"We're in a good situation right now," said Parchem, "but how good it depends on the result of the Saturday game.
A middle of the Olympics - Dins on the batterian
Where would you have been now, it's Olympiad.
The events in Rio-de-Janeiro are unchanged and unremovable, which is the removal combination of oralization and effort.
Like the olympic fire, and it is the huge fakel that moves from the leather to the ocean, to the hymnist, to the threethlonist.
You can't include the television, read the newspaper or listen to your neighbors about the coffee and don't listen to Simon Bayles, Kate Ledeki, or about the murder between Michael Felics and Chad de Clo.
And there's Logan Duley.
Dully, the first part of the Olympics games, the ruining of the tickets, could be completely among the characteristics shown in the proyms that have moved sponsors and a reliable advertising roles, if it was a flood, hemnostam or even a feastman.
But the 28-year-old Duley from the city of Lake-Forester in California is gone for the olympic coasts on the bathroom.
Olympics are not aware of all events alone.
Further than the center, partly in the shadow, are the types of sports that are not commonly recognized: the shield of the pneumatic ball, the shield out of the gun, the badminton, the tachbound.
Briss will always be with us for his kingdom.
But if I'm allowed to make it hard to protect your personality, let me give your attention to the modest guns on the bathtub.
Although the batteries are an olympical type of sport from 2000 when they deployed the games in the Sina, the past 16 years they received so little recognizing that many of me paid people were not in the course that they were generally related to the olympic sports.
This may be regional disappointment.
Although the United States were sent to sports to a warning, they never played meals in baths, and their sports were not gone up to 2012.
The Chinese and Russians usually share male rewards among themselves, and the Chinese and the Canadians are women.
Dun Dun from China and Rossi McCanann from Canada will protect their London gold medles in this year.
But the bathrooms have an atmosphere ball, particularly because the uncertain ears are closely associated with a circle college than the Olympics.
I must recognize that I'm not an expert, but only a landlord intuition.
They actually have a comic capacity -- this is the caricative shortage of infined pearls — but also the heritage of gemnastics and water breasts, two types of sports, which are mainly compared to themselves.
The word "batt" comes from the Spanish word "the trampoline" meaning "trapelin for waters."
The results of the wine will be at the hyganic bathroom, flowing to almost 30 feet, and should take the series of acfaritatic traps (doors, shoes and salto) to the final landing on the feet.
They appreciate the implementation, complexity and field time, in accordance with the Official Olympics Programme.
Thirty-third sports from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will be connected to Rio.
The most widespread olimpic course is in front.
Representatives should go further, fast, above and above in the gold pool, sometimes to the finger, and sometimes down and down there on the top.
They are seeking not only to the physical or starting wall but also to the telecam, to another distortion: the world or the olympic record.
It is a warm effort to be kindly, worthy of ensuring, even fatal, and it is difficult to let the storm even swim.
But, I think, it's a few of them when I look at the game.
It's a gun on the bathroom.
The batterian management is upper.
The movement forward is not the purpose.
He or she's talking, it seems nice as astronats, flights up, then down, then without efforts again up.
And of course, they have no competition or difficulties, but during the whole programme there is no foolish breathing, there is no long-term, just a amazing, spectacular disappearance of time and gravity.
It's the most closest to the olympic species of sport.
Women qualifications and then feeds will take place on Friday, translation on the day of Eastern Europe; males on the Sabbath, also on the time of time.
NBC will translate the final within the daily programme from 14:00 to two days.
The disappearance of the olympic complaint is expected a quiet, beautiful moment that can easily look in a total shock.
And if the growth of awareness can only be achieved by the leading views and objectivization, as, in accordance with Wall Street Journal, recently suggested men of the United States, Duley is only waiting for its new upgraded stage of the factors.
The Protestation Generation in Ethiopia, the former United States Alliance
Protestants in Ethiopia
Demonstrations requiring political changes in Ethiopia have been confronted with an enlarged opposition by the Government.
Auditors say that the tens of protestants were deadly wounded during the police.
Is Ethiopia actual?
In the last decade, she was one of the most statistical African countries, a strong partner of West with rapid development economy.
But in the last months, anti-governmental protests have spread to the country by spread to the greater number of its territory.
Only in the last week, thousands of people have gone into the streets, requesting radical political changes.
According to human rights defenders, the Government reaction was cruel.
Auditors stated that police officers had killed the tens of unarmed demonstrators.
Video records from protests, proposed at the end of this year or at the beginning of this year, show how the security officers kill young people with pieces when they had put hands on the wall.
The higher official of the United Nations human rights official is now calling for a warm investigation.
"Again, it was difficult to retain this country from dispute, and it would be more difficultier," said Rashed Abdi, head of the African Rog project in the international research crisis group.
Ethiopia is the second population of Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by West.
American military and learning services are closely co-operating with Ethiopia to combat terrorism in the region, particularly in Somalia, and almost no country in Africa receives such support from West.
The Ethiopia economy is developed with a impressive speed.
Its infrastructure has significantly improved, even a new reward trip in the capital of Eddi Abba.
And her streets are normally quiet, secure and clean.
However, it was a democracy – human rights organizations have constantly mentioned Government repressions - opposition on the territory of the State, because dissidents have actually been deployed.
Many of them were sent, arrested in prison, killed or thrown into decade.
But it can change.
"If people are constantly deployed and left other options except to proceed, it is rising up," said Sium Teshame, a doctor of the University in Central Ethiopia.
The whole younger protests.
The generation is protesting.
Many burdens starting from land use by closing the coalition of government coalition.
Following broad elections in the past year, the Government and its alliance parties have fully encountered the opposition and have now controled the 100 per cent of the Parliament.
At the same time, the enlargement of the border with Eritrea is growing; the fight for this undetermined, disputes had made hundreds of lives in June.
Analytics are concerned that the seminar groups who have been more or less destroyed in the past years, such as the Front of Liberation of Ormom or the Uganda National Liberation, may try to use anxiety and re-enforced.
A number of factors explain why the worst feelings that have been in the deep - depth of souls are now insufficient.
The first, it seems to be perfectly unnecessary: the smartphones.
Only in the last few years, the large number of ethioops had been able to communicate in social networks, since the decreased smartphones became alone, and the Internet Service was better.
Even when the Government closes access to Facebook and Twitter, such as it is often, especially during the protests, many people are still able to communicate through the proxy server that hide where they are.
Some young Ethiopics said that they were organized for protests.
Secondly, there is more solidarity between Orom and Amhar, both the largest ethical groups of Ethiopia.
Oromo and Amhar are not natural unioners.
During the centuries, Amhara, from the most high-good Christian Ethiopia's high-speaking areas, welcomed politics and business exploitation, many of which were musulmans and live in low areas.
But it's also changed.
"We're going to operate a community under the single beginning," said Mullato Gameche, Leader Oromo.
The most important protests went through Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many of the Amharians and Oromo feel that the ethnic group of Tigri, which is about 6 per cent of the population and is controling military and learning services, trade and policies.
The third reason of concern is the loss of Meles Zenauy.
The former ruling leader had fulfilled the responsibilities of the Prime Minister of Ethiopia in the age of 17 years to death from an unknown disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a person who could preved danger.
Analytics claim that he has particularly recognized the first signals of disappearance and used the teachers to obtain and certify the opposite data.
"The Nenten regime does not have a good meaning," said Abdi, analytical conflict situations.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemarim Deloss, appeared where he took the place of Miles.
On the other hand, a species of Tigrey in the north of Ethiopia, the Halemarians southern.
Analytics say that he does not have confidence in the security services controlled by Tigrin.
Many are concerned that it will lead more blood proliferation.
The last time, Ethiopia overvive such concerns in 2005, after thousands of people had come to protests against that, as the analysis said, the elections that the Government had been lost and then made results.
Many protestants were killed during the past repressions, although at least in comparison with the last months, and this period was relatively fast.
The development experts expressed appreciation to the leaders of Ethiopia for delicate development of infrastructure, such as new trailings and significant progress in combating poverty.
But obviously it had not stopped the growth of internal disability by the Government of Ethiopia.
And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.
Last months of protests in Hungary, the city of Amhare, attacked the business of Tigri and the anti-Thigrin hatred in social networks becomes a comprehensive.
Analytics state that protestants are treated by the United States and other Western Unions in an inadequate situation.
The American Government used Ethiopia as a basis for non-profit fields on neighbouring Somalia, although it had recently declared that the base was closed.
On the one hand, it is clear that the Western wants to support the democracy, but on the other hand he does not wish that his Allianceer would lose the power in the country already instake.
"And on this point it'll be difficult to go through," said Abdie.
Donald Trump explains its statement that IJIL was based on Obama, "Serquedam"
Donald J. Tramp tried to engage the last conflict covering his pre-selection chamber at Friday, claiming that he sought a few times in this week, he stated that the President Obama and Killry Clinton were the "fundors" of the terrorist group of the Islamic State.
The explication has been made out new questions concerning the understanding of the candidate at the post of the President of the Republician Party to focus in mind to the American people.
It was also set by his adjoints who tried to protect him during the period of concerns, as they had to explain the statements he probably did not mean.
He said that proposal for the meeting at the middle of the evening, Tremp decidedly to approve its Thursday, repeating the interview that he really wanted to say that President and Clinton founded IGIL.
But at Twitter early morning, in the Friday, Tromp wrote that he just evacuated.
This post was directly contrary to the approval made all the day before, when Tremp stated in several interviews that he was absolutely accused in his accused.
When the Consequent-Consequent Howe Hie Hitt tried to help the Trump to avoid explanation, he reminded him that Obama wanted to destroy IHIL, a candidate from the Republical Party had not been used.
The last scenel was spread when Tremp tried to reorient its campaign to the economy at the background of the reduction of the reit.
The Tremp and Clinton have discussed concurrent things on the economy in Michagana for this week.
In Friday, Tromp tried to return to this topic.
Furthermore he turned to Twitter, he warned that the Clinton plans would bring to the increased bottles, and said that she had heard her a hurt.
The Tremp had already used orders as a justification.
At the end of July, after he was close to the whole critics, almost said to the idea that the Russians should spread the electronic post of Clinton, he then explained his comments, "Certainly I'm swear."
This approach allows the Terrorism to go beyond the limited politically and to take its words again if necessary.
"I think it's his way to test those or other messages that have a response between his worshippers, to look at how they are doing, and then "declaring them" in the same or other side, depending on the response," said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, conducting the analysis of the language of both candidates.
But I also think he was concerned in his statements, and I know that they're growing enough to treat them differently.
Instead of detection for a wide electrical elector, Tremp took a more vulnerable tone in the last days, while his recital continued to fall.
The new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist, published on Friday, showed that Tremp took Clinton with a great cross to North Korea, Virginia and Colorado, and went with her levels to Floride.
Although the Tremp is usually trying to not be excused for the prostitution of things that it says, he often accuses his criticisms in the wrong interpretation of his words and the disappointment of the humor’s feelings.
However, as Tramp was an object of great attention in the last months of the President campaign, his shocks made him faithful alliances in a fair situation: they should publicly support any provisions or explanation.
Rudolf W. Juliani, the former Mr. New York, who is one of the most known Vice-Presidents of Trampa, made serious efforts to protect the candidate in the CNN interview on Thursday.
"I think what he says is an acceptable political comment," said Juliany when he asked for the confidence of the approval of Trump, that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true that Obama was almost an unknown small organization, he called it not representing a threat absolutely wrong, and that's why it happened because he had brought a soldier out of Iraq.
Most of the Mediterranean Republics believe that the Administration of Obama, in which Clienton had undertaken a post of the State Secretary, allowed IJIL to develop, since it was not difficult to dominate the situation in the Middle East.
Before the mining in Pennsylvania, the Tritter had continued to attack the media for the democration of each of its words and prejudice to it.
He appeared on the "grateless" television experts who tried to recall him, and said, "They are weak!"
Some democrats were deployed by the Trampa as a less reaffirming that it was not the President.
Sometimes the extracted coffee returns to Greenpount
The Beerb's coffee was an absorption of only local places in Williamsberg, in which there was no Wi-Fi but a good coffee for 15 years.
It was actually out of her accommodation in Bedford-Aven.
The Soup Sheri's Magazin, who took the Herb's place in 2014, has been sold by a mix of caxes.
Local people paid it as a last loss in the updated city.
The Dear Molly Crabepp wrote to Twitter: "New York is always changed, I know, but I can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsy hotel is destroyed, and now the Weerb is a store."
But sometimes New York is constantly changed, he is being updated.
In November of the past year, the Herb ship was opened in Greenpoint, less than a mile to the north from the original place.
The new Herbe is Wi-Fi and receive credit cards, but there remained some of the same staff and the simple atmosphere.
Another coffee is still good.
The new Warba Chapter is Sico Rodrigez, an old coffee officer, who is owner and general manager in a new place.
He began to work in "Werbe" in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of the customers proposed to put him on a new place, he said that it would be glad.
Rodrigez, 36 years old, has been left in the former form.
"Werb" works with the same driver and bought the same coffee model.
It's even set up the gluters from the old Warba.
But Rodrigoz said he would like to experiment.
He proposed new guards.
The menu is presented with sandwichs with becon, eggs and sympa, and there are pumps from capers or iron wound.
There's a guard from the blue.
There are no drunks in the coffee, but now they're ready to be drunk.
After nine months, Rodrigoz said he focused on the unresolved flow of old permanent clients.
"Muchs of the old clients have also produced prices from Williamsberg," he shared.
In one of the recent resurrections, Rebecca Olivera was one of those clients.
Olivia, which was 34 years old, lived in Williamsberg and was often visited "Werb".
Even after she moved to Greenpoent, she was still going there.
After the Warba, she said she stopped drinking coffee for some time.
"I understood the coffee and the atmosphere imposed me in the Watbe," she said.
Now she's drunk coffee again, although that day instead of the usual ice coffee she made a tea buyed, another newspaper.
Tom Rontenal, another old client, visited the Warb, starting from 2003.
He went before the work and commanded inevitably the same thing.
"In fifteen minutes of eight, every day, as at hours, I came and prepared my cup with a mass and all the things," he said.
Rodrigoz said that he wanted to experiment and introduce new views into the menu.
But he's ever changed with the bike, an egg or a jar with all the acts.
Rodrigoz said he wasn't at both that the store had ever done an old place.
Moreover, the owners of the Soup Sheri suggested to produce a special weight for the Warba, using a coffee of coffee prepared in cold way as an engineer.
"I think we may agree on their proposal," said Rodrigoz.
The permanent inhabitants of the Poland origin also loved this coffee.
One of these new clients translated the polar language, and Rodrigez said that it was planned to find a place for him in the winter that his new neighbours would feel desired.
There are other benefits in the new place.
The local point to sell the sacks is planned to disappear on the bottles and to sell the coffee prepared by cold.
It is likely that the coffee will be closer to the building.
For many clients, it's enough that the new "Werb" will include their favorite guards in the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a permanent client and shared that he was killed by the mountain when they were closed.
When the coffee was opened in a new place, Waitt said that he went in and put the coffee cup, he felt himself so far as he returned home.
"How long I wanted to feel this aromatic," he recognized.
Depressive food of depression in the "Foll Trade"
In March 1933, shortly after the presidency, Francislin Delano Roosevelt sat at the Oval Office.
As a gorgane, President Roosevelt loved model observers of the Fifth Aven, for example, the Four-Shood and the Military Military Soup.
His menu at this time was more modest: shaped eggs in a tank soft, a card pipe and a dezert road from black.
"It was a culiary solidarity with people who suffered," said Jane Zigelman.
Her husband Andrew Kow added: "It was also a message to the Americans about how to ask."
Soups living in Brooklyn Hayes are specialists for the history of food.
The last book of Coua, "Roga in China" was dedicated to Chinese cuisine in America, and Ziggelman told the story of life in a common apartment in the Neighbour City of Side through food in his book "Dam 97 on the street of the fruit garden".
Their new joint work of the Cross Trace, which will be published in the Tuesday publication of Harper, is the history of the American food in the Great Depression.
In some degree of their culiary solidarity, they met the store for dinner in Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a little easy busy in the Flation Bartle, which worked since 1929, in the Brigge's year.
Sighelman, 54, had a soft sweet and oil browser, and Cou, 57, took the Indian, the card pig and the fruit lamb.
When the reporter had given the local road, a couple had read this approach to the discussion on food in the depression epoca.
"The railways used a great question," said Zigelman.
There was a pearl, a cracket, a dear rocket.
They have made from the main ingredent and decades that have been allowed to grow ingredient.
Imagine that you've eaten so much dinner as much as you need for dinner.
That's what I've shot.
"That's like he was laid in a fair stone," he said.
In years before the Depression of the American table, particularly in the rural, a Swiss table was represented.
Women's groups were prepared for farmers, and the feast-speaked pipeline was dinner, dinner and dinner.
Americans have sent food to hunger Europeans during the first world war, and the “Foll Trade” describes how the country had done soon stopped to be a country of disappearance.
"There was the time when the food became a central and easy topic for the Americans," said Cue, explaining why he and his wife decided to write it.
The same was not easy to be a new budget ratio: secret guards, such as rocks and mixtures, became the main food product; the lack is a "proper way to eliminate food," Ziggelman noted, because the rare could hide non-optimized ingredients under the soup.
Fruit fruits were replaced by deeper sugar.
Maso, for many years, the former basis of the American food, became an economicly distributed growth.
People have suffered foreign weights because energy and food values have become more important than smoke and even culiary sense.
Taking note of research for books included receptores, Ziggelman prepared the cup of the epoche: the bottle made by a calculated mass.
"It's not the addendum to the daily table," said Cow.
Ziggelman added, "It was very weird."
The archase oil isn't completely coming to the bottle.
This was characterized for many home receptores.
As never before and ever since, home specialists, including Louis Stanley, the Federal Office of Homes from 1923 to 1943, were managed by the country’s behaviour.
Posted receipts and articles in newspapers and newspapers, they recommended women to become " budget providers," to accept calls and transform the smoke as a protein shot with a marriage to a dumb observer.
It's the best of an interesting historical facts.
Specially pychlantly telling the Government's reaction to hunger citizens, for example, the position of President Gerbert Guvera in the spirit of the "power of pirates".
It was publicly a simple landscape of the Aiaba State at the time of his childhood, and he asked for a million who became.
"He liked continental kitchen, for example, fish with a smoke," said Cow.
He's been eating almost in a smoking table, hopefully smoking.
He was fantaistic of reality.
The President of Roosevelt could have done the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not encouraged him to give an example to his own complaint.
As telled in the book, Elehonor Roosevelt took an economist that hadn't really interested, and it led that the White House was "which wasn't only the meal of food in Washington, but at the time and timely prepared."
Many of the culinary epothesis were forgotten when the country was again rising up to feet.
Their heritage is our continuous focus on colonies and food, says Zighelman, and how science was used to prepare food.
Surrounds say that during the writing of book, they better understand the foods of the mother of Zighelman — that she could not choose food, for example.
"It was seriously afraid of the unfaithful relationship," said Cow.
Ziggelman remembers, "He has made people in full series."
It was an unfortunate case with profiles.
When the turtles in Eisenberg's hosts, they with Kou had a dezer that had prepared the house: a decree from the black, which was the President Roosevelt eating for dinner.
"It's called a muse from the black," said Zigelman, adding that it was a displayed acceptation - to give a modest reception of brass names.
It was not just the black, a little pain, a sugar, water and a corner.
Everything with an inconsistent lay down bed in a busy, coric, lippy substance.
For a surprise, it was not bad.
Two times he asked to add.
He said, "The low Greek cracks wouldn't mean here."
The arrest of the procurements on the Mass track on the Howan ticket has been extended until 14 November

Gilead computers will pay costs for lawyer services during the dispute of the hepatitis C with Merck company
The Gilead Sciences Inc campaign has the right to reimburse the expenses for lawyers, which she had caused a grave issue of the patent’s medicine with the producer of medicines Merck & Co Inc, decided a federal environment court.
In June the Gilead company was released from $200 million for the violation of two patents of the Merck company with regard to the health of the Gilead company, the leaders of sales, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after the American court found a number of violations from the company of Merck, including lies under jurisdiction and other non-ethetics.
At the jueves of the Federal Court of Justice, Beth Labson Friman said that the Gilead company had the right to remuneration of the costs carried out during the spare of the jacks.

Clinton has paid $10.75 million in 2015 and has paid 34.2 per cent of the federal wages.
Killary Clinton renewed its tax declarations for 2015, which showed that the candidates in the President of the Democratic Party and its husband had in that year $10.75 million and payed the effective cost of the federal wage of $34.2 per cent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million as a well-keeping contribution, the Clinton Foundation, which had received approximately $5,3 million as a honoror for the statement, and the former State Secretary declared the arrival of $3 million from Simon & Schuster for its book on its stay at the State Department.
The Potential Vice-President Clinton, Senator of the United States, Tim Kin from Virginia, together with his wife Anna Holton, renewed logic declarations for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid the effective rate of the federal wages of 20.3 per cent.
"Hillari Klinton and Tim Kine continue to establish the standard of financial transparency," said the Consequent of the Pre-Pre-Pre-Pre-viser Clinton Jennifer Pallemy.
In full opposition to them, Donald Trump is covered by subsequent justifications and violates its past promises to renovate their indigenous declarations.
This is the usual case for candidates in the President of the United States to publish their logic declarations, although the law does not require them.
The New York Business Tramp and his lawyers called the verification of the State Login Service as a reason for its refusal to renew their logic declarations.
"Your move," wrote the Consequent of the Clinton Yan Sams, in the meaning of the Democratic Declaration of the Democratic Party.
In Thursday, the Special Adviser Trump Michael Koen said CNN that the Trempo would not let them out until it ends of verification.
The Critics of Trampa, including the candidate to the Republician Party in 2012, said that his refusal was addressed on its status, its well-being contributions, its business operations and other communications, including Russia.
Client was hiding this issue and led online on Friday, where the main place was taken by the removal of republics who had forbidden the Trempa to recover a logic account.
In Thursday, she raised this question during the discussion of the economy in Michean.
"He refuses to do what each did without exception of the candidate to the President for decades: to restore their tax declarations," she said to those who were gathered.
The Political Gazette reported that Tromp has not paid any or almost any taxes in the 1990s, and the Business Research Journal of New York Times in Friday, many lawyers on loans and busers believed that the case could be still remained.
The Federal Statutes have become disputes in the presidential elections.
Client has supported the regulation named a milliarder, the investor of Urrean Baptite, which would ensure that people who receive more than $1 million per year would pay an amount of 30 per cent.
The President Barak Obama also supported the proposal.
At the meeting of Clienton at last week in Omah, the Nebraska State, Baptite, whose congress was based on the Berkshire Hathaway Congress, suggested that Trompe to meet and exchange local declarations.

Preserveds and Fabrics make protection of the Tanzanian slopes
Environmental protection boats in Tanzania use the non-traditional way to prevent the slopes to income in human points — they throw preservatives full of read.
The method was effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had come into the head of this idea a few years ago with the American Natural Committee, took its movement by studying soldiers in the north villages of Tanzania to use an unfortunate one of four steps to protect their homes and posters, without cause to animals.
Many previously used copys to protect themselves.
On Friday, the World Day will be devoted to the protection of animals.
"When we have found a set of tools ..., we are watching changes within these communities, so they are much more sure that they could not put the balls on their fields without a damage," said the executive Director Honeyguide Damian Bel.
The first two steps are in the deterioration of the fake before the slope and the signal delivery through the royal.
If it couldn't leave it, they're throwing out the so-called ready.
The shock of the skills with the guy in the preservation, and his end is concerned, the dream remains just a pital.
In the dishwasis, the preservators are shoted with the greenhot, spreading the small dust of the powder in the air.
One dumb is usually enough to reduce the pillar into the other side.
The country measure is a lower device that strikes the Roman flowers in the air, produced a loud and green explosive.
To Turkey, there were no longer 32 Turkish diplomats left from the country after an attempt to the hospital in July of this year.
These data were provided by Chapter IID Turkey Mewelt Chawscholl in a conversation with local journalists.
At the first stage, we have sent 208 staff diplomates to continue work in the centre.
One of them 32 persons without objective reasons and explications have not returned," said the Chapter of the Turkish Foreign Police State.
Remember that, in July, Turkey, the attempt of public turn has been made.
The authorities of the country were officially stated that the hospital was disappeared and reported about the detention of over six thousand, among them military charges of high and average name.
As a result of the attempt of the hospital, 290 people died according to the MIDI Turkey.
The European Register expressly declared the Berlinian hotel for the removal of the Israeli phone code on the Arabs — reported the RT news channel
The French Judgeer of the Jewish origin has released the Scandle to Smith, discovered that the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin does not have the list of the Israeli phone code, as the officials are referring to the " requests" by Arab clients.
Claude Lanzman, a documentary film on Holocauste Shoa, expressed his disaster Kempinski Bristol in Berlin, written a written letter in German SME FAZ.
During his recent stay in Lazman office, he tried to find Israel in the list of phone codes provided by the store.
However, the country was not mentioned among States where they can be called directly from the rooms.
How could Israel be done that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the New Germany, was excluded and eliminated?
He wrote Lanzman.
Replace Kempinski Bristol provides an opportunity for Israel through its own phone service centre.
In the search for explaining this question, the author ' s author ' s author ' s author ' s secretariat addressed.
The answer he received there, according to Lazman, "He has shot him."
Klerk said that this measure was "sudified by the manager of the Kempinski network".
The reason that stands on this stage was made out of a great wrath of the Register.
"Our guests of our Arabian guests, and they needed the code of Israel to be removed," said Lazman, who served the officer.
The Israeli Ambassador in Germany called the case of "related vision," reports the Southdeutsche Zeitung.
We were struck and shot the incident.
It's actually a terrible spectacle.
What has happened in Germany and that is, in this network, a great view.
There's no need of clarification.
We're waiting for the hotel to make the correct conclusions," said the officer.
The case has made a small resonance on the Internet; people called him a scandle.
Some stated that the Kempinski hotel was just "good" in the proposed Arab client requirements.
"It would be ashamed," said another post where it was shown that the hotel is located on the glorious road of Kurfurstendamm, near the synagogue.
The hotel itself has sought to retain any accused named "unspect" and "defended" before Lazman, reports the Der Spiegel journal.
"Against no direct order to include Israel in the list of rapid sets," cited the words of the representative of the Kempinski journal of Southdeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that code is added now.
Police is used to use a smooth gas and rhythmic pumps against Brazilian protesting students
The students focused on the police in the Brazilian city of San Paul in Thursday when they were gathered to protest government reforms of the public education system.
The police used a smooth gas and a residual pumps against protestants.
The orders began when the police officers tried to burn students, as the police used germs and iron gas.
Several students participated in the demonstration to express concern about plans.
In accordance with the proposals of the Governor of the State of San Poula Geraldo Alckmin, some 100 public schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be reconstituted to recognize money.
Some of the protesters could be seen in writing on the graphy walls aimed at the timely fulfillment of the President Michael Tamer.
This last protest was done a few days after the protestants went up to the street to support the defended President Dilam Rhesph, when the seat of the country had voted for her immigration.
The tragedy between Russia and Iran increased by 71 per cent — reports the RT Business portal
With removal sanctions, the company between Moscow and Teheran increased 70.9 per cent compared to the previous year, according to the ambassador of Russia in Iran to Jagana.
Since international sanctions against Iran have been rejected, the growth of the interests of the Russian firms is observed by the country of business, he said.
Russian companies re-related connections with Iran and new firms are ready to get access to the market.
Of course, further trade increases are one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran," said Jagarian.
He noted that the first five months of 2016 between Russia and Iran increased 70.9 per cent compared to the same period in 2015 and was 856 million dollars.
In particular, Russian exports in Iran increased to 91.5 per cent and was 697 million.
The Russian import from Iran has increased 16 per cent to $158 million.
Increased trade has been achieved by the disposal of car equipment, land vehicles and weapons," said the salon.
Jagarian also suggests that Russia has visited the recurrent number of Iraqi tourists in this year.
In the past year, the diplomatic representation of Russia has issued approximately 35,000 vials, primarily, tourist, citizens of Iran.
Furthermore, the Iranian first entered into the топ-20 countries as a number of tourists visiting Russia.
It is sure that the last year record for the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be killed," he said.
At the same time, about a bit of Russians visit Iran that, hopefully, salary will change.
"I personally recommend to visit the towns of Ispahan, Shimp and Yiz, in which memories of the former Persian civilization in a good state," said he.
The State continues to deploy hairs in the defence-defence complex.
The "sistematic non-compliance" managers of the "Almán-Anthy" Context Manager and the 'employment of confidence' and 'training'.
The Chief of NGOs for the nearest three years was appointed by Genesis Bender.
Only in Thursday of the evening, there was no broad resonance to the SIM.
What can such silence explain in the terms of a maximum rearming of the army?
Nevertheless, the FF manager does not wish to disseminate any hearing or negative proposals in the public environment.
This reiterates that there is many problems in the defence-defence complex (OPC) and that the State does not wish to focus on them with a higher attention from the society.
The disappearance of the Inconomist is unfortunately an important event in the area.
The Almacean NGO is the main concept, which is specialised for the production of land-radian-radial components (UNCP) of the sea and earthquake.
The Almon is currently working on the establishment of the Police-Rédient and the Marophe, which are planned to establish for new roots, fregates, ethnics and creatures.
The chief of the Military Russian Dmitriy Cornev believes that the refusal of the Inconomic Exploitation has been exempt by the deadline on this project.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the Marfay development began in 2007, and the entry in road was proposed in 2013.
Police-Réduit must be the main system of the WHO on new WMF vessels.
For the information I get, the tests had not been completed by any successful test for a few years.
Actually, how much I can judge, there's no one of the Almaza's fault," said Cornev.
The expert is concerned that the delay in the exploitation may happen as well as the C-500.
The project designer work has not been completed until now, but the first components should go to the military during 2016.
The Minoboron believes that the work is planned and will be completed in the timetable, although the report was recognized with the P-500 development problems in 2014.
The country is difficult to assess the Inconomic Quality of the Unconomist, which has been managed " Almax" since 2011.
Cornev agreed that the terms of project time may be both the case and the cause of disappearances.
It was considered that in the past few years it was very difficult to provide information on internal processes in the OECD and business management plans.
The race received long-term orders for ten billions of roads, and the greatest money, as known, is loved by the sickness.
Normally, the Director of Defence undertakings are from their own desire, by the Contract on the Parties or are translated to another work.
In this case, the disappearance has been publicly, sometimes and not received resonance.
This stresses that the Elmaza manager was likely a struggle fibrary and opposed the "related roads" above.
In all cases, the State has no intention to be peaceful with such a behaviour.
It will disappear those who prefer to dispute with the Minoboron installations and does not fulfil the tasks made.
On the same time, the RF lead is trying to punish the prosecutors (the motion of the Sterm Court).
A higher attention to sector issues is personally given to the President.
The Army Pentin calls for the Military Industry Commission and conducts periodically meetings on the rearming.
Circle protects the number of GDP managers, seeking to have a loil composition of directors that will be implemented from above.
This is a far-related policy, however, in the background of corruption and the absence of normal competitiveness in the OECD of other instruments did not have States.
The situation in defence, of course, is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation stimulates Crimil as soon as possible to bring armed forces into the order.
Parallelly with the "sack" managers in the RF Guidelines make completely successful steps to improve Russian professionalism.
The Cadro Army composed the new quality of the ministry of the defence Minister of Sergei Shawg.
It is an impression that the President had taken an outstanding reservation for the Peace of Peace ready to war.
During the cold war, the CSR military force and the nuclear pastor reached in the 1970s had brought to the conclusion of the Helsinki Covenant, which strengthened the Moscow ' s impact area.
It was completely effective in all lacks of the biopolism system.
That was the lack of war on the European continent and relating to the stability of the situation in the Middle East.
The trafficking of winters in cold war has thus turned to strengthen international terrorism.
Following the series of terrorists in Europe and the United States in the "civilized world", I regret that there was no peaceful angle.
Despite the overall damage, Western refuses to talk to Russia at the level of equal partner.
In such terms, the only Unions of our country remain the flow and army.
Improvement of military power allows Moscow to retain national interests and to take out new destructions of the world policy.
The Captain Calum Skinner skinner is swallowing on the corner right, resulting from the Britain's gold
The Chief Colum Skinner was triumphed in a manner team at Rio's coast last evening, and the three of the Britain Commander protected his title from London in 2012.
The 23-year-old Glozgo was the strongest of his friend, Mr. Chris Hoy, who made his own, and the young man's gorgeous story was shopping on the finest right to gain the Favorite Team from New Zealand.
Britain made the right to an unexpected gain four years ago, when Hay made the right to the fifth of his six olympic gold meals.
And they repeated the trick, after they financed the skills of the world in the martyr cocktail on three guns in London, although Hoy has ended the carrier since that time.
The question between Pickin and London was replaced by the Specialist of James Staff.
They did as well as when Hindes appeared.
He also created a vacuum that Kyan Emady and Matt Crempton were trying to fill.
Skinner was a man who had been retained by British trineries, specifying the ability of statistics, which was now realised.
Handes, Kennie - Chepenines with Chuy four years ago, and Skinner set the olympic record in qualification, but the standard was overcome by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British three gained a goal for gold.
Hinds was right behind his round, but Kennie drew the command forward and Skinner supported.
The change of the strategy was the larger part of the transformation where the Hinds had gone to a greater transfer to turn and allow Kennie and, in particular, Skinner to hold the stage.
Haha observed his place as an invitated BBC expert and took the view of Skinner, Kennie and Hindesa, when they had come to the pizzads.
The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgo said, "It's a forest comparison."
I'm here to make everything possible and make myself a name.
We set the olympic record in the final and winners of the world.
It was incredible.
No better way to win.
After the triumph in London in 2012, Kennie and Hoy was recognized, Handes had been caught on a train after an unlawful start.
He was then rejected from the commentary, and there was no way to appeal from the European Competitors.
There was no such question in the greatest gain this time.
He said, "I felt like in London, with all the theme of Britain on the Tribe."
We've all met the team in the last three months.
We've been playing in so many courses with a world name that to win the olympiade again was just more amazing.
This is one measure, one gold meal for the country that has gained seven of the ten names of course as well as in Beijing and London.
If this is a bacrometer of progress made in the last five months, then the cold is waiting for five days to succeed.
With the form demonstrated by Kennie, it is not within the borders of the possibility to present how he repeated the movement of Chuya, playing three olympic gold meals in one games.
This would allow you to see how Kennie, who was about 12 years old, who also was born 23 March (especially appears a sacred date in the British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Reggree, M. Farhea and Roger Bannisster), to give his account to six gold meal and one silver.
It would be like Chue.
The next time, Kennie is in line with which it begins today and has been played for three days.
A 28-year-old outcome from Bolton said, "I'm just going to do this now.
Command orders are always the best.
You're coming to win with your friends.
It's little to play one another if honestly.
He said, "If he wins another two gold meals, he must get a reality."
It was the only day of the meal playing, but they followed the good news for Britain.
Mr. Bradley Wigkins, Ed Clinsey, Steven Berk and Owen Dull are qualified by the fastest four kilometres of the pursuit of four.
They fingered at 3:51.943.
Peace record established in Londra in 2012 is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42) are today at the second day of the activities where the Uign will be in the centre of attention.
He had a discussion with the Commissioners yesterday, a qualified carrier when the officers needed to measure it.
In the relevant female action, which renews and ends tomorrow, Laura Trutt, Joanan Roossell Shand, Elinor Barker and Kate Archibald, have improved the world record, shown time 4:13.260.
Great Britain Command came to the powerful team of warsers to take the middle of the Olympics game and for a number of meals.
Following exclusive demonstrations of full superfluence in Pacino and London, the expectations were disappeared in the gradual preparation to Rio.
There were dramas on the second plan, not the latest department of the technical Director of Shein Sathton in April because of the accused in sex and injury, and of major philosographs such as Chay and Victory Pendelton.
However, on the basis of the first evening on the summer, it seems that the légendar Majesty now in Britain's achievement may be again again.
The future Portland Metallurgic charge is threatened because of the disappearance of the electricity contract
The future Portland Aluminium in Victoria, as well as the hundred workplaces, is threatened because the electric energy company, which provides, in accordance with one of the owners, is going to investigate the contract: it is planned that all contracts will be deployed.
This step is the result of the decision taken by the Government of the Victoria in that year to not extend subsidies provided for support for the functioning of the battery.
The fixed subsidion for 20 years is in November.
To 2 000 workplaces may be threatened to the Alcoa company in Portland.
The total of 2.000 workplaces, directly and coherently, may result in the risk of any closure.
Additional coherent consequences may also be, since the metall burden requires approximately 10 per cent of the entire electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, the Alcoa company closed the metalluric burden in Pont Henry, which brought to the closure of electricity to England in the past year.
The Portland Metallurian company Alcoa lost money and risks close.
Those actions have been made to be a real-development on the future that continued over a few years, significantly due to the strong positions of Australian dollar and later on the price of the production of the burden.
AGL campaign, which had a large ambition of electricity electricity from its electricity Loy Yang A in Latarbe-Walley, reported that other three owners also had steps to disappear the treaty.
The control of the charge is a short-term company of Alcoa and Alumina, and the Chinese CITIC and the Japanese company, Marbuni Corp, is the smallest valley.
"AGL Communication expected that the Portland object continues to work, it is that the physical demand for electricity is not stopped by the metalluric burden," she said.
According to the AGL company mentioned, the contracts are so called "heached contracts", which should have entered into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month period, therefore they are completed in 2017.
"AGL company is therefore still expected that these contracts will bring their share of revenue in 2017," said the electric energy company.
What would be the potential impact on AGL's winning company starting from 2018 by the financial year, it is limited to the powerful market for optimum energy prices.
AGL company stated that the amount of treaties had already reduced at $187 million in the meaning of the "properly deployment".
According to the Alcoa company, it decides to distract contracts "not affect the power of Alcoa to manage the metallurgic charge or to provide electricity to metallurg. "
The American company said that Loy Yang had concluded a twentieth anniversary contract that had to be entered into force in November of that year, but she still needed to explain why it was deployed.
Analytics were concerned about the possible closement of the Portuguese metallurgic charge in Victoria, as well as the scope of Tomago near to Newcastle because of the unlawful economic situation in the field.
The AGL Exploiting Company AGL Steven Mikkelsen said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts each year, and Thomas approximately 900 megawatts.
If both of these provisions go from the market, significant reduction of the demand on the market [electricity].
For us, as for the producer, it will be bad," he said.
Not only a star of reality show Cardeshian, Kendal on the center of Vogue's
Kendal Jenner, 20 years old, model and fourth daughter Clain Cardeshyan-Minister, Chris, appeared on the expensive settlement of the United States Journal of Vogue.
Kendel, which is the breeding of Estee Lauder and defined the weeks of mode in Milan, Paris and New York, reported this news in his Institute in Thursday.
"I'm in the room together with my lovely people, and I looked at this clothes and laughed," wrote Kendal.
The news of the issue was a strange (or just in the spirit of the Cardashian Family?), prepared by the Vice-Video Family, in which all the Cardashyan-Jenner family (the Rob and Catlin, as well as the most lovely gentleman of the Vio-Bissung, producer of the Cardashian Family) Rayan Sikhard, had made an explanation of the secrets on the discount, and at the end of classic port: they planned a party of the Surprises.
This is the standard driving line of almost all children's television shows during the birthday (Sikrry says: "You thought we forget about you?" with sincereness of the program at 8:00, but Crisus was necessary that the glory might be reached or other girls.
Because with this episode, dedicated by the center of Vogue, we certainly entered into the new spectrum of Cardashian.
Let the older sister Kendal Kim get on Vogue's table before (when she appeared to her husband Canie West in April 2014), but the centuries of the magazine has been achieved by himself.
The Zenbrief Exhibition is the most sold out of Vogue for a year.
This is likely to be a donary publication than the model magazine, the output is a large number of advertisers (as the port of Fashionista contained 615 pages from the past 832 strenuous output).
The news of the stars of the stars are waiting for such an intolerance that the magazine photographs in the past two years have come to the official anonym.
The number of previous women falling on the discount include Naomi Campbell, Lind Gospelist and Kate Moss.
In the past few years, there were no doubts of more "changements that work models" than "the models which are characteristics".
The Laureat Prime "Ocar" and the Brunda Dior Jennifer Laurence was presented for the camping in 2013, after that year, Lady Gaga was caught.
But even in the smallest case, if Jenner, who has described the magazine as a "earning model" of his generation, falls into the first category, she's in an unfair company.
These characteristics are not the family of known people, the stars of reality show or modern children who know how to do good videos in Snapchat (when Jenner falls in all these categories).
These are actually talentous women who are deployed in the industry.
For Beyons, the past year, this year was one of the most successful in the carrier in relation to the Lemonade album.
Of course, it's not all happy for Jener's success.
The situation of Jenner in the world of mode, in view of the past star of the televisional reality, was always supposed to be tackled.
In June one of the first models of Victoria's Secret Stephani Seymorr discovered Jenniner and her college J.J. Hadd, called their "such as a moment."
These plants were re-enclosed after the Genner's event of the Vogue.
But it's not enough to mean.
Kendal Jenner at the center of Vogue.
It is a supermodal in all the meanings of this word.
She's defined for Mark James.
It's sold you a tonnic cry from Estee Lauder.
She, yes, all her sisters, sell your photographs in their same applications available to the pay signature.
She sold the photos made by the daughter of Sindy Crowford of LOVE's LOVE.
And at the free time, perhaps still seeing her sister Cortney and her children, it is part of the television reality show.
Legal centres refuse 160,000 per year
Any year more than 160,000 the least protected representatives of the population are reflected in public legal centres, as the sector is prepared to the effect that will provide further financing and that is already on the limit of the capacity.
In Queensland three of the five persons - mainly, older, immigrants, unemployed workers, victims of violence, persons who do not have the possibility of fighting the unfair ownership and also have already received a response in providing free legal assistance and representation.
The general legal services that are already working outside the possibilities are prepared for further reduction.
Since June next, these legal centres should lose further 30 per cent of federal funding.
The Director of the General Legal Centres of Clinslandd James Ferrell said that, in accordance with the last report of the National Association of Legal Centres, thousands of people have received reply for the year.
Forrell said that if the decision of the Federal Government would not be denied, the situation would only be disappeared.
"Cinnsland's legal centres are constantly inadequate financing: that means that thousands of people receive response to their vital services," said he.
People who are in force, people with unmanaged and disagreement debts, familys through disappearance are wrongly authorized, all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they cannot get help in which they need.
The Federal Government endorses the financing of 30 per cent from June 2017, and means that thousands of less defended in Kensland will be attempted to address complex legal issues without aid.
We call for the Minister of Justice and Senator Quinnsland George Brindis to immediately reject these financing reductions so that people may get the needful assistance when they face legal problems.
In the past year, the Government has fulfilled its commitment to establish free legal assistance to the average country indicator.
It is now time to focus on the needs of public legal centres and communities, their clients, and the Palestinian Government is now at the time of work.

Britain must send the olympic spirit to extend Hitrou
The Hidrou also offers reprehension and prosperity not only in our outstanding human points and in the whole of London but also throughout the country.
As I believe, this was exactly the huge advantage of Hitrou, just as it was with London 2012, where we have made all efforts to benefit from our population and regions from play.
Olympics have granted great benefits for Stratford and City.
And we'll do this again, creating a opportunity for local people and ferry near Hitrou.
Only for our huge human items, we create 10,000 new stations, 40,000 new workplaces and put the end of youth unemployment around the airport.
As before London 2012, those who think the task of expanding Hitrou will be too large.
They told me that British will never be ready to the olympic igrams, and that we're going to be in a difficult situation for a world arden.
The Catholics were mistaked in 2012, and they will show the wrong of Hitrou.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Hirou responds to any question given to it.
Like the Olympics Tool Hitrou is an infrastructure project for most, not only for a whole round.
The extension is the possibility of establishing up to 180,000 new jobs, $211,000, of the economic growth, of endangerment and employment in both airports and throughout the United Kingdom.
We have a wonderful team in Hitrou, which has implemented 11 billion funds of infrastructure investment at the time and within the budget, from T5, the best one of the airport airports five years under T2, which was built in the middle of two world's highest airports.
Now they are ready to ensure the third planning area confirmed by 16 billion private investment funds.
Olympics in London 2012 have been a huge success for Britain, and I am sure Hirou would also be extensive.
It was time for us to send the Olympic spirit to the needed rock and expand Hitrou, ensuring the future of our trade and to create heritage of customs and employment that Britain can be proud.

Adblock Plus, Facebook playing "sheets" on the locking of the advertisement
For the company that pay money for the Internet-Regullement, it is an attempt to have a programme security for the closure of the advertisement play, as one of the companies that creates such software security.
On Thursday, letterally a few days after Facebook announced that it was going to block the advertisers on his website version, Adblock Plus published the record that users could update their filters in the program to lock the report again in the social network.
In Facebook, he declared that the current version of the website changes the stage around its report to make the blocks of the advertisers easier to recognize what parts of the pages are an advertising.
But Adblock now states that you could get a new code.
In its publication, the representative of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that " some kind of mutual combat between the community of blockers' reportings with an open source code and those who are attempting to find it continued since the discovery of the locking of the advertisement," and that Facebook may present its own decision at the nearest time.
The fact that the largest social network in the world has entered into the fight is a clear sign of how great problems have become blockers of industrial advertisement.
In the world, approximately 200 million people use announcer, according to the past year's study of Pagefair and Adobe, almost four times more than those who used such programmes in 2013.
By 1,3 billion daily active users who are on Facebook through mobile devices, the mobile advertisement is 84 per cent of Facebook's income from the advertisement.
However, the company is flowing by the advertisers of the super version, as the mobile blockers are not effective in the mobile Facebook annexes for social network and Institute, according to the representative.
Nevertheless, the advertisement in the current version represents a sufficient proper article that Facebook makes such an opportunity-investment step.
Also, in Thursday, Facebook announced that it was going to update its "related preferences" tool to provide people more controls on how they are being advertised.
In Thursday, Facebook stated that the new Adblock filters were concerned, since they will also block some non-regular account on the website.
"There will not be a positive experience for people, and we are planned to address this problem," said the representative of Facebook in the official electronic letter.
Bloods are a huge tool, so we focused on creating such tools as Recommendated preferences to deliver managers into the hands of people.

Did it be possible to avoid a slaughter?
That's what the prosecutor must determine," said Hopsiteter.
Two similar events in the past five years are allowed to imagine that drivers will not be recognized.
Anyway, both of which are in the middle of the airway, has been deceived that cars could not wait for an accidental meeting on the middle of the night, reports the newspaper.
In the past year, the officer was justified from the cause of death for disappearance, after it had slain and killed a man at A1 above Pairn in August 2014.
The victim had drunk and lost awareness on the road, listed the court.
The Court discovered that a police woman, who had responded to the extract vocations, was managed by a vehicle that was recognized, and that a person 'exclusive and unprecedented situation' was “the court said.
Some person who has information on the event in Thursday should call for the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44.
NASA Climat model: Venner has ever been alone alone alone alone alone alone alone alerted.
The Winner may have been a new NASA model.
Students from the Institute of the Institute of Buddhes have developed a model for the past Veneries study, using tools and algoritms similar to climate-use.
The model was developed to determine whether in Venezuela, with its heatless surface and an atmosphere overwhelmed by the gas, ever existing conditions like the earth.
The scientists previously believed that the small reverse speed of Veneries was explained to its fleshly atmosphere.
But the last model suggests that Venice might probably have a disappeared atmosphere, like the earth, and still turned slowly.
The model also examined the futuring of the early Veneries.
In the planet, there were more soft regions than the earth, but sometimes there was enough water and sufficient geographical changes to create conditions for life and prevent fast speeding.
The early Venner was also going to use the sun, which was 30 per cent of the dark.
"In accordance with GISS, the slow turn of Veneria puts it a daily side to the sun nearly two months a time," explained in the communication for printing a scientist from GISS Ettony Del Hennio.
It raises the surface of the planet and produces the rain that creates a threshold level of clouds which operates as Zoontics, which protects the surface of the planet from a substantial part of the sun.
The results are the average climate temperatures, which, as a wonderful, are more cold than our day on Earth.
The model shows the Vienna's story like development, which previously introduced a planning specialists.
Despite the fact that Venice had ever been aligned, it had been made up for a number of milliards of years to be affected by a too large rain and an altrophiolic election.
Her oceans were disappeared, and its water pair was exhibited by an altrophial exclusion.
When her water hazardous, only the carboat atmosphere of carbon gas with the mortal parking effect -- that's what we know today.
Research Letters were shared by the results of their new Climate model Veneries in the Geophysical Research Journal.
Patrick Roy leaves Avalanche's team trigger
Patrick Roy left the trainer and the Vice-President of Colorado Avalanche in Thursday, refering to the lack of influence during the decision-making process.
The executive Vice-President/President of the Coad Commander Joo Saquik confirmed the news and noted that the club will start looking for a new trainer immediately.
"In the past three years, I have fulfilled my responsibilities of the Chief Chairman and the Hook Chairman of the Colado Avalanche with energy, loss and decision," said the Roy's 50-year statement.
For the years, I was gladly talking about how I could improve this team to bring her the needed deep and up a higher level.
In order to achieve this goal, the trigger vision and the Chairman of the Chokai activities, it should be ideal to agree with the organization.
It should also have the right to vote in the adoption of decisions affecting the work of the team.
These conditions are not implemented at the moment.
Sook, who took Roy 23 May 2013, thanked Roya for his contribution to the team.
"The appeal told me about his decision today," said Martha.
We appreciate everything he did for our organization, and we want him to success in the future.
Roy became the laureate prize Jack Adams Award as the best leather in his first session with Avalanche's team in 2013-2014.
He brought a club to 112 cells and victory to the Central Division, but Colordo was deployed by Minnesoto in the first round of the tribes of the offs and played the past two years.
Avalanche's Team announced evaluation of 39-39-4 in the 2015-2016 session and five points left from the Wild Team to combat the second League route to participate in Western Conference.
The Adler from Slowavo, Roy wind four cows of Stanley, two of Montreal Canada and Avalanche.
The Norte Sea Neighbors renew negotiations and stop the damage
Working for the payment of Affectants in the North Sea has been stopped, and all the parties of the discussion have come to the new round of negotiations, reported the leading representatives of the parties.
The Royal Dutch Shell ' s barriers against the Nepters Company were organized on the platforms in the North Sea, which were in the Royal Dutch Shell.
"Whood Group and United Nations and RMT Unions can confirm that we agreed to renew the negotiations process to solve current disputes," said the joint statement.
We will take several meetings on the full day for the next week, starting from the beginning of the next week to consider the problems of swimming consideration.
The Professionals reported that their recent action, which, in their words, was first than 25 years old, was aimed at potential reimbursement to 30 per cent.
The Wood Group company has reduced the rate paid by contract officials in the North Sea, approximately 9 per cent because of the negative tension of the market.
The decrease of the costs from the company has resulted after 10 percent decrease for contracting employees at the top of 2014.
According to the company, additional reductions will be added to its space to overcome the market.
The Shell company, on its side, reduced thousands of people and announced the plans to stop the non-Fettization activities in countries of number to 10, as it rationalises its activities because of its mega-line from the British Energy Competence of the BG Group.
Energy companies are pressed by decrease prices on unpurified net: the economic situation has been disappeared by decision to get out of the European Union adopted in June of the Great Brits.
The Scotland member of the Parliament, Dave Andersson, met the professors in this week previously to discuss one of the largest working conflicts in the North Sea in our epoca.
The North Sea said that it was vital for regional economy.
"In the north sea, and in the whole country, we need a economy that would work for most, not only for some," said he in the statement.
More than $1.4 billion would be paid for new projects in the North Sea in 2016, at the average value of about $7 million over the past five years.
Kipler measures the road return speeds to the Pleid copy
The last mission of the Castleler Space Telescope helped the Astronoms to gather the most full of the road return directory.
New data are helping the astronoms to understand why the stars in the copying are turned with different speeds, as well as the return periods relate to the planning.
"We hope that our results with other star copys are aware of the relationship between the mass star, its age and even the history of its sun system," said in the communication to print Louis Ribal, a scientist of the African Working Centre and an analysis at the California Technology Institute.
The Plaud’s collection is in 445 light years from the Earth.
Many stars in the copying are now only reaching creatures; they were born approximately 125 million years ago.
They're turning so fast as they're never going to be.
These growing stars are selecting a large number of stars.
The winds flowing the magnical fields of stars to the stars of the storm.
In the ancient stars, her rotation speed begins to be delayed.
Kepler measures the speed of turning every star, with the time between the appearances of the starfills, such as the sun cups.
The new rotation speed directory suggests that more massive stars are reduced to milk than less mass stars.
Ribal compares stars with dansers: larger pirates make merits than smaller.
"In the "Ball" we see that those who turn suddenly, usually more massive, while those who turn faster, usually relat to very light stars," said Ribal.
As the Pied copy is so close, it serves an ideal Space Laboratory to compare star properties with return speeds.
"Plauda's green copy provides a shipping point for the theoretical models of turning stars, both young and elderly," said Rachel.
We still want to know how, where and why the stars take their turn fast and go to their "Thanic Tuffs" appear to say.
Ribal and her colleagues detailed their last analysis of the reverse speeds in the three new articles which will soon be published in Astronomic magazine.
Research relating to the activities of the groups detained in the Crime of the Ukrainian Vierstone is conducted by two states.
In the FBI, there are evidence of the part of those detained to the preparation of differential in Crime.
As previously reported, the recognised statements gave the resident of the Ukrainian Energedor of Pawn Eugen agreed to cooperate with the consequence.
In his words, as objects for diversion, he considered the " Titan " chemise" in Armenia, the Nepthobaza in Theodo, the Kyrenian Park, the gas supply, and one of the military warlords.
Justice-defenders believe that the detention has been able to be far away from all guards.
This, inter alia, was the basis for the arrest of suspected in the Cypriot Paradise, notes the publication.
The main manager of the Russian Society has become the Yugoslavia
The Russian Federal Union had decided to appoint the head tribe of the Russian Society State of Curve.
The contract will be calculated for two years before the end of the CHM-2018.
On August 11, RFC was designed to the head tribe of the Russian Society Station of Croatia.
It is a well-known footballist who was the first player in the Moscow Space, as well as a trainer with a solid experience of such Russian teams, as all the "Transport", "Trerug", "Amkar", "Dinimo", as well as the angry "Lage", who has become a victor of national origin and the kitchen of the country.
It is reported that a contract will be signed with Cherche's nearest time and calculated for two years.
Thus, it is the obligation to prepare a collector for the world cupionate in 2018.
It is aware that his trigger chamber will enter peaceless Romahezko, Ginstarus Stauch, Herour of Panicos.
There is information on which the payment of the whole triumph is 2.6 billion euros a year.
According to the MSI, the RFS was set before the Czech Objective to bring the Russian collective to the pool and metal.
As the trainer himself stated, it considers the establishment of a competitive environment in the team and is going to give the footballists a opportunity to demonstrate himself.
He also welcomed the election to fall on him.
The first part of the Russian collection will be held in Antal, on 31 August, with the Turkish team.
Remember that the previous post of the Russian Russian Training Laonid Slave, who complyed him with the trainer in the CSCA club.
He stated that his post post post post-law national Russia's national team to Euro-2016 in France was taken.
He was therefore responsible for the bad result of the collection.
With an Angola and UNAR, Namibia was strongly encouraging during long fight against the apartheid.
However, after South Africa's independence in 1990, the country with population has reached great success, particularly in the past few years.
The main reason of the success of Namibia is that the Government has greatly focused on education.
While people in developed countries receive the same understanding of the primary and average education, in many poor and even primary schools need to pay for education.
Furthermore, Governments are often advised to pay for "payments".
However, in Namibia's primary school education is free.
Moreover, since 2015, the media education has become free.
The authorities of the countries are also actively working on other important directions.
Malarian destruction forces have reduced by 97 per cent over the last ten years.
In contrast to the international trend of non-equality growth, Namibia has been reduced.
As compared to the indicator of 1993, Jani's coefficient, which is the standard indicator of income distribution, has been delayed at 15 paragraphs.
Then, 23 years ago, this indicator was one of the highest in the world.
The poverty level has reduced from 69 per cent in 1993 to 30 per cent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (per less than $1.90 per day) has also reduced from almost 53 per cent to less than 23 per cent.
Namibia also has the highest in Africa's freedom of words, under the "Rporteurs without borders".
The country has significantly warned the United States and other rich States.
Furthermore, the country has a pleasant recital - one of the highest in Africa - in the Index of Corruption, which is human rights from Transparency.
Even now, when the prices of the rock fall, Namibia is able to keep high growth rates.
At the same time, the debt of HIV is approximately 25 per cent, which is less than third level of debt in the United States and most of the European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The level of unemployment, at least on traditional methods of evaluation, remains sufficiently high - almost 28 per cent.
And, as other countries in the region, Namibia is high-level disease level of HIV/AIDS, nearly 17 per cent of the population are informed.
According to the World Bank, Namibia is related to a number of countries in the middle income, but the authorities believe that their State is actually a developing country.
The Namibian, of course, faces some challenges that have been deeply developed by the economy.
The State must be developing a very large and delicate country with a small population.
In the territory of the country in the deserts, the mixed tribes of complaints who have to be integrated in the modern society without loss of their identity.
Integration of the fourth century of the world economy is not easy for any country.
For Namibia, it is more difficult: as any other country in the world is, it faces the impact of climate change.
However, Namibia had not thought to leave her hands, but the country decided the problems that were before her.
At the same time, after the residence of independence, the establishment of a observed economy and a compulsory society has been established.
It is noted that concurring political factories were gathered together to work for a common good.
Actually, Namibia provides careful health services not only for their own citizens but also for their neighbourhoods.
A number of 15 to 20 per cent of medical institutions in the north of Namibian citizens of Angola.
No one in Namibia speaks about the construction of a wall that would separate the country from poor and corrupted neighbourhoods.
The Ombudsmans understood that neighbourhoods had not chosen, and therefore decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate in deficient water resources, to participate in regional medical projects, to promote investment and exchange students.
Furthermore, the Government of Namibia has justly condemned that rich natural resources could be easily cured by facilitating the gain of many.
The authorities understand that income from the natural riches of Namibia is required to contribute to infrastructure and production powers.
They also recognize that it would not be directly attempt to obtain a maximum profit from the country's sales of resources, and re-enforce investment laws and contracts to ensure that it is possible.
Transparency has a vital importance for this process, therefore the strong support of the Government of the freedom of the Word is so important.
As the head of the State Hague Guingob noticed, the SMEs often say that he doesn't like.
But after combating the free of apartment in South Africa Namibia, Namibia must protect the freedoms received, the President said.
Not all Namibia key resources are exposed.
Some such as fishery are relating to renewed, and the Government makes all efforts to maintain and strengthen them.
More than a million foreign tourists each year visit the country.
Namibia shows that even the countries that begin with serious lacks of racism, colonial construction, non-equality and low development can be on the way to general prosperity.
Its achievement provides international recognition and expression.
Many have heard about the Gold of Warne's former gold objects created by man (4600 and 4200 before our hero).
Successfully, this was the most highest archeological sensation of the 1970s: in Bulgaria, when the Warnant Neck point was discovered, a fantastic number of gold artefacts was found to be more than three thousands of total weight of six kilograms.
Only one safeguard known as "aide No. 43" was issued 990 gold objects over 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the former gold of the world can rapidly be moved to an inevitable form of business found by archeologists in July of this year.
Again, in Bulgaria, it is known as Tel Yenazite.
In the apartment of the Warn, the Port City, Tel Yenazite is located from the sea, beyond the village of the Pazard region.
Business represents a gold pillar in the kitchen.
Ivor Boyajyav, the manager of discharge in Telle Yonazite, reported a 4600 years before our hero and stated that she was the elder of Barne at least 200 years.
Warn’s treasures are given approximately the same period, 4600 - 4200 v. before our ere.
Technology allowing the accuracy to provide metal is now not available.
Where is the certainty of the gold that is older?
Of course, professor Boyajyav knows more than she reported the Reuters Agency: "I am perfectly sure that the gold of the Barne's older Gold."
This is an emergency importance: this is a massive object, but it is enough to take the place like in the story.
In the interview of Reuters, Boyajyav reported that the scientists analyzed the metal composition as well as again and more carefully learn the archeological plastic where the gold artefact is found.
This helps to give a bowl with a maximum accuracy.
It also explains a lot of places.
The Telephone is a visit, even if you've never heard about it.
At the present time, Tel Yenazite is considered the ancient "ward" of Europe.
The Tel was based on the seeds of people migrated in Europe from Atlantics (temporary Turkey) in seven thousands of years before our hero.
During the next century, the processing of metalles has been deployed by the first metalluric levels before the establishment of a full industry.
The original history of this architecological area is particularly named: Balcano-Karpatian metallurian province.
In five thousands before our hero around the metal work centres began to visit the city type.
They are now called the ancient towns of Europe.
Of them, Tel Yenazite may be the oldest because the artefacts were found here in 4900 before our hero.
I'd be called Tel Yinazite Prototype of the modern city, although it's very old visit, even in comparison with the Mesopotamy.
"It is the place of the older Shamera for a thousand years," said Bojakia, in view of the general view that the city culture was born in the south of the Mesopotamia - modern Iraq.
There were the first cities in the usual understanding of this word.
The Tell Yonazite copies will be held since 1976.
The archeologists have discovered nearly 12 hectares, and this is approximately a third of the term of the territory of the accommodation.
The rest of the strong wall was found, which sometimes reached three meters in the height.
From houses and masters, however, the archeologists clearly differentiate the streets, public buildings, the valuable buildings, the Defence Centre and the housings.
The Telephone is often called "Picking City", which was found by the decades of the fowls of the birds.
All birds were reflected in the room state, from there there it was a proposal that they were not de-dearly objects but an object of local ball.
The "Pitty City" has been destroyed about 4100 before our ere - perhaps the Indian tribes coming from North East.
There were no towns, there were horses and weapons.
Three metresised walls have not stopped.
Archaeology discovered clear signs of hard battle: Inside the houses were found the remaining of older, women and children with the slaughters of slaughters.
New income and new facts are annually changed by the customs presentations of the old history of humanity.
Bolgarian archeologists are not more often talking about individual cultures but of the 'traditional' first civilization of Europe born in the Balkans.
The powerful style in the search of this civilization was the "lood Warne" remarked in 1972.
Loyally that the gold roses of Barne had to do something - something like an golden business created in Telle Unnicit.
In Porsche, the model was artically old 911 2020
Officially stated that the preparation of 911 2020 4S Excluding Design is the manual specialists of the units working with series cars.
It is, for example, an special color of Etna Blue, which was yet developed in 1960 for the Porsche model 356B -- this color has even increased the logotype model.
Furthermore, the tour received a fixed white grafic of boats and the 20-due-coal drives RS Spiyder, and some details of the cow formulation in the "Blue-soil metallic".
It is noted less: it is, according to the large account, of the green-symic system, new steels with expanded electricity ranges and the black anedged corns with the lootics of the unit.
Furthermore, when buying a special version, each buyer will receive the gift of the car and a rich album with the photographs of the production process.
The solid installation of Porsche specialists Exclusive is not become: the retro-tarthr in the characteristics is completely compared with the series.
It is found by a six-cylinder motor, with a huge amount of 3,0 l, developing 420 l.s. and 500m.
The dynamic version 911 2020 4S can be accelerated to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 2020 4S Excluding Design will be issued by a limited title, but neither its amount nor the value of each individual sportet will be reported.
Facebook and the Bloods' reporters have linked the "arms" garbage.
Recently, Facebook technology preventing reports on the social pages has facilitated decision-makers to block response advertisements.
In AdBlock Plus, he was sent by the adversary, but Facebook is planning to do soon and to be useful.
Thus, AdBlock Plus has proclaimed its new technology, which will remain a short time.
The representatives noted that, seeking to deceive the new "related" report technology, AdBlock Plus decision with commercial declarations is blocked and many common provisions from friends or pages.
In Facebook, this AdBlock Plus policy was happy and promised soon to address the problem.
As the source of the TechCrunch editor, the AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook site will be ready for the nearest hours.
Thus, traders and blockers have linked their kind of arms, seeking to play each other by the same party, users who have left interesting accounts from friends or seeing the advertisement where they had not been able to see it.
The ethnic aspects of the advertisement block are recently huge disputes.
In Murmank, a violenceer will be presented before the court of the Western Murmank.
The case has already been investigated in the Russian Federation Committee.
The condemnation made by a 54-year-old man is very serious to the effectiveness of violence of sexual nature.
Followed that, at the end of November 2015, Paul's convicted street in Murmansa had committed acts of sexual abuse against 20-year-old girls.
The sanction of this article provides the maximum punishment of freedom for a period until six years.
Dongfeng brings to Russia Crussian Fengguang 370 and Rich New Website For Rule www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 - a representative of the population in China's class of cars, compared with the mine and the cylinders.
Another denunciated Russian Premier - Rich New Pykip.
Many west firms of the Moscow International Autosolon in this year decided to ignore, so the desolation of the Cross Expo ' s grounds will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, the powerful border will be the Dongfeng Motor corporation, with larger species of Russian markets and an intention to propose to our cars a number of interesting news.
One of them will be the curse of Dongfeng Fengguang 370, which has been sold in China at the price of 55 900 June (such as less than 550 kilometres in the current currency).
As far as Russians can be lighted, the question of the positions in our country is still in the debate stage.
In China, finally, Fangguang 370 on the end of the Yunish sales, fengguang was reached to the 11th place in the list of the most sold mines, although in the view of the largest road education (175 mm) and the protection of the plastic alignment on the lower perimeter of the peak can be fully appreciated to the census.
Crosswen is built on the front-in-train platform model Fengguang 360, in the 370, the same car base is 2725 mm, but the shoes are less longer (4565 mm against 4510 mm), the disaline and the disappearance of the disaster.
The salon has increased wooden planets, but shown on the photo of the great vertical sensors screen "a Tesla" on the central console was only on the early exhibitions of cylina, and the sale of cars made with the "music" easy.
Five of the seven landscapes are easily combined, forming a red wearing area of 1650 mm long, a maximum size of 1500 l.
The driver for Fengguang 370 provides a 1,5-literal "atmosphere" for the power of 115,000 v.s., which has a 5-profit mechanical transmission.
On dinamic qualitys, the producer has slowly decreased and promised the pleasant budget of the owner to operate at 6.7 l/100 km.
The Picpe Rich New is a well-known Russians of Nissan NP300 Navara's past generation, but with a loudly famous Chinese style.
Despite the morally old construction, this model is still used by a stabil demand for the Chinese consumer as a reliable and uncomfortable "laughter horse".
At the east price Rich New Truth is probably interesting and Russians, because the modern Japanese pirates became immediately ways.
Rich New is designed by two carriers to select: 2.4 s.l (137 l) or concern 2.5 l (116 l.s.).
The transmission is only the mechanical, the port is on the back of the wheel, but there's modalizations and it's easy to be associated with the front.
It will be on the wall of Dongfeng and the new flagman seed A9, and his Russian Prime Representative of the Chinese Francism has anonyshed yet in June.
In the Chinese market, mineral clusters are more than one of the last news Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
At present, the Russian Line Dongfeng is of two models: S30 and H30 Cross chapter.
In the seven months of this year, the discipline of the Chinese firm was made in our country 696 cars.
Transport information will be stopped sending the mail site by www.zr.ru
The Inspection has changed the order of the list of notifications on property stocks.
All Russian carriers have increased in the past years of scheme: a year and a month they will receive car rental payment for the previous year.
Yet, many of them will not attain to this year.
It is that the inspection of the inspector without a lower noise has changed the order of notice to nationals.
Those registered in the "Local Supplier Office" at the Nalog.ru office of the Nalog.ru offices will be e-mailed.
In the inspection, such Russians were automatically marked by the online users and drew them out of the standard "mobile" list.
The news are affected by all the owners of vehicles and non-mobility.
All others will continue to be received.
However, the possibility of return to the old scheme is also the owners of accounting on the website.
To this end, they will visit and write a statement during August.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and pleasant.
The notice is appeared in the "life office" immediately after the preparation, while the letter is going for a few days and may be lost.
The added number of users of the Internet Inspection inspection has exceeded 18 million people, allowing the status to succeed in the post.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection are not obviously sufficient to inform nationals about changeing the right.
Some could be registered in the "life office" to obtain a unique service and forgot it long.
These persons will not wait for e-mail advised and, in the same way, will fall into the category of non-paids with all the results of the effects.
Access to the "Local packet" is performed by three ways: through accounting port of gosuslugi.ru, using the email signature or login and password specified in the registration card.
The last can be obtained personally in any local inspection (independent from the terms of account).
We recall that the transport bulletin has to be paid until 1 December.
The release of notifications started in July.
The Mercedes-Benz G-class, which is designed to achieve a very high delivery, is something in itself.
But the controversia concept did not hurt the G-Power company masters, who were undertaken to modify Mercedes-AMG G 63 sports.
G-Power's savings to BMW cars, but nobody of his human masters is a stranger.
Indeed, why would not improve G 63-571-function aircraft with a tank and a hundreds of cm?
On the starting of the mosques, the master was used by the privileges that opens the 5-litro pound "sound."
And this is the dinamic diagram to the hundreds has improved the unlike 0.1 c, and now the cyrpick is capable of 5.3 c.
However, the average speeds are probably better given to him.
The speed ratio defines: If the standard G 63 is not going faster than 210 km/h, the tunnel of the electronized electrical one is able to over 250 km/h.
Research cars practically unlikely from its first pipeline, except other car CDs 23-due Hurricane RR size 305/35 ZR 23.
The Mercedes-Maybach unit has anonymous a huge concept of 6 m long that represents a comprehensive compound in Pebble-Bikch.
Mercedes-Benz campaign is going to compete with BMW i 'Green Subbound' and to move its electric models under a separate trade brand.
In the next years, at least four environmental news are expected.
