Goodach: More security for feet
They are not 100 meters away from each other: on Sunday, the new B 33-Fußion camps are taken in the village park place - in the vision of the old council area.
Two installations so close to each other: view or screening?
This question has been clearly answering the question of the Guarantee Minister yesterday.
"The Council Chamber is at the same time installed because it is secure the school," said Eckert yesterday.
The Cluser-Amulation secure railways as well as bus drivers and the mountains inhabitants.
The official installation adopted yesterday is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirst Street.
We have the museum, two churches, Kurpark, the Business office, a doctor, a bank and the transport flights from the accommodation area ›Grubć.
"Before the high transport and football agreement, there was a further range to them," said Eckert.
This also confirms Peter Arnold by the Council of Agriculture Offenburg.
"As the current measurement of B 33 a day about 12 000 vehicles are about 10 percent of swimming transport", said Arnold.
So, the building of another axis is more than needed: "Secure is easy here", says Arnold.
In total, four views of transport have been carried out, even a movement has been considered, however, again dismissed because of the greenhouse area Sulzbachweg/Kirst Street.
It was described by Arnold at the location of the Ampelmasters before all: "Founds of an extra for us with particularly long wooden transporters we have tried whether these vehicles can go out from the Sulzbachweg to B 33 without nicking the most accompanied."
The approximately 15,000 euros are the "modernest that is now on the market", Arnold explained.
The installation is equipped with rare LEDs, which are so strong that the lighters of the cars are also good at the deep sun.
And slowly, it is also: the older light plants consum approximately 100 Watts, the new eight Watts just eight.
For carset, there are three light plants.
Arnold explained the technology of the new installation: this is equipped with two radar sensors.
Press the football button, test the above radar sensor the transport situation.
If the road is free, green for the feet if not, it takes about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the feet.
"When a group or prevented people go through the road, the green phase will extend, so everyone is sure about the road," Arnold said.
Of course, the carriers must think as a partner here and watch the train.
This was not yesterday the case: Kaum showed the shape for footballs green, rawed a high class factor through - when lighting red.
Josef Winkler has been written for more than 30 years the nucleus of his childhood and youth of the soul.
The catastrophes of his Catholic villageness - the speechlessness, the haughter to rock violence and dumping sexuality, the brain and unfairness - has described a lot of stuff.
Acknowledged is the booking booking carrier, especially as prosa author, the texts are rare in his work.
Collage of prosa texts Gerhard Fresacher provides for its instruction "Weather lights on the tongue", which is now seen in the garage X at the Peter's place, so a collection of prosa texts together.
The theatermaster connects some of the elements of the Roman's autobiografic "Theeigene" (1987) with prosaminiatures from "Leichnam, his family betrayed" (2003).
On the widely empty bottles - important recruitment: a disqualified sofa that is collected and masturbed - the eight-country enveloped part is the text material.
It seems to be a little confidence to the text.
The 70-minute performance override the proposal with a full of cases of regional accidents, known by the repertoire postdramatic game forms.
In particular, the players are in the case of some wonderful scene implementations.
They are hardly touched with the head under the water, with their dinners on the wall.

However, the text does not have any extension on this manner.
The best moments have the evening when it sounds - the band width is enough from Deep Purple to the popular liedgut.
First of all, the overwhelmed instruction comes to peace, and the wind creature of absurd humor is blown.
A black box in the car?
US-American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the affected highway system, and believe that the solution is found in a small black box found in the armor breast of each car.
The devices designing every kilometre dangerous and reporting the information to the authorities are a core of a contrive attempt of Washington and the United States planning officers to revise the US-American financing system.
The normally higher long-term planning area has soon been a intensive debate with raw alliances.
Freeers have been engaged with environmental groups and have expressed that the government is the small box for the design of the dangerous kilometres, as well as where they have been used – and then the information can be used for the calculation of tax disclosure.
The Tea Party is detained.
The American Civil Rights Agreement (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection issues.
However, while some can't be able to take place in the Congress, several federal states have no longer waited.
They are currently checking how they can change to a system in the next 10 years, paying the driver per secure miles.
A thousands of car vehiclers have already been equipped with some GPS supervisors.
This is really a museum for our country.
“It's nothing that we can only be used”, said Hasan Ihrata, Director of South California Assn. of Governments, which planned an appointment of the dangerous miles in all California cars in the U.S. from 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology is here.
The initiative comes at a time as the Highway Trust Fund is financed from the taxes that US Americans are deprived in the sample.
However, in America, it will not be done so much as before.
Cars consume less benzin.
The minimum oil tax of 18.4 cent per gallone (more than 4 Euro per liter) has not been increased for 20 years.
Political cars at high spectrum prices, not to increase the tax only for a center.
“The Benzin tax is not easily accessible” says Lee Munnich, a expert for transport law at the University of Minnesota.
His Federal State has recently equipped 500 cars with car writers with which a mechanised payment system should be paid.
“This makes the most reasonable alternative to long term” he said.
Official screens describes it as a mile-based user cost.
It is not surprised that the idea is found at the stidic liberal approach, for for example, the tax has allowed us to affect the retail to reduce steel and climate abuse.
Californian planners set up the system in the development of strategies with an ambitious, legally deployed objectives of the Federal State to climate change.
However, the Republicaner Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, Chairman of the House Transport Committee, also explained that he sees the most long-term alternative in it.
The free marketing marketers of the Reason Foundation are also made by the idea to pay drivers after backed streets.
“It is no tax that falls in a black loch” Adrian Moore, Vice-President of Directives at Reason.
People pay directly for what they got.
The movement is also supported by two previous American transport ministers who had requested the Congress in 2011 to move in the direction of metall-based calculation.
In the last year, the US Senate approved a $90 million by the pilot project that would include 100,000 cars.
However, the majority of the representative house prevented the presence and reacted on the concerns of Members from rural areas that represent people who are often needed to return to work or to the city.
More federal states and large cities are not moved in this direction.
The most important Oregon is currently 5,000 drivers for the greatest experience of the country.
These drivers will soon pay the mile costs instead of the minimum oil tax to the Federal State.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City also considers such.
Illinois tests it in limited measure with Lkws.
And the I-95 coalition, to which the Ministers of Transport of 17 US States are in the East Coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently investigating how you can introduce the amendment.
The concept is not universal Hit.
In Nevada, where a few 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices, cars were skiptic at the thought that the government could pursue every one of their movements.
Alauddin Khan, Chief of Strategic Management and resulting in the Ministry of Transport of Nevada, said: “Remembers against Big Brother and such things were a great problem”.
People didn't want it.
When the test arrived, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: “It would be relatively easy to transform the carriers into growing monitoring devices.”
There is no need to build a huge, slow-related technical infrastructure that would be used unnecessaryly to capture data on the daily movement of individuals.
Nevada is a number of US states who are now taking a technological exhibition with which the State can take the identified kilometres but not exactly when and where.
Thus, Khan, would also be aware of public.
The jagd after this technology has brought some authorities to a small startup undertaking named True Mileage in California.
The company is originally not undertaken to assist federal States in the control of vehicles.
Moreover, it was their aim to take foot into a wide market for Kfz insurance, where drivers should pay on the basis of the dangerous miles.
However, its devices are also interested for the road plans because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that are regularly loaded by modem.
“ People are ready to participate in when their speed and position is not designed," Ryan Morrison said, manager of True Mileage.
In some of these public pilot programs there were great mistakes.
There are essentially more and less intrusive opportunities to use this.
In Oregon, planners experience cars to give a number of choices.
You can decide for a device with or without GPS.
Or they do not choose any devices and pay a payment rate on the basis of the average numbers of all inhabitants of the State.
Other places hope to sell the concept of a misstrauical public by extracting devices with more functions than less.
In New York City, transport officers want to develop a device for control, which also allows parking costs to be paid, the insurance must only be paid for the dangerous kilometres and the speed data of other vehicles in real time can be extracted by the driver's steel.
“Orients would be motivated by the value of the benefits that the system offers to participate,” it means in a City planning document.
Some transport plans, however, ask whether the whole wheat is not only a huge delay manager.
At the Metropolitan Transport Commission for San Francisco Bay, the Congress could solve the problem of the highway Highway Trust Fund by enhancing the power tax.
Additional single payment or annual allocation may be recovered with cars with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little gases, so they also pay a fair share.
“There is no reason for a operation if a aspirin is sufficient” said Randy Rentschler, head for legislation and public affairs of the Commission.
If we do this, hundreds of millions of carriers make care of their privates and many others.
Queenfeld: Small manager smoke wacker
The voluntary fire of the wild fire recommended its main tests, notwithstanding personal managers with Bravour.
Only eleven men took part in the production.
Chairman of the Division Hans Kammerer had visited the Federation in the castle of Burgberger.
There should be a short-term closure during the summer.
Through the outstanding flag and rain development, two people were killed, but one of them could still be called.
Two defenders of the Weather were prepared to enter the building after the first review of the scope by Hans Chamber.
After a short time it was to find the first person and read in free.
The second person had to be led.
This wasn't so easy because it was also to overcome a close lot.
The building, a workshop with integrated standing for two horses, wasn't easy to secure.
It layed a lot of wood, and also strohballs there.
Furthermore, there were electric machines for wood processing.
The first leachangon was conducted on the tank in the vehicle.
Another guidance occurred on an overfluor Hydrant in approximately 100 meters of disappearance.
There could now be three leather attacks.
The use of the building was also a hole roof.
Hans Chamberer was also to describe what was not available with a lower staff.
In the first case, the Royal Governing Group will be supported.
The commander was satisfied with the end of the performance.
Relation to high schools and companies
At his visit in the Briisgau-Hochwarkwald, President of the Land Day Guido Wolf also explained where the work forces come from tomorrow.
He went together with professional school leaders and the roundsgymnasium and the parents' parents' parents' heads of this important issue.
"Picture is an important location factor", underline Claudia Stehle, Director of the Hans-Thoma School, which presented the networked school education centre of High BlackWald.
Wolf was expressed on the forms of training projects.
Since 2011, there is a successful cooperation in the forest city between the Food Centre, the Kreisgymnasium and the Professional School.
He also commend the family friendliness in the countrykree.
"It is important not only to have the family phase in view, but also because of the demographic change, the stage for the scope of the diagnosing of persons," said Wolf.
He also emphasized that more employees were worried about the guns and the defence of their members.
"Unless the support of the employer can lead the resulting burden of employees to an end of the employees," Wolf said.
But no one could make it possible to lose qualified work forces, he said further.
Another, particularly important factor is the connection of high schools and enterprises.
"Whoever has already learned the presence of the region during his study, remains with its skills and its abilities of the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region," the President of the country showed.
For only if there were enough training places, the training force can be covered.
In view of its view, the country Cross' benefit is its advantages of the situation in South Western Germany, directly close to France and Switzerland.
He also experienced on his journey from Titise-Neusstadt to Freiburg the efforts already understood for the construction of public transport.
"Let you continue to worry and make sure that public transport will be better," he said to the address of the present communical policies.
A substantive afternoon experienced with music
Since 15 years, Kaul's Family calls the Dieting Seniors to coffee, kitchen and then to a vesper.
Earlier, the elderly fellows were conducted in the racist villages.
Meanwhile, this afternoon will be held in the Flegeheim St. Josef.
The households are glad at the lacking cups and Tortens.
Later, there was a wrestsal.
With current melodys Silvia Kimmich and her father Karl Kimmich were understood.
More than 100 years of old natural wall as a front limit of the old school in the Cyprist Street will be re-evaluated with the Sanification cost plan of the city's shipments.
In the days before the Kilbig, a small winkel wall was built at the first work of the santion of the previous school, to stabilize and statistical deployment of the Balustrade over a hundred years old natural stone.
The other steps provides that Alexander Misok is from the Brannling City building to enter into plans and to create a sanitation concept for the old wall.
A cost calculation shall be taken by experts which will then be put to the Communities Council for decision and fixing the further action on the table.
A decision of this will, for example, be taken in the next year.
Following the sanitation, deployment and planting of the old school court within the two side flows of the 1912 school, it is necessary to be healed in an indefinite time as a successful measure, the necessary limitation wall on the basis of the new construction.
The historical, a hundred years of ancient schooling wall to the Kirest Street, is, above all, through water and fresh roads, as there is no drainage need for sanitation, and has a gun-up rehabilitation.
Deep river in individual stones produce white pains, but the wall is currently not in danger.
A standing wall is a requirement for one of schools to be used by schools, which is carried out by the current operations.
Originally, school sanctions were already planned in the years 2008/2009, but high unplanatory expenditures had been disappeared.
An important word in the historical school sanitation, which has already been used for films, will be admitting the country-de-de-malam.
If provisions come from this page, then the city's brunettes takes places on the grounds of the thinking shoes.
The students of the Brunling Founding School, who are teached again in a good healthy old school with new Aula, can soon use the old school.
Auzdemir wants to receive Jazzaus education in Stuttgart
In the persistent discussions about the future of the musichoch schools in Baden-Württemberg, Cem Özdemir, Federal Chairman of Greens, has now been included.
"I think it's wrong to put up the whole education in the music School Stuttgart," said Auzdemir, "Stutgarter News".
Jazz and class are just at the Jazz standort Stuttgart.
This is contrary to Uzdemir, which is in Stuttgart as a favorite for a direct sentence at the Federal Section on 22 September, the Green-Royen Government.
This requires a new regulation of five musichoch schools in Baden-Württemberg.
Then, among others, the course of Jazz and Pop of the Musichoch School Stuttgart should be placed to the musichoch School manheim.
US width: "Super-Tonnel" to drug wheel
At the border between Mexico and the United States, Ermittler discovered a "Super-Tunnel" to the drug wolf.
As shared by the U.S.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.A.,
Three suspects were then determined, eight tonnes of Marihuana and almost 150 kilograms of Kokain.
The tunnel was not yet taken into use as a result of the information.
"These cards are stupid if they think they could be buried under the Radar," said the United States District of South California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference before a camping house in San Diego, where the end of the tunnel was discovered.
Drugs are settled by Duffy: "If you continue to build such tunnel and try to use them, we have decided to make money to a huge disappearance of your yours."
Although the US authorities, as well as the Mexican security forces, are in a long chamber against the drug card.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people were killed in Mexico in relation to drug criminality.
The experts built by
Through the outstanding provision of the tunnel, the producers describe that he was built by architects and engineers and that the construction took a year.
It was so valuable that electrical cars could be used there.
On the Mexican side the access is located in a building that is 80 meters away from the border.
According to the authorities, a leader leads a 20 meters to the duty to the real tunnel line.
The tunnel has a round of 1,20 meters height and 90 centimeter width.
It would also be appropriate to promote illegal immigration direction of the United States.
Two of the suspects were established in connection with the Kokain Fd.
The third, a Mexican, was caught by the slaughter Marihuana.
All three are as the highest trace of the lifetime of liberty, as the officers said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels were discovered, it continued to take the press conference in San Diego.
But it is the first time that Kokain was found in such a tunnel building.
It is usually cokain in smaller amounts and not through tunnel.
This demonstrated the "disconduction" of drugs, whose traditional roads are divided in particular, said Bill Sherman of the Drug Fact DEA in San Diego.
You would do everything to get in the United States.
No details were given to the festivals, at least six mexicans, named it.
You need to calculate along ships up to 10 years.
2014 will be held by Gesinger festival
The July of the city of Geisingen will be 1250.
Return of the first urkal mention is always closer.
In good eight weeks the year ends, the Jube Year is attained.
Geezes and church chauses were mentioned 794 first originally.
In churches a sentence was made in which both places were mentioned.
On 15 March, there should be an official attainment to the jubilee year, and since the guests are currently not a hall, this event will be placed in the place where 1250 years ago, in the church chauses.
In the framework of the Jubileeum, some events are planned in geis, as well as in church chauses.
In July, a festival is held from 18 to 20 July on 1250.
Return to the feast.
On Friday with a festival on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the crystal.
Furthermore, this festival is the church-hausen festival of churches.
The townmusic director Rudolf Barth has written a composer for the city where the Yugoslavia is set up at three deadlines.
On 21 June, together with the Son application feast of the Black Wald Convention, on 12 July in the Arena with firewerk and on 13 December as the first concert of the citymusic in the new festival.
This will be completed and understood in July 27 and 28 September.
In addition to the Geising City Jubilium, a new chronic is also issued.
"But a chronic should not only be made of jealousy itself, but a printed work of today, which is the same thing from geisings, church chauses, leipferds, selfs and well-beings," says the citizen Walter Hengstler.
And also today's feast feeding 2014, 1974, the present space was completed with the internal entertainment.
The new chronics will then be presented in the new festival in feedings on 21 or 22 November.
2014 is also a year with many jubilees.
The Narrenzunft Strohglonki starts on 8 February with a brawl's abuse at its 60-year-old substance, the Harmonie Goodmadations will be 90 years and the festival of March 29, and then fees from 1 to 4 May.
The old work Leipferdingen is 40 years old, the Geising School has been in the new location for 50 years and felt this on 10 May, the music Verein Polymania Leipferdungen will be 150 years old and felt this in the framework of the Bruns feast from 4 to 7 July.
The city of Geisingen was mentioned in a classification tour in the owner of St. Gallen, in the first year 764.
The Uruguay was made in churches (heaven) which was at the same time a court place.
The two municipalities are then mentioned in the same sentence.
For 2014, this 1250-year-old is also the community reform for 40 years.
Council adopted Gleisanlagen in the Visier
Should the railway "Am Hirschen" be constructed in order to increase the security of the transport?
Yes, the municipal devices decided.
It is necessary to take 220 000 euros in the hand.
The German Bahn in the next year wants to improve the Kinzigtal Bahn streets.
In particular, the safety of train transactions should be increased - regularly it is in line with collations of twice with other vehicles.
Voting the communities to the reconstruction measures, they must be shared with a third of the costs that share the rest of the rail and the bond.
Schiltach's City building minister Roland Grießhaber explained the municipality's speciality of the cross crossing "Am Hirschen".
There the city is planning to build an exhibition at the west of the train.
There could also be greater vehicles, for example, transporting long woods, belonging to anti-related transport without locking the glosses.
For this reason, the Guidelines suggested that the city could extend the road to date, to ensure a cleaning low transport flow.
This was discussed in the municipal Council of Controvers, since some races were the need for a road distribution in doubts: Thomas Kipp brought the timing of the criticians to the point: "We could take so few vehicles so much money?"
Citizene Thomas Haas resisted: The "Hirschen" railway will be used regularly for long-wood transport.
Even wood from the "Kuhbach" sector will partially be transported on these streets, because the vehicles haven't been able to use the streets on the pocket browser, because they couldn't be in the main streets.
Furthermore, the streets as a rotation for the vehicles that do not allow the tunnel to be used when the main trail is locked, have argued haas.
As it is obvious that Kirchberg and Schlossbergonnel building and sanitation should be made as this is now in Wolfach of the case, you can also get the "Am "Hirschen" transition for a longer period of transport.
The roads agreed to investigate which costs would cause the costs to extend the road widespread.
Unlike this, the reconstruction of the train transition has been granted mostly with the measure that the necessary support wall is built so that the city could build the following road direction "Bahnhofs Traße" in the case of the shipment of around 5,5 metres.
The reconstruction of the train crossing to the railway could cause a whole other problem that affects the rise to the strongly increased "garoltz houseway".
The management had been able to investigate the removal of the train of the Ingenieur Breinlinger, since it had been sure that the planned switch of the railway was then possible without any further.
The investigation resulted in the fact that it was not exclusive that the road relations could lead to the extent of further vehicles.
The responsibility for this returns the city as a road construction loader.
The reconstruction may then be able to take carefulness.
As both the oil imports and the asylums are working in the current exchange, you should not agree to the reconstruction of the train transition, has argued haas.
In this place, the risk of collection of the adhession with a vehicle that is clearly lower than the other train transits, since the middle of the stop point is in the middle of a good view.
Even trails from the main movement court, it should have been broken in this place as far as no collection has been made.
Most often the reconstruction of this train transition has been rejected the approval, since the city Schiltach has to have the problem of the grounding vehicles, the railways, since the trains could be able to return from the responsibilities after the end of the construction.
As uncertainly, the Group considers the reconstructors in the train transitions "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" for which the crossing agreements have already been taken with the train.
This decides about large world space missions: Milliarden missions
Additional planets, gravitation rooms or black leather experts of the European space carrier now needs to be on two large projects that they want to start in the next years.
Third proposals are to choose, five are still in the race.
Another worlds.
More than 1000 plants in other stars have already found astronoms.
Or at least there's some of them, nobody knows.
The selection is hard: Do you want to search for Gravitation Rooms?
Or do you like to study the origin of the cosmos?
Or do they fall after earthly planets and may discover an extraordinary life?
These are the responsibilities of the European Space Court of Justice.
For its "Cosmic vision" program, they are looking for ideas for two large space route projects that should be decisively forwarded to research.
The food for such “L missions” is approximately a milliard of euros.
The start will be 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the Elite of the European Space Research has met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
30 ideas standing on the debate, five of them have now been elected.
A number of groups address the proposals to the researchers.
In the next days, a final decision should be taken by the scientific Committee.
In total, four major questions have chosen the Head on which missions should find responses from the 2007 planned Cosmic Vision Programmes.
What are the conditions for the development of planets and life?
The precise actions in the removal of stars from large gaswolks - and so the removal of plants that cover these stars - are still in the local darks.
A large infrarotelescope in all could override this dark.
And if a star planet has, in what circumstances can there be life?
To follow this question, 2017, the World Telescope "Cheops" will start with the 500 already known planet systems in our nearest environment.
But the possibilities are limited, the Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, the astronoms could form similar planet and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and then seek the "Bio torrent": Gasens used as an indice for bioactivity.
How does the sun work?
The question will also be recently concluded on what conditions it exists for the development of life.
A important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the weakness of his magnet field and the partial part of it with the planet system.
In our sun system, these processes are explicitly investigated.
With the "Solar Orbiter" the Ese has already accepted a mission of the M-class (the budget is about half billion euros) for this question.
The song will start 2017 and watch the surface and activity of the sun exactly.
A great interest for researchers are also jupiters and his months.
They want to figure out what the role of the Ries planet has played in the development of the sun system.
This is the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision Programme.
The Sonde "Jusice" (Julier Icy Moons Explorer) begins its journey for 2022.
Eight years later she will reach jupiter and study the atmosphere of the planet and the required months Europe, Kallisto and Ganymed.
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe?
The world offers many opportunities to study materials under extreme conditions and to investigate whether our natural laws are still valid there.
Maybe there are disappointments that could show physics the way to a new theory, among which all known natural laws are combined.
How is the universe discerned, and what is it?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was caused by the urknall.
On the other hand of the isolated material, from the stars, plants and lives as we exist, there are dark materials whose wealth power is combined with Galaxies and Galaxies, and the dark energy, with which the effects are accelerated by the expansion of the world.
Until the researchers know what physical laws were valid in the first second parts of the urknall, nor even the dark material and dark energy exists.
With "Euclid" the Esso has also accepted a M mission which has been launched for 2020.
With a special telescope, the song will first study the distribution of the material in the universe, and allow reliefs to create dark material and dark energy.
Who could make the rain
The 30 proposals will remain only two remain at the end of the election procedure.
The best opportunity for a candidation as L mission has, in view of many experts "E-Lisa", an emphasis on the proof of Gravitation Sales.
This includes physical changes in the structure of the space time, which Albert Einstein had previously passed for almost 100 years ago.
They were not shown to this day.
Elisa could create it, hope the scientists behind the project.
The mission provides a detector existing of two or three songs, which is statised in all.
It could also demonstrate greenhouses that are dismissed at the original level, and provide new knowledge about the development of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are still competiting on the second L mission: a great Röntgentelescope named "Athena", which will study under the other black leather, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outdoor planets of the sun system, "Prism", a mission to measure the cosmic background, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which will be monitored and investigated.
In addition, different proposals have been made for the sake-related transport from the Mars, for the research of Mond, Venus and Asteroides, as well as the sunfistics.
Snowden ready to cooperate with Germany regarding US supervision
Edward Snowden, the U.S. Snowden, has explained that he was ready to travel to Berlin and to go before the German Federal Day, if the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander have no answers to their activities.
The German Deputy Hans-Christian Ströbele trap Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where this asyl has received to discuss the statement in Germany.
In a letter of Snowden presented at the Friday of Ströbele to the Medias in Berlin, he wrote: “Although the result of my efforts was positive, my Government has been treated to continue a disappointed view as faithful and attempt to crimine the political opinion with violence, where no defence is possible.”
To say the truth, but it is not a crime.
The Snowden writes that it is convinced that the support of the international Community could convince the American government of it to put the complaints against him.
The complaint covered by the Ministry of Justice includes sponsion and the State Stage Stage.
The German Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said about time online: “When Mr Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives, we will find ways to allow them.”
The relations between the United States and Germany have been charged by the evidence that NSA has rejected the phone of Kanzler Angela Merkel.
Thomas Oppermann, the Chairman who led the parliamentary Committee responsible for the secretary service, explains that you should take the opportunity to hear Snows as a witness, if it is possible, "forgiving him to be dangerous and fully destroying the relations with the United States."
Ströbele, a Deputy of the Green, published an image of himself and Snowden in his Twitter Feed.
At his visit in Russia, he was joined by two German journalists.
Ströbele explained that, in accordance with the advocate of the former NSA employee, Snowden could not return to Russia when he left the country.
If Snowden is exposed in Germany, then he needs a insurance that he is "certain" there, the Deputy.
Snowden explains in his letter that he was a “sounded and continuing” campaign of persecution, which cast him out of his home.
However, he is concerned by the reaction of the world on “in the way of political explanation”.
Citizens around the world and high-range politicians – even in the United States – called the enthusiasms of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a service to the generality.

Frontier Airlines is replaced for handy packs
Frontier Airlines planned to request passagiers from 100 US dollar that want to move on their flight hands.
Frontier Airlines decided to calculate up to 100 US dollar for a piece of hand-packet and 2 dollars for coffee or limonade, even if you read passengers to keep the whole dose.
The new cost is applicable for handy packs in the box over the seat, small tickets under the seat are still free.
Frontier explained that it was calculated 25 US dollar if the cost is forward and 100 US dollar in travelers who first pay for airline.
Frontier speaker Kate O'Malley said that the ship of 100 US dollar swimming off to move travelers in front of the payment.
“We don’t want to calculate these sums” she said.
The airlines began 2008 to request taxes for the first and second pack.
Passagiers who tried to get them, therefore, as much as possible, have stopped in the hands, which has the impact that the prisoners are often filled over the seat.
Taxes are an opportunity to move passengers to take less with boat.
O'Malley said that at the new feet it wouldn't really have to get money.
It is about the most faithful customers of Frontier who had expressed clearly that it will be always more difficult to find place on the seat.
Passagiers who buy your tickets on the website of the air society must not pay.
This means that a passagier at frontier aircraft in circumstances may take a carrier free, but the next person must pay $100 for comparable package.
O'Malley explained that the website of Frontier and the check-in processes would be changed, so the passagiers will be informed about the feed before they come to the aircraft.
Frontier's new handsheet is in force only in the summer, there is no exact date yet.
Passagiers are often shots about bonds and other fees, but airlines are pleased to take it back.
They argue that the transport of the carrier costs and that passagiers should pay this service if they want it.
Many of the Wall Street view the new carriers as a sign that airlines take enough money to cut the costs of aircraft after years.
Most of them have the fingers of feeds for hands.
Spirit Airlines Inc. requested as the first feeds for hands and then followed Allgiant Air, also a flight driver.
The only other aircraft company with such a cost is the Hungarian Wizz Air, explained the Jay Sorensen Additional Business Council Jay Sorensen.
He estimated in a report of December 2011 that the manager's hand-payd was an annually 50 million US dollar.
Sorensen, who previously entered a leading position at Midwest Airlines, was recently paid with the spirit and was nervous what would be waiting for him at the aircraft if passagiers confronted with the unregular hand leader of the company.
“The Boarding Process was part of the most unfair relief I lived in my road on the airway” he said.
I was waiting for seeing dogs and handling discussions on the aircraft.
“The aircraft was full,” he explained, “and the boarding was moving as smooth.”
Frontier is also followed by the two dollars that are required for coffee, tea, limonade or Saft.
The company explained that passagiers, Limonade or Saft bought, who needed to keep the whole dose and will be filled free of café.
Water is still free.
U.S. Airways had recently tried to ask money for feeding money, but seven months later, after passagiers were evaluated and no other large society was taken.
Frontary step to summ the handsheets if passengers don't buy directly in the airline, the latest initiative should be made with customers on their own website.
Airline companies pay online travelers such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US Dollar for saled tickets.
This allows all companies to move passengers to direct sale with them instead of a online traveler.
Frontier has, however, gone out in this area.
In September, the enterprises began to provide only half of them in booking on a online journey.
Meanwhile, the mills were shot at 25 percent of the aircraft.
A airport with Frontier over 1000 miles in the case of a third-party provider offers only 250 miles.
Passagiers can also reserve only when buying directly on the website of Frontier Locations.
Frontier has a faithful client trial at its seat in Denver, but the business breaks and lost money.
The resolution was about 9 percent, and the aircraft capacity shot approximately 13 percent in the first quarter, as read in the financial report, which was published in the middle of the mother Concert, the Republic of Airways Holdings Inc..
The Republic has tried to get the financing of Frontier in the course of the sale of society within the framework of the sale.

Learn instead of unemployment: Pilot project for Unstudents in Tourism
A pilot project for the tourism sector started at the Meklenburg Sea Disk.
Following the Federal Working Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as unemployed in the industry will be qualified over three winters towards train forces for hotels and guests.

NSA explains that a "internal error" and not Hacker have been the fault on the Crash of the website
The shadowed National Security Agency explained in late Friday, an error has laid its public website some hours and not Hacker, as online has been described.
“NSA.gov was not available for a few hours this night, since an internal error occurred during a planned update," the Sponsor said in a message sent by email.

Mystery information are not in danger, the speaker.
At least a group of hacktivists took place for the NSA site with a DDoS attack.
For such attacks, the target site will be flood with page calls until the server is overloaded and gathered the site.
The Cybertatics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to incorporate the internal network of the target system.
The former supergether NSA, whose name first No Such Agency (No such authorities), is found in the light of publicity and sees the enthusiasms known in the last months of its outstanding monitoring program in the Inland and foreign Critics – a result of the secret data of the NSA, which is stolen by the former NSA worker Edward Snowden.
The growing conflict on the secret service has established initial speculations on which, in case of today, the result of a targeted Cyper Operation is.
The number of people without job is easily reduced in October 22 to 1.307.
Although the quota is 3,1 percent better than last year, and also better than in September, "when they had been caught us more", says Monika Felder-Bauer, a number of business officers of the Agency for Work in Sonthofs.
Because numerous operations have been reacted until have been reacted in settings.
A reason for this is the voice of fields: "We have a few fashion forces in the hands, health property and in the older plant."

We decided to take a first flight and then to attach a time of processing which we have done.
This happens during the whole airport program.
The second of five test drivers will, for example, start in the next weeks which are left shortly by the company site.
However, there are 12 months after the youth flight of the first customer to take a CSeries aircraft.
Bombardier explained that it checks the planning for operation (EIS) and will be updated in the next months.

The charge file in the air and space carriage party was 30 September 32,9 billion dollars and was not modified at 31 December.
“In the air and space roads the results of our provisions, but the low entrance and market interests were totally disappointed," said Beaudoin.
The expenditure in the air and space carriage Part was about 13 percent to two billion dollars.
Bombardier, the world's largest rail train producer, knew that the exchange in this section was increased at about 11 per cent of $2,1 billion.
The mandate file in the Transport Party was estimated on 30 September 32,6 billion dollars and was easily increased against 31 December.

Cokain Dependent lawyer, who waited for drugs before police delivery, must be in prison
Basharat Thista, 42, provided information to Scarborough Scarborough Forward
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug independence could come to light
He was condemned by Liverpooler Crown Court for three years of prison
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug bar before a great police issue, because he had feared that his secret drugs could be discovered, was condemned for three years.
Basharat Thista, 42, provided underwelt size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about the data on the drug activity of the traffic after its own cockpit was compromised.
The advocate Prize by Criminlists as a “prised class” was arrested in 2011 in his house after the police Scarborough who he had presented in a previous drug procedure.
As well as Scarborough (32) three Beutel Kokain at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn, Lancashire was released, while that with colleagues was at a food of the lawyerroom.
Today, thista was usually consumed drugs of class A after testings of Kokain in his heads, on his letters and credit cards.
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011, he tried to provide unlawful information on the arrest of two men at Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects have been observed by the police in the context of a great procedure for heroin and cokain trade in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
In addition, they were arrested with 32 persons later after the police was secured in a series of household investigations of Heroin and Kokain in the value of 1,5 million per cent and $200,000.
Dieta, 42, gave further information to the criminals because he feared that his drug independence could be public.
Today, this is the Liverpooler Crown Court, who has been working for the Castlei Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn, after a three-term proceedings in two points of complaints because of the defence of the Justice is condemned and condemned.
In a previous interrogation, he added the cokain property.
The lawyer was transmitted after the police found that this had been regularly contacted with Derta in February 2011.
Two officers followed the suspect and saw how he went to this house, and there drugs laid on a cleanness of 60 per cent in a black golf-shaw under the Mulltonne of the lawyer.
Shortly after he left the drugs, Scarborough was regularly called with dieta, which was located at the dinner of the Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park.
The lawyer returned home, drugs took place and then nine communications were exchanged between the two.
It was known before the court that thista was a “regular consumer” of Kokain after the tests of the class A in his heads, his letters and its credit cards were discovered.
Thista was later arrested, but it turned away to take the Kokan and said he had spoken with the Middle Dealer because he was his mandate, and said that their discussion was subject to the “instruction of managers”.
During his arrest, dieta took his letters and tried to remove a number of credit cards, but they were secured and made him a hair test.
At the police audience, he added that he would be called a office and mandate to be at home because of legal affairs.
The court was recognized that he was important actors of the drug trafficking which he had introduced some of them before calling for significant arrests and informed what the experts knew about them.
Announced that a criminal prosecutor should know better than all others that it is not lawful.
Thista is appealed to the abuse of his position as a criminal defender, as he has been too much adopted with certain mandates.
The interactive relationship is not easy to a drug hamper, but a drug hair who assures his lawyer with drugs.
A part of his communications was uncertainly legitimate, because he was the lawyer of these persons.
However, it was far over the borders of a normal relationship between lawyer and mandate.
He effected the police exempts as soon as possible, so they continued to pursue their criminal activities.
Mr. Dieta, therefore, brought his professional status to call.
He was close to certain mandates, particularly scarborough, and he allowed it to comply with his independence.
Thista said: “If I were a corrupt lawyer, what I am not, and I wanted to give information to Scarborough, I would not wait for 15 hours, but I would immediately do it.”
However, after the hearing, Superintendent Lee Halstead of the police in Lancashire said: “Herr Thista has done the step of a criminal offence to a crime at the time when he began to buy drugs of organized crimes.”
His cokain independence has led to comply with unfairly and has emphasized it for the reasons of the leaders of organized crime that were subject to him to add value information on police entities.
Advocates must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure the publicity of confidence and confidence.
This has passed this confidence and has tried to turn back to the Fassade of his profession.
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the statements against thista, who also leaded to a sentence in three cases because of the property of Kokain and Justice, which underlines our decision to bring criminals to the court.
This case should be a warning to criminals and show that no one is able to take the hand of the law.
We'll find you and bring you to the court.
Scarborough itself has been condemned to 14 years of prison after he declared the condemnation for heroin, Kokain and Cannabis Trade for the fault.
Fively more persons involved in drug trafficking have been condemned for drug abuse of 153 years.
On his website, thista published a area with questions and answers on which he showed that his dreamjob was to come as a lawyer to the death chamber in America, his last host at the dinner of Mohammed Ali and Chancence Equality is the motive of his work.

Haslach: Skepsis easy to see survey
For example, the 2015 elections to the Congress Council will be amended in the Heslach (SE).
Then there is only a common board for all six species.
In a common meeting, the groups of Haslach, Hofstadts, Munich, Fisherbach, Steinach and Welschench were prepared on the changes.
Since the basic decisions of the diace is nothing more to change and it is to implement them the most satisfactory devices.

They had been made in 2006 for the task, "one, five stays" and had to find that it wasn't so easy.
The Haslacher Units Groups then made response to the future composition and size of the Joint Front Council and the practical work of the community teams.
The developments will be concreted in further meetings and decided in a further common meeting of all six groups in the next birth year.
At the end, Michael Schöner presented the new logo of the sealsorge unit, which was admitted with significant majority.

Sometimes it'll not be green.
The contact clothes in the street does not respond or the light sign is defected.
So what are you going to do - rock?
If an concerned has waited enough long to a red axis and the creature is free, it can continue, he explains the Stuttgart's lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine "Motorrad".
But the expectation time must be "measured" which may be differently expressed in case.
Becker will be able to break at least five minutes before the functioning of the appointment has been extracted.
However, if the trip continues, it should be clear that it leads the full offence to a damage.
Who patiences less than five minutes, waits in circumstances not enough, warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Supreme Governing Hamm.
In the case of negotiated, a driver had ignored the axis after about three minutes and had to have responded to a dangerous red lightversity.
In fact, it was not defected, but it was a little late on green.
A trip prohibition left him because of the special situation, but the moneystrafe did not.
Council of the Communities rejoices about solid houses
Always when it goes in municipal meetings on the budget, the citizen Ralph Gerster has a good laugh.
The municipal shock in Herdwingen-Schrank is well filled and the debts are no longer known for the administration since 2005.
In this context, the 2012 financial year can also be tried as a full success.
This was clear when the annual calculation was presented for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget of approximately 7,6 million euros over a million euros exceeding the planned.
The oversight of the administrative budget also covers approximately 1.8 million euros over the approach.
In particular, the overseas should be thanked to the above-mentioned pesticide taxes and the Community share in the revenue tax.
The budget also was clearly found on the values planned.
In addition to the proposed 1.5 million euros, it was in the past year 2.5 million euros.
"There is the main part of the higher introduction from the administrative budget", says Rothmund.
As less investment has been confirmed in the 2012 financial year, the reimbursement is also higher.
In total, the total refund could be increased by about 2.1 million euros to the total of €4.9 million.
The citizen Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"That's a work you're not easy to protect from the middle," the garster, looking on the annual calculation.
He and the communities are glad about the good numbers.
It may be paradoxe, but exactly these good numbers could get the citizens soon to go.
The Community in the past was able to look at high rates.
But again, as we say, we have already been cut out of the country.
There are conditions for these subsidies from different comparisons.
In addition, the cities and municipalities, which are invited to grants, must show some tariffs.
"We must consider the issue of the customs, since in the coming years, investments we would like to have succeeded," announced the gentlemen in this connection.

The decision of the law is a number of measures to strengthen national security in the course of attacks by armed islamists at the West Gate Centre in September.

The new designed attack slights with a new coffee.
The one who admits to the defence and return.
The one who wants to do the name of the program.
As Déjà Vu, a psychological phenomenon that expresses the feeling of a new situation once ever experienced or seen.
In the case of visiting the same coffee on the opposition in the city of Kleve in view of high school Rhein-Wal, it should not remain in the clean DéjàV feelings.
Finally, the Café with the beautiful name has exactly the goal: a real stay is not only grateful, but is always able to return again.
Because it's just nice and it's easy.
Look inside life on Opposition 8 gives the viewer a good feeling.
The highmodern, but not coffee environment looks like a place to feel well-being.

Not last, too, through the high school.
"When we have no target group," Daniel Büttner notes.

UN Proclaims new objectives in poverty combating
The United Nations starts immediately with the development of a series of new objectives which should be replaced by the Millennium Development Goals for poverty fighting before 12 years.
At the front of the UN Gipfel for sustainable development which started at the evening in Rio de Janeiro, Australian diplomates played a key role in the planning for “sharing development objectives” which are to replace the Millennium Goals in 2015.
They have been adopted in the final draft of the document, which is adopted by global political leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the Gipfel.
The United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-Monon stated on the celebration of the time that had been “to thinking of national interests.”
“I am glad that Member States have understood to take a process to agree with the universal and sustainable development objectives”, he said.
“These objectives will build our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the framework work for the development after 2015.
I will not wish to implement this mandate granted by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development goals to build the Millennium Goals.”
Even though the SG Ahim/Baden is since four playdays without victory, it continues to be good at handball office.
There is no doubt of this to your Tomasz Malmon.
All still are completely motivated in the case.
But I hope we will finally win again.

They will therefore be safely motivated against their ex-coach.
"There is to be expected if there is still a strengthening from the first place," said the SG-Coach.
To finally return to success purchasing, the Malmon Team must increase in comparison with the past attacks.
Before all things in the detection work and on the overall game, it was finally powerful.
The opportunities are also needed to be better definitively.
So I hope that my players have finally been able to get the head.
Security difficulties in Mozambique grow in view of coherences between influential personalities
A thousands of people gathered together in the centre of Maputos, under the weak eyes of the status of Samora Machel, the State Founder and the first Mozambique Presidents, to vote at a rare public demonstration of peace calls.
“We want to repace peace, we want stability," said Vanessa de Sousa, business manager of an investment undertaking.
In fear of the future of the country, she took its business clothes against a T-Shirt, named “We require security” in Portuguese, and concluded the amount of the Thursday on the town of the capital.
Since two weeks, there are daily reports on coherence between government forces and Once, which are numbering the worst warms since the Peace Agreement over 20 years ago.
On the first time, he was a wonderful rebellion movement, which supported first by white-registered Rhodes and later from the Apartance Government of South Africa, in the efforts to detach the independent government of the country.
After the Peace Treaty of 1992, she became an opposition party.
Analysts keep uncertainly that the country returns to a growing conflict, but the recent events of foreign investors and domestics have disappeared.
For the growing economy it is much on the game, because the discovery of great gas benefits from the coast and coal in the northern western years could bring investments from more than 50 billion US dollar from companies such as Rio Tinto, Vale from Brazil, Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States.
The dominant Frelimo Party, since 1975, is the dominant force, and Onoreo, each other, is the fault for the disappearances.
On 17 October, the Government has provoked the recent coasts by attacking her members in the province of Sofala, a traditional highburgorum.
The oversights on the previous rebells were calculated as a government structures attained and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the leader of the group, explained Ontoo's speakers against the financial Times.
The Government gives the offence of the cohesions and accuses the organization to have attacked soldiers.
The President Armando Guebuza has tried to play attention to an institutionality.
On the AFP, the French newsagency, said in middle, Dhlakama was considered as a “release” who wanted to use all his remaining forces to demonstrate that the government can resolve its decisions.
At the same time, Frelimo and renovo demonstrate that they want to avoid a war.
However, the concerns have been taken since Mazanga had been discussed with the words, so that the peace agreement was adopted in 1992.
On the FT, he explained that Frelimo has not more respected the agreement.
“Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously," said Mazanga.
Earlier conversations between the parties have only been limited to the adoption of steps which have been encouraged by a number of cohesions in this year.
“We have two adult men (Gubuza and Dhlakama), who have along the heads,” says Joseph Hanlon, a Doctor at Open University and Mozambique experts.
No one of them is good in the negotiation, and no one is ready to make the needed competences.
On behalf of the electoral reform, she has already declared that she'll be cooking the communical elections in November.
The elections of President and Parliament are planned for the next year.
Some commentaries have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt of a short movement, the competence and financial benefits of the government.
From 1992, a new party founded by a former member Democrtical Movement de Mochembique (MDM) is probably improved in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza is the residues of its second office in the next year – the democracy of the country deserved.
“It does not want to democracy of multiparty, he does not want transparent choices, but he does not want to make peace because he does not want the Chairman's office," said Mazanga.
It is clear about what capacity is available, but it has understood inevitable attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important northern-South connection.
Most feasts were found in the province of Sofala, which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo, where Beira is located, the port, the mountain construction persons like Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June Rio stopped a month after the use of the railway an attack on the streets.
Mazanga responded to the question whether this drug will be repeated.
"The international community wanted to advise that the things in Mozambique are not good", said Mazanga.
The stability has still increased the scope of the government, says Fernando Lima, Leader of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people have already been careful of corruption, the huge progress in development and a recent detection salary.
“The people think that the Government and the President are responsible for the future of the country and should be those that find solutions for problems”.
Omar Sultane, a demonstrator, said that people just wanted to be stability.
He said: “It can't be interested in renaissance and Frelimo, they just want to go back to peace and useful roads," he said.
Children should receive myths and legends as "Standards for life" means a author.
The stories of Thor showed that “boot force has no chance against fine tricks” and the Artus-levels demonstrate how important it is to have a dream.
Many of the myths were, however, “in some cases to be smooth and in some cases to be learned at schools” therefore Crossley-Holland was planned for an “favorable choice” of former works.
“I find it wonderful that myths and Folklore are already part of education in America” he said.
I have proposed that for 20 years as a plan.
He added, in authors and teachers who are “externally learned”, children would ‘deactivately offset’ because in substantive storys the messages would be “forgiving”.
Crossley-Holland, who has translated Beowulf from the Angeless and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: “It can follow certain intentions but you should keep it in the background.”
The largest difference between a adult author writes for adult and a author writes for children is in need to provide hope.
Not all must be simplified or leaded to the Happy End, but there is an immense sense for good and bad.
This must be shown underlyable, revealed by the story and not explained.
This is the old story of the prophecy instead of telling.

The Court is blocked by the decision on the stop-and-Frish Directive of the NYPD
A Federal Governance in the United States blocked on Thursday the order of a judge who requested changes at the Stop- and Fish Programme ("Conservation and Foundation") of the New York Police Department, and deleted the judge of the case.
The U.S.A. Declared that the decisions by judge Shira Scheindlin would be taken to be decided on a call of the city.
The judge had condemned in August, the city had condemned the Constitution in a way as the programme for arrest and demands of persons would be applied.
The city has put an appeal against its appreciation and the proposed aid measures, including the decision to establish a monitoring office which would support the police in amending its Directive and the relevant training programme.
The Headquarter heard the arguments to the requested exhibition on Sunday.
The vocational report explained that the judge should be retained from the case since she had condemned the behaviour code for US-American judges, determined that a judge should avoid the event of partiality; this was partly founded by a series of media interviews and public experts in which she had publicly reacted to the court's criticism.
The judge had condemned that police officers had rejected the citizens' rights of ten thousands of people because they were inadequately designed to black and Latin American men with the stop and physic program.
It called for an external body to monitor the implementation of significant changes, including reforms in the directives, education and supervision, and sets out a pilot program in four rooms where most controls were carried out.
In August, the city of New York was prepared to stop the practice of the store of names and addresses of persons who were resolved by the police.
A negotiation on the calling of the city was planned after 14 March 2014.
The stop-and-Frish-Tactic has been criticised by a number of civil rights-laws.
The controls of this kind have been available for decades in different forms, but the number of recorded controls increased during the office of the participant citizen Michael Blomberg's participatory officer of 684 330 in 2011, most of those black and Latin American men.
2004, four men who were listed to all minorities were introduced to a collector.
Responsors of changes to the NYPD-France programme say that the changes will be completed infringent practices and that they create more reliable and efficient police, as well as the way and way as other police presidency sets out the rules.
It is worse that the changes would fight the police moral, but not the criminality; it would also be abused of money, and the more wide problem of a police is not resolved that, after the way, thousands of offices in the past decade.
The judge argued that they did not refer to the stop-and-risk fraxis that is constitutionally but only reform the type of implementation of controls by the NYPD.

Coulson fixed telephone hacking for checking a tip
The former news of the Word-Herausgeber Andy Coulson was at the attempt of confirming a false tip of a case of the minister of the time by Charles Clarke.
Staatsanwalt Andrew Edis QC explained the court in Old Bailey, news of the World have heard a false warrant in May 2005 that Clarke would have a relationship with its “attractive specialberaterin” Hannah Pawlby.
The newspaper requested the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to send Pawlbys Voice mails, and followed them, but Coulson also called them and left news as the court had received.
“In view of the public administration, Coulson is the now outcomer of the NotW, no one who stands before the apartment of people and hopes to take it into a former way, but one who loves people with a story to see their reaction," said Edis.
He said NotW used three procedures to search history research: Telephone hacking, monitoring and confrontation.
The producer is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously he knows of the second, the supervision, otherwise can't be.
How does it look like the first?
He knows about the telephone hacking?
He fights it, but we say, “And if he knew it. ”
The first time of the NotW reaction was taken as a source that was interested in Pawlby, saying: “Do not destroy your time, it is together with Charles.”
A band with Voice mails from its phone of at least three requests was secured in August 2006 in Mulcarios apartment.
The producers also found imports on the computer of the detective, recorded on Pawlby and their sister as “project”.
At the time when the research was delivered, Edis explained that the grandchildren of Pawlby were anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them.
Subsequently, the former Chief Reporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup observed the monitoring of the movements of Pawlby.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left a Voice mail with the following content: “I have a story that we want to get out tomorrow, about which I would like to talk to Charles.”
Edis explained that Coulsons activities in this story followed the same model as other important personalities, such as the former Minister David Blunkett.
The jury heard that Coulson Blunkett had confronted a company with a married woman when he was lied with the complaint Rebekah Brooks who had been married at that time.
Coulson and Brooks strive to be swore with others to put telephones between October 3 and 9 August 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup have granted the telephone hacking.
For proof against the planned rich tax, the French Fussball will actually translate the first street since 1972.
A locking meeting is to be endless.
In the conflict on the rich taxes, the government and the Professional Fussball in France have managed after a lack of conclusions in a sackgase.
The President of François Holland recommended on Thursday in Paris Elysée-Palast Vereins and Containment Representative and also heard their complaints.
However, he refused to report the Fussball from the 75% planned income for more than a million euros a year to pay all the country's companies from 2014 for two years.

Thresholds: No absolute protection possible
"We want to join the inhabitants early in planning," the citizens Jens Haveler opened the civil information events to the high water protection concept.
A number of 80 participants had come to the community hall to explain the planned measures to address questions, to express concerns and to put ideas.
It cleared that the last decisions were the members of the Council.
The high water that had occurred on May 15, 2009, was an unprepared event that addressed the question for protection measures for the future.
A river territory investigation was given to the neighbouring assistants, which is now based on the high water protection concept.
"The most possible protection of many buildingd elements is the goal," thus households.
The planning of protection is based on 100 years before a German Weather Service statistics expected high water.
The climate change is taken into account by a 15-procent approximation.
This is called "HQ 100aClima".
The water mass that had been leading to damage in 2009 discussed a thousand-year-old water.
"A absolute protection does not, but a relative improvement we can achieve," said the households.
In order to achieve protection of HQ 100aClima, around four million euros should be invested, and the community can calculate approximately 70 percent.
But it is more important that it would only give the promotion when a total concept is implemented.
The community is also demonstrated on the impact of the citizens.
A comprehensive planning and approval procedure should be resolved.
In the best case, it can be started with implementing 2016.
In addition, the protection concept which has been presented in the municipal Council has already been presented in the past week (mitted) local measures in the flight of the Flight Irm from the Stammheimer Tale.
At the end of the presentation of the High Water Protection Concept, the participants used the opportunity to provide their appeals.
In other cases, there was a question why no longer was planned for the protection of the place.
Gregor Kohn, Fach Planner of Ingenieur Officers Forest and Corbe from the Hills home, who introduced the concept, pointed out that it was necessary to achieve the match of all proposed measures in order to achieve the desired goal in the sum.
In addition, the most economic solution was to be found, so Joachim forest of forest and corbe.
Inmutation has been dominated in leaders of the high place, which have always been leading again at normal vegetables under a translation of the channel network.
The problem is known in the management and the first measures have already been taken.
However, it is noted that the Directives for channel systems are other than the high water protection and that should not be dismissed.
The community is obliged to develop the channel network so that two- to three-year rain stocks could be strengthened.
The larger water canals would disappear millions.
Sustained after Society
The early afternoon afternoon, in the countrystraße 44 near Revensdorf, two cars were hardly harmed at a Frontal Meeting.
The police was immediately completed the road, but it was possible to say at first little to the accident.
Nevertheless, there are various Witnesses to be evaluated first.
It is a festival that the 19-year-old Lenkerin of a VW Golf went towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man came to her hindai.
Both vehicles were gathered together, while the woman was so hardly clothed that the iron needed a half hour to release her from the car wheel.
Real accidents remained unrelated first.
Both guests came in near hospitals.
The street left about two hours completely closed.
You might call him Dostojewski in the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a divine searcher, a metafysiker, his Romans and narrations also have something serious.
Excepts the disaster in the outside: the swimming eyes, the bart, the high shadows.
And as Fjodor M. Dostojewski is understanding with his massive Oeuvre as the founder and apologet of the Russian soul, he reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet that applies to something in his own country.
Some titles have appeared in the Hafermans case with the 1118 figures were distributed two thousand.
Dick explains that the Kingdom of Atombased Technical progress is to be elected with Paranoia, security water and faith.
Dick had God's experiences, his late books read themselves as a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manager.
Maybe he was crazy, drugs were put to his herd.
He's captured, early that the computer's divinities.
He wrote a theology of the computer and asked what a person distinguishes from a machine, the Creator of his creature.
That's the Blade Runner problem.
The killer.
A Master of the Science Fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film records like Ridley Scott, Paul Rehobes and Steven Spielberg.
This story is now particularly important.
The "minenties-Report" is from 1956, he confounded the sweet of the war and the McCarthy-Tribunale.
It is developed here the principle of the "Pre-Crime, "Pre-Crime", so what is more or less official doctor of the white house.
In the Dick world, which is similar to our fearful mountings, look in the future, and the police grows.
"We take individuals who have no law against no one," said the Chief of the Authority.
"We're going to strike us before they can make a crime of violence."
And: "In our society there are no burdens, so we have a flood of full fishermen."
They assume that it happens to disappearance, and prevent the criminal thoughts to be implemented in the fact.
Dick's narration is like the bluepause for the anti-terror sets and the NSA refusal.
Anticipation of the attack: Obamas Drogen philosophie and -Praxis is also functioning.
But Dicks story is not yet ended.
The Police Chair claims that there is no division of violence, the military controls the day - and what remains from the State.
Then the superguarder is overseeing himself and overcoming a future crime.
The system runs through.
It's perfect, but it's lying.
It provides its own conditions.
Take injuries and sacrifices not only in buy, but building on it.
The system makes the danger that it fights.
Philip K. Dick read calls to come back to the truth.
Countries for Merkel in Russia
The former US secret service expert Edward Snowden could also do in his Russian Asyl Exagen Exagen in the US Office for the Federalkans of Angela Merkel.
Representatives of the German Union may be able to address written questions or to meet the 30-year-olds in Russia, the Agent Interfax reported.
Before the Green-Bund Day Deputy, Hans-Christian Ströbele yesterday had taken the first German political snowden in Moscow to speak with him about the ideas.
Increased NSA-infringement paranoia through State monitoring
In a mild day final August, a German police-substrator flighted a deep over the US consultant in Frankfurt on May, the financial capital of Germany.
On the instruction of the Federal Ambassador for Constitution and Terrorism Warning (BVT), the German Internal Secret Service, he should photographize the exchange of the US post, which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Federal Bank.
According to the German Medien, the BVT wanted to demonstrate the presence of monitoring talents and the action brought to a word change between the United States and the German Foreign Minister in Berlin.
James Clapper, US-American Director of National Intelligence, was reiterated in September that the United States had no opportunities for the foreign pioneage “for the purpose of establishing the operational secrets of foreign undertakings in the US-American company to build their international competition or profit”.
However, since Edward Snowden, who has become the white-level, has started the publication of his fullhorn to the US-American monitoring secrets, the European Governments and the Business Chiefs are no longer sure if they can take the Director to the word.
Reports from which the American National Security Agency exposed the Brazilian Oilmark Peterbas and has been data of the American Cloud providers including Google and Yahoo, the firm paranoia has brought on a new highest level.
The fass for transition brought the inthusiably that Kanzlerin Angela Merkel's phone was angry for ten years, perhaps for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can live in visas, they also are secure business leading potential objectives.
Snowden has transparently operated the intensive cooperation between US secret services and enterprises.
I think it is likely to be used for mutual benefits.
“The Dutch must stand up,” says Oliver Green, President of the BIT Mi, representing small and medium-sized IT arms in Germany.
The German enterprises believe that the United States now presented a large risk as China when industrial pioneering and data disaster, a survey published in July of the Councilmark EY.
However, in the documents transferred by Snowden, there was no complaint that the U.S. had extended the secrets of foreign enterprises to their own companies.
Politicals expressed their concern that the EU has missed certain IT and Internet potentials and should reduce their independence from the United States.
The undertakings are skiptic in this regard.
On the Federal Day, we should build a German Google.
I can just close my eyes and open them slowly...
“It does not work like this”, said Hasso plattner, President of the German software producer SAP.
If you would want a strong European IT industry, you wouldn't have killed it 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subventioned, from the coal over cars to the agriculture.
Everything until the IT branch.
However, rich and technical reefences of the US players covered by the Snowd enthusiasms have shocked firms, who had seen the largest spending risk in China.
The Cloud Computing will be a great change because European company leaders are now aware of that data contained in the U.S. are subject to the jurisdiction and therefore are potentially dangerous.
According to one of the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade institution carried out after the enthusiastics of the US-American Mining Activities with the Prism approximately ten percent of the Member States plans to use a American provider.
Jim Snabe, a comprehensive business manager of SAP, says: “We see a new question of customers that have not been given it before a year ago – she said: Where will my data be stored and can you ensure that these physics remain in this area?”
Many German undertaking leaders are the view that the latest reports simply confirm what they already knew, which is that the powerful States want to steal their valued secrets and therefore need to be monitored for each price.
There is no surprise for the economic pioneering.
That was always like that.
“It was a theme for many years and has not changed the current debate," says Kurt Bock, President of the Chemical Society of BASF.
The Americans sponsored us at commercial and industrial level, as we also do, because it is in national interest to defend our companies.
The management of the company usually does not speak about the contractual measures you have taken, because it has benefits.
In large enterprises, employees will have long deployed that the co-advance of a free USB-style on a middle or the unexpected license that a laptop in the hotel is not ratified.
Ulrich Hackenberk, Statute member of car producers Audi, says that it is listed on standard practice for years before a presence, collect the mobiles so that they can not be used as listed devices.
The German BVT calls for managers to use easy prepaid hain when they go to foreign trips because smartphones may be compromitted.
The Prepaid Handys are thrown behind.
However, it is the concern that small and medium-sized enterprises remain attractive against hacking and monitoring.
In Germany, many of these undertakings are world market leaders in the country concerned.
“Find and medium-sized enterprises often lacks experience, staff and financial resources to protect operational secrets from unlimited access”, the SCT states in a report.
The U.S. recognizes their own firms for economic pioneering through other countries.
According to Washington Post in the US National Intelligence Estimate in February France, Russia and Israel behind China on Rang two of the countries that served to provide economic data of the Hackings.
A constant member of a German Blue-Chip Understanding, when it goes to economic pioneage, then “the Frenchs are the worst.”
Bernard Squarcini, the former Leader of the French Secret Services DCRL, was discussed in an interview with the following words: “The secret services are very precisely known that all countries, even though they are working in the fight against the terror, expressing their commitments.”
Heads: Mese gives response to marriage questions
"The marriage is the most important discovery trip that can make the man," said Philosoph Sören Cirkeg standard.
Tips, as at least the wedding feast, now gave a special master in the household in Hechingen.
The meeting was important providers around a wedding.
A trend: The Retro-Look has stopped back income.
It begins at the wedding clothes.
White is Muse, the best hidden or in Creme.
Forwards are closed and sewed clothed with steel clothes, often with a clothes, downwards they go down the back and often end in a bottle.
However, the spirits are different as Stefanie cooks from the modern house clothing students.
In the case of gentlemens, the surrounding of Western and Plastron dominates, but it can also be chosen creamefarbige or brane combinations.
If you choose the local, it has been explained.
Smokeless neighbouring rooms are not optional that the environment should be particularly.
Here, the Domenians focused on their own offer in the remission.
Then whoever wants to go with the cocktail, your link has a offer.
"It's also like kids for kids," he says.
Romantics are also asked for invitation cards, flower arrangements and for marriage images.
Always more in mode comes the "After Wodding Photo" - so acquiring services in special places, preferably about water cases, some days after the feast, but in wedding clothing, Elisabeth Keidel explained.
Several more details were presented in the Sunday.
Flower-arrangement, rings, wedding table, kitchen, and a swimming pool, like Marko Ripperger, the guests can keep quietly.
Don't forget the right cosmetic and nails.
Everything for an unbelievable festival.

Parents of a teenager of Georgia, who died in tragic accident, believed on murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a collapsed ringermate in the turtle of his high school, are convinced that her son was killed, explained the lawyer of the family on Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the United States of Georgia was found in a rightly placed Matte, who was behind the Tribunes in the school hall.
The Research officers of the Sheriff of Lowdens County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, but the family of the 17-year-old.
“ They are convinced that her son was killed” said Benjamin Crump, a lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, against FoxNews.com.
They never believed that he was dead as the Sheriff had concluded.
“They are considering that every logic is disappeared against the laws of physics and against the healthy understanding”, Crump.
Moreover, they are convinced that the truth will be condemned to protect person or persons responsible for the death of their son.
“Your son went to teach in the school, and came back in the bodysack, ” he said.
The US lawyer Michael Moore said on Thursday, there will be a formal exhibition to the death of Johnsons, since a number of important questions will still be unreached.
What was the death cause?
Do you get his death back to a crime?
This explained Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts in which they also lead.
My goal is to find the truth.
“I am desperate that there is a sufficient basis for formal submission”, he said.
Moore explained to reporters who had the initial autopsie claimed that Johnson was dying in the consequences of a “position-determined increase”.
However, a second autopsia has provided another death cause, so Moore.
“There is a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed” he said.
Moore added if it was sufficient evidence for a criminal or civil investigation of the death of Johnsons, he will provide the FBI with the implementation of the statements.
A representative of the County Sheriff's Authority was not prepared on our question on Thursday on a comment immediately.
A court in South Georgia said in middle, in the middle of Thursday, that the authorities should release all the visas of monitoring that the producers had checked.
The parents of the teenager said they hoped that the video titles were signed as he was dead.
CCDC Public Accessibility Policy for School
During Wednesday, the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a number of directives for the transition of food students from children to schools.
These are the first directives that the US Government has issued, since the number of school children grows with food allergics.
One of the 20 children in the United States has a food alergy.
The dissemination of food allytics among children has been adopted by CDC between 1997 and 2007 to 18 percent.
The Guidelines contain information for schools that should show awareness for food alimentary and how to take care of children to show allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools have pre-epinifrin – the car injection of the EpiPen Mark is most often used – to be able to prevent a potentially mortal overfinance reaction.
The lawyers in the Federal States have recently amended the rules so that the schools of Epinephrin may be easier.
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms called by children who shown an allergic reaction.
Children may say: “It feels like if something is pressed on my tongue”, “My tongue feels like if a hair lies on it” or “My tongue cripts.”
Parents from Intersexual Children can choose “faithless uncertainty”
Germany is the first European nation in which a third family is recognized for children who were born with uncertain genetics.
Nearborn is no longer shown to a man or female.
In accordance with the new law, parents should not explain a gender for such children, but they may be able to admit to “uncertain” or “not set” on the birth course.
The goal of the law is to take the pressure of parents so that they should not take over-related decisions regarding the operations of gender instruction in newborns and fighting discrimination of intersexual people.
A intersexual person said BBC years later: “I am neither man nor woman.”
I'll stay the flying work created by doctors, smooth and full nerve.
One of the 20,000 children each year comes as a boy or a girl in the world.
They belong to the intersexuals, a group that falls under the diagnosis “Sexual Difference” (DSD), a collection of people with a typical chromosomes, keim-drüse (ears or hos) or un normally developed genealies.
Wallis Simpson was likely intersexuell.
The understanding of gender identification is not yet very well developed, but most experts in the U.S. have to be used to use the best available sex information, if it is not possible and not waiting to the psychological and physical development of the child before you decide – if it is, for an operation.
The New Yorker Psychiater Dr. Jack Drecher, who specializes the problem of gender identification, said that the new German law “cloth after a good thing.”
Intersexual children make an ethical dilemma.
“Mann people have life-related diseases needed by chirurgic attack, but most children do not apply it” he said.
You can take a sex instruction without operation and then wait how to develop the identity.
The scientific data about how a child is mostly developed its bad identity, are not very precise.
No one knows why it happens.
It's like the secret that people are humansexuals.
In a report to the European Commission from 2011, intersexual persons are different from transsexual or transgener persons, because their status has not been bad, but acted by its biological constitution, which is not exclusively male or female, but typically both in the same time or not clear as one of them.
These characteristics were shown in substantive sexual characteristics such as muscle masses, disappearance, fruit and stage, priority sex characteristics such as the continued planting bodies, genetics or chromosomy structures and hormones.
The report also provides a consideration of discrimination, which is carried out by intersexual and transgenous persons in professional life, as well as of the dimension of deterioration, violence and preventive criminality.
No boys agreed with the gender image now have a special camp.
In addition, it is possible in Australia and Nepal for adults to provide in official documents male, female or “third sex”.
In June, the Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognized as a worldly first “unfair” person after a court had reached a life-time maintenance of a “not determined” sex status.
The German instructions besides M and W future have a third order, X for intersexuell, so the Inter-Minister.
In the neighborhood of France, sex themes are still confronted, so a message to France 24.
In 2011, the Decade of French Deputy of the Catholic country signed a Petition that the “theorie” should be removed from school books.
The US-American site Catholic Online has also spoken against the German law: “When the world is moved into a new state, where the sex is a decision, but not sexual activity, then we dismiss two more columns of civilization.”
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to the baby Zone, and she was better starting when the babys were given a gender at the birth.
“ This parent also is too stressable enough without further restrictions, especially when you don’t know the gender of your child," she said.
Children need stability and security.
Historics were seen children who were born both men and women, such as hermaphrodies, after the attractive Greek God who had both families.
Against 10 years ago, the medicine considered the sex as something that could be solved and then reconstructed.
However, the ethical basiss of an operation will be included, as it is now known, how complex the bad identity is, and that doctors can also lie, because they don't know how the child feels like the age given by them.
“ During the 20th century, it was called a psychiatric emergency, ” said the Treasury.
If such a child was born, then you're not called the psychiat, but the chirurgen.
The dominant theory about the treatment of children with uncertain genetics returns to Dr. John Money from the Johns Hopkins University, who is a shape of gender.
He argued the meaning of “fair identity” and argued, social and environmental attitudes – as the parents had a child – interacted with the Genes and Hormons of a child and suggested whether a person was considered a male or female person.
However, in a case known under the title “John/Joan” of 1966, his theories were conspired.
He calls for the parents of a boy whose penis was disappeared at a disastered circumcision, to caught the child in full, and to remove his hooks and then to take him as a girl.
“Money presented this case as a successful example for a change which he was not,” said the dream.
When the boy was about 15, he changed the male and married a woman.
With 38 but he was murdered.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors that would practise this model.
However, in the 1990s, with the use of the Internet, survivors of these gender operations have come to the public which are “not happy with the result”.
So near Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old author from Montana, born with XY-Mann chromosomes, but two-second genetics.
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a great climate or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “friendly life” as a man.
So his external body and the Hoden were soon removed after the birth of 1976 and he was enlarged as a girl.
In the age of 12, he received female hormones.
"I knew I'm not a girl," he said against ABCNews.com
I was unfortunate, but it was really difficult to ask questions.
In the age of 18, he should receive a Vaginal Plastic.
But when he was depressive and knew that something was not true, he requested his medical acts.
What he discovered was shocking.
I was sterilised at my birth, and no one told me ever.
Bruce was born with a DSD, which his body was not sufficiently tested to develop genetics.
After he learned the truth, he changed the man's identity again, he received Testosteron injections and left to remove his breasts.
The operation has become unfruitable.
Today, he fights for others in an organization named interface project to assume intersexual people as normal.
However, Anne Tamar-Mattis, Chief of the Advocates for Reportd Choice, is concerned that the German law may encourage the extents and stigmatics.
“ Many actives are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to take rapid decisions and to demonstrate the child not determined”, she said.
We're afraid that benefits of interventions.
We think it would be better to demonstrate the male or female sex and then wait.
However, we don’t know how the law is doing, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports the Australian law, because “which allows adults to recognize as a third gender”.
“ adults should be able to take their own decisions on their legal gender”, she said.
The German law refers to the appointment of birth.
This is not the battle that you should run the little children at this time.
If they are grown up, they can decide over their body.
However, Dr. Arlene Baratz, a brushtradiology of Pittsburg, who has a daughter with sexual difference and supports hundreds of others in a self-advance group, says the German law 'a perfect' both parents and children.
Katie, the daughter of Baratz, was born with male chromosomes, but DSD has been completely an Androgenistity.
Following the receptor effect of the target cells developed in the Katie female characteristics.
She has a Vagina, but no weather and no ears.
Today, Katie 29 is married; she is working at the University of Pennsylvania as an employer in the children's psychiatricity.
Since it is unfruitable, however, hopes to get a child through adoption or a bedmaster.
Baratz said: “The law gives a room for parents, in which they do not have to take decisions.
It makes them the time to make various tests and closing things and gives them so time before they write "many" or "please".
In this way, everything is okay – you're taking the child great and loved it.
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parents luck.
And you don't have to overcome a transaction that does not allow you to do any longer.
“ This concludes the children in the decision and removes the fear of the parents, because they are the thought they would not do the right,” she explained.
Lastly, the child decides about the sex, which is better to him – and that's wonderful.
So children will be moved in the way to take the decision itself.
Unknown girls shot out of the car
Unrecognised in shoes from a car a 12-year-old in sachen content.
The teachers had probably been eating a group of children at the Thursday stage in Genetin with a air pressure gun.
This reported the police in Burg.
The girl is easy to be in the left Wade.
Rescue forces brought the girls to the hospital.
The shoe came from a small car who had been before a group of six children and suddenly stopped.
The Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The thieves also swimming on a bus place.
It's broken.
Then they fled from it.
The Criminal Police identified it on Friday.
Until now, the police inspection can reveal to a quiet Halloween-Night.
The officers were only two-foldly calling for elderly children who were warranted against households.
As the households recognized this timely and the eggs equally disappeared, it should not be found.
Alongside the city, some sylvester oil were also shown, but there was no shots.
A resident in the Bischof-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his pkw was developed with the clotter and was used with his radars.
However, until the police's attraction, the man has discovered all directly closely, why the police had not to continue to be active.
Women with future perspective
In fact, Waltraud lives traumable Ries.
Your house is located in a quiet living room of Stuttgart with a lot of green, an old tree source, clean neighbors and not even too much transport.
In the city, there are only few minutes with public transport.
"They have no fear of the spices?", asked Waltraud ries and shows on a flight scene at the tour frame.
I'm looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time.
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart.
However, the reason is not spring phobie, but the concern that in the age the many trips to the house and in the apartment could not be able to be aware of any more.
Furthermore, since a menisku operation has learned the middle female in his own body what it means to move with Stockwork.
A book of her appeared on the topic 'Grevenly dwell in age - What living form is the best for me?'.
"Our apartment is the best example of what is not going in age," she begins to tell.
When she went over 20 years ago with her husband to the Maisonette warning, it was just a beautiful apartment in the green.
Today with half fifty thinks Waltraud Ries differently about it.
She also knows that she's listening to the little people who are generally to the topic 'Worns in age'.
Most disappearing it as long as it's.
It's always going to be the others.
Before if the pressure is really great, you'll think.
'It can be too late,' so ries.
In their book, the Internal Architecture 17 models of living for self-determined living in the age.
"It is always an individual decision," she explains.
I don't give it for the age.
Even whoever may be able to lead the agelessness in Toskana or Britain, it should always be considered that he could be sick.
And: 'Unless awareness of the country's language, you are also in Dolce Vita,' do not think of the authoric seats.
Their models are classic training models, alternative habitation forms or the frequencies of the rentner-WG.
Everyone has his tickets and machines in the age.
'It would be such a living community, but nothing' she means with a eye-proof.
Not even like in a student WG with a common bath and a kitchen.
'It's just needs his backing rooms,' so ries.
However, that can operate a senior community, but the book author does not exclude.
This should then be different than in the classical student-WG.
And sometimes you're just wanting to be quiet."
In this view, it is not alone in the country capital.
'The most old people in Stuttgart want to stay so long in their own apartment' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten, the leader of the citizen's service life in the age of the country capital.
Your service office provides people around the topic 'referred'.
That's why the exactly elderly people would also take uncertainties and restrictions to buy only to stay in their living environments, that is also the experience of the Stifting Wartent.
Today there are many opportunities to build the house or apartment free.
Ries recommends that all who are employed to work with the old building of their home or apartment are not just informed and not the best workers.
Today, there are also specialists for the old building today.
Even in the living room, one or another is realised, and if only the toilet growth is, the internal architectecture will be cleared.
But it is not always allowed to be the existing apartment of old law and to ensure that it is free of barrier, even if it is still so nice.
This experience had to make Waltraud ries.
Although you could install a trip lift within the apartment, which also bears a road paid up to the door of apartment but would be the weavy greater obstacle.
She will continue to search until she found the ideal object for her and her husband.
Before the surrounding, she enjoys more than before the scene at the door of her apartment.
Snowden wants to pursue further penalty
The United States have not changed their position to the previous US secret service workers Edward Snowden.
It is continued to have continued unlawfully secret information.
So he must be made a criminal procedure in the United States, the speaker of the US Minister, Jennifer Psaki, in Washington.
The recent exhibits of Snowden would not change it.
Before the German Green Politics Hans-Christian Ströbele had called for a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to not harm him further.
Psaki noted that it was the Ströbel Exhibitions for a parliamentary, not for the German government member.
The secret officer Edward Snowden is mainly prepared for a conversation with German authorities.
But first he wants to know his situation.
The former NSA employees in a not addressed letter made by the Greek Hans-Christian Cristian Ströbelee on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and published to Federal Government, Federal Day and General Administrator.
The letter has been translated by one of the Ströbels:
The experts
I was requested to write to you concerning your survey on mass overseas.
I call Edward Joseph Snowden, and was the defence of the United States's Institute Agency, and the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and the Defense of Intelligence Agency.
In the course of my employment in these institutions, my government has made witnesses of systematic laws that have been granted me from moral obligation to trade.
As a result of the publication of these concerns, I saw me a severe and persistent chamber that had to leave my family and my household.
I now live in the exil and enjoy a satisfactory asylum, giving me the Russian Federation in accordance with international law.
I am encouraged by resonance on my political trade, both in the United States and in anywhere.
Citizens around the world and also high officials, including the United States, have the enthusiasms to a system of global monitoring that no competence is debt as a public service.
These sponsionage complements have made many proposals to new laws and directives which have been covered by the lack of public confidence.
The benefits for society from these knowledge obtained are more clear, and at the same time the risks taken in purchase have been significantly reduced.
Although the result of my efforts was positive, my Government Disen is being treated as a faithful breach and urged the political view to criminalize and appeal.
Yet, it is not a crime to speak the truth.
I am sure that the Government of the United States will support the international community with this abstract position.
I hope that, if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are planned to be able to participate in the comprehensive declaration of the contents on the outcomes established in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports, appropriate and legally.
I'm glad to talk to you in your country when the situation is closed and thank you for their efforts to make the international law protecting us all.
Edward Snowden tested by Hans Christian Ströbele
Child garden has found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands," says Winterlingen's citizen, Michael Maier.
The former child garden in the gardenstraße sold the communities to a private person.
For sale, the Communities Council decided at its recent meeting in no public part.
The building changed his owner to a "recognised" price.
"The municipality is satisfied," stressed Maier.
The budget was 100 000 euros.
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the previous child gardens.
The citizen is right that winters have delivered the responsibility of the building before winter to someone else and therefore no longer needs to come to the conversation of the house, such as to move, to look at the garden and place the road.
"This weapon is now away," Mauer rejoiced.

Report: Obama campaign added to replace bids by Hillary Clinton
The former advisers of President Barack Obama have discussed the secret to replace Vice-President Joe Biden in the election campaign 2012 by Hillary Clinton, the New York Times.
The enthusiasm is the most valuable surprise of the long-term work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the election chapter 2012, “Double Down: Game Change 2012”.
The Times is an example of the first book appearing and she reported on Thursday that the topberary of the Chairman would have performed “forefine group sessions and surveys end 2011” to find whether it would be shot to Obamas' hope to repair if it falls.
According to Jonathan Martin, the National Political Responsor of Times, the book describes the story of the leaders of the campaigns and the white house, namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, which has the effect on the survey values of the former outdoor Minister Clinton against the Vice-Presidents.
The potential wealth was a closely hot secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a half of the President's greatest advisers – including Daley, the former campaign leader Obamas, Jim Mesina, and the former senior adviser of the white house, David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the opposite concept.
"Double Double Down" is described that Daley has been at the street of the efforts, notwithstanding their 'em personal relations' before you decided to be against such a stipulation, after data showed that the candidate of Clintons would not be an important improvement of the chances of Obamas.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government has actually advised to replace bids by Clinton.
“I explained a number of things to be considered, and that was one of them," said Daley to the Magazin.
It is necessary to be remembered that the President at the time had fearful survey values, so we thought: “To God’s will what we do?"
While Daley was described as an “officied Sorgfalt”, Martin said to Anderson Cooper from CNN that the campaign was operated during the reception of a significant impact to find out whether such a goal is payed for the electoral officers.
“In campaigns there is no so much money for surveys and fokus groups if not seriously thinking about something” said Martin to AC360.
However, it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team considered a exchange.
Martin said to CNN, he asked Daley if his damage boss would have known about the potential Weakness decision.
As Daley explained that he did not believe that the President of the possible change was “conscious”, the former stage had to be “mobile” that Obama had known it.
Martin added that "double Double Down" does not provide definitive answer to the question whether the political songs of Obamas had reached a table.
Cooper asked Martin, whether he seriously thinks Obama hasn't been aware of the investigations whether you're going to fall in the elections.
“Otherwise,” said Martin.
What's happening on the way with my email?
Email is actually called electronic letter.
Would the project of the Internet Service e-mail similar to the original post, technically used the letter secret?
When the early Internet services were used, the first reason was to make communication possible.
Therefore, the basic technical protocols have not been considered to create a stability fund for a hearing letter change.
Therefore, a original e-mail is more than an open mail card as a signed letter.
If user "Anna" sends a mail to "Benni", are the computers then directly connected?
The e-mail program or the Anna browser on the first step sends the mail to the mail server of its service provider.
If, for example, she had a GMail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the contents to the driver using the beam.
On the street, the mail can run on some other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call the contents at its provider.
Do you want to read original emails on their way through the network?
Most mails will be read more often from software robots.
When the expert is sent, it is usually checked whether the mail is conducted as an annex.
The recipient systems will also be presented a virus-check.
In addition, the providers shall check whether it is a slow and unrecovered spam mail that is equally removed or at least removed in a spam directory.
Do the robots have another task?
In systems such as GMail the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place in the context service.
When Anna and Benni communication by GMail on their coming holiday trials, Google can hide appropriate links to vacation offers.
Do you also read unknown people the emails?
The probability that unprofitable people read a mail is extremely low.
Theory is that possible, but it is possible.
In companies, administratives often have the possibility of read electronic posts.
The criminal prosecutors and secret services also have legal opportunities to initiate or take account of e-mails.
There are possible illegal exhibition actions.
Is it possible to protect e-mails against the comparison?
By encrypting a OpenPGP standard, e-mail can actually be encrypted against compliance.
With high technical impact, it is also possible to facilitate the meta data of an email communication so that it can not be recognized once without any further, who has communicated with someone.
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany?
The mainly privately used posters are playing Yahoo and Google according to an investigation by Convios Consulting from August 2013 only a subordinated role.
During the last parts of Yahoo mail, Gmail could clearly be found by Google.
Mother shot in the forest and rating cased
When his mother died, a man out of Wolfsburg shot a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest, and continued to busy their wheat and feed money.
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger had buried his whole mother after the exhibitions of the police in the forest.
At first, he missed the death of the 89-year-olds, then he took the money over one half years.
Now the 67-year-olds have to respond to the fault, as a speaker said on Friday.
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was understood in May: At the same time, the mother needed no medicine more needed.
The Empire told the Rentner that his mother was moved to Spain.
Because the officers did this wonderfully, they continued to determine.
He found that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years, and he lastly made them.
Finally, the 67-year-old has laid down the death of his mother.
An obstruction said that the police did not provide any points of content for a penal crime.
Little to icecrees that illuminate in the dark?
A British undertaking has developed the first lighting ice in the dark – with the help of calamities.
Charlie Francis made the fluorescent properties of the seaests and made a lighting leckery.
The idea came to him after he read a research work on qualitatives and could convince Chinese scientists to make the light protein artificial.
The Eiscreme reacts in the diagnosing with the language, with which the pH value is increased in the protein and the light will be solved.
Chris explains that the food reacts to the warm in the mouth and lighting – ever more leaving, so it will be clearer.
Charlie, reasoner of the Eiscrememark "Lick Me I'm Delicious", says: "This product is unbelievable, but still in a very early production phase, and so we get two grams of it for 200 feet."
The protein used in the eiscreme reags with the language with a neutral pH value.
When the mouth warms the protein, the pH value grows and the iron illuminated.
We discovered it in the last months and we appeared ideal to bring it to Halloween on the market because it has this wonderful light effect.
It's probably the worst ice screen I've ever produced, because the skill illumination is four times more than gold.
Each kitchen costs me about 140 pounds.
But it's slow to that.
Charlie's experimental company with seat in Bristol is famous for its un normal mask facilities that includes bier, kiss, wild meat and wood.
But his new creation must be more ambitious.
He says: “I would like to develop an invisible icecree.”
This is not possible for himself because of the light spread which is designed by the ice cristalls, which consists of icecrees; but I think we can find an opportunity to create it.
The Eisencrees uses the fluorescent properties of a quality produced by Chinese scientists.
The TSV Morsum after six days of play is still without any point in the handball connection band.
Today it comes to the Ingo Ehlers team to Derby to the TSV Daverden, which has done the last weekend of his first victory.
With this game, the Saison starts new for us.
"I hope we will finally have our head off." Ehlers still keep optimistic.
This has finally been available, except the last long hendrick blohme, with its complete cadder.
Daverden also sets us on time game.
So we need to keep our mistakes little.
However, the first line is to increase in the discovery, which lastly left all others than a safe impression.
Indeed, Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz has been relaxed after the first stage of Northhorn.
The game, of course, was a house number.
But so we're not a long time for the favor, because the Derby can always happen.
Even though, he wants to create Panitz now in Morsum to start a series.
It's missed from Jan-Malte Jodat.
For this reason, the A-Jugent Windshence, which is active at HC Bundd License A, is its saison debtor.
Whoever isn't hot in such a game must stay at home.
Halloween 2013: In numbers
When I was small, Halloween had something magic.
My sister and I were swearing with sweetness, lately staying and clothing us for the neighborhood.
Today, I've become the Halloween mounty.
In the past two years, I didn't have been ready to distribute from my apartment to sustainability, and I will probably not do it this year.
But the statistics, I'm a black hair, which's going to be Halloween.
The majority of the Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate this year Halloween and gives 6,9 billion US Dollar for Sustainability, Costs and Decorations, so the US-American Union of individuals (NRF).
A thing I'm glad to every hill again is the trend values.
The costumes will be equipped with about 1.2 billion of US$6.9 billion, the NRF.
In this year there are an arrogant unrealised objects of the last clash.
Women do not need to be in sexy clothing, now they can also fill the marketing food like pizza, Hamburgers or carotes.
What men happens, I expect every lot of Zombie thanks to The Walking Dead, and I stipulate that the Daft-Punk Worlds will be created this year in the Instagram Fades.
According to Google, the most famous Zombies, Batman, Piraten and Hexen are the most famous costal costals of Zombies, Batman.
I'm sure it's nothing about tradition.
We've been clothed by our dogs last year and we're not on my place alone.
In fact, $330 million of Americans give this year for the coasts of their households, so NRF.
These are a lot of “Hot Dogs”.
Whatever we have to do is, we're not ridiculous.
Americans will pay $1,9 billion this year, so The Nielsen Company.
These are approximately 270 million kilograms in chocolate wheels, lutchers, Bonbons and Gummbourgs.
So good news for the United Nations ministry, 41 million people who run through the terms "Sweet or saura" by the quarters.
In fact, we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – we do nothing to eat.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sweet candy Corn; however, 15 million kilograms are sold for Halloween, the national connection of the Sustainable Manufacturer.
That's about nine billion masks.
It's a rape that I can't solve.
Nothing is more about Halloween than houses in which it springs.
They have great names like "Terror Behind the Walls" (the House of Shock) (the House of Shock) in a real prison, "Howl-O-Scream" and "The House of Shock".
There are actually 1.200 officially acknowledged spring houses in the United States that won't get 500 million dollars Resolution, so America Haunts, and that is closing the wonderful photos on which you just pink into the Hose and then put the friends on Facebook where you don't resolve, and then one of the types you are on which you are standing leaves a comment as “new face expression”.
But we're finally coming to the corbishs.
Charlie Brown trusted us with the Great Curbis, when we were children, and the shadow of a cirbistain is like the sharp of the Christmas tree – something we made from small.
Congratulately, the “Baby in the Curbis” trend first last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us have grown up in order to defend the court and not to sit there.
This year, the US Census Office will be paid about $106 million for census, so the US Census Office.
The cirbistainers who slowly disappeared in the garden are probably from Illinois, where this year 245 million kilograms were met.
If you want to get right points, then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and kiss out of its 921 kilo severe pumps.
Appartement burned in Helmb Rights: Rescue forces selected mountains
The firewave had to be printed in Helmb Rights later.
A three family house in the countrycree of Hof starts in the night to the sudden day.
The rescue forces mounted a selected body from the house.
Rescue forces have found an elected body in a three family house at a band in Helmb Rights.
Whether it is an inhabitant hand still unlawful, as a police speaker said in Bayreuth.
In the late Thursday, it was burned in the ground of the house.
When the fires were pushed, the flames already smote out of a window.
The use forces went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This and another room were completely burned out.
The whole earth is damaged.
All the other inhabitants were not home during the border, the police speaker continued.
The building is no longer inhabitable.
The exact reason for the fire was first not clear.
Germany's largest country Church has an open-up launched to meet the professional of the Pastor.
The Evangelian-lutheric country Church Hannover is a possible ground: Hannover is recognized that the number of their current pastors and passengers will be measured to 2030.
For young people from today, the profession is very attractive and be good future views, said Pastor Mathis Burfien (43) in conversation with the Evangelian press service.
It is attractive to be able to decide the working and day end itself.
With Burfie, the National Church has first requested a pastor at a full place to keep young people for the theological study.
At the same time, less young people are decided to study theology.
Burfia brings it back to the process of disappearance: "The voice of God is ready, the world is slow."
The professional of great freedom and diversity is also prepared.
I am the Lord of my Terminary, and I can put my difficult points where I am important.
Pastors could be very close to the people.
They gained much as teachers and could well live.
Surely, it will pay more in the free economy, but theologists would have been a secure employer.
It comes to meet young people from today, who are not only carriers, but for a faultful work.
According to the country church that includes three quarters of lower acids, the current time is about 60 pastors in the rest.
At the same time, about 40 absolutions of a theologic study, their visariat starts at the same time.
In territory areas such as the Harz, the Emsland or the Venezuela, it may be difficult to be placed in places.
Burfia wants to organise among other study days for young people and to invite prominently who have studied theology.
The theology study provides wide education.

Land Rover Rally Series announced
In the interior, rensite and six pontct horns are available and a free pre-exchange.
Options are rich of enhanced breasts, a service package containing Bowler Works mechanisms and logistics support until the vehicle installation between events.
Drew Bowler, manager of Bowler Motorsport, explains: “The Rally clients who come to Bowler have changed.”
They are not all recognized renacers, but people who are in the search for sponsoring and adventure, and after a accessible way to world class events.
We are glad to open this way in partnership with the Land Rover and the MSA and to believe that the format will allow new possibilities to generate different Rally disziplines in Britain and foreign and to prepare Neulinship on the streets and the reality of Rally Raid.
We were really glad to develop the defence of Challenge Wars – that will be a sustainable mastership.
Furthermore, the Defence Challenge has a training and test day in February, as well as the option to participate in desert roads in North Africa and the Middle East.
A firewave to save a skin, 15 meters over the ground on a dangerous rock preption in a stone breast
Cockerspaniel-Hundin Ruby was driven after a small accident of transport
Three days later she was discovered by a spacious in the rock brown in her missile situation.
The firewaves swimed on the rock and saved the dog before the safe death.
The firewave has been able to bring a hair in safety, set up on a 15 meter high precaution in a rock rock.
The nine months old Cockerspaniel-Hundin Ruby was going out after an accident of transport on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved from a stone breast.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his friend Becky Hall, 20 who heard the dog, came to Steinbruch Flappit in Denholme, West Yorkshire to take Ruby again and thanks to the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They were discovered after their missing Hungary and published help calls in social networks when she was run after the small accident of transport in the rock.
At about 14:15 at mid-eight, he saw a spacious walker who led his dog, the rocked Ruby on the 15 meters higher paragraph in the stonebruch.
The technical rescue team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station moved to place and turned to salvation Rubys, which was then transported into a dog box above.
Andy Clayton, a specialist of the technical rescue team, said: “It was in a dangerous situation.
It was located in the middle of the rockway – 15 meters from top and ground.
She didn't move a muscle during her salvation – she was as smoking.
But now she's fine.
Then she drew a couple of hundreds.
That was a very unrealistic use.
The fact that the dog has been discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist of the technical rescue team, said: “Robby had a ries.”
It is the possibility that she was very hard or painful.
Ruby was conducted to the investigation of animals, but nothing found except creature and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: “Before seeing the rescue was crucial.”
I couldn't believe she was actually there.
It was wonderful to keep her back into the poor.
The animals explained that if the creature became too large and would be broken together, it would probably be disappeared.
The fireshots have made great.
It was really courageous what they did.
We're just so grateful and everyone of them was absolutely unbelievable.
Scott Alderson from Keighley added: “We were afraid that she would fall, but she remained up.”
The fireshots were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains that he never took Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with a Australian radiosender this week, the Pop-Star said that she had worked as a background scene in Jaggers song Old Habits The Hard from 2004.
Perry explained she had eaten with the altrocker at evening and that “who advised me when I was 18.”
She added: “This is long ago and he was very nice to me.”
In a statement, a representative of Jaggers said on Thursday, “classisticly denied that he had ever undertaken approaches at Katy Perry.”
The representative added: “Therefore she changed him with someone else.”
Perry was one of the songs who had a guest at the Rolling-Stons Tor this year.

George Kerevan: European disappearance gives the shot the choice
A new day, a new story of scary for independence.
This time we will warn that an independent Shotland is required to join the Schengen Room as a condition for the EU membership.
This provides the word of stories of passenger controls in Berwick and a secure border by stachel road throughout the hadrianswall.
In fact, the plan of Strathclyde has been pointed out to the potential economic benefits that would lead more travel free in the rest of Europe, but it has not been a role in waiting for the board.
Nobody has also mentioned that the EU Member States often to enforce their rigorous rules if it is better for them.
Since Shotland is not listed to the Schengen Room, the continuing non-observation for Brussels would only be a small competence in the matter of what you really want from the shapes.
So it's not a story.
And one who has come so in the years, she is already equal to a Fossil: the first time I heard the “independence of the passover controls” equest for at least 40 years ago.
This is an interesting point when the special repair of this old story is lost.
Why should we expect from an independent Scottland that there is a tank after the European feed?
Why push the London Joch against that by Brussels, especially now?
These are the real European news: the great plan established after the war for the agreement of Europe is in stocks.
The European crisis has been officially died.
All of the EU parties who have arrived on lands that are coherent to the EU or want to throw the euro as Community cohesion over the border.
Even in Germany, the Euroskeptic Party could be founded Alternative for Germany – first this year – approximately five million votes at the Federal Day selection in September and thus effectively exempt the free democrates (equality to the British Liberal Democrates) from the Federal Day.
There was always a home contradiction against the plan to create a federalist Europe.
However, the current economic crisis is a warning point.
The European Central Bank's close Spar policy in connection with the skills in which national economy is required by holding the common currency, many people think that the project of Europe has been too far.
The Euro crisis has little to cause national deficits to the excessive budgetary effects – that was only in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has established its members at the Western currency, who are part of the German exporters, and it is likely to like German politicians so.
Without the possibility of a local currency assessment, South Europe will be re-enabled with a constructed productivity share against Germany.
The only opportunity is to short up bonds and public expenditures – offered by Berlin.
A deep European productivity problem is behind the current problem of food and currency.
As a result of the ‘Green’ energy directives provided by Brussels – a code for the subvention of French and German energy companies at the costs of consumers — the European industry compares the dual of electricity and the fourth of gas.
This is a pleasant cost reward, as we already could see in Grangeouth.
All loans records in the world are not protecting the European petrochemical industry before being reduced from a solid American ship gas into the ecks.
As a consequence, a revolutioner, particularly in France, the elder EU leader.
After the war, Elite France saw the EU as a vessel with which Germany could hold up and be at Paris with online.
But Berlin needs no longer than a Tor to Political Legitimation and Europe has deprived its own economic policy to fight the grounded French economy.
The result: Marine Le Pens law entitled, EU-Front National Front has just obtained a vital selection, so that the dominant socialists are three.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the electoral votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it could not be able to make a spectrum in the right spectrum would mean automatically advantages for the lefts.
What makes Le Pen with her newly gained population among the white Frenchs of the working class?
It would like to use the EU wheels next year to reduce an anti-UE anti-community closure in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU portraits are well disappeared in these elections, and that's very well possible, then it could first be possible to reduce the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to be out: In not too far the future, the growing resurrection against the EU and the common currency will meet for the ceiling of the euro.
The EU will not be disappeared, but it will be more than the “Europe of the U.S.” favoured by the General de Gaulle.
Germany and some of its satellite populations may be fitting at the euro, but France and South Europe will return to their own currencies.
I hope that Britains are deprived in the hope of joining themselves to the United States.
Nevertheless, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific area is close to the United States alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where is Scottland staying at all that?
We can decide to be a region of (in recent consequence) Small England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests – whereby it is to say Berlin and Brussels what they can be able to move.
I am convinced that Shotland could go in a lower European connection, unless we keep our own currency.
Cooperation with other, similar countries thinking is easier in a non-Food Europe of the nations.
Otherwise, we should consider that it should be equal to the Norway and keep our economic independence.
The SNP government in Schottland is valuable – the successful political movement against the Spar policy in Europe and 2011 has gained a speculative majority because of the outbreaking of the proposed (and implemented) currencies that the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the follower Tory-Lib Dem Coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scottland to decide now for a independence, only to get a spanish policy from Berlin and Brussels.
Old Publishing Device: Enhanced faster
African and Spanish girls have tendencially reached the pubertation than their white age-genoses, such as research.
Core changes are not directly meaning the pubert device
There is no complaint that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic fatty is a resolved of the early pubert
The trend to the early pubert is less expensed for young people
The former CNN responsist Pat Etheridge is a journalist that specializes on children and family issues.
Should a mother be worried when her daughter grows in seven or eight years of breasts and shamhaare?
At the annual conference of the Children's Party American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, she explained the Pédiatric Endokrinlogge Dr. Paul Caplowitz that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and created a new standard.
“ I take a lot of time to call parents — usually, it is not a sign that the pubert’s place is fastly involved, ” explained the capital.
Appreciable shows of development, such as growing fruits, sham and axleshare, and body-reach, are shown in girls previously.
However, there was only a easy disappearance at the age of Menarche (augment of the first regulation) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average seat is 12.5 years old, some less than 12.75 in 1970.
“When the development of the fruits starts, it remains at least two to three years to mearch,” Capluitz said, also the author of the book “Free publication in girls: the essential adviser for this frequent problem”.
Time is the most precise test as the browsing device is.
It is contrary to what actually represents the start of the pubert, but it applies to “creased” if the growth increases of a growth suits before a age of eight years.
In most cases, the process or the thumbnail requires – something that can survey a childarm.
The tests could be shown by an endikronologic in order to exclude serious problems such as tumor or cycles.
There are methods of treatment for the delaying of an early mentalization and the disappearance of another consequence: the timely ageing of bones that can lead to growth and so that small cows can lead to adults.
The recommendations for medication or hormonal treatment are focused on the age of child, development speed, growth rate and emotional rival.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Caplowitz is retaining what happens medicinely, but he assess: “The subpressure of the pubert can be in the ways of behaviour and feelings of girls, otherwise than her age-genosis.”
The other large problem is clearly: parents don't want their young daughters to have the period.
“ They are worried about the pregnancy risk or how they have the hygiène side,” said Caplowitz.
“ It was a shock, ” she remembers a woman whose daughter with ten days had received her.
Even though it had the first sign and we had spoken about Menstruation, she was not emotionally prepared.
She came to disappoint and disappeared from school to home because she was the first in her friendship.
There are many largely published theories about the causes of the early publication site.
However, there are no bad evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment or sexual messages would be seriously in the media.
Children are like girls earlier in the pubert.
Caplowitz is the view that the most convinced premies is the epidemic of fatty.
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years that produced a connection between body fat and access to the pubert.
Other research supports this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African and Spanish girls have tendencially reached the pubert's place than their white ages.
There are different statements for this.
Global seems to be a early pubert of all possible things from economic climate conditions.
Another advice: Although boys grow the face- and shadow premature, the trend to a full of time pubert does not so specially as with girls.
Other doctors at the AAP Conference are underlined the complexity of the subject.
The surrounding of the acne and shamhaar is itself widespread for children and children.
“We need to be careful, as we identifi the true start of the pubertät” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pidiatric endokrinologist at the Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not have to keep their child age advice to how they should talk to their child.
“It can mean that you must lead a conversation previously as awaited,” cried Caplowitz.
If you stay quiet, the child is usually good.
Girls who rise early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if he has come into a pretty time as thought.
Jumbo manufacturers strive on the face of large seats
Among leading aircraft producers, it has come to an exhibition of the width of seats in the tourist class, which offers the sound for a bitter compound on the Dubai Airshow this month.
The fight is focused on the width of passengers in long flights in the tourist class – not always those to seek airlines mostly, but the outstanding room makes the key for efficiency testing in the latest airports of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.
Airbus requested a sector standard, which includes at least 46 cm width in the tourist class, but the US-American Erzrival Boeing said that the airlines should decide.
The combination comes at a time as the aircraft makes it possible to sell larger versions of their two-motoric long-term flowers, and waiting for records from 17 to 21 November.
As the back part of the aircraft has been equipped – especially if there are nine or ten seats – it is essential for the specified economic results that should provide the new “Mini-Jumbo” design.
Boeing claims that his modernised “777X” is 406 persons in the tourist class that are over 17 customs width and that 10 per series are allowed.
Airbus explains that A350's competitive version offered 350 people in 18 large customs seats in the tourist class, and there is nine per set.
Aircrafts often shares Hiebe about technical details using advertisement in the Fachpresse.
Now bus calls for Airbus before Dubai Airshow, where the 777X will be made with more than 100 orders for example, directly to the public.
Recently, the company presented an announcement that could be the beginning of a new show war and showed a picture in which three persons sit together in a restaurant, and the title: "Do you accept this?"
“Boeing offers long-term flights in seats that are one of the regional turbo Props” says John Leahy.
In view of changed food conditions, people are dicker, but airports have not changed radically.
Among the early 1970s, when Boeing 747 has defined the modern long-term trial, and the end of the century, the weight of the masculine average American between 40 and 49 years is 10 percent, so the data of the United States Health Minister.
The size number of men in the 21th century is 100.8 cm in the United States Health Statistics.
Airbus says that his rivale was a seat concept of the 1950s when the average body was baptized by the fresh “Jet set” smelller.
The airbus, investigations that indicated that an additional custom (2.54 cm) per seat increases the quality of sleep by 53 per cent.
Boeing asserts the numbers of Airbus to the seats and says that it is not going to decide in the measurement of the manufacturers how the airlines designate the balance between airports and institutions.
The company also explains that the investigations have the experience in the aircraft of more than the seat width.
“It is really going to give flexibility to airlines so that they can do what they need to be successful”, explained the Craver de Boeing experts of the aircraft.
They don't want to tell them what she's doing.
You know her business better than everyone else.
For aircrafts, it is more electricity, but for producers it will become an increased topic that can affect the circumstances.
On the other hand, a rail on airlines with a estimated volume of at least 700 billion US dollar according to list prices in the coming decades, which could be sustainable to the export base of the United States or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seatlayout is the power of the power behind the exhibition of the new Jets.
Even as Airbus and Boeing means 20% more efficiency per setz in their latest two-motoral long-term numbers as the market manager in this segment, 365th Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeings to the results are partly depending on the comparison of 777X with its ten seats per series with the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still less than at present machines with ten seats per set.
“Boeing therefore has more seats in his aircraft to make it more competitive to our products", says Kevin Keniston, head for Passagier comfort at the European Airbus.
On the other hand, the Analysts, full kabines with ten seats per series in the 777s said that many passagiers decided to be along with more flight airports.
“Eight ten customs seats would be great for passagiers, but the reality is: from a economic point of view, the airbus offer is controlled by the 777 threats," says Mary Kirby, an expert for Kabinian Institution, the reasonari and the outcomer of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing are not offering places but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The green Jet sales also takes bands to assess the establishment in the competitiveness.
Even if they appreciate the comfort, all the producers also offer to make daily with high-defended flowers and regional flights.
Airbus offers a A350 with 10 series, but has not yet been sold according to its own exhibition.
To short, Airbus has noted how greater accessibility of the Kabines would be and for some Jets wide seats to the portions.
Without the support of the only one producer of the largest modern Jets, experts say that the call will probably be disappeared by a new industry standard but the wages of 777X sales.
New anti-nicotine immunity may make the pleasure when smoking the garage
Scientists have developed an anti-Nicotine immunity that could destroy the rain.
One dose of the vaccine could protect the mousse life before nikotin flavor.
For tests on humans, further trials will be needed, but Prof. Ronald Crystal by Weill Cornell Medical College in New York has said that the first results were good.
“We are very glad that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of raw people who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market, but have to live that their nikotin search is stronger than these approaches”, Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a damageless virus that has been changed so that it contains the genetic information on the production of nikotin anti-atentes.
The virus infectes the lever cells that then produce an explicit fuel of anti-types.
The anti-types take the nikotin molelets into the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, so a raceer does not reach nikotin heigh.
In attempts, nikotin’s mass has been affected to their normal activity level.
Mexicans would have taken a “time”, the researchers explained a sign that Nikotine had reached their brain.
Experiences are described in the Fachblat Science Translational Medicine.
Earlier tabak immunities lacked because they enthusiased anti-filters.
The vaccines had to be given so often that they were smooth and unfair.
However, the costs of the new vaccine are likely low, because it transforms levercelles into antioxide manufacturings.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine could be made for people if he is completely sure that children will be retained before they are able to try a cigarette, and that can prevent Nikotin’s trial.
But it's likely that rawchers would use him to stop.
“ Then they know that if they start again, they will not receive any pleasure for the nikotin pollution substance, and it helps them to disappear the nature,” he explains.
The British scientists said that the results were interested, but at the same time they warned that there are still further research needs.
Tripodi prevents being affected by Obeid
The former minister of Labor Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is sent by the State Survey of Corruption.
The former NSW minister has amended the regulations for maritime respect, please, with his political manager Eddie Obeid, which covered participations on three principles in the State controllaneous country.
The Independent Commission of Aganst Corruption (ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption) has extended its investigations on the issue of whether Obeid has continued to extend paid contracts in Circular Quay, where the Obeids two restaurants and a Café, without a registration of its exits in August 2005.
Now tripodi has been determined because of the accused, since Tripodi had exposed the Thursday's first stabs of Lyne Ashpole according to the Thursday.
During the years began 2005, the Government had extended public descriptions for the paid contracts.
The painters were driving and wanted more time.
2009, the paid contracts for companies at the Circular Quay, which included 2.5 million dollars annually, were extended without public description.
Tripodi, who was Minister of Hafen from February 2006 to November 2009, was originally spoken for public descriptions.
However, he decided to have taken the amendments on requests of Obeid, which, as Tripodi confirmed, had renewed the government's paid regulations.
One of the ICAC submitted telephonys showed conversations between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunnn, a leader who had changed in the ministry of the port after he worked under Obeid in the fisheries Authority.
“What is the subject discussed in these telephone talks about the preparation of commercial retention rules?" asked the Commission member Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
“No, ” answered Tripodi.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it was not definitely.
It is not definitive between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli flights take objective in Syria, so official sources
The Israeli jagd flights would have attacked a target in the Syrian Port of Latvia, confirmed a leading government employer against Fox News.
The officer did not explain what the goal was, but said that it was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, it was the target of Russian SA-125.
At least two times this year, Israel has already performed aircrafts on rackets in Syria.
Foreign workers with 457-Visa could be undertaken “Reality Test”
The Government considers extending measures on an 'Reality Test' for for foreign workers with 457 views.
If the test is introduced, it is about a criteria for use that it should prevent 457 in order to establish unqualified jobs or for the access of family and friends to Australia.
Today, a debate was published by the Government after the former Deputy of the Labor Party, Maxine McKew, which had condemned the comments of the Government in terms of foreign workers, because they could be delayed by the neighbouring Australia.
“Breaking statements such as, foreign countries must be set down” and, first, set Australians, are a very unemployed disagreement in times in which workers call for a protected labour market,” she said to Australia India Institute today.
History commented that white work forces should be protected – and if some in the region compare a echo of this historic art, I wouldn't wonder it.
The Debate proposal includes 12 measures considered by the former Minister of Immigration, Chris Bowen.
The Minister of Immigration Brendan O'Connor, who yesterday talks about human damage in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the recommended amendments and the others are still accepted.
If the “Reality criteria” is received, a person who requests a visa may be examined immediately whether “the application is true in cases in which the applicant is involved with the owner or a relevant person of the company’s supporting.”
The company could also be obliged to assess the number of 457 visumers after the past enterprises who first wanted to support only a small number of employees.
A 35-year-old sri-lancical asylant probably died in a heart-infarct after he arrived in this week with a refugee bottle on the Christmas Island.
The disappeared nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia with him will belonged to the middle of his father's death from a growing cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died.
A study was announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of HS2 railway project for Scottland.
In HS2 Ltd's work, it is proposed that with the beginning of phase 1 in 2026 high speed connections between Shotland and North England are made.
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project “a closer Britains”.
The College Keith Brown explained that he was very happy to work with the British Government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high speed unit between London and West Midland.
After the end of Phase 2 it will give connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the Government corrected the estimated costs for the construction of high speed rates between London and Northern Ireland of 32.7 billion per cent to 42.6 billion.
The British Government, in conversations with transport Scotland, has encouraged HS2 Ltd to seek further streets and travel time improvements for Northern Ireland and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of a travel time of last three hours or less than Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: “Our goal for HS2 is a real national stretch network, the British and its cities closer.”
We're going to go with HS2 because it's a huge advantage with us.
Unless we stand before a capacity crisis in our train.
However, it is also about the link between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which will be improved thanks to HS2.
The Schoattic State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented: “The present announcement is a good message for Shotland.”
In the name of the Schott Government, Keith Brown Carmichael invited the “incompetence” for the skilling connection to the HS2 network.
Brown said: “The high speed-speed connection brings the potential of large economic benefits for Scottland, but also the Scotland's economic force provides an argument for rapid rail connections in the whole British countries”.
For this reason, we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to investigate the options for high speed-speed connection in Scottland, the benefits of all and add the connection of Glasgow-Edinburg, which are already planned by the schoat government.
I am glad to review the investigation report with the British Ministers in the next year and to assess the next steps together.
Rules on electronic devices in aircraft remain available in Australia
Australian airports have to continue to discharge tablets and telephones at starting and landscape, although efforts in the United States to locker the rules for such devices.
The US-American Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US flug companies to change their provisions, so that passagiers on their devices are read, see, see or play videos, unless they are found in the "Flug" mode.
During the majority of the airport, passagiers are already allowed, but many people are angry that they cannot read their e-books when starting and landing.
Australian societys observe the decision to which US-American airlines need to take places to work, but there is no direct plans to amend their rules.
The CASA Authority also explained that the warning will be seen, but noted that the restrictions in the use of electronic devices in critical airports in Australia will be applied.
“The CASA has not actually identified specific rules regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft”.
The topic is subject to provisions to which, according to the airlines, the security of the security and the passagiers must follow the security instructions given by Kabine Personal.
Virgin has already been discussed with the CASA on an extension of its Wi-Fi conversation system on flights and explain that changes are open to be initiated by the legislator.
“We would welcome an audit of the authorisation of electronic devices by the CASA, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience now after we offer (allowless conversation) during the airport," said a speaker.
Qantas explained that you will remain on the basis of the current rules.
“Our current directives provides that electronic devices are not allowed to be used when starting and landing, and we have no plans to change that is now," said the company.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations which can benefit from passengers, and we will see the FAA solution and the reasons that are safely concerned.
The decision takes place in US-American societys each after the age of the Flotte.
You must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate the functions through mobile devices and change manual books, training materials, hand-covered programs and customer instruction.
“After a airline confirmed the tolerance of its flight, it can allow passover to use the use of transparent, easier electronic devices such as tablets, e-Book drivers and smartphones every height”, FAA known.
In rare cases, when bad view, the crow will show the passagiers while the landscape can be removed.
The group also recommended to move harder devices at starting and planting under the seat or in the pools on the seats.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, the BVB attachers had provided for heat scenes in the Veltins-Arena.
Borussia Dortmund reported hard consequences.
Before the Friday game, the football band against the VfB Stuttgart reacted Ultras with a sweet - first.
It was an unbelievable, almost a sensetic acustic, which is to be attracted by the Federal Band game between the German Victoria Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park.
To hear the guests with their dependences.
The southern tribes refer to where the most faithful - and laughest - BVB factors, first of all, were presented: no bonds, no slaughters.
The podest of the Capo, which coordinated the other common commitment, remained irrespective.
And all the front on the tribüne, a large faça with the title "Section Stadion Prohibition".
Only as a tourist Roman Weidenfeller as always as the first BVB player takes the place, he burned a short-term jubel.
When his mankinds followed, there was a loud speech and weird shapes - but not long everywhere.
In the central flowers 12 and 13 of the southern streets there was nothing.
Although the Stadion speaker Norbert Dickel once again had the positive experiences of the last days - Derbysieg, victory about Arsenal, extending the contract of trainer jürgen clopp - not carefully for festivals.
For five minutes before the appointment, the Capo took his podest - and that just so far, with the hands of green emphasis, shouted in a loud clash, as dick as lived the stimmation on the rings in the stadion.
The last was as always the southern tribes on the row - and finally it was again here as the latest place in the stadion.
And afterwards as with an appeal from the southern tribes, the laughing invitation "Derbyseers stands up" came again as always.
The weak before was probably a reaction on the events of the past days.
Inmediately before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04, some of the joint BVB lighting records were attended in the views and on the place, and almost the tourist Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was paid because of the chaotic scene.
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watchke had received the springs of the villagemunder Ultras in his office - and they believed Watzkes words, this was a more unfortunate time for the Fanverters.
"The BVB's BVB Buses will be given for the whole air movement", announced on a podium debate in Frankfurt.
As immediate measurement, Watzke understood Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart.
"I haven't been prohibited," he said.
The nucleal toleranz politics in matters of psychotechnology we can't receipt.
Furthermore, the ancients have been shown different possibilities of exhibition - until Sunday, this time has been to decide for one.
Otherwise, so Watchke, the BVB will set a sanction until the end of the next week.
"It's gonna be cut off," protected Watchtower.
You can be remarked as the reactions in the southern tribes fall.
wooden houses in Singapore, since the crisis arrived in the Mediterranean history
In a peak house in the center of the Bendeeer in Singapur Janani Amirthalinga entered a golden army, a ring and a couple of earringes to be able to pay the school fees of her daughters.
“My husband and I just bought a house, where my whole money is inside,” says Amirthalinga.
Although each month 3,000 tonight dollar (ca 1.730 euro) won as an administrative employer, and her husband also works, it does not go out the monthly income, it explains it.
In fact, the demand in South Eastern Parts is, where the debt of the budgets is so large that Value Max, where she has taken its taxes, has become the third board house which has been held in the Singapore.
Smoking is not only a fast way to get money – 1.300 Singapur dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as useful as an uncertain bank payment.
Typically, a 17 percent-year-old career in Singapore requires an effective year of the 17 percent, which is only 15.4 percent requested by the United Overseas Bank, a local credit provider with a Philippe in the same sale centre.
However, the benefit of payment houses offers that there is no checking of creditability or revenue, so that grants are more rapidly possible than in banks.
For this reason, millions of people in the region in pearl homes are encouraged, after families have increased life-sharing costs, and an increased budget and consumer debt.

People's economics also ensure the high debt of consumer in Thailand, which has been issued this week from a technical recession.

“In the end effect, it means that, in view of increased costs, people will be attempt to complement their revenues whereever it is possible”, says Song Sing Wun, economic at CIMB, a malaria bank.
Historical maximums of gold prices in the past two years have still strengthened the trend for the disappearance of personal objects, since people use the opportunity to transform the smoke of the family in barriers.
In Singapore, approximately 70 percent of the events covered in the 200 peak houses of the city's gold.

Rescue package of $325 million from Australia for Tasman Health
The Australian Government is on the hard conditions linked to the Rescue Package of $325 million for Tasman Health in order to ensure that the Government of the State cannot disappear the money.
The Federal Health Minister Tanya Pluberse has announced that the Commonwealth will take actions in order to address a crises caused by an old population of the island, a higher quota to chronic diseases and system restrictions.
The funding for a period of four years was decided after government advertisements with the independent Tasman Member Andrew Wilkie.
“The Government has disappeared an emergency package, which is in our view of the unique challenges of which the State looks against,” said adults today.
The 325 million dollar package includes 31 million dollars Support for election services.
Additional 2600 operations, including orthoped attacks and treatments because of green Star, should be removed residues.
Furthermore, there are money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston, better care for statistics, factory training, psychological health services and the establishment of a system for electronic health data in local hospitals.
“It is the best opportunity to improve the health system of Tasman,” said Tanya Pluberse.
The Minister was a close report and competence obligation of the Tasman Government.
The Federal State must maintain the current funding level in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth and report monthly where the additional money were issued.
A third-party Commission will be established and ensured that the State of Health provides as effective and efficient as possible.
As Wilkie stated today, the $325 million would only take little use if “they are not involved from real reforms that bring the public tax health system to a more sustainable course.”
Without regard to this, he commend the Government that she had reacted to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the First Minister of May.
“I am sure that federal aids will make a great contribution to the public health system of the US State from the concern list” said Wilkie.
In accordance with the Government of the Federal State, these election services will be limited to the recent sets.
However, the health policy speaker of the opposition at Federal level, Peter Dutton, is the view that today announcement is only a ‘foster solution’.
“Therefore we are in this situation because the Labour Government has disappeared $430 million from the health system”, he said with ABC TV.
It can't be that a State government will take a half billion dollars from the system and cut the Commonwealth 300 million and then make it as well as the good news.
Dutton called for morebers to ensure that not one dollar of the rescue package for additional bureaucracy will be issued.

Syria has destroyed its possibility for the production of chemical weapons, a monitoring group
Syria has destroyed important installations for the production of chemical weapons and gasmoniation, the global monitoring group for chemical weapons on Thursday, while in the north of the country, it came to severe cohesions near one of the locations where they are mobilized meritly gifted substances.
On Thursday, a syrical activity group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the citizen war just three years ago.
The announcement of the Organization for Chemical Weapon Prohibition (OPCW) came a day before the date
1 November, which had established Damascus in Den Haag in order to destroy all the facilities for the production of chemical weapons or to make "inoperable", including all machines for the mix of chemicals in Gift gas and the full of Munition.
The end of this progress, which is based on the first degree of the destruction, is an important milestone of a ambitious period, which is designed to destroy all Syrian chemicals to mid- 2014.
The destruction of the institutions means that Syria cannot produce new chemical weapons more.
Damascus must still begin to destroy existing weapons and equipment.
As a result, there are approximately 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country, including the gas and the neurven gas Sarin.
The announcement occurred in a Thursday-to-day war at the Safira city by experts say that there is a production institution for chemical weapons and campaigns, such as the Syrian observer office of human rights in Britain.
The active group who followed the number of dead dead on Thursday, 120.296 people died by a network of actives in Syria.
They are 61.067 civilians, including 6.365 children.
On the pages of the Government, 29.954 of them were the army of President Bashar Assad, 18.678 government friendly arms and 187 libanaic Hisbollah migrants.
Anyway, under the dead, 2.202 democrated military data and 5.375 wars of the opposition, many of them.
On 25 July, the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000.
This number has not been updated until now.
The conflict has driven about two million people to flee from the country.
Asads troops fight in Safira for weeks against the rebels of which many links with al-Qaida groups have.
The observation office said that it was given on Thursday losses on two sides, but no details were called.
The fights underline the risk of the chemicals of chemical weapons, because their mission to release Syrian from his donated arms is a race against the time in the middle of a busy citizen war.
According to the OPCW, which cooperated closely with the United Nations, the team “the team is convinced that it has been seen all of the important production and/or compliance institutions referred to in Syria and has experienced their destruction”.
Therefore, “no further inspections” planned since now.
At the beginning of the week, the inspectors explained that they would have completed the first round of the reviews and visited 21 of 23 of the places specified by Damascus.
The inspectors said that security concerns were not possible to visit two institutions.
On Thursday, the OPWC, which were two positions in accordance with the syrical exhibition, “and the existing objects of the Chemical Weapon Programme are placed to others referred to inspired.”
It was not immediately clear whether the place in Safira was one of the two institutions that could not visit OPCW inspectors.
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPWC next month.
“I'm led to the happiness and the courage that you've all at the fulfilment of the most necessary mission that have been made by this organization," Ahmed Uzumcu said, the Director-General of the Monitoring Organization, published in a comment by OPCW.
Since three years, the Sunnite Muslim Rebellions in this citizen war against the Assad Government and its security forces, which have been encountered by many members of the Alavians, have been deployed by the social islam.
With regard to further developments, the head of the observation group said that Rami Abdurahman had given a strong explosion in a air defence institution in the Syrian Coast Province Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is not known, he explained.
Rail on judgment for Bomben Leaders of Bali
In 2002, 202 people who have come to the bomb plan in Bali, reacted the sentence for the last complaint who had been sentenced before the court, since Omar Patek had to be killed by the view of their fair.
Patek, who had been at the flight about ten years as one of the most expensed people in South East, was condemned yesterday for his role when the building of plot bodies for the bomb attack to a Haft Street of 20 years.
He could be released after 15 years.
The 45-year-old murder of the mass murder was found by the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist quarter of Kuta, with 202 people, including 88 Australians, and many more.
An offence was also conducted in a series of terroristism-related points, with a flood of creatures on churches in Indonesia to sanctuary in 2000.
The Government's administration had requested a long-term defence, even if she had asked for the man who was called as a master building of bombs as a demolition man, the death traffic could be called.
The decision has revealed horror memories at June, a mother of Perth, who has lost her 39 years old shotsman Jane and Jenny in the Packet and his co-convergents for almost ten years ago.
She said to fight with dreams, Patek had to be condemned to death.
I really mean he should follow the other kitchen's footballs.
“It should be set before a shipment command”, said the Courts against AAP.
I have to live every day that I won't get any other kitchen and I will never see my daughters again.
The Sari Club was equal to the earth, just after October 12, 2002, a huge bom exploded in a small laster that was partained before the night club.
Peter Hughes was in the Paddy's Bar, where only 20 seconds a self-mortal center had exploded a rucksack filled with spermsack.
He fell a month after the attack in the coma and the "slab" three times while he walked on a lifestyle system.
Hughes said that Patek had the same shocksal as the three other members of the terrorist Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bathroom and were appointed four years ago.
Actually, this type should get the deathstrafe before all others.
Let them live – no, there is no reason to let him live.
Becoming 20 years after he killed 202 people and abounded many hundreds, it's not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali Bomber who stood before the court.
He took a decade of the festival, but finally, in the Pakistan city Abbottabad in January 2011, where US Street forces had killed the previous al-Qaida-Chef Osama bin Laden four months later.
During the negotiation, a FBI Agency stated that secret services reports had made the evidence that Patek had been patent in Pakistan to meet my load with the goal to rebuilt the connection between Southostasiatic terrorist groups and al-Qaida.
“He didn't stand up,” said the Court.
Until shortly, he didn’t show a reverence for how much he had added to other people.
The sentence occurred before the tenth year of the attack in this year, which began with memory feasts in Bali and Australia.
“It will give many dreams this year” said Courtes.
Patek can be sentenced against his sentence.
FAA: Airports can now use electronic devices in aircraft (or no mobile talking)
Airports are now able to use their electronic devices for reading, jobs, games, music and to hear the view of films, but not to call the mobile, so the new directives issued on Thursday by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, the passengers should not expect that these amendments will be implemented immediately.
As soon as they would be implemented, depending on the relevant air society, the FAA worker said Michael Huerta at a press conference.
Airlines should demonstrate that aircrafts are in line with the new directives and that they have updated the training books of the staff and the rules for the transfer of devices in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA explained that they have already received plans from some airlines that want to build the use of transparent electronic devices in aircraft.
These airlines were also Delta and JetBlue.
“After the state of the plan, we could soon approve the extended use of electronic devices”, the FAAA has known.
Currently passports, tablets and other devices need to be disabled when the airports are closed.
You can restart them once the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain has green light.
When entering into the country airport, the aircraft must re-enable the aircraft and cannot start again before the airport is landed.
According to the new Directives, airlines whose aircrafts were secure against electronic disorders could allow their passengers to use the devices in starting, landing and on the rollfeld.
Most new transport flights and other flowers that have been covered for the use of Wi-Fi higher levels should be in line with the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Officer, welcomed the changes.
“If the new regulation is safely implemented, and we work closely with the air society – we will benefit both of it”, commented.
We are honestly sorry to feel aware of this issue.
However, Internet connections continued to prevent the survival, exchange of emails, text messages or download of data under three kilometers, the Authority explained.
Passagiers are requested to make smartphones, tablets and other devices in the air mode.
So, there is still no more “words with Friends” the Srabble like online game that the player Alec Baldwin 2011 played on his smartphone when he had to leave a Jet of American Airlines because he refused to disable the device while the airport was divided at the airport.
And harder devices such as laptops must also continue to be stolen, since there is a risk of rupting if they flow through the kabine.
Mobile talks during flights are also prohibited.
The regulatory competence for telephone competence is not at the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
FAA may be prohibited for certain electronic devices when starting and landing.
Last month, Mark Rosenker said by the Authority of Transport Safety National Safety Board, security experts for national transport questions at CBS News, mobiles would still be considered as risk.
“Handy is really a problem, not only because they could cause potential storms in navigation devices, but because we know that the CFC can cause the transition from the air also," Rosenker.
A consultation committee of the sector called by the FAAA to investigate the subject last month recommended that the Government allows a broader use of personal electronic devices.
In the past few years, pressure has increased the FAA to decrease restrictions for use.
Critics like the democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri are the view that there is no valid security reasons for the prohibition.
The restrictions are also to be more difficult because the use of devices has become generally sensitive.
In some studies, the speech that forgets or ignored to a third of the passagiers to the removal of the device.
The FAA began in 1966 to reduce the use of electronic devices by aircraft, after reports on the restructuring of navigation and communication devices by passagiers, UKW-Radios, which had been known at the latest time.
New aircraft are weitaus dependent on electric systems as previous generations of aircraft, but they are also built and the FAAA authorised that they do nothing with electronic interferences.
Airlines offer passagiers for several years to Wi-Fi when the airline is reached.
The drivers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also improperly contrary to interferences.
The overall majority of passenger flights should be appropriate for the increased use of electronic devices according to the new directives, Huerta said.
The present electronic devices are generally significantly less functionality than previous generations.
For example, E-Retreat is only a minimum radiation if you are killed.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transfer values are increased.
For a lockering of the restrictions for device use by passagiers, Amazon.com counts.
2011 firm workers played a passenger flight of full childle e-retreat and made a test flight to produce problems but could not find.
Members of the FAA Consultation Committee are extremely mixed feelings about the risk of use of devices.
Douglas Kidd by Passagier National Association of Airline Passengers said he was thinking that the damage of the devices is true, even though the risk is minimum.
Other members of the Committee said that it was only aunded reports of pilots that speak to the air systems by the devices and most of them were very old.
However, the Committee recommended that the FAAA allows pilots to be allowed in the countryside of instruments under bad views to deactivate the devices by passagiers.
A group of the travel sector welcomed the changes and described it as a comprehensive adjustment for travellers that would be ultimately equipped with technology today.
“We are glad that FAAA recognizes that a acceptable passagier experience is not in relation to security”, said Roger Dow, CEO of the United States Travel Association.
For the airport service of the North Sea-Bohr Island, the birds are recovered
One by aircraft service to the coast of volcanic birds, which was found on a North Sea-Bohr Island, was retained into the nature.
The water wheel was lowered in the last month with a pitcher to Aberdeen, where it was embedded by the SPCA skitical animal protection organization in their rescue center in Alloa.
Colin Seddon, head of the center, said: “This water rail was likely a wind of the north of Europe, which was stopped by the strong wind over the north sea.”
Apparently, the earliest bird flighted on the Bohr Island.
He added: “He couldn't continue, therefore we have been contacted with the help.”
At their release, the water wheel was retained and healed.
Is Elite ready to do business with Britains?
The Business for Britain was initiated in April to bring the economy to a table and to define what those who want to ensure in Britain's welfare and work to change our relations with the EU.
To this end, we have given the biggest and comprehensive survey to the British economic directors and asked them what they think about the British, the economy and the EU.
YouGov consulted about 1,000 leaders from the economy, which form about the UK's sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will be surprised.
We found that the overall majority of enterprises are exported outside Europe and focused on countries that are modernising and growing while the countries in the EU are wandering.
They wish to promote new trade connections with countries such as China, India and Brazil, instead of maintaining the long and enhanced process to reform EU objective institutions.
As regards certain legally regulated topics – from cards to product legislation – the majority of the economic directors of the view that the controls of these key competences should be repealed to Western Minister.
It has been generally unfriendly on the internal market, as the costs of Brussels regulations would be overcome to be part of the European trade zone – even 40 percent of the large enterprises are to be traditionally the most friendly of Europe.
Finally, and it says most likely, our discussion of economic leaders showed that a significant majority would like to be a course in the direction of the Agreement and not on the policy of trade.
This knowledge that is found in the enterprises of all sizes and leading concerts shows that the economy is on a “intensive change” that brings the heat of trade to Britain.
It is a lot – a change of the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead at 16 percent to a change of views in favour of the remaining in the EU.
The Prime Minister should have no doubts: this survey shows that the British economy is under its plan for the re-reaching of the British conditions for the EU membership.
It also shows that the enterprises of a new treatment are a significant disagreement of the powers relations to Britain.
A better goal for the British economy is possible and in increasingly necessary after the euro area is now moved towards an economic and fishing calendar.
The priorities should be in the United Kingdom's majority jobs and growth, as our survey shows what means an increased attention to enterprises on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach for regulations.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom called Pipeline in Bulgaria as the start of a new Gasära
The starting of the South Stream Pipeline in Bulgaria was the start of one of the largest European Energy Projects, the Gazprom stand.
“The present event is a millstone: the construction work in the South Stream Gaspipeline, the largest and important project in Europe,” said the President of Gazprom, Alexei Miller, on Thursday.

Bulgarian consumers receive Gas from South Stream prices when the whole project is running in 2015.
According to Gazprom, the construction work in other subordinate countries will begin at the end of the planned road.
The pipeline is designed on an annual capacity of 62.3 billion kitchen meters of gas.

Listening to the King Commission: Two YMCA employees have acted with the accused of Jonathan Lord for sexual delicts
Two YMCA workers from New South Wales (NSW) were accused because of sexual disappearances related to children, before 2011, prejudices against children, Jonathan Lord from Caringbah were received, as the King Commission has learned the sexual abuse of children.
However, in the opening declaration before the Commission, the YMCA had declared that it had never been “never had ever been done in the organization with an case of sexual abuse of children”.
Managing Director Phillip Hare was asked by a case in which an YMCA employer was accused because of children's pornography, and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall was condemned by his infringement of children.
Hare said Gail Furness, one of the Commission assisting lawyers that he knew of the first case but didn't know the second.
He agreed that the opening declaration of the YMCA against the Commission was not yet found in the signing that “the YMCA has given external reviews in which the YMCA was recognized as a pre-relevant for children security.”
The evidence before the Commission showed more that the MECA was informed that he had received the second-ninth assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities (Auditors) in August of the year.
Hare, who started with 21 YMCA, introduced the business guidance to “depart from me” in the position of the Lord and not assured that employees had been a clear complaint against the Directives on the safety of children.
Lord was the beginning of the year because of the sixth year, 12 boys were condemned during its two-year work for the MICA.
He was judged at least six years of prison.
However, it is the fact that the YMCA had a cultural problem that the employer had stopped to report the deficiencies of the Lord in relation to the security of children.
The employers said they had observed disappearances, among others that the Lord was alone with children, she was in private as a babysitter, let her sit on her sweet, told one that he loved it, and the children played with his phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose master was and who had asked for a child protection, because she was concerned for his behaviour, said that the Children's minister Jacqui Barnat, who was the privilege Lord in YMCA Caringbah, was “the most unfair and the most time.”
The manager explained that he would not accept delays from employees, since they would not have trusted to substitute their subsequent message.
Nevertheless, he said that, mostly, his friendship with the Lord imprisoned their complaints, because they had not reported him.
Hare explained that he had reported its opinion that the lection to take the organization from the “Jonathan-Lord Swish” case, “not the messenger” by the employees, and the term has been authorized to him.
Hare said that the decision that the employee to sign the secret licenses shortly after receipt of the accused was taken by the Child Director of YMCA, Liam Whiteley.
He said that a contamination of the evidence should be prevented, but what is “augmentable” and badly used.
The MICA NNW was when Jonathan Lord was busy between 2009 and 2011, no safe organization had been for children, professor Stephen Kleinbone by the Greffith University, experts for sexual child consumption, the Commission.
He explained that there were “related problems” in setting, checking, processing, training and monitoring of employees.
The hearing was transferred until 20 December.
Tony Blair explained that he would use the opportunity to return as a British Prime Minister – but he smile that a comeback is likely unbelievable.

On the question whether he would like to return to the Office of the Prime Minister, Blair of London was discussed with the words: "Yes, certainly, but it is unbelievable that this happens, so..."
When the horses were kidnapped in sharps in Cardiff to cut the horse of the year, they knew that a hard competitive camp was prevailed.
But no one was prepared on the three old Fenton Kirkland.
The knirps, not even in the child garden and had done his first steps before a few months ago, and his Shetland-Pony Toffee sought locker through the three rounds and took the first price – while they left 30 adults behind.
The unrealised couple, both equal, was due to their attraction, behaviour and style at the annual competition which was organized by Sunny Bank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff.
At his attempt in competitiveness against men and women with elegant melons, he had put his technicians into a fresh wind and brought the two years of an old toffee through the Ring.
Fenton was assembled by the jury for his natural ability during the transition with the pony that was far over his age.
And Toffee received Best notes for his presence and his personality.
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and felt every day with the Shetland-Pony.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, “Fenton and Toffee are a great pleasure.”
They had to come to the whole part of the partners and have gone with gold and rosette from the place.
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with Toffee, and we were all feelings when he won.
Full foreigners in the Arena kept him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The young boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows the tante Sharon Howells Tante for over ten years.
Howells said: “This whole public was electricized and all have been clothed and clothed.”
He turned to Sand the whole length of the Arena and even though he was so low, he worked pantatic work.
Fenton is crazy to animals – he loves horses, tractors and farmers and has two knees for which he cares.
As he has been started, it will not take long until he is on the “Paper of the year” – and I'm sure he's going to get fine.
One speaker of the yearly horse view said: “Fenton is first three, but he knows how he must walk with his pony.”
They're a great team together.
The jury evaluated Fenton and Toffee then, as they had been well slaughtered and presented in the main direction.
They looked at a good cooperation between Pony and leaders – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in Ring.
I'm sure Frontons' sweet clothing has made their part to make it really perfect for understanding.
Chinese newspaper should be reformed after calling
A Chinese newspaper requested to be reformed on the title page for the release of a reporter who was accused by the disappearance, has explained a press regulator.
The New Express in Guangzhou was printed a rare public call for release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But in the television, Chen later provided that he was accepted by Technology screens to put reports on a partial company.
The new expression of an “comprehensive correction” will now be understood, and the regulation authority stated.
The “Recertation Regulation” was held by the Authority for Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television in Guangdong.
Preliminary statements show that the New Express, listed at the Yangcheng Eventing News Group, published several unrelated reports on the buildinglion company between September 2012 and August 2013.
“The editorial management of the New Express was unordinated”, the Regulatory Authority noted in a statement.
She said it was decided to “a administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and to remove him his reporting license.”
In addition, “the Yangcheng Eventing News Group has been advised to provide a complete rectification of the new expression and recommended to submit the relevant responsibilities to the New Express and to check immediately the leading team of the New Expression”.
Chen had written several articles for the New Express, in which he reported on a producer of building machines named Zoomlion.
After he was arrested, the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title site and left his journalist work.
Nevertheless, Chen took place in the public publication of false reports against payment.
“In this case, I have defended Zoomlion as well as all the newsgroups and their ability to gain the confidence of the public”, he explained against the CCTV's messager.
I did it first because I was out of money and peace.
I was clear that I did wrong.
At the end of Chens excuse, the New Express published an excuse on the title page and explained that it was vowed to verify the reports correctly.
Various recognized complaints have recently deleted complaints in the television.
The experts say that complaints are still routinely dismissed, notwithstanding a change of legislation in the beginning of the year in which the authorities have been prohibited to be accused of themselves.

One of the most raffined tunnels for the drug wheel between the US and Mexico, who was completely equipped with lighting, lighting and electric train equipment, has now been discovered.
The United States Authorities described the 120 times 90 centimeters average tunnels as one of the most expensive passagies they ever found.
The tunnel, which has a length of six football fields in the Zickzackmust, is connected to the nearby Tijuana, Mexico, and San Diego, USA.
In the area there are unrecoverable packs that makes easier to hide drugs with drugs.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could not be recognized, the authorities explained.
In the discovery of the tunnel, eight tonnes of Marihuana and 148 kilograms of Kokain are secure, so the appointments of the Court.
Three men who worked as a driver, were accurated by the ownership and the intended sale of Marihuana and Kokain.
You have been in a decreased punishment of prisons between ten years and life.
In Nogales, Arizona, smuggler sets on a extensive underground network of removal channels.
The tunnel is the eighth big passover which was discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the most tunnels have been discovered after the seahuana winter in Central Mexixy in October, which shows the drug card before the challenge, as they can quickly bring their product to consumers.

Veganism is submitted to the Vegetarism according to the Lexica, but different from this, however, in a significant way.
Since the Vegetarians allow the defence of sahnetors, ice or a powerful husband, these disappearances are not on the food card of a veganer.
Meat, chains, ei, besides the sight of meat and fish, the veganer is allowed to disappear all animal products.
What remains, you may ask, but in close considering, the vegan food world has been deemed to be a significant rate of income.
"Brot surveys are very loved," says Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the grass reform house, which provides a number of special products for Veganer.
Reuben Proctor also please visit the load in the Domgasse.
Since 13 years the recent new countries vegan, in Lampertheim he found everything he needs to live. " 1997 I put my food around and became Vegetarier."
For the centuries, then the next step and I became Veganer.
"The conviction came not only because of food, but on the basis of the chocolate," says Proctor, the artist's leather's normal leather.
He recognized that there was also in other general terms without animal products.
In the first line, vegan is a Ethiopian.
"I don't want the animals to die for me," the Proctor says the maximum of the vegans who strive to the whole consumption.
The Veganer quickly discovered new products, which increased the damage.
"It's a double bus," says Proctor today, "because Vegan is not aware, no axes, but it's a scale." The idea that you can reduce the selection to food options, the Proctor leads to the power of the usuality.
And exactly these conditions, some still have become so goodly combined attempt.
"The search factor is a very important factor that allows many rapidly, similar to the rain," Proctor is a comparison.
And say, "Take those who are defined are not fitting on the animal."
Often, it's the weight or the type of preparation that makes the smoke.
"It can also produce the same effect," means the Veganer.
For example, Proctor offers Auberginen, Champignons and also a couple of veganworsts.
He considers a balanced, widely widely nutrition, where it should also be delayed.
Of course, you want to have something between the dreams, that's legal.
"It must hurt, but it is not only to reduce animal food," says Proctor.
Health damage to the extinctions, a further widely widespread adoption, he did not have taken it.
The conversion had a positive aspect for me.
I don't take an elderly cholesterin and have an increased vitaminal.
There are high-quality assets that are exclusively vegan.
"My blood values are best, I'll make sure often," Proctor defended.
In particular before the lack of vitamin B12, many Vegansimus criteria warn.
"The animals are approximately harvested, instead of grassing in the weeds, it is frankly whether in the meat you buy in the coals that Vitamin-B12's part is high", is Proctor.
For Veganer, it will also be able to take the coenzym in form of tablets.
"My B12 value is okay," he said.
Wear ways, Proctor should not go for food supply.
Finally, there are basic food in all and every super market in the middle of sojamilch and other products.
Everything I need, I'll find place.
I'll just buy something special.
"Most people consider that only the preparatory products are sweet, but it is also used in "all" preparatory products known as well."
Besides the preparation of vegan courts, weaker and less time-related as well as accepted.
"In the housekast there's a lot to discover, with a few small kitchens, you can be good if not partly get better results," says the Proctor.
Margarine instead of Butter, some more backpulver and coal acid instead of Ei, could also bring his vegan powders to the stain.
Family feasts the Veganer gives a new root.
This has dynamic when you buy together, this has a new place value.
"The situations that can understand it are so different as the people themselves", says Proctor.
Of course, Skipsis has already been brought to him.
You don't swear my food anymore?
"I'm gonna feel bad now because I'm drinking milk?" - for such questions, you should act as Veganer's feeling with fingerprints.
"I don't disappear people, I'm a part of this society," Proctor doesn't want an enslaved fresh.
And more precisely, the whole world appears not as the veganfremd - and the Veganer does not accept as limited every day.
Fst Food is also allowed.
It's all around!
"Much of the Queens offer a fabel, or also a vegetary yufka," says Proctor.
In a pizza he looks at passenger lines, or is also designed a pizza without a kitchen, all a question of the nature.
The restaurants are so slow on it.
"When I started to join you Vegan, everything was far more difficult, the Neusal countries can make a development complete: "You need to talk to people to take care of them."
"When sufficient questions come, they may be denied to add the food card," he hopes.
Vegane restaurants develop themselves, such as the combustion in Mannheim or the coffee bird free.
Proctor says that other restaurants also have a vegan court on the food card.
For the reason, vegan judges are taken for all of them.
Everyone can eat it, so they are exactly the contraction of exclusive.
"Felds are exclusive, in the most real sense of the word, because they are closed others," the Proctor sets.
"When you want to avoid food candles, the Veganism is a safe way to make the greatest part of the front," says the Proctor.
The purchase of vegan products could but be something difficult to start.
In particular, when you learn to understand that animal additive materials can also contain in terms of animals as color gloves, it seems to leave the eathic follow-up in so many crowds and cases of soul.
It is not only why Rauben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book: "Veganissimo - animal contents and their alternatives" explains the many materials that are used for food but also for cleaning products.
"After and after the development of a scanner view, you know what signs and logos you have to look at "It is sometimes better to do small steps than to stay or to be stolen," is a white proctor.
Veganism, he is a important moral fingerprint that offers awareness.
Maybe he is not completely able to make it possible, but at least he can teach the consumers to ask his traditions critically.

Budget for foreign real estate owner against London's Speculation Table
The Ministry of Finance has provisorly calculated the CGT measures, but it is still waiting for the final decision of Schatzcanzler George Osborne, which has reduced a total tax of 7% of apartments, over two million per cent and annual costs for buyers, apartments as a company and not as individual persons.
Today, the income from the steel tax for residence in the west ministry and Kensington & Chelsea, which are present in 2012/13, at 708 million Pfunds, which were gathered for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Northwest, Northwest, Yorkshire and the region of Humber.
Cook said: “Base the increase in steel taxes on high price apartments and the establishment of the related legislation against an infringement, you may have difficult to say that high-quality realities are too low, notwithstanding the impact of the Community tax system.”
“In this step, some foreign investors could make the purchase of real estates in London, or have stopped their owners,” he added.
The first type of real estate – the first five to ten percent of the apartment market to price – in the well-want South Western beach, which has extended from Fulham to Wimbledon, has defended the record value of 11.8% in the last year.
The prices in Central London have increased an annual growth of 5,6%, but a higher "International market" overlooked on which the southwest of the city, the Northern (7.4%) and the eastern (6.5%) had been an extension of Savills.
Scientists could throw more light on what is related to the weakness of a dog with his shadow.
Early research showed that happy dogs with the swine were wearing more right (from the skin) while it was the left side in nervous dogs.
But now scientists say that other dogs can make these subtle differences and react to it.
Prof. Georgio Vallortigara, a new scientist of the University Trint, said: “They are well known that the left and right brain seals different to the stimuli, making positive or negative emotions.”
Here, we've tried to see this at other specimen.
He also noted that, in the case of dogs, the right brain heads were responsible for the movement of the left side, and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings.
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the widespreads of their artgenois, researchers watched the animals while these films attained to other dogs.
They make the heart frequency of the birds and analyzed the behaviour.
We probably will soon understand why the weak turns into one, even if it moves to the other direction
Prof. Vallortigara said: “We have shown the dog films with dogs – either a natural relieve or a silhouette to eliminate other unfortunate aspects, so we could control the weak movement more to the left or right."
When the animals saw, as an elderly unprinted dog had moved the weak right (with the perspective of the sweet dog), they remained fully relaxed.
But the weakness was in front to the left (after the perspective of the dog who was hungry), so the frequency of the heart grew up, and they looked unfortunately.
According to Professor Vallortigara, the dogs are not clearly communicated with each other by these movements.
He is more convinced that dogs had learned from experience in which movements they should take care of and when not.
He said: “If you have different meetings with other dogs and wearing with the weak in a direction with friendly behaviour and the right side produces a less friendly behaviour, then react on the basis of these experiences."
The researchers say that the knowledge of dog owners, animals and trainers could help better understanding of the emotions of their animal.
John Bradshaw, experts for dog retention and gaststipendiat at the Faculty for Tier Heats of the University of Bristol, explained that this was not the first study which was studied whether the left and the right of the dogs was important.
Last year, a team of the University of Lincoln found that dogs driving the head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and on the right, if it is a satisfactory dog.
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada, he stated: “They go to a roboter sand if they are, the left and not the right, instead of being unrealised, exactly different than in the Italian study.”
According to his explanation, the differences could therefore lead that dogs in the various studies could not interpret the animals in the films or the robothudes as dogs.
He explained how dogs react real dogs.
“What there are considerable charges for many different sugars that the two brain hairs are used for different purposes, but many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs do not be excluded," says Bradshaw.
Since their behaviour is easy to describe, it will probably not take a long time until we understand, why the weak is sometimes in one, sometimes moved into another direction.

Papst Franciskus is known in February to the first cardinal
Papst Franziskos is called the new cardinal of the Catholic Church on 22 February, as Vatikan knew on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest clerical in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also to choose a Pope, so the French cure will be known to the first group of men who will eventually be involved in the election of his followers.
Now there are 201 cardinals.
However, a cardinal that has reached a 80-year-old can not be part of the papa selection, which is a group of 120 “electioned cardinals”.
In a declaration reported by the message, the Father nețțao Lombardi, a speaker of the Vatican, will be held a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremonie stopped for the nomination of the new cardinals, which is also known as the consistorium.
“Papst Franziskus decided to be known before his decision to introduce the Consistorium in February, so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from all the world may be planned," said Lombardi.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of electioned cardinals will probably be recorded until February.
He explained that a dad is usually renovating so many cardinals as needed, so that the number of the electioned cardinals reimported up 120, and so many cardinals more than 80 as he wanted.
The consistorium in the next year is therefore important because it was the first since the election of Franziskus in March, so Valero.
It is now a certain overwhelming of Europe and in particular Italy.
“It will be interested to see whether the new cardinal cardinal will be recognized from the rest of the world to restore the balance” he said.
Forty percent of the Catholics live in South America, but they only have a small number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first ones who are called since the education of the Cardinal Council founded by French cure, a group of eight cardinals from the world that have the order to find opportunities for reforming the Church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now France has chosen these eight cardinals that should help him," said Valero.
He explained that it is possible, that Franceskus are the cardinals for the Council.
But until now we were not in this way – that's all new.
Valero said that typically the bushes from the large places in the cardinals would be called, but steady French cuss “all surprises – so we don't know whom he is called”.
GM calls new pickup drivers in the United States to repair the seat leather
General Motors calls knapp 19.000 of its new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra-Pickup tricks with building 2014 to address a problem with the manually calculable seat lens, so a communication of the US-American regulation Authority for vehicle security on Friday.
In some of the cars, there can be a defect in the mechanism for the repair of the pre-session seats.
For this reason, they do not comply the federal directives for vehicle security in heads.
“If from downwards on the vehicle it is possible that the head support cannot be protected, so there is an increased risk of abuse”, the message was to read on the website of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).
The revoked models were produced between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM-Trucks started in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading US American automobile producer since the insolvente restructuring of 2009.
GM informed the car owner in the first October chamber of the defect.
The NHTSA was unable to verify the notification written by the 16th Government of Shutdowns, which was negative to car sales in October.
The sale of Silverado and Sierra Tricks renewed for the 2014 model was increased in the first ten months of the year by 20 per cent.
In October, GM was sold 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra-Pickup tricks.
The GM action increased at the New York Bank of 1,4 percent to 37.47 US dollar on Friday afternoon.
Cruising a Obama elector
I have chosen President Obama twice in hope that change may be possible
He said that Obama has understood loyal efforts to be made by the blockadetics of the Republicians
The blocking policy does not appeal the site problems of Obamacare, drug attacks
Obamas Memesers over the election camp of 2008 have been a hard memory of what could be possible
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student in the second year in Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a terrible traurious book now.
It is a book of which I believed, it would surround me during the second harmful year of my medical study and give me hope again.
It is called "The Audacity to Win" (the Audacity to Win) and entrusted the Memiers Barack Obamas to the 2008 Presidency selection.
When I ended with my patients’ inscriptions and went to bed, the book brings me back in a time when the policy had inspired millions and one speech could raise the mom.
The election was held to a earthquake and newshearters in order to lead the historical importance of this hour.
My class rooms weep before joy, and my parents gathered all the news they could find.
A young team of Visionary was on the way in the white house and the nation was ready to change.
As soon as Obama was changed to the office, he had 82 % acceptable values.
And then I closed the book.
Re-enable to this present is a bad watch, like if you get out of a dream.
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a pretty memory of harmful ideas.
In the years since I first sent my voice, it has actually changed something.
But it's nothing I could imagine.
I recognize the great and multilateral things that Obama has reached, from the adoption of the Omordable Care Care Law for hospital insurance until the military resort from Iraq, the end of the disappearance of Homosexuality in the army and death of Osama bin Laden.
I also believe that the partial political block-detactics has taken over many efforts that our nation should be forwarded: immigration reform, public option for hospital insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay to call for some.
However, after I have defended the obama government against colleagues and acknowledges, I have made my statement at the end.
I have reached a point of political disappearance.
The republic blocking policy cannot explain why the votes of foreign homes are allowed or the death of unschulded children through drugs in overseas.
It is unable to explain why the National Security Agency collects data on private lives of Americans and why the Wisstlevels are anticipered that opens the State abuse.
It is not possible to explain why the lawyer al-Awlaki, a US-American Stateist, has been killed without procedures, nor therefore the public financing and expenditure limits will be passed during the presidency elections.
It does not justify the results of a report that means the efforts of the white house to relax the media are the “aggressive ... since Nixon government”.
And at least it cannot be excused by the incapacity to disappear a simple website for more than three years since the adoption of the Abordable Care Act.
I don't know if it's what I'd have to wait.
Whether I had to understand with 18 that the Government’s work could resist its previous political campaigns.
Of course, the Deputy Member is not a prerequisite course, since an opposition party and an accidental events such as the Newtown Massker is the public debate.
However, if I look at the above examples, they seem to be elected far from the government itself.
And that's most of me.
I have chosen again Obama in 2012, not because I was glad about his candidate.
With Romney, he made an incredible and ungarned alternative that he seemed to not set its directions and positions.
I had the impression, a second office time for Obama, free of the pressure of future elections, would fulfil the hope we had heard so long.
However, in the meaning of the approval values for Obama at under 45% this week the return in 2008 has become so heavy.
It looks at me after the many promises that have risen in the air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to be a serious loss against Clinton in the elections in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the electoral helpers after the decision, he told his employees to return to the course and follow the purpose of their business.
“I want us to find our knife again," he said.
We need to remember who we are.
There are five years later, Mr President, and I could not vote you more.
The views expressed in this comment are excluded by Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer confirmed that the Prime Minister Tony Abbott has interesting conflict at the parent holiday
The Milliardary and Deputy Clive Palmer says that the Prime Minister Tony Abbott focuses in an interesting conflict at his plans for the parents' vacation because his daughters are pregnant and could benefit from it.
The Mountain Magnate, who is in a jurisdiction on the payment of $6 million at CO2 scene, stated the argument when he wanted to know whether he was in a conflict.
The United Party could control up to four votes in the senate which are important for decisions whether the CO2 and mountain construction taxes are crashed.
But Palmer stated that only Ministers of Interest Conflicts could have, and the daughters of Abbott would benefit personally from the laws.
“ It is in a great interesting conflict when it goes for paid parents’ vacation, because when one of his daughters is married, he has a direct interest on whether she has a vacation or not, ” said Palmer.
Two months after the election, the eligible Palmer election commission explained with 53 voices for the new number officially to the winner of the Sunshine-Coast session of Fairfax.
Palmer requested a revision of the process for the stimmatic counting to go faster than these people.
Tony Abbotts daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the stimmab?
“We need a better system” he said.
Why should we not have a system where you are marked by data into a computer immediately selecting the result at 6:30 afternoon?
Palmer also criticised the use of blue certificates in the marking of the smell.
Do you use them because you can raise the results if they don't affect one?
Today, it is incredibly unbelievable to vote with Blue certificates.
The Election Committee has examined the options for an electronic choice and recently published a common legislation proposal with New York.
Palmer, 59, explained that his policy heard a international airport for the Sunshine coast and that he would take his new office 'so much serious'.
At a public office, the public service is about.
“We are stretching after no payment except the story, that is that we can serve in a critical time of this Community”, he said.
RBS suspends two departments
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two leaders from its division, so two persons confided with the situation; this is another indice that the world's authority is to take care of the measuring managers in the monetary market.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, German Bank and RBS, confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in the world's largest financial market at the 5th day of the US dollar.
The two leaders would be the first RBS employees who have been sustained in an outstanding investigation that the scandal is followed by the Libor's Internal Banks.
The Bank, which did not have commented on the requests, confirmed this month that she received information requests from the authorities.
“Our explanations go to this subject and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities” said the Bank.
Last month, the situation of closer persons added that the RBS had added the titles of e-mails and Instant messages sent by and to a previous career to the British supervision Authority, the Financial Conduct Authority.
This Handeler, Richard Usher, had left the RBS 2010, and will be assured by its current position as a European leader of the Forex-Spot chain at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, Chief of the European Spot Trading at Citi, was held in this week and Matt Gardiner, previous currency partner at Barclays and UBS, has been sustained this week at Standard Chartered.
No one of these feeds has been deleted.
To the Instant Message Group of Usher bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup, they told the situation nearer people.
UBS has known that it had taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory Authority finma that she had investigated a mobilised manager of the devise market at a series of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Authority Weko, the FCA, the US-American Justice Minister and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently engaged in anti-related banks in monetary market transactions.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also introduced internal investigations or received information requests by authorities, said to the situation confided persons.
Banks transmit Instant Messages and Emails from several years to search for cases of fault.
The reports on these investigations have been made by the guests in a field of deployment, which has been part of one of the most profitable of the trading banks, but this year was under pressure because low voluntary in monetary currencies limited the opportunities for experts.
Some bankers have tried to play the business and said that it is nearly impossible to manipulate the extensive and high-grade liquid devise market, but leaders are thinking that this is not indeed true.
A leading leader noted that, despite the huge daily volume in the devise trade, the grouping of liquidity between the various trade platforms and the increased use of their own platforms by banks is that “the market can already affect very low tickets”.
The message came out the same day as Credit Suisse knew, she announced a sharer of her London Exchange Traded Fund Office after the end of the year he caused a loss of six million dollars.
The Bank immediately informed the competent authorities and worked together with them.
“We are sure that the hair has been treated alone and that the case is involved”, Credit Suisse said.
Increase the building row on the beachle-ground
A group of the citizens 'Sweizer Wiese' initiative made the building saun on the beachal green area at the currency in Bad Herrenalb.
Furthermore, she broke and spread the footway, it means in a press communication.
The planned cover of the disappeared house in the back part of the ground was not allowed from security reasons because the landscape was driving.
Alfred Abel, who has now managed the foundation, had promised the departure of his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI.
The IB's action was transparent with the message "We've been added to it".
However, the 20 members of the citizen's initiative was not yet in their action.
Their motto on the great plact called "We are against Bauruinen."
This would like to refer to the risk of more ruins in the Swiss Queen – to create the river project a day.
In the conversation with many passors before the "Bauhouse", some citizens believe that it will be more better than the achievement of the city project, although not few the same questions on the dimension of the project presented, such as the IIB.
But they are able to resign, because the city continues to leave these answers, it means the ICB.
As it was to hear, the public exemptions of the citizens are also affected.
Mai had said in the municipal Council that he feared the thermal bathroom, the population should decide to decide against the plans for a Bad and Wellness complex on the Swiss Queen.
Some of them appear so much to renew, others recommend as "pompe of impression" in the population, that is further in the press communication of the IB.
The BI thanked the expenses for the color and all helpers.
Rangnick shell for Schiris: No weaponable
So pleased Ralf Rangnick with the current Excellency of Federliga-Tabelle Director Red Bull Salzburg, the sport director of the "Bullen" of the Radslers.
"There is now a dangerous trend that Mane and Alan will be dragged into the category of swaps," he took the two openers on Thursday on a press conference in Salzburg's protection.
Gentlemen Annuals for Rangnicks Critic was yellow for man at 3:0 against Green on Sunday last, when the Senegal was a nice player to defend - which was not freely like the TV images showed.
"Every faulty decision," said Rangnick, "the Seedsrichter Harkam, "whilely demanded."
Harkam would also be able to scaling "the part" between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Greedig-Trainer Adi tenter after the party.
His German landsman defended: "It would be the same in every individual situation as Roger Schmidt."
She wants to have no contact with his colleague after the craft with the tenter.
I don't know why.
"When I am the one who was regulated," said the 46-year-old.
Besides the success, Rangnick corrected but a lobeshymne.
"Therefore there are only two words: right," he stated.
There's no lot of packing.

Frankfurter park costs must increase strong
Parks in Frankfurt could soon be more excited.
The Master Council of the City has requested today a presentation of a democracy designer Stefan Majer (Green).
After this, the parking costs are to be increased by 50 percent.
However, the prices are not to be increased, but the time of parking and parking cars will be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes.

The public transport will also be worse.
Rejoicing City: Quicking Guests
With a slight box, the Lords I of the TSV's joy City in the school hall had to come in recitals against the TG dinnations of the Swiss album.
Of course, the elephants were standing on the other website.
However, Bald showed that, even old terms, they could not fully maintain the rapid actions of the Guardians.
With the hard and placed attacks, the dinningers became extremely difficult.
They repeatedly corrected the played pockets and attacks by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz on the middle of the network, and were not on place at the block board.
Two high first saddle wines clearly expressed the concerns of the joyful urbans in all respects.
In view of this disappointed and decisive performance, then the third section was winned something slow and low to 3:0- End (25:13, 25:14, 25:22).

In the B class, the second managers of baiser sources were in the Murgtalhalle in stocks.
They offered a hardly overwhelmed two hours match.
Nervosity on both sides caused particularly mistakes and points of balance; the pressure was also due to short-term tools and in some critical sectors of games, the transferers prevented the view of possible point gains.
The TSV team of Marcus Blautto, but through the great physical use and a pleasure engagement of both teams, was made in this effectively very comparable.

The touristic goal of the Weather view is deployed in terms of the goal to receive an integrated widely growing old allmidfeld with its specific protected living space types by opening and linking to the remaining conditions.
Determined species such as rare sharps and grasps can not overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces.
They need these free connections to maintenance.
Tribukat said she wouldn't want to smile it at this place to fall a lance for the planned bioosphere area.
This planet is not only added to the current measure.
A bioospheric area also offers the opportunity to sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of the international recognition of a status, and therefore a continuous complement of the project of life as well as the achievement of the attempt for the future.
After these various performances, Representative Christph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff participated the help in groups.

Egypt has first been elected free presidents
Mohammed Mursi defers the official, but his day of triumph should not be the end of the political wars in Egypt.
The Islamist Mohammed Mursi said a “new Egypt” when he was sent out as the first elected President of the country and that the follow-up of Husni Mubarak, which was sent out 16 months before the office.
With its official introduction before the first constitutional institution, Mursi was also elected to the first islamist President of the Arab and Egyptian world's fifth State sovereignty since the currency of the Mauritius has been approximately 60 years ago.
He put the eid before the 18 black judges of the court, clothed in black roses, who had his seat on the middle of the Nile, and a former Egyptian temple.
“We strive after a better future, a new Egypt and a second Republic," said Mursi in the festival ceremonie, which lived in the State television.
“Today the Egyptian people set the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom, a real democracy and stability,” said the 60-year Mursi, a engineer who has been made up in the U.S. and a muslimbrudership member, a fundamentalist group, who has been taken over 84 years ago as an prohibited organization of each government.
100 soldiers and police officers watched the building, when Mursi was in a small car convoi shortly after 11 hours.
Only a few hundred candidates were gathered before the court to judge the new President, and in contrast to the precisive punch out of the Mubarak time, the transport was only shortly arrested so that the car convoi could overcome the usual road that bounds the city center with the southern towns.
As an uncarismatic “related” of the brotherhood has taken his personal prestige since his vineyard and a free summer, in which he was not only a candidate of the Islamists, but only all of those who wanted to bring the efforts of the resort from 2011 against the authorized mubarak.
“ Egyptians today are a civil, national, constitutional and modern state," said he in a blue approach, clothed with red crawatte muzi the judges in the wooden chamber, in which he revealed the office.
Later, Mursi went to the University of Kairo, where he had to keep his attractions.
He was officially welcomed by a army captain who played the National Hymne that he listened in notice.
The military Fieldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present.
At his arrival, he was welcomed by hundreds of people in the largest audience of the University with speakers of “The army and the people are a hand”.
In 1908, the University of Kairo created as a basis for secular education has developed in the 1970s a highburg of students.
Mursi put a symbolic eid on the Tahir Chamber, the birth place of the resurrection that led the last year to the end of the authorized domination Mubaraks, and promised to call on the precisive powers that the military Council had overlooked from the office.
However, with the disappearing of the official eid before the court, and not as usually before the Parliament, he asks the will of the military, which indicates that the power camp will continue.
Mursi's talk on the Tahir-Platz was full of dramatic popular guests.

In addition to Australian schools, average of 143 hours a year and 1 hours received in Singapur 138 hours.
Since it is no formal request to predict more time for mathematics, but it means that the comprehensive mathematic audit – combined with a stronger measurement of the Fax in Ranglisten – schools will be likely attempt to use more hours.
In the learning plan, there is more focus on “the problems of the right life”, including financial mathematics.

Along with shot, flows and dungal for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle offers free medical assistance in designed villages in Kamerun
Store Bwelle and his team every weekend to treat hundreds of patients
In the Western African country there are no many doctors but one for 50,000 people.
Listen here or with your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle belongs to the Top 10 of the “CNN Heroes of 2013”.
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the Top 10 to select him to the “CNN Hero of the Year”.
The victor will receive $250,000 to continue its extraordinary work.
21 years ago George’s Bwell looked at how his sweet father always lost the conscience and traveled to hospitals who were not available over the resources to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was disappeared in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé, the main city of Cameruns.
First, he had only a broken arm, but then it was a disappearance that spread on his brain and caused a hematom there which should affect him for the rest of his life.
“ There were no neurochirurgs in Kamerun” says Georges Bwelle.
We would have brought him out of the camera if we had the money.
Instead, Bwell years were used to join his father in overcoming clips and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy", commented Bwelle.
You can leave the house for five hours tomorrow and travel to the hospital to be the first, but it is not first.
There are many patients.
Some people die, even because they need to wait.
The situation has not changed since Bwelles' father was dead in 2002.
In Kamerun, there are only a doctor for every 50,000 people, so the world health organization.
This is the relationship in the United States with a doctor for 413 persons.
However, even if it had a doctor for them, most of them couldn’t allow the visit.
Two of five people in the country live under the poverty limit and nearly three numbers of health expenditures in the country are private.
"The only problem they have is the poverty," says Bwelle.
And the poor makes it impossible to enjoy life.
His father and so many of his countryholds leaded to see in Bwelle the decision to decide to take something to do.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteership have performed 700 free operations last year.
He became a doctor himself and worked as a farmer in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a common organization named ASCOVIME, which offers free medical care for the weeks in rural areas.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group helped about 32,000 people.
Before every Friday, he runs up to 30 people in small buses and goes with the smoothed medical equipment on the dry on the landless terrain into the villages that need help.
It doesn't always lose everything without relief.
Too more than once they had to drive the vehicles through flowers and shapes.
But when they come, they will receive as the heroes: a festival, and a dance, and the best behaviour that has to offer the place.
In these villages, medical care is really a reason for the feast and ball – with its widely laughing and free energy – it is pleased at the joyful feast there.
The team starts the next morning with the investigation of hundreds of patients.
“For travel we treat 500 people”, Bwelle.
They're coming from a surrounding of 60 kilometres around the village – and that to foot.
Each of these weekend lines offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are treated because of Malaria, Tuberculose, Foods, Diabetes, Parasits and sexually translated diseases.
Others receive browsers, painted letters or free births – a document that is required for school, but many poor families can't easily be delivered.
Last night the team leads easy operations with local deployment.
The operations usually will be placed in a school, the Council house or a apartment; after the attack, the patients stand and go to the training area to make place for the next.
The illumination for the OP and desinfection is speed by the group generator and so works and its volunteers until the early morning hours on Sunday.
It's an encouraging pensum, but the village muscles usually help to keep the team motivated.
“ They are stumbled all nights so that we can stay wake up and continue our work," says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team returns to the city, hurry, but shamefully to the work made.
The group – a mix of camera doctors and foreign medical students – has performed 700 free operations in the last year and knows that it makes a huge difference for the people they help.
A man explained that the free operation of a leather flower that he had got to allow him to re-operate.
“ This changes the future of my family," said the man.
Besides the weekends and his work as a chirurg in the hospital, Bwelle worked even nights in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, he finances 60% of its common activities, such Bwelle; the rest of private dependences.
“I don’t really know when he sleeps, ” Katie O'Malley says, who studied Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicisine and worked voluntary in Bwelles group on the second year.
He is always in the hospital or tried to make money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and hospital students such as O'Malley, who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to collect practical experiences that they would never get home.
“We can be in operations where we help to remove blood or keep the tools for Dr. Bwelle” says O'Malley.
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year.
Students pay their journey to Cameroon usually itself and often with feed health materials.
But once in Yaoundé, Bwelle transmits the shipment, transport and guidance.
"He's very uncertainly a herd," says O'Malley.
He endorses his life of this organization and his desire to help the cameramen people, does not know borders.
For Bwelle, the nail constant work is not charged.
To help others to a happy life and to fulfil a promise that he gave his father makes him great joy.
“ I am so happy when I do this work, ” says Bwelle.
And I think of my dad.
I hope he's seeing what I'm doing.
I'm doing it to bring people back to laugh and to hurt the pains.

Exceptively warned the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingways Novelle "The old man and the sea", was divided by Horst Janson on the body.
Janson himself is an old hate in his household, the showing artist.

Thus, the two are easy to be great.
It's almost like to see the flowers in the middle of the old man of which the fishing manolo speaks.
If Santiago is sitting on the throne, it's really in Janson.
Furthermore, the role of the old fisher is through and by a characteristic role that Janson is excellent.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a motive man who doesn't oppose and finally win through his knowledge and his will also win the fight against the fish.
Janson is in slight streets as an allianced maker on the pool.
He can focus on the attention of the public, so that his monologue is not a moment clean.
His efforts to put the fish finally to the surface of the water are so true that the surveys forget that the sea is only lighted water flames.
Regesseur Jens Hasselmann allows the old man to act in the boat before fisherdorf.
In the past of the instruction, he puts the active scene in the light: the tent of Santiago, the bar of the Sänger Marie-Luise Gunst, which with their lips and the honorable voice of Kuba is the feeling of life.
The four musicians play Kuba Rhythm and are also guests of the Bar.
Tourism: Increase to Romans
At approximately 120 meters length, a low water canal is received from the Roman time.
He who visits the households won't end the Dom.
The two gates are about 157 meters in the sky and make it to the second highest of the churches of Europe.
However, only few visitors who assemble the two filigran crystals say that there are also a lot of discovery among the Dom.
Rainer school is experts in cases of cool.
The service center of Cöln tourism is directly on the Dom.
The round begins very unspectacular: "We grow in the deep garage," says the school.
In the seventy-year-old years, the city officers wanted to have an auto-country city, and therefore remained from the rest of the old walls only what was not too large.
Most users of the parking house today are also abolished to the Roman oversights and only deployed their car.
But who looks more precisely, finds the Parkdeck D2 an archéological foundation disappeared by metals.
To see about five meters of high roads from hand-growing stones.
"There are the rest of the Roman city wall which was built in the second half of the first century after Christ," said the school.
Before it goes back to the daylight, the school allows the participants to throw up the top of the park even a look into a dark, 15 meters deep page.
That's the bird of the old house, unfortunately too.
The next transition station is the prectorium, and here the participants are growing down to the teeth.
We live here the office of the first powerful man north of the Alpens, the precursors of the CCAA.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The decline is for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippiensium", which means goodly German as "State of Roman law and city of the Agrippiener, founded by Chair Claudius on the place of the altar for the Caisercult".
And at the pretorium, it is the former stainless patch, the power center of the Roman Imperium at the Rhein.
From the exhibition area, a tunnel access to the Roman water canal has been obtained here at about 120 meters long.
"You can take a piece quiet over the so-called Cloaca Maxima, if you want to," open the guests.
There's still a surprise of law.
After he took the key at the box, he led the group down to a 16 meters, amazing page.
"We are now in the mix, a ritual Jewish bath," he explains.
The Jewish community built her Bad deep in the ground to come to the basic water that was unable for the ritual washings.
Today, at the underly end of the mixture, whose origin is returned to the eighth century, different water situations can be made through changed peel of the Rhein.
The mikwe will be part of an archeological area on the Council House for which the construction work should start in shorts.
Until the end of the end, there will be a few years.
Beautifully disappeared: Reinstallation of Rocker Process
A blue attack in Rockermileu is restarted after more than four years.
A process for trial murdering, dangerous corporal disasters and disappearance against two 30-year-olds has started before the countryged Frankfurt (or or).
It is involved by severe security conditions.
The complaints shot up.
They should have been active in the Rockers scene and have heard the bandids at the time.
In June 2009, the State authorities would encourage them to join and put three men into a car together with unknown compliances in Finowfurt.
All the victims were grieved, a man would almost lost his leg.
The victims must have been listed to the Concurrent Hells Angels Group.
One should be a high-range member of Berlin.
Properly there was a persecution flag with several cars.
According to the complaint, it was about rivier wars and a power-demostration.
The two complaints were sent out in the beginning of 2012.
One court speaker said that it was not possible to prove that the men were really involved in the black feast.
The machines had masks and were not recognized.
The Federal Governance Court took the sentence after the revision of the State authority and returned it to the negotiation of the countryside.
One of the complaints is currently because of another delicate in open fullness.
In particular, it was about the reconstruction of the removal purchases in this point.
As a witness, the Commissioner had been loaded at the time.
The centre of the accused and other persons who had rejected the police.
It is difficult that Rockers are almost always keeping one of them earning laws, and not advocating them.
This is also applicable for the victims.
In the first process, only one of the victims had been packed.
Staatsanwalt Stefan Golfier by the Office of State Frankfurt (Oor) said to ask that it was initiated since the last process.
For the process, eleven more days of negotiation are adopted.
The travel company does not think
The night was long, the music sounded and the stimming was good, but sometimes it goes home.
Only: In the trees of people on the driver and back, the hunger is noticed.
Of course, the one or other cocktail or sect may be responsible for it!
What is closer to go to the next driving in to digging a littleness?
I add, I'm pleased to see that if it's going to feastfood holes later.
A pair of pumps, a Cola, a guest - and then naks just from home and in bed!
However, on the homeway, the clear differences between me and other hungry disco giants are noticed.
For what is the lack that you're steadly regular to get out of the car window?
First of all the weekends, the paper carriers are thrown into road countries and parking offices.
"What?", I ask.
Does people doubt to take the thirsts with home respectable to the next museum?
It's not just so that the paper's sent the landscape.
Travel institutions have already hidden such as managing plans and solved accidents.
On what it thinks "weather society" but not, probably she doesn't even know what this word really means.
If you're in the last way, just right with several people in the car, you can know how a backbank can be seen after overfit nights: Klamots, flats and other muscles are in there.
There would be a few tastes more or less but also nix - in contrast to the road, where nobody wants to get on the most food of other rocks.
I can see the day when the cities and communities will be blown the roads - and the fatfood chambers need to ask for their shots.
