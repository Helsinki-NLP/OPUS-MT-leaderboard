München 1856: Four cards that change your view to the city
A irland-style where young people today need to be aware of.
A groep captain where you're buried for the S-Bahn Tannel.
The small farmers are the unique reason for farmers.
The former official card Münchens promotes enthusiastic stories for days.
It's nervous if the land cards are not current.
It's known everybody who had to be revealed because the car-Navi showed a green rush.
The historical landscape cards of the digital Bayern atlases, a offer of the Geoportal Bayern of the government, are all others as current - but just very closely.
Specially if you compare it with current online cards.
Then it will be clear how the cities and municipalities have changed in the Munchner Merkur region since the 19th century.
The digital Bayern applas is a flower tackle that is not equally recognized as such.
The large survey card has been developed for cities and communities more detailed cards, such as Urposition Letters.
Those included by the Bayerical measurement manager between 1810 and 1864 and the first measurement of Bayerns.
Your task officer: Napoleon.
The French Heer manager appointed Bayern since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.
Napoleon wanted a overview of the land designed and gave a topographical reception of Bayerns in order - of course to military purposes.
Even though the French troops with the peace of Luneville on 9 February 1801 finally disappeared: There were the present neighbours who created the idea of an outdoor Bayern card.
Short Max IV. Joseph continued the project, founded the "Topographic Office" as well as the Bayerian measurement manager.
The curriculum for München is of 1856 and is such as all others on the Internet of the Bayerian country library.
The comparison of older/day is the most recent city of the country.
The city has been expanded in all directions and has grown together.
An example of this is the sub-desponsor that is still relatively isolated in the 1856 card.
Sendling was 21 years after the creation of the card, so 1877, as Münchner's part.
Today, the underendling is located in the middle of the city.
The households are concentrated around 1856 during the present Plingansstraße, named by Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a manager of the resurrection of the Bayern farmers against Austria 1705.
Where the West Park is today, you can see nothing as fields - on the first view: A smaller card with dark lines and numbers appears: manually numbered flows from the so-called "upup" of which the basic tax has been issued.
Small parks there today are no farmers more - but small farmers of the "Land in the sun".
A large green area is of the north of the subsendling.
The Theresienwiese, since October 1810, was in the 19th century still a betony - and no betonwave.
On the other side of Isar, the historic card gives a view to the history of the psychiatric medicine.
It is not only read in the area of today Au-Haidhausen Au-Hospital's tour names "am Gasteig" or of the increase "After of Lloves" - but also in large letters "Irland".
Yes, here on the Aurfeld Street, one person was shot with grounds.
There was 1858/59 the Munchner Kreis Institute "Our the Ear Lights".
From 1872, Dr. Bernhard of Gudden led the institution - that psychiater, which is carried out in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.
"He was continued for his time, for example, the clothes of the so-called Irish.
He also urged the staff to apply violence against the isoles," said Hermann Wilhelm, the leader of the Museum's Haidhausen, who has worked for an exhibition with the host.
For 280 patients was first place, then 500 places were expanded.
Another time, this capacity has also not been extended – the reason for the construction of the environment in the hair in 1905.
Since 2006, the Isar-Amper-Clinicum München-Ost is one of the largest psychiatrics of Germany.
In the area of the former earliest atmosphere, youths are now in the Munchner Salesianum.
The order received the construction complex in 1920 and went into a young home with training businesses.
Westernly, the football of the TSV München Ost, eastly in the 1980s.
2015 the Haus "Casa Don Bosco" - in Architectonic advertisement to the original construction of the Ireneans who was destroyed in the Second World War at Bomben attacks.
The Marian place was 1856 as "Haupt place", which was called "Kaufinger Gas".
An important change of the Second World War also made in the heart of Munich.
The bombs of the Allied Bomben run in December 1944 many leathers in the city.
A great remained until today at the Marynhof.
The English Institute, small business houses and a vocational captain from the Middle Ages standed at the Middle Ages, where the workers were prepared and on April 5, 2017's steel for the second S-Bahn streets.
The shipper can compare the old munish card with the air image today - and fill the lake at the marketing court.
Civil Rights Group published travel warning for Missouri
The National Agreement on the Promotion of Colours has expressed a warning for fabulous people who are traveling on the basis of discrimination and the racial attacks of the State to Missouri.
"The NAACP Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Missouri, which should enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls for African American travellers, visitors and Missouarians to submit special attention in travels by the State and to provide an outstanding opportunity, since a number of questionable, racially based cases in the last time of the State and here are noted in the opinion of the Group".
A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes people difficult to gain discrimination injuries, as well as the criminal authorities of the State who are incompatible with minorities, allowed the group to explain the warning of the NAACP.
"They have violations of civil rights that pass people.
They will be stopped because of her hair color, they will be killed or killed," said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.
"We will hear contempts in such joy that we have not heard."
It is the first warning that made the organization for a State in the United States.
The group occurred cases as racistic acts against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man of Tennessee.
Sanders died in questional circumstances beginning of the year after he had no Benzin more during the country travel and was taken by the police of Missouri in custodia without being accused of crime.
The Council also pointed out a recent report of the Office of the General State Administrator of Missouri, which shows that black carriers in the State are more often held than white.
"The recommendation is that people are aware of themselves and inform their families, friends and employees what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel.
"The people must be ready to make the cash money or to let the deputy know that they are traveling through the State."
Missouri entitled 100 crimes in 2015, after the latest numbers of the FFF programme for hamily crimes, which calls for the State in relation to the number of such crimes on the 16th race of the country.
The trip warning is also a response to a new Missouri position that would make it more difficult to make a company with respect to apartment or employment discrimination.
Before the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the Member States had adopted immigration laws to impose local sanctions to arrest people on immigration, which will contribute to further race profile.
Return warnings are generally issued by the Ministry of Foreign Foreign Force for other countries, but recently groups have used the measures as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
The race project is elementary
Fisherbacher Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue in the next year.
The CDU Bund Day Deputy Peter White and Cordula Kovac have made a picture in place.
At the Court of Justice of the Family Zendemann, representatives of the fisherbacher CDU-Ort Trade were attended together with the citizen Thomas Schneider and the two fellows.
Markus Schwendemann first granted views in his company in which he operates 55 Hektar Wiesen and 40 hectare forests, 40 swimming pools and even many guests and stayed in five apartments.
The "Sneewaldmilch" is the alternatively marketing way for the milk of his kitchen, so swimming man.
On the table of the festivals, it is exclusively regional.
Since he also is the BLHV Presidency of fisherbach, he described the weighting project as " elementary".
I can't have a lot of growing areas on this kind of ground.
The Greenland surface provides a lot of work, many needs to be processed with the motor seas.
"We have to fight here with the conditions and the topografie," said the zendman.
In 2003, he understood the former operation and operated these without chemical plant protection and dry, even if he does not lead to bio-operation.
For citizens, Thomas Schneider, it was clear: "The Common has recognized the importance of the race project and is happy to promote Leader".
In costs from 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, the farmers should be supported.
It is hoped that the survey of the planes could be extended a whole time.
"The greatest treasure we have, the people who work in the agricultural farm are thinking about how they're going to operate," said the citizens.
Agriculture is often in the critics.
A total of 25 parts of eleven participants were included in 2013.
The opening area shall be 40 hectares that are not allowed for at least 2023.
From the total costs of 71 500 euros the half of Leader was promoting, a quarter leather botched the municipality of fisherbach.
Thus, the farmers remained 12,610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometers.
"The great benefit is the longness of the teeth," said the weedman.
Cordula Kovac stated: "They make a good job without farmers and farmers."
Peter White also stated: "The best foods are produced."
The Landscape Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows State promotion of feeding cells.
The goal is the opening of the blackwald.
The provision is the presence of one of the participating cultures defined by the LPR.
Furthermore, the infringent surface may not be economicable (inflammation over 35 percent) and must be threatened by the survey.
For the Fisher Weidezaun project 2018, the request of eight participants with 24 parks who want to build at 16 kilometers of Zaun.
The opening area corresponds to 35 hectares, calculated costs are more than 112.000 euros.
Is there nothing more holy?
Now the white house of Trump takes the freedom status
The most safe character of a regime will be when they start to attack the statuss.
The Americans appreciate these as well as every other - therefore the carefully inspired Sturz Saddam Husseins on the Firdos place in Bagdad in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump Regime, certainly knew what he did, when he took a symbolic axt in a huge fight with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the President on the drastic restriction of legal immigration with the freedom status.
To stay fair, Miller did not touch the status itself.
A race of boat owners and liberty ismyrs would have made him if he had done it.
But he emphasized their importance, and in particular the importance it was written to her, when the famous memory of Emma Lazaro in 1903, 17 years after the preparation of the thoughts, his base was added.
As Miller Acosta said, "I don't want to enter into a complete thing about history, but the status of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that lights the world.
The term that you face is being added later and not part of the original status of freedom."
Miller is seriously right, but how he's formulated it, it's not really about the story.
It is about the timeful resonance of Lazaro, which is the only one in which a State imposes not only some old immigrants, but the elders of the poor: "Your mourning, your poor, / your threatened mass, which replied afterwards, is the worst off of your rich costs."
There was never a time in which our screens were better to see.
Miller did not engage in literarity -- he explained that these people in Trumps are not welcome.
This conflict because of the importance of a status is part of a broader political and cultural combination: it is actually a conflict on the importance of America.
Lazaro - and their friends who used to put their words after their death at the base -- they knew very well that they had a high political action.
The skulpture should show connections between French and American Republicanship by putting it in a useful classic formal definition the female body of freedom.
Lazara changed this importance: In their mind, the female figur is no longer abstract - she received a voice.
And she gives himself a whole name: Mother of the Exilants.
The connection of the painting with the image is a brillant feminist coup and a heavy attack on the American Nativism.
And as Lazaro changed the importance of the Statute, people wanted to change this from the right flight for a long time.
The Great Schreihals Rush Limbaugh, a Art of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the freedom status is no one but is a early neoconservative, which brings the American flame into the overwhelmed world: "Lady Liberty goes forward.
It will take the factor of the freedom of the United States to the rest of the world.
The Fackel must not light the way to the United States."
Of course, Limbaugh has been put on something here.
The importance of the status is a question of the position of acceptance.
The great fault of Lazaro was to see them as they had seen from the crafted, but hopeful people after long and often horror journeys on the cover of ships.
It is the real meaning of seeing the world from the perspective of people, looking for flowers and an opportunity to improve their life.
Their statute tells them the words of hope and the welcome they need to hear.
And of course, this is not the perspective to recognize the Miller and Trump ever.
Her fake shall not light the way, but the hate that is the only source of power.
World Mastership 2017: Neil Black enjoys Schottic members of the Britain Team
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two shapes were listed to the team of Britain
The performance director of the United Kingdom's easy Atletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-knowledge Schottic continent in the World Master Sector will provide a massive contribution to the team.
A record number of chottic athletes was selected for London 2017 that started on Friday.
Black believes that "Sich in Scottland has to learn something specially" and the easy-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-the-le-the-the-the-fths of the United Kingdom.
"We welcome it, and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find it," said Black.
"I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.
The Scotts think that it's something to do with what they've done.
Britical light-effect: It's something to do with what they have done.
And with the guy on the street.
Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."
More of the skistal attractions are Medaillen advocators, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who are at the top of Sir Mo Farah on the 5000 m streets, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the manager to the team capital.
"Eilidh is quite disappointed.
"It was incredible," says Black.
"Any number of athletes, unlike whether they were shotly or whereever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very fiery and were very motivated.
The suffering and the real feeling that the Eilidh had fully used, of course, was great."
The memory of the Commonwealth-Metal meal that is attained at its fifth World Masters at the 400-m Hairs, says it is "incredible" that 16 shapes are in the British manager.
Scottland’s best total number of atoms at the World Journal was seven reached by 1983 and 2015.
The Middle Award Prosecutor leads on this way and sets out five British and two European corrections in the past year.
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5.000 m sales.
Chris O'Hare, who runs 1.500 m, is another shot that should be observed after a great season that contained the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary games.
Doyle remembers her first world dominants when the only other shote in Lee McConnell team was.
The manager says that it is "norm stolz" on the fact that many of its country leaders are not only part of the team, but also in some cases in the medicines and in the ends.
"The special person to be team officer is that she was elected by the other team members, so that it was a great honor, but to know that my team colleagues have chosen for me and have chosen me, it makes it very special for me," she added.
"Of course I am very boasting on all the shadows that belong to the team.
It just shows how far we came.
And they're here as an ethnic athletes, Athletes who want to grow on podies.
What about my talk as a captain?
Yeah, I think she's okay.
I just emphasized that we are very happy in this situation, since we have a home-wide master.
It is therefore really important to set up this home support and to benefit that we are again in the Olympia stage.
I'll take a second chance to go out there and competite, and it'll be so nice atmosphere there."
Blocking of criteria on Facebook: Do not buy for a public office if you can't provide the inventory of electoral
The father of our country knew something of worse press.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it was not long until the newspapers had killed him, from the internal policy to its political principles.
He fled at the critic, sure.
But he didn't bring his criticians to the weakness.
For in 1783, Washington said: "The liberty can be taken away - and, dumm and stupid, we'll be brought to the slaughter as the sheep."
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work to be more than Washington.
Hogans employees have blocked and removed the contributions of at least 450 persons who have expressed their opinion on its official Facebook website.
And the American Civil Liberties Union denied him so the beginning of this week.
The stage of the Governor decided the ball as fresh, and the online commenter was full of a contradiction with "Na, and?".
"It's just Facebook," said many people.
But it's important.
And it's particularly important if it's a guy like Hogan.
This is a republic Governor in a overwhelming democratic state that is so loved.
He has the second highest approval of the 50 Governors of the Nation.
Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzkopf.
He has shown a fixed hand in the manner of his State and close respect of the principles.
He was also very sent to use Facebook as primary resources to connect with his electors and played his sensible head to Chemotherapie on his side.
Therefore, the blocking of people coming to the side of the Governors is a public forum designed as official and by employers who are paid with public tax donors, unnecessary and finally dangerous.
In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Spracherin Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governor and argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing more than a moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of throats, stripes or harmful people who strike the pitch online.
The post talked to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And these are only true people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an undertaking and a parisher, no trol.
They all said that their comments were respectable, sensitive and not profan.
The Paradise celebrated the Bible in his post and called Hogan’s Catholic faith.
The right advocate Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., wasn't bad but she asked for hate crimes.
"I have commented truly that I was deceived that there was no reaction on hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary area of the message page "The Post".
"I don't appreciate this idea when a number of people are taking to the same topics, they will be recognized by some of them more than a collective approach called and not as a large group of citizens concerned."
What the workers of the Governor were called as "concentred Spam attack", others would probably call "Für language".
The Facebook Council makes it easy to switch a message by simply blocking a criteria or remove a negative comment.
It is much more pure than in previous time if you had done the same thing as employees were sent to collect and break newspapers with critical leading articles, or arrest demonstrators and bring to difficulty.
But exactly that happens just digital.
Hogan is not the first public official that is critical that he has affected Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is denied by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.
One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.
The President of the Supervisor Board of Loudoun County, the First Amendment, said the US-Bezirksrichter James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she acknowledged an elector of its Facebook site.
And in Kentucky, the Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be so hard.
At the time of Washington, the time of the spring ports had a similar effect like the Internet.
The number of newspapers increased between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous writers struck his leader.
And even at that time, Washington had anonymous trolle.
The people who were using the Pseudonyme like "Jurila", "Valerio", "Belisarius" and "Portius" wrote all letters to newspapers, the Washington's decisions.
Petitions, which criticised its position on the Amity Treaty, the Trade and the ships with Britains, surveyed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington.
But he didn't bring them to suck.
Freedom, opinion diversity and discussion are based on our nation.
And true guide means accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes at home comfort in the renaissance Club
The former Europeans No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope in the next three days, since the renaissance Club in East Lothian is the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open.
The northernire, who led to the left in the past year before he lost Paul Eales, is connected to the new exhibition site and is being a tourist in the name of the Congressor and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw how the Renaissance Club was built, and we can see how he reached his peace with this event," said Rafferty.
"The players will see this course from his best side, he is in a great state.
Jerry made a great job when he set this place.
He's a gentleman of this game and is pride of his performance here.
This is a great screen window for this course."
The English Eal is glad to defend a mastership for the first time, although in its 32-year carrier, both in the European Tour and in the European Challenge Tour.
"It feels very special," said the hidden player in Southport.
"I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because she was taken in the year after I gained it from the program.
To come back to this part of the world is magisch.
It's a wonderful place for golf games.
The memories from the last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon, the last year, to win here.
It was really a special time and one we are always appreciated."
Gary Orr, who came after his 50th birthday in this year to the European Senior Tour, returns to action on homeboats.
This event will be its first skills attainment since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scitosh open in 2013.
"It always means a little more when you play at home," said Orr, the man of Helensburgh.
"You're gonna do it well, but you're also spending this additional pressure.
I really wanted to play again, and I played a solid golf.
I'm glad about how far it was."
With the trio on the field, the former master Seeger Ian Woosnam and the senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and the former Ryder Cup Captain Sam Torrance are the six shots on the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance is free, the parking costs £5 per car with a bus and £ 10 per car with two or more ins.

Mixed Lunge clothes through passive requests
In the past two decades, less people died because of past request to Long Crebs.
For this result, scientists of the University climate of Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) are in a study.
"After our appreciations, 167 Lungkrebs are returned to passover cases", said Heiko Becher.
As comparison, he introduced a own study on this subject of 1994.
There were more than 400 Lungkrebst cases because of passengers for year in Germany.
The new investigation is published in "International Journal of Public Health".
Home decisions show themselves as a very complex
The construction work on the road's multilingual road is in full garage and "There are some dimensions in time", according to the leader of the building of Fred Heinze.
In the field of house decisions, the situation is more comprehensive than confused, since it is much hidden in the underground, what is not marked in the plans.
The transport that always dismisss the construction work is a great problem for the company Stumpp.
"The ignorancy of the car cars for red acids and crafts is already great", reported Heinze.
The road is closed and only the line buses are powered to travel.
Angelo Carus, Marvin Kostorz and Tim Costorz of the company Stumpp are working for weeks with the work at the press.
"The hot days were very beautiful.
But to the luck, we were assured by our friend Fritz Matt with a cool mineral water," says Marvin Kostorz.
Poverty and death in the Indonesian Goldland
If Bardina Diei bought the dinner, she doesn't use herd.
She's only using a top.
In its wood house in Enartali, the capital of the Paniai region in the unforest Indonesian province of Papua, the house is usually called a sweet cardoff - local as "nota" - directly in the Kamin.
After a half hour, the chosen knee will take and disappear and disappear.
Deoi sits on the lembode - she has no moble - where she also performs her daily work, for example, clothes with abused water from the nearly weighed pool.
An eimer in a dry room serves as a latrine.
As the latest of the four marriage marriages of her husband, no fields were shown.
Poligamie is usually here.
Of course, it may be dangerous to work later: most villagemen are unemployed, and many of them are hard, and there are soldiers here.
"No one wants to move around after 17:00 in the village," she said.
It is a rare consideration in the daily life of Papua, a former Holland Colonie adopted in 1969 after an overwhelming referendum in Indonesia, only 1.026 elders by public guidance to the destination.
A existing movement, which affected the independence against the Holland government, rapidly turned on the Government of Jakarta, which undertake controls over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observators.
In 2003, the province was officially divided in Papua and West Papua, and the independent part of Papua-Neuguineas was the eastern part of the island.
Enartali is located as payment. The trip contains a 90-minute flight from the province capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-year-old car rental.
There is no public transportation.
The city with about 19,000 inhabitants consists of wood houses that are caught from booms, and of wave dances converted by roses in different flavour tonnes.
Only very few Indonesians have made their journeys here, disappointed than journalists and practical not foreign countries.
Before Christian missionaries, Mee Pago Papuans arrived a God named Uga Tamee.
There were also other changes.
"We were not intended to take this clothing," says Diei and described on her living, handed turban, their dark Hemd and its green rock.
"We had only leaves to our body."
Papua is the most poorest province of Indonesia, where 28% of the people live under the poverty limit and have some of the worst child mortality and alphabetization Councils in Asia.
But it's also Indonesian Goldland.
The biggest and profitable goldmin in the world, Grasberg, in the area of the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is just 60 miles from Paniai, a high country province in the size of New Jersey with 153.000 inhabitants.
Today in 2015 Freeport has built in the value of 3,1 billion US dollar gold and coffee.
Moreover, Papua has the value of estimated 78 billion US dollar.
However, these richists are a source of the banning for the Papua, which ensures that Indonesia is a mighty military presence.
A investigation of 2005 in New York Times reported that Freeport of local military members and units between 1998 and 2004 has paid almost 20 million US Dollar, including to a single officer of US$150,000.
Papuan requests for greater autonomie affect these golden guans and are being treated without gnaden.
According to the reports of assets, more than 500,000 Papua were killed and thousands were managed by the Indian Military since 1969.
In the 1970s of the Asian Human Rights Committee, Massential Provisions in Papuas Stammeshochland were made in accordance with the Asian Human Rights Committee on Population.
In addition to the region, the Indian police arrested more than 3.900 peaceful demonstrators in the past year.
"We lose all" means in a report of the Brisbane Erzzee's Dynamic Commons from 2016, contained in the 2016 reports on creatures of the previous year, such as illegal institutions and follow-up, management and electrical proposals are particularly affected after another report - and the brutal deployment of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's difficult to count the number of victims, since every week events happen," says Andreas Harsono, Indian Researchers for Human Rights Watch.
The slaughters have strengthened, since Papuas' resources bring a superfluum of youdlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The population of 3,5 million inhabitants of the province is Christianly 83%, but the demographic development changes since muslimian economic migrants from the huge islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi arrive.
Weather warning clients sold used hook and Gado-Gado, a mixed fruit served with landson sauce.
Local people fight to keep here.
"The migrants have began to sell hunters and fruits on the traditional market more than the local Papua," Abeth You said, a 24-year-old Paniai-in-Canada, who went to work in the province capital of Jayapura.
"It has the Inland Papua - the Mom [the women] of Papua clothes their market."
The Indonesian State President Joko Widodo, known in the Middle of Jokowi, discussed during his election campaign 2014 the unbalances and legal violations in Papua.
The former roommann guaranteed 27 of the 29 areas of Papua, including Paniai, on the way to the President Palast in Jakarta.
But in Papua has little changed, and today the homes feel.
"Our hearts are broken, because we have set for Jokovi 2014, with the expectation that he will be fulfilled our hopes that the righteousness will be restored," you said.
In fact, Paniai was only two months after Jokovi’s Inauguration in October.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were outside and bloody Christmas leather before a camper in Enartali, as two Indonesian soldiers were thrown on a motor road through the darkness.
The crazy children told them that they should set up their carriers.
One of the soldiers took place at their voice and later returned with four soldiers, so the local Pastor Yavedt Tebai.
The soldiers who had drunk were drunk and smote the group with their skins, said victims and witnesses.
Then one of the soldiers burned in the group of children.
A 16-year-old child Yulianus Yeimo was so hardly killed that he fell in coma.
A few hours later, the building of the next government committee was set in the board and the things were calculated on the next day.
Nearly 1,000 young Papua people, women and children gathered together on a football place before the local police station and the military commanding centre to request justice.
They brought ceremonial jagds and led the Waita thickness in the round and a bird-summ asylum - by Papuas Mee Pago stage.
Some demonstrators began to tackle stones on police and military posts.
When the shadow was led up, the soldiers were sent a command on an internal function: "When the masses have led more than three times opposite, they appeared dead," it means in a official document of TIME, which has not been released the local media.
Jeremiah Kayame, the leader of the Kego Koto Vitals of Enortali, saw the dry danger and called for peace and urged the multitude to return home.
No one was to listen to the smoke.
"If I killed, I was soon thrown into my left hands," he said to the Veranda of his wooden wood houses.
Kayame still doesn't know who has eating, but says that the wheels came out of the series of soldiers gathered here.
"It was overlooked, many cups were drunk," he added.
The homeman Alfius Youw was caught three times, so his cousin, who was witness of the extinctions.
"I fled to him and studied his body to make sure that it was," said Yohanes, who only makes a name of many Indians.
"I saw he was dead... I knocked him."
The Chefin Spektor of the Papua Polyzei, Yotje Mende, said reporters that his officers were just wanting to "secure" because they'd be attacked.
"We have to defend us when people move to kill us," said the speaker of the Papua Policei, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
"It's about life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many more were killed.
The news of the deaths came just on the next day 'filtert' to Jakarta.
Three weeks Jokowi in Jayapura took a leading talk in which he explained sympathy for the victims' families and swore to get the historic misconditions in Papua.
"I want this case to be removed immediately so it will not happen in the future," he said.
Minister of Security Weanto said in October 2016 that he was established an extraordinary mechanism for the adoption of historical human rights violations.
But the exhibitions almost started immediately.
"The majority of violations have been made a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and the beginning of the year 2000.
The point is that we have been obliged to achieve these disasters, but there are processes that must be overcome," he said.
Then Weanto made a return when he spoke with TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, "when everything is legally regulated," he said.
In 1999, the United Nations had announced crime against humanity, which requested more than 1.000 death sacrifices in Osttimors to be black of independence of 1999, said that 11 cases of human rights crimes were already introduced in Papua, including the Paniai's case.
Familys of the Paniai open took these evidence with a huge unbelievableness.
"I was interviewed four times in the last three years, but there was no progress", says Yohanes.
"I'm courageous."
He says he's still in fear of years later.
"I'm afraid," he said.
"I'm afraid to be arrested by the military, I'm afraid to be killed."
His brother Yacobus reiterated the thought that people in Paniai were afraid to discuss the case.
He says he was killed by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims.
"When I buried the body, the military was looking for me," he said.
The shooters didn't stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police moved on village villages in Paniais neighborhood of Deiyai.
During a confrontation between village residents and a man who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital, a person and 17 others died, including children.
The man, 24-year-old Ravianus Douw, who was enveloped when he was in a near river, died on the way in the hospital.
Inhabited village residents protested before the location of the company.
The police said that the villages who lived the stones were put to officers who reacted on their warnings.
But the Independents say that the mobile Brigade (Indonese Paramilitary police) began to shoot the multitude and kill a murder.
"We were so in Panik, we were afraid that it would be rache," said the 29-year Dominggu Badii, who lived near the hospital and was witness, as the last ones have been quicked here, so the TIME.
"I hid two days in my house."
The Deiyai parliament has called for the officers involved in awareness and to return the police's mobile Brigade from the area.
Paniai has always been an unrealised for the Indonesian government.
The lack of sensitive development strengthens the insufficientness of the tribes of Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal living in the Green High country of Papua.
Many of them concluded the "Fries Papua movement" (OPM), the rebellen arms that claim to defend the rights of the Papua by enclosing sporadial attacks and removals from Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the Top-OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Juda Kogoya.
As a reaction on this has been arrested thousands of people in Paniai in the past years and voluntaryly took place, under the “safeguarding of national sovereignty”.
Some are never upset again.
Among the people in Papua, Paniai is known as a tragic, forgotten place.
The poor strengthens the unfriendly.
The little journey that is sold in Enotali is to divorce for home.
Brot is exactly except rich widespread.
People here build everything they eat: especially notta, fruit, and fruit.
Agriculture is the task of women that are able to edit four or five fields of the Sustain card.
They keep the majority of the harvest for the family while the rest of the local market is sold.
10 pieces of notes costed only 100,000 indonesian rupes (75 cents).
During the time, economic balances have increased between the domestic Papua and the new migrants, which have reached greater number since the discovery of new airports to the Nabire Airport.
The few jobs in the region are generally to the better designed and pleasing migrants.
Papua are often the capital or the necessary ability to make their own undertakings competitive.
"The young people are not interested to stay in the village... because there is no job or money", says John Gobai, President of the tribe Council of Paniai.
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.
Furthermore, the restrictions of the reporting of international media remain retained.
At the beginning of the year, the French journalists Franck Escuudie and Basille longcamp were deported because of the lack of coordination with resident institutions from Papua, although they were given the rare permission to films.
According to Phelos Kine, the Advised Asian Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Jokovi's election camp for the restrictions of the reporting to promote transparency and development.
"There are new risks for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia in the easternest province of Papua and West Papua: Visa disappearance and a black list," he said in a statement.
The lack of press control means that international pressure to the Indonesian Government remains far limited to the immediate neighbourhood of Papuas.
In March, six peaceful States - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate the " different and widespread violations" in Papua, including the Paniai Schilders.
The same countries have been historically supported by OPM.
The speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Minister of Arrmanatha Nasir back the pre-ses of the group and said to Jakarta journalists: "Indonesia is still a democratic system, and there is free media so that it is difficult to deal with the evidence of human rights cases."
People want more foreign governments to take this note.
As a formal delegation from the Netherlands, under the management of human rights-basticians Kees Van Baar, Jayapura on May 4, Jayapura had visited their weaknesses and threatened him "We wanted liberty" according to a source who also wanted to remain anonym at the meeting.
Indonesia has a further presidential choice, but the Papua say that they will probably not be voted for Jokowi.
"Jokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he's killed by people who are involved in the Paniai's shops," says Gobai, the President of the tribe Council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai Vulk, noticed that it is under the particular threat of a rubare military, in poor education and health services.
Gobai says the Paniai leaders, such as other Papua, consider their voice for Jokovi as a "related" that he must pay.
"You don't need money, they just want righteousness," he says.
Despite the drunks and contempts, the Paniai Shopping victims brought out a last symbolic act of the suffering: the body of a victim was buried in an area with the police and the military station.
They know that they may never come to righteousness, but at least they do not forget the responsible of their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed," Yacobus says with sweet head.
"What else can we do?"
Take the 'Torch' cloud wheel race from Dubai to the second time
A fire found on Friday in one of the highest villages of the world in Dubai, his back book and about hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 meters high, 79-style buildings.
It's the second flag, which lives in only two years through the western house, sometimes called the Torch Tower (Fackel Time).
The building was evacuated, injuries were not reported, and there was no direct word on the cause of the flammes.
"We fell asleep and we were risen at the fire and the cry of the people.
We cut down the treasure, and it takes about 10 minutes to come down from the 50. Anything downward," said a resident who gave his name as George, Reuters.
Dubais civil protection authorities said that the units of the border fight against 4.00 p.m. (0:00 GMT) solved the fire and choosed the building.
The Government said that she worked in providing meetings for the concerned.
In the case of the case, there can be resolved questions on the security of materials used in the outside of high homes around the world.
An investigation by the management of the Torch Hall after its block in 2015 showed that the major part of the damages of the clothing, the external clothing to decoration or isolation came.
In Britain, the police said that she believed that the system of plates on the isolation and clothing at the London Grenfell Time in June could have contributed to the rare extendion of a band where about 80 people died.
No Davis-Cup Reform: Forward Best-of-five
The President of the International Tennis Trade (ITF) has been held with its large Davis-Cup coup at the General Assembly.
At the Ho Chi-Minh City meeting, the revolutionary proposal for this sport was only supported by Davis-Cup unit to play on two benefits, even though it was not supported by the necessary two-thirds.
Those are often very long but, therefore, very appreciated five-satz classs are also received to the traditional purchase.
63,54 percent of the Member States was determined for the reform, the goal of the ITF President David Hagerty was therefore disappeared.
"We respect this decision, but it is delighted that our members have not adopted the entire reform package for Davis Cup and Fed Cup.
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions," Hagerty said.
We will continue to work on improving the complaints.
It was not only the vote after many instances before the proposal to put the end to a neutral place.
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details: Thus the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will be in the next year in the first round the guest's right.
In order to reduce the costs for the agency, the requirements in cases of training, etc. will be facilitated and the players will need to solve less official media terms before Davis Cup.
More than 1 of 5 US travelers brings prohibited objects in the aircraft, finds a survey
A survey under airlines showed that more than 20 percent of objects recognized or unconscious at the controls of the US Transport Administration had been shoted, including at least 6 percent of those treating the aircraft, while they had seen prohibited meat or other objects with changing.
Meanwhile than 1 percent stated that they had discovered that they were irruptively shopping weapons, munition or plastics.
The survey of more than 1.000 people - who were carried out by a Jet Chairperson Service, the Strato Jet Charters Inc., also found that younger travelers had been missed by the rules.
The requests to indicate that they had scientificly tried to flee with something prohibited by the TSA were 19.7 percent of the million, compared with less than 15 percent, members of the generation X.
The most of the cases that have been predominant to the TSA agents were food and flowers.
More than 3 percent have been able to have scientificly contained cases with klans by security controls, while 2.2 per cent of women requests and 3,7 per cent of men also confirmed that they had been obviously prohibited drugs to the airport.
The company said that it had asked travelers throughout the country to find how many of the aircraft had been brought through the air security and how many of them were obvious.
It is no surprise that people who are the most old skillware, scientific or uncertainly, through security, are those who are most frequently flowing.
However, the company notes that the TSA Directives are something complex and enhanced.
People are often uncertain what flights they can take or how many of them are.
There is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of floods covered by the TSA are prohibited.
For a long time, people thought that TSA could look for books as shots.
Flights are allowed for internal flights, but not to international flights.
Elon Musk is worth: 10 thousand tesla clients storm Order
Elon Musk is pleased to use its new Tesla "Model 3".
Today, he suggested that a part of the customers has returned their unbindend reservation.
Besides the steadly triumptic numbers of exchange rates and the widespread paragraph objectives, Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has reported another, less and less glass number: the stornations in the new market model 3.
Musk had often won with the more than 500,000 preferred for the new car, whose delivery rightly started.
Now you can smile music: The total 518.000 proposals have already been returned from 63.000.
Criticals always pointed out that it was simply involving unreserved reservations.
In a stornation, Tesla pays the 1000 euros (in the US 1000 US dollars and in the United States 1000 per cent) "Reservation payment".
Currently 455.000 of such unreserved reservations included muscles in a phone conference with analytens.
But the Tesla-Chef does not believe that it is a 12% of all orders.
Its argument is: the challenge of the enormous growth objectives is not at the demand, but on the production seat.
Last year, Tesla 84,000 cars were sent out in Tesla.
2018 it should be collected - all the models should be 500,000, 2020 a million.
The question is clearly available.
According to music, there are no reservations for this day at 1800 days.
If Tesla is able to make its news, never shown in the practice, any of the production routes that have been used without greater breakdowns with maximum extension.
Many experts doubt that it is possible.
But if it is too high, then the incompatibility of reservations to the problem of Tesla might be.
Since then the company can not encourage the unfriendly customers to move out in shapes.
EPA-Cheef Pruit is reduced by the delay of the rules of Obama-Era to reduce emissions
One day after he was declared by 15 States, Scott Pruitt took back his previous decision to extend the implementation of the Rules of Obama-Herra to reduce the emissions of the Smog aircraft.
In fact, the change was presented when his Agency appeared to the needs of the State Environmental Authorities against reaction slaughters as today's administrations.
He did not mention the case against his previous position in a federal training office.
It is about a period, which was taken on 1 October, to keep the standards of 2015 for ground Ozon.
In June, Prett announced that he will be retained for a year outside to give more time to study the plan and to prevent "industrial decisions or economic growth in local decisions".
Pruitt, who was by President Donald Trump's State Advocate of Oklahoma, was a confidence-related threatening environmental provisions.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt was reiterated to block regulations or delayed by which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil breaststoffen should be retained.
The immediate return from the Middle Easter is the recent legal decline for the Pruitts regulatory Rollback Agenda.
Last month, a Federal Office in Washington decided that the EPA manager override his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a regulation of Obama administration, oil and gas companies to monitor and reduction of methanlecks.
In an opinion published in the middle-women's middle, Pyrite suggested that his comprehensive shareholder at Ozon Standards would easily strengthen the EPA's commitment to cooperation with States through the complex process of timely completion of the new standards.
"In front administrations, the EPA has often not stopped the terms for implementing and then attempted to be appealed by active groups and others, and in one agreement, to determine the period for implementation," said the EPA, which complained more than a decade in his previous job.
"We do not believe in regulation by court procedures, and we take serious time.
We also take the law and the authority we are serious."
However, the EPA's opinion noted that the Pyrust would be used at any time with its "population for the deployment and all others legally available" to ensure that the rules "based on a solid policy and the best available information".
The Republics in the Congress have a comprehensive reform of the Ozonal Rules.
A draft legislation adopted in the last month should delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 at least eight years.
The measure was not yet put to vote in the Senate.
The Head of State General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of the States who had denied EPA in this week, said that the group was intended to keep the legal pressure.
"The return of the EPA - after our samples - is an important profit for health and security of these 6,7 million New Yorkers and over 1115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flees in their communities," said Schneiderman.
In this case, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Orgon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington and the district of Colombia.
ground ozone is used when shopping materials from cars, powers, oil flowers, chemicals and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight.
The rising smog can cause serious attempt problems in sensitive groups of humans and contribute to thousands of previous death cases each year.
Representatives of the public health and of the environment are awaiting changing currency on petroleum.
"It's inquiry how much pressure it needs to be done from the responsible for the protection of the air", said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We need to continue to fight the ideological crossing of the Trump Government, to offer self-employeurs and their special interests."
Tumlingen fees 750 years of St. Hilarius-Kirche
750 Year St. Hilarius-Kirche: The Jubiléum of the Bergkirche is invited to the old Friedhof Areal in Tumlingen on Monday, 16 July, at 16:30 p.m. to a serenade.
Whether his idyllic situation and beautiful views on the town is the historic St. Hilarius's place for comparison.
The visitors of the sixth Benefaz Seerade may allow themselves to secure from this powerful place.
The saving and maintenance of the old building in the place made friends and helpers to their sites.
Walter Martini notes: "It's a unique driving little."
In 1267, the St. Hilarius Capelle was first mentioned in the Württembergic Uruguan book of Württemberg: Graf Hermann van Sulz sold "The mountain with the founded pearch in Tumlingen with the Vogtei" to Mr Eberhard of Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Marker.
The word of the Uruguay, following the Tumling Mount, also standing out of the other paracles, also a ruling court to which the church or the Patriot right had been partakers and not converted.
They also lived there.
As the description of the Most Rejourn City of 1858, it was next to the subdorf and the topdorf, who are now recognized today in the place of tumlingen, the "Berg" of the third, the dominant village's village's dominant.
Old cards from the time for 1600 undermitting these historical accuracies.
The territory law was issued from the early average educational law.
A teacher who built a church, outstanding and appointed with a paradise, continued to the Eignator of this church and could also surrender this own church.
This was the right to use a garment or to propose a new piece.
Three high places were in the church and two glocks on the tower.
The size of the two was destroyed at Christmas 1673.
The new implemented Glocks began first 1692, but later in the Second World War in 1942.
In the 30-year war (1616 to 1648) the windows were struck and the locken line was thrown.
That was unfair.
1796 French troops were laid near the church.
They cut the cancers and the church steel out and used as the wood.
The survivor of the church was to bring 1809.
To 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof served as the last place for the dead from the audience.
1823 the Peacehof was extended and the Hilariuskirche was broken.
Only the Kirchturm has been standing.
In the New Year, 1834, the tour shot the crysturm, and half of the year.
To prevent an unfortunate, the tour was broken.
Only the tumor’s day remained as a Witness of the 750 years of old church story.
Today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasme of the "Creative Rentners" as followers of Dieter Dockhorn's Hilarius attitude.
As an agency, friends and providers were loaded on Sunday, 16 July, to the sixth Serenade at the old Friedhof St. Hilarius Capelle.
This will be established by the combo of the Kepler-Gymnasium joy City and with words by Kurt Cubler and Reinhold Matteis.
Hartmut Romann says the conclusion.
The programme begins at 16.30 p.m.
Once is at 15.30 p.m.
At the end of the Serenade, a surrounding places before the court of peace.
"Assemble a summer breakfast under the shadow of old trees and with the slight look on the forest," the events exhibit the fantastic view.
The Serenade will only be placed at dry weather.
The agency hopes to many supporters to enrich the historic St. Hilarius St. Hilarius, which is important for tummers and hearings.
The friends and helpers of Tumlingen feel specially obligated to the home household, like Serenade-Organisator Walter Martini.
Convention will check the approval of winds
The "Boisheim" does not see a legal condition for the construction and has therefore been applied to the Council.
The Verein "Boisheim" requested Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to recover his approval for the establishment of planned wind power plants in the Boisheimer net.
You have been pursued by the law.
The Convention argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer, no wind power plants could have been authorized, since at the time in Vierses, there was only an area of wind concentration at Schwalmtal.
Inside this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind energy plants are fundamentally possible, and the concentration zone is also affected by excluding wind energy use for the rest of the city.
The areas must prevent a "saving" of the landscape.
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer net a few days before by a change of the plan of ground use, but that had not been authorised because of a form of error.
"Of the lack of planning law, the approval decision is to recover as before the law and therefore also," said Christoph Erkens, President of "Boisheim".
The current position of things: the city Council has decided the wind concentration area in the Boisheimer network; the authorisation of the census government is still exempt.
For example, "There is the design of a approval for the establishment of wind energy plants exclusively. "
The environment confirms the entry of the request.
"The corresponding letters have been entered in the Square since last week," a speaker said.
The environment takes it to be re-examined.
However, they do not have to stop the procedure.
In view of the processing of management procedures, the round would not express himself in the Thursday's argument of the Boisheim Union.
The NEW Re, a daughter of the NEW, planted on a plate on the boisheimer net the building of four to 200 meters high winds.
By the past year, the company in which the city of Viersen was medium-scale involved was closed with the owner of approximately 65 hectare large markets.
With the establishment of the four wind energy plants, the air condition can be discovered of approximately 11 400 households, which corresponds to a five-five of the flow of all the four-heat households.
The NEW Re will invest approximately 20 million euros.
In the past summer Viersens city Council green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the windpark Linnich at Aachchen and a participation to a wind energy station in Übach-Palenberg in the round of Heinsberg.

City and Handler Planing "Hoimat-Shoppen" Wooding
Bad long salary and people from the region should re-en September discover the possibilities of purchase in the interior city.
The pool and the city management wants to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to place the inhabitants to the shop in the interior city.

This includes new offers, such as the first "activive day" to the Brunish party, as well as the sale of Sunday, conversations with all operators and activities to move them to active participation.
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the view on parking fees at this day are part of the concept.
Furthermore, the potential of customers should be re-evaluated or again.
This includes turists and tourists.
But also many homemen would have lost the internal city when they bought out of the look.
Finally, all should contribute to the inner city - to providers, the operations of the whole city and the United States.
It was intended to overcome the Lathargie that had partly been widely told the king in the early year.
Birdit Streich, Chief of the IHK Center in Muhlhausen, shared that the third "Heimat-Shoppen" day, first five Thuring cities, participating in the threeth "Hoimat-Shoppen".

Trump was set after transished scripts of phone calls Mexico on pressure because of payment of the border wall
Transcripts of phone calls between the US President Donald Trump and managers of Mexico and Australia were published by Washington Post.
On 27 January, Trump in a phoneat with the Mexican President Enrique Pena Nono asked for public to say that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The U.S. Presidency missed him because he had attacked the public wall. According to reports he said to him, "It can't tell the press."
Trump started his presidency campaign with the promise of establishing a wall at the south of the United States, and swore to pay Mexico for the project.
The transcripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and entailed a closed exchange.
Mr. Trump said that a trade for the United States flights who moved to Australia is "legally", "mies" and "dumm" and that the substance of the trade that was sent by the Governance of Obama would allow him to see him as a "depp" after he had proposed an prohibition of refugees to the United States.
Mr. Trump sent the call after he said Mr. Turnbull, "This is the most unrecognised call for the whole day."
Moores Ford-Massaker: Assets lead racistic Lynchact as a call for justice again
A Ford Mercury's 1948 Ford went through a group of surveys in the rural Monroe, Georgia, and slowed on the Ford Bridge of Moore.
Before the car that had four black passagiers and a white driver that could reach the press, a group of white men set out with brass to block his way.
The manager of the Mob - a man in a middle age - took a long journey on his cigarette and looked out by the wind protection ship.
The insses were in fear.
"We want this n. ---- r roger!" the man cried.
"Let him out of the car!"
The threshold was shot when a young black man was shot from the arrival of the carrier.
Happily, this terrible scene played on 22 July is only a idea.
But then if a lock is thrown around the half of "Roger", almost all are very real in the public.
Since 2005, civilian rights return to Moore's Ford Bridge to follow the night, in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey were held by Ku Klux Clan in 1946.
No one was ever accused for murder.
"It is really unfair that in all these years no person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities, even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helps the organization of the appointment.
"It's a stomach on a story, but it's a charge for our souls."
Brooks is a 71-year-old Congressor of the State of Georgia and a life of citizen rights.
For him, the appointment is a dramatic call for trade and provides an annual memory to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected.
"We want criminal persecution, we want the conclusion, we want healing, we want to reproach, but first we must receive justice," said he.
"We can't get healing and forgiveness until we receive righteousness."
A court medicine puts a bed on the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford Linken on 27 July 1946.
According to the FBI acts received by the NBC news, more than 50 men from Monroe and the circumstances in the Lynch process were suspected.
But no one has ever been accused.
Although the suspects remain free for decades, citizens' rights say that the double movement for Lynch actions was always known in the whole city: policy and sex.
In April 1946, a decision of the Principal Court of Justice allowed the black citizens in Georgia to the first time to deal with their voice in the summer.
Besides the same time as the election, the FFC of the black farmers Roger Malcom was a white founder, Barnett Hester, during a fight - well- because of a woman.
Brooks said he was in the city that Hester had slept with Malacom's wife Dorothy and that the baby she hadn't come out of her husband.
On 25 July 1946, Loy Harrison paid for a prominent white owner, 600 dollars to release Malcom from the prison, so the FBI.
He was joined from Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison.
But when they turned away from prison and closed the Moore's Ford Bridge, a Lynchmob around the car.
"What it seems to be, it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murder," concludes a FBI order.
"It is also evident that there was a complex between the State and the local criminal persecution that was not only involved in the murder, the evidence was removed and acknowledged the identity of witnesses."
Brooks are still forming a pants.
"It was a election law masker," he said.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in this Community: "If you leave to register and if you vote, it will happen to you here."
By a decade, Cassandra Greene led the annual definition of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Mord.
Its vision is viewful, delicate and founded in a deep racism that many desires to believe that it is no longer in America.
It's difficult to look, and it's more difficult to look away, but Greece said that it's the point.
"We don't want to talk about the lion because we're then confronted with their personality in us all," she said.
"If I can't build a relationship with you if you don't want to listen to me or not to hear what I did."
The tests for this year began in June, and on the first day, almost 30 players - a duty white and the rest of black - were in a room and laughed when Green started a well played survey on the piece.
Wade Marbaugh is here Greene Co Registerer.
He has played the role of the Chief Clan member for years, but he said that the role will never be easier.
"I'm feeling angry because I'm not," said Marbaugh.
"but I think it is very important to get this story in life because we don't want to return to these times."
On the other side of the room, the players tried to play Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, the Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester, their lines.
The piece begins with Malcom, the heroster cried and threatened him, as he was asleep to sleep with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, no-- he, get out of my ownership!"
Rascona burns the fire.
There's a pause.
And then everybody (instead all the black showers) was laughed.
Green's late.
'What?' asked Rascona.
He's alarmed and dismissed.
I was too hard?
"No," said Green, still worried.
"I don't think the white people have said at once.

Max Quantity work as voluntary
They work in their voluntary year even in several places.
Where is it all?
Many: Normally in Steinfurt in the muble browser, once in the week I help here in Greven in the Mobelbridge.
And I've already worked at school's whole day.
How are your experiences?
Many: It's a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here.
I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.
You're 26 years now, so a later volunteer.
How's this?
Many: I've done Aign.
And then a construction study, we're saying, it's abolished.
I knew that it's the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else to work with people.
And then I asked me what you're doing.
Make a social year, there's a point of view, there's a view that you can see how it is, in the breast point, indeed.
And was that so?
Many: I've gathered a great endprint.
I will start my study at the Winter Summit in the social substance.
I'll be studying dual, probably make herne a social worker training and student in Hamm at school.
Is there not something in normal during the volunteer service to have several different benefits?
Many: Yes, it's very variable.
It's probably always about where you're making the FSJ.
It can be done from the ageheim to youth - in all possible aspects of social work.
I was very disappointed.
I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon dinner.
For me it was exactly the right thing I made.
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really is.
Otherwise than in the construction study?
Many: Of course, this is not about to figure statistics.
You always have other people shape heads who have a whole other history behind themselves.
Whether a refugee, whether a younger who has been exempt from the family is always needed to go individually.
Very interested.
And you didn't have a lot of becoming?
Many: So I'm not the guy.
It's a range that's too much.
Most love, very friendliness.
There's also a negative moment, but so it's that life is.
Pearson shorts further 3.000 jobs and cuts the division to reduce the business
The U.S. Education Group of Pearson said on Friday that it will build further 3.000 jobs and cut its inter-divisions of 72 per cent, since another restructuring program will be started to overcome the pressure that is confronted by the company.
The building that the Director-General John Fallon announced over the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 was added to its previous restructuring, which had already been lost for 4.000 places.
Pearson, in May, announced a plan for cost reduction for more than 300 million US$ (394 million) in order to recover a business that was taken by the rapid step to digital learning.
The company who declared his participation to Penguin Random House in the partners of Bertelsmann in the past month said that the vision for the year was unchanged after the first half of the year had obtained an increase of 1 percent to 2.05 billion.
Kabul Convoi attack: Nato-Soldat killed at self-morality
A self-mortalist has attacked a military convoi in the Afghan capital Kabul, killed a soldiers of Nato and destroyed several others, say officers.
Five soldiers and a Dolmetic were dismissed, a statement of the Nato was informed.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died in the case of the city of Qarabagh.
The Bombardization is the last violence that Afganistan has attacked this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mocket in Herat.
On Monday, a self - murderer killed two people near the Iraqi news in Kabul.
In a view of the Nato, the Explosion on the Tuesday was done when a common patronuille with the Afghan Army was attacked by a "provised spring" by people.
The explanation suggests that all remained in a stability and treated in the US military hospital at the Bagram Airport.
Corresponders say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for the NATO troops in the close bathroom.
According to the United Nations, at the first half of 2017, at Afghanistan, at least 1.662 civilians of death victims, of which about 20 per cent in the capital.
At the end of July, a self-assassin bomb killed at least 30 people in a principally religious district of Kabul.
The Taliban said they would have made this attack.
On 31 May, a huge bombardization in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly military attack of the country since the US troops in 2001, the Taliban was dismissed from the power.
The violence underlines the precaking security situation in Afghanistan, as the President Donald Trump denied to increase the number of US troops that support military and police in the country.
Corresponders say that the self-assassination in Kabul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, their policies, and in particular in the vocation of President Ashraf Ghani.
EPA shall decide to reduce the Smog rules according to cartons
The U.S. Environmental Authority has decided to extend the regulation of the Governance of Obama, whereby States are obliged to grant emissions to the Smog causal emissions, which took a day after 15 States denied the Agency on the step.
The EPA later announced the decision to be forwarded on middle and said that the Agency had the obligation to cooperate with States.
"We believe the dialogue with and react to our state partners," said EPA-Chef Scott Pruitt in a declaration.
In June, the EPA was announced that orange provisions should be measured in a part of the country's smooth emissions to determine where the figures should be made to maintain more stretch air quality standards to extend a year until October 2018.
A group of 15 major democratic States, together with Colombia's work, extended the event on Sunday and said that the efforts were illegal.
The Government of President Donald Trump has attempted to renew a wide range of environmental plants which the former President Barack Obama has raised as a part of a wide agenda that, as a result of Trump's economic growth.
However, the efforts have resolved the democracy and natural protection groups which make worse about the impact of emissions greater on public health.
The EPA website says that the air unit contains Ozon 'the Lung function and can increase the attractive symptoms', such as as Asthma.
Community Council will Community Space
Finally, the decision was clear: in two contraventions, the Joint Council of Fluorn Winns decided the establishment of a Community area in the future senior habitation.
There is an important information before the discussion: the purchase contract has been signed for the remaining lack of the basic part, reported Minister Bernhard Tjaden.
There will be no planning need for the project voted by a private investor.
There is a debate on a Community space.
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the municipality.
In the landscape, he would provide a living area - about 55 square metres - and a landscape of 70 square metres of surface for a special price.
The manager and the majority of the Council of the Communities are concerned that a Community space is not only a point of meeting for the residents of the senior rights, but open to the community.
For example, the word of "Strickcafe" made the round.
Forget the decision taken by the allocation of resources for the current budget already in the past fruit, by promoting opportunities.
The building is in the sanitation area.
The establishment of a Community area would, thus, reports Tjadens, 60 percent of the percent of 30 per cent.
The decision is to report to the investor that you don't want to throw a bond between the knees to determine that both sattel - what is the angel of the environment - as well as the Pultdach - which would reduce the level of traffic and make the building - could be possible.
Inevitably, so not only Wilfried Sohmer, or this addition.
If it's helping, he's happening to the Gremium.
It is not so simple to the Community area.
Daniela call refers to the many own buildings, which are not so right to come before, so you are now on the Community space from the window, she says, "I am hard to do so."
Yvonne stagers, however, are absolutely contrary to a common participation.
It looks at a hidden subvention without any damaging or even expensive investors.
This is not even so, because with the acquisition of the planet you are not granted any sustainability, but it is a real, uncertainly marketable counterpart, the territory.
The applicant's request to comply with the decision in accordance with the decision, finds three complaints.
Thus, there are two contradictions in the original program, the Stefan Haller, which is so: "When we take the decision, we make a river term there to close a railway in our infrastructure."

To walk in the harvest of stars to stars
In the harz, the first "Sterne Pfad" should be the first.
This plant is the Verein Starwarte Sankt Andreasberg.
There are a planet path in Göttings since 2003.
A "Sternepfad" comes to the need for information with many arms, named it.
He prevents nature, science, movement and sports performance.
Members want to prepare along the planned red tables and inform about stars and star images.
In a first phase until 2018, the "got accessible installations at five to six places" in the topharz.
Inquiry, St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber.
The information on the tables should be added by the Internet.
Therefore, a good mobile network is a role in the location selection.
Barrier freedom is also a criteria.
Later, the storm road must be expanded over the journey.
"Over the stars of the stars, the observers learn a lot of knowledge, for example about the physics of the individual stars," the assigned.
They also learned why stars had different colours or why a star slighted more than one other, although it was essentially leaving further.
It will also be midded in which star is a chosen star and when he is best to see.
Since 2014, the entertainment belongs to St. Andreasberg's highest stars in North Deutschistan.
The middle of the national park Harz, as indicated by the Federal Protection Ambassador to the sixest dark regions in Germany.
Often from there, the milk roads and even the Andromeda galaxies with blue eye are clearly seen.
Since 2003, the United States' initiative of the Promotion Planetarium in Göttings has been an excellent way such as the planned starway - the planet path.
Starting before Gebhard's hotel in the Goetheallee, which formes the interior of our sun system, the planet leads the road with its stars up to the Hainberg and the starwart - as well as a "external Airport" location in Diemarden (Gemeen Equality) with the planet Sedna.
The stars with the individual plans - including the degraded plutone at the end point of the planet - are exact in the distance and measurement table of one to two billion.
The earth is hit on a cube of 6,5 millimeters of disadvantages, while the extract 75 meters of the sun is always mixed by 70 meters.
The whole distance of the planet road is a good four kilometers.
During the sun's light to pluto eight hours needs, footballs need a good hour until the star with Pluto.

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet the first time, discussing a possible showdown
Vasil Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who should be in a collection course to introduce the most closest box camp in nearest future under 147 pounds at the first time on Thursday.

"I'm an earliest weight," remembered Garcia.
"I'm up for broners [of 140 pounds], but I'm not so big.
I'm small for 140.
I want to go down to easy weight.
And he must move on easy weight [135 Pfund] and then we fight.
It wants the fans.
Let's give them this."
Lomachenko was right.
"Camps needs this fight."
Climate asked whether it should be on Pay-per-View, part of a strategie that the Lomachenko has to fight with a 135-Pfund deployment in this year in order to agree a date in the next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) of the interest in the fight against the winners of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their light title chapter in the Forum on 23 September.
"This fight could happen in the Pay-per-View mode because all the fans were asked after him," said Garcia and pressed out later to fight the network, which offers the best financial package.
We're the best.
No other names can produce this kind of attention.
When they're always ready ..."
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as "a huge fighter", and he might be partaking to his Saturday Chamber.

Fortunas Hoffmann: "Treier chain operates better"
Andre Hoffmann, after the 2:2 Saison Taxe against Braunweig, is the optimization of the abolition in Aue points.
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first saison game, also with the result, that the two owners wouldn't have been against Braunschweig.
"There were two representatives too much, and we need to look better in Ocean," said Fortuna Düsseldorf.
The triple chain must also be optimized in the hill.
And a door after a free seat, the fortunes no longer want to take up.
"For the future, it will be so that no more is on the line of Michael (Rensing).
Hoffmann is convinced that his manship is also entitled after experience in the preparation with the three chain better than with the fourth.
"Now I don't know how we're going to act in Aue", says his Trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is aware of his thing, "because we're just in the three-quarters of the triangle on the campaigns in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players that can build well," said Hoffmann.
"According is, but we're still better harmonizing and we're not making us so many bugs of playing."
Of course, Hoffmann is also going to Aue to win the game.
"If you can talk after a disappointment of a missile start, you don't know.
The performance could be fine," Hoffmann said.
"When we get here on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the pool, we will certainly talk about a ordinary season baptism."
Davon didn't want his trainer to know anything.
"The starting in the Saison I was judged just after six to eight days," said Friedhelm Funkel, who didn't want to speak from a advantage against Ocean, just because the game of the Sachsen in the world's home had to be denied at the time because of an unwanted person.
"Today, they can start the saison almost with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, "the players of Aue may even be something more frighter, because they wouldn't have a hard and complete game like Fortuna against an upgrading factory in the horns.
"If they don't know so 100 percent where they are now," said the internal defender of the Fortuna.
Since the guests from the Rheinland as easier favour on Sunday to the event finally prepared by Aue’s stadion.
"That we leave them, just because we have the intention to come among the first six, is Bludsinn," says Funkel, its balance in only a weakness against Aue from nine games is positive.
"There is no mankind in the second federal band that you need to be shot before," Fortunas Chefcoach says.
"An such explanation would be arrogant and serious."
And that's how Funkel wants to live his players on Sunday without case.
New results of the Swedish Asylalter Evaluation Tests
The latest results of asylum researchers tests in Sweden who have been undertaken a new method for medicine assessment of their age show that more than 80 percent of those presented are older than 18 years. But not everyone believes the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine (Rätts Medicinal Trade) has started implementing the tests in the past year.
In the asylum procedure, you must make the estimation of the age more precise after the Swedish Migration Authority (Migration Court) because of errors in the evaluation of the correct age of some refugees who were less aged.
Today, the Forensic Medicine Agency has released the results of total 2.481 tests from the period from half March to 31 July 2017.
Eighteen percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older, while in further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency was the person "perhaps 18 years or older".
In 432 cases, it was the conclusion that the person was "before aged under 18 years".
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is made in question.
According to Johan Seriesson by the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are permanent in the past months.
"We see no great difference in the statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite constant," said he.
The high percentage of cases in which the person has been judged over 18 years does not, however, mean that the applicant has lifted over his age.
In May, the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases to "propose that the investigated person is 18 years or old."
When the Svenska Dagbladet studied the results published in the period 581, she found that in 243 these cases the person opened that it would be 18 years old in this case.
The methods of medicine age assessment, which are made in rare explosions of wisdom cells and MRT captures of knifes, which are then analyzed by wheels and radioologists, are also criticised in some areas.
A sceptic is the endokrinologist Claudio Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological delivery of people in order to see whether they have come before or later as usually through the pubert.
"I had a reason to think about it, and I don't think that the kind of measure should be used.
The biological age in this way is very uncertain.
If we can't safely tell it, we should not do it as if we could", he said the newspaper Metro.
Seeansson by the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests: "In general you can say that the risk is to appreciate a child as adults is low.
The largest risk is, if the person is not less than 18, in this case, this is about 10 percent."
Full in Plan
The work on the three bowls of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg will be well forward.
In middle Thursday, a seven tonnes were installed a severe betoning part at the pocket at the east place entry of Lauterbach.
"We're very good at the time, it's over", says Reinhold easy, construction managers at the Department of Roads and Transport in the Left President.
In April, the work began at all three necessary sanitation presss between Schramberg and Lauterbach at the same time.
The construction is intended for October and easy to be sure that the time plan is maintained.
The first press from Schramberg leads to the trombach.
It is an oil bowl browser of Beton who is clothed with red bunt rock and has a total length of 4.80 meters.
It was in 1900.
Like the two other brows, she has come in average in the years.
In order to ensure the ability and security of the transport, the three buildings are now guilty.
The two other bridges lead over the layerbach.
They are built from red Buntsandstein.
Boths were established in 1939 and are 12, relating to 10.60 meters long.
The bucket at the place entry of Lauterbach has now received a middle morning on the north side a 1,30 meters wide and seven tonnes of the so-called brown cocktail.
This is an exchange that is used as an operational way.
On the south of the press, a 220 meters wide pool shall be used on Friday.
So the footway will go through.
The particular thing is that it is about the festival parts, a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo.
The other two tickets are already viewed with the patented buckets.
Special fingerprint feelings required managements by construction in Lauterbach.
For there is also a glass box in which many companies are accompanied.
The residents have been informed in front of the work by manual officers on the project.
Furthermore, fish and cancer should be disappeared first.
For the bowls between the building area and the Sammelweiher in direction of Schramberg, the transport is purely regulated by an axis.
The street in the area of the bus at the lagerbacher entry is completely closed to the "Tannenhof" and "Sept Linden" hotels.
The costs for the three press sanctions are 700 000 euros.
Financing is the whole country.
AfD in Gerolstein: Protest in German cartoffelsalat
It is not so often suggested that the parties are going to a race, but if it's about the alternative for Germany (AFD) together, what otherwise is difficult to bring under a hair.

The police has ordered many officers to Gerolstein, she shows the Presidency, especially at the street, which is just a few meters away from the events.
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein?
Mario Hompes reported by the AfD Vulcanifel, he was trying to make such an event and get the adoption.
The 45-year-old of the godsdorf had first asked in Daun, but there was a delay because the laurenkirme was not enough of parking rooms that had already been built.

In view of the events on the road front, he says: "This is the good right of people, heading, it remains peaceful."
This also does: Besides 20 hours a band for conversation in the city hall, including the rheinland-Food-President of your boy.
In the room, approximately 200 authors who are waiting for the splendid candidate for the Federal Section, Alice Weidel, and the designed Federal Presidency Beatrix of Storch keep their words.
Unchanged is the presidency of the police, but the officers had a quiet evening.
Some more than an hour the AfD events, guests in the area have a longer athme, but there is also a few hours after 21 hours.
The police can take it - no special prejudices.

Before the church, the crowds and many soldiers followed Zeremonie on a leinland.
The Minister of Defence of the Leaven described the surrounded soldiers as "took decorated" and settlement.
The Stabsheadmann has built the battle of the battle of the strike-ups in Fritzlar and was one of the first six expanded tigers of his government.

Prince Henrik doesn't want a grave beside his wife
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe (77), Princess Henrik (83), wants to be taken after his death.
It shared the king's house on Thursday.
Traditionally the Danish king's pair is used in Roskilde's house.
The imagehauer Bjørn Nørgaard has already created a Sarkophag for the two.
The queen is understood with the decision of her husband, and it continued in the communication.
Where the prince Henrik will be buried, it's still unlawful.
But he did not have the intention to be used in his French home.
Prince Henrik never made a heat that he wasn't happy with his title.
After the Throne resolved his wife Margrethe in 1972, he would like to be king.
2016 he went into the rest and also described the title "Prinz Gehl".
Since Henrik had not received the title and function that he wanted to see against his wife as equal - even after death, Lene Balleby explained the head of the Danish Queen's house.
Where the last rest of the 83-year place will be finally unlawful.
But he did not have the intention to be used in his French home but in Denmark.
He likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years.
The recent Henri de Laborde de Monpezat, the son of a French Adelsheet, had met Margrethe in London in 1965.
At the topic, he worked in the French news.
During his later wife, the sympathy events of the people continued to strike, Prince Henrik had a serious position in his 50-year-old government.
In an autobiografie hearing over the first years in Denmark: "What months after my arrival was criticised all I did.
My Danish was awesome, I prefered wine instead of Bier, Seden’s paintings instead of Strickshocks, Citros instead of Volvo, Tennis instead of football.
Even for the Gaulois I fought instead of Virginia-Tabak and the countries who had the call to be the brands of social criteria, I couldn't hope.
I was different.
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed.
They were the same two errors."
Minister Chairperson We will speed New Selection
CDU and FDP prior to possible majority in lower stocks
On the other hand, President Stephan Weil (SPD) is not to return after loss of the Red green government majority for a rapid election of the countryday.
For the Friday, the Parliament's resolution was issued.
Before the surprise of a Green Deputy Member of its country dinners in the low-sheets, the Government of President Stephan Weil (SPD) had caused a serious crisis.
Five months before the official time of the country's election, the red green-grown coalition in Hannover was abroad to the opposition of CDU and FDP in Parliament.
The current Greek Deputy Elke Twesten founded its step with the non-numberation for the election 2018 in its election crisis in Rotenburg (Wimme).
"I see my political future in the CDU," she said on Friday in Hannover.
CDU Group Chapter Bjürn Thümler wants to recommend its group to take it.
The CDU and FDP had together 69 seats in the Dutch Land Day, SPD and Green 68 seats.
Until the relationship was turned.
The new Land Day will be elected regularly on 14 January.
Thusler said that the Red Green country government should now decide whether it could continue to rule in this situation without most.
However, Stephan Weil is incompatible that the landing day is as quickly as possible to decide its self-removal.
The CDU Group will, for example, decide on the Sunday on its further action.
The country Constitution also provides the possibility of the country Day to the Minister's trust and choose a follower.
"Our Constitution provides several options.
These opportunities must be tried to be proceedings rightly cleaner," said Thümler.
"There will be discussed with peace all questions if they are accurately tested."
Things called Twesten's step "took some cool."
The politics himself said, "I'm not a drunk.
I feel very good."
She was named as a black green annex.
The Greeks requested the Absorptive Deputy Members to redirect their countryday mandate.
"We are of course aware that she has received her country party on the green country list, with an immediate effect," the country Presidency Meta Janssen cook and Stefan corners participated.
The President of the Green Anja Piel said: "We take the decision of Elke Twest."
It has decided to take no discussion in the group.
"As for the background that there is no contentive differences, we can't complete this step."
SPD-Canzlerkandidat Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the German Greek Deputy Allke Twesten to the CDU as a contract.
"The behaviour of the former Green Deputy Members in the low-speakers is not only a contract to the electoral and electoral, but also the Council on Red Green," wrote the Federal Chair of Social Democrates on Facebook on Friday.
He supports the decision by President Stephan Weil (SPD) to re-select the country Day.
The exit Twestens costs the majority of red green in lower acids.
The politician is "in its fair efficiency and in their branches their personal interests in the country," the SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil criticised.
"It's a scandal that the CDU in the lower scene has been combined with this weak intrinsite game and is trying to kill political capital."
Björn Thümler's lower skills will recommend its members to take every west to the CDU.
The SPD Group in the Federal Day, Thomas Oppermann, made twests to raise the result of the countryday selection 2013.
The CDU was at the same time before SPD's strongest force, SPD and green day but a dreamed majority of a voice.
Agriculture Minister in the Interview - How do we protect us from guests, Mr Schmidt?
Germany discussed about sweet oxen.
How could the scanal pass?
How to protect consumers.
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt (CSU) is in the interview with the editors Network Germany (RND) speaking and answer.
Mr Schmidt, how can consumers be protected from forgotten eggs?
I can only encourage all consumers and consumers to see exactly the eggs in your currency and check the pressure.
On the consumer protection port www. Life media warning.de, the Federal States provide the latest information on the concerned oil Chairs.
The concerned oxes should be destroyed or returned.
Even if we know what is now, a health risk is practically excluded.
Now Aldi takes the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the author of the Federal Agricultural Minister is not really understood?
Food oversee is the Federal States' task.
Nevertheless, my house has been unrepaid and has been recognized since the concerns of Germany in the middle exchange with the authorities of the countries.
All information and risk assessment are called for consumers.
The trade has, as well as the producers, to ensure that the products sold are inadequately trafficful and healthy.
If the maximum content of 0,005 mg/kg is overflowed, these are not possible.
However, unloaded eggs can be sold and lost.
This time the operations are not the fault.
Seats production companies and consumers in the same boat?
Following current knowledge, the production operators do not have direct debt.
Moreover, they have to counter on the basis of the usually illegal practices of service companies with economic damage.
As always there are too little controllers.
Is there only a staff or a bad competence?
There were only official controls that have discovered the progress.
However, it also means that food frequency and criminal energy can never be excluded to 100 percent.
However, a consequent declaration of such events and the transmission to the State authorities in the cases where criminals can be made is crucial.
I have already shown a clear statement by the authorities.
Is the regular alarmism in food chain really needed?
The consumers and consumers have the right to obtain exclusively safe and transportable food.
If an unaccepted insect is used in the food economy, consumers and consumers shall be paid on law.
The fixed resources are in a situation which is absolutely unnecessed by producers, traders and consumers.
Basically, it must be clear: The legal use of the insecticide fipronil in the stop of life providers is not acceptable and must be completed indirectly.
This should be done at all levels and on high pressure.
I wait for all competent authorities that the contents will be clearly and unlawful.
How the financial rules of football on Neymars transition to Paris
The rules aimed at preventing unlimited expenditures of the European football governance will not affect Neymars World Rekord Tranfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Seneter of Paris Germain.
Some consequences will be made for Paris Saint-German from the UEFA, because the electoral organization who overlooked the European game has the power to facilitate managers from access to the predominant Champion League tourist.
Financing Fair-Play regulations that were called from the UEFA in 2011, means that PSG must demonstrate that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without great losses.
Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to buy Brazilians from his contract, and Neymar will receive a amount that will be paid more than ten million dollars per year.
There are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's transition to France.
The PSG can with security make money locker so that Neymar signs and brings it into a galassic of other stars, in view of the financing of the team through the power of the dominant family of Katar.
Those can use a lot of money for acquiring players, but with legitimate acceptance sources of taxes allowing them the Break Even point in their business on football.
FFP was designed by Michel Platin after his election to the UEFA Presidency in 2007.
The former French player believed that Vereine, who had taken great debts after success, had effectively affected and risked to destroy themselves when banks or owners left their support.
In 2011, FFP was delayed from the concentration on the debts of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses.
The change means that the business model used by Roman Abramovich originally in Chelsea in 2003 - a club bought with potential and then strongly invested to improve the manager and build a global brand - to a stronger business.
During the current three-year period of FFP-determination, which is running up to 2018, clubs lost 30 million euros can be accepted.
And although Platin 2015 has been affected by the Presidency in Ungnade, the UEFA Foundation of Aleksander Ceferin continues to disappear from overtime expenditures.
"With certainly FFP is not dead and we will still enhance the rules for the future," said Andrea Traverse, responsible for the UEFA for FFP, against The Associated Press last week.
Although the PSG has paid the Buyout clause of Neymar in a pauschale, it may distribute the amount of accounting for the duration of its contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year-old agreement so that the sums of resolution for the next five years may be exempt from 44.4 million euros in the annual conclusion.
The first bottle of FFP syndications in 2014, the PSG, together with Abu Dhabi, situated in the possession of Manchester City, took the most serious sanctions.
The PSG has received a cost of 60 million euros (and then 82 million dollars), which was lowered at 20 million euros, and it was ordered that the managers members of the Champion League of Saison 2014/15 at 21 players remained limited instead of the other normal 25 players.
The UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to list their financial supervision by opening their revenues by companies related to the owners of a club.
While a catharical company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsoring should overcome the standard rates, the UEFA would not allow it to be a legitimate income.
In 2014, when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA sponsoring was covered by the Qatar Tourism Authority.
It was reported that a part of the PSG allocations to Neymar on payments of the WM 2022 WM Committee could come to Katar.
But PSG and Katar 2022 have made it easy to be Neymar WM business and to find such a manager for UEFA regulation authorities.
The present sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attention to all attempts to comply with the rules.
The UEFA had no preparatory conversations with PSG about Neymars transfer, said the people trusted in the situation on Thursday on Thursday.
They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not able to discuss the PSG situation.
The latest reports show that PSG 2015/16 has gained a profit of more than 10 million euros.
The accounts for the last year must be published.
PSG is expected that Neymars arrival is a blessing for sponsoring deals, Merchandising and Tricot sales.
The agreement provides that the exchange after the signature will be increased at least 30 per cent.
The Spanish liga was clearly irrited to see one of the best football players and she tried to prevent Neymar's way by affirming that PSG would harm FFP.
"It's a clear case of "financial Doping" with the club and the State," said the President of La Liga, Javier Tebas, the Spanish Day Time of AS in relation to the recent property at PSG.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, which is a member in the possession of a American sport-Tycoon, shares the provisions of La Liga against a State financed.
"It's the consequence of the ownership, and it has changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday.
"When a country has a unit, it is possible.
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairplay because you are going different ways or can have different interests when a country has such a big actor to represent a country."
Swiss is looking for a new shoggi provider
In the past few years, Chocolat Frey Bord-Schokolade produced for Swiss.
Now, the sweet cooperation is before a possible end: the airline records the task.
Swiss-Swiss speakerin Meike Fuhlrott confirmed an appropriate report of the "New Westweiz" journal on Friday.

"To the current leader Chocolat Frey we are very happy," said the speaker.

The Swiss wouldn't have any information on the costs.
Branchen vice-sideds appreciated the task volume of the "Not-Westweiz" at 1,5-2 million of France - the Migros Tower provides an annual amount of about a billion of France.
But more important is always the effect of the public: for a shopping producer, it is an excellent task.
How many applicants have the new description, Swiss does not want to betrayed.
But only Swiss producers will be questioned.
According to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey would like to continue to renew the Treaty on the Frühling 2018.
For the Sda, the largest Swiss producer was not available for a opinion.

Level Atletic - Discus-Olympiaceist Robert Harting reached WM-Final
The three-time World Master fights on Saturday at the end of a medaille.
His brother Christoph, Olympiasizer of 2016, was failed in the national WM decision and could only see the discus white chapter from the tribune.
In the case of the first attempt, the Polynic Title Piotr Malachowski, who was far from 65,13 meters, was the final campaign.
Nostalgie goes in "Wet Hot American summer" and "Comrade Detective" in the nice
This repair of the story is at the same time notalgic because of the magnificent days of the characters of the 80-year-old Erra, for the 90-year-old Erra (such as David Wain and Michael Showalter, the Sketch Comédie "The State" for MTV, and for himself - it means, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rud, to be greater.
As a cultural art effect, it is also a parody and a corporation of our Facebook powerful medicine of permanent memories.
But when Franchise, it feels like the time would come.
"First Day of Camp" worked well, not only because of his absurd humor (which includes a original history for a speaking dose fruit that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin).
When they hide on the corners of the gags - player players average age playing children who are growing up - yet they made the possibility to gain the last part of the Witness.
"The Year late", with his adults that are now playing, is less emotional and his parody is more than the primary principle, including a riff on the Stalker's 90-year-olds like "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle" ("The hand that looks on the skills").
On a point it forms a character by a Apple Powerbook, some inline skats and "a number of other things from 1991".
Many of the central stories are the same.
The lovely coop (M. Showalter), now Roman author, has not yet forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) has not yet lost his virginity.
And there is still a more amazing piece, in the Ronald Reagan (as Mr. Showalter) which is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a goodly pleasant impression of Michael Ian Black).
As always the excursions of the best part of the Franchise.
It makes great pleasure to see the earliest young Mr. Rudd, which Matt Dillons underlysed by "Singles" shows the former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old knacker.
It's the moments of casual warming that could adhere this Franchisis as a kind of renewing "Seven up!" Serie until he reached the way I accept as his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American summer: Twoty Years late", whose last scene will show bands as they will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American summer".
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon remembers another kind of Nostalgie: the revealing of the Kalte War of "The Americans", the film "Atomic Block" and even the "GLOW" with its East-West Ringkampf Iconographie.
The Com mission created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas is a Register to be a TV series found: a Roman drama of the eighteenth years with the two polices as friends, two Bukarest officers who fight for truth, athism and the way of Marxism Leninism.
The main roles - a hard Gregor and a idealist josef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici, whose dialogs of Channing Tatum (or an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt are synchronized in English.
It's a gentle idea.
But it's not much more than one idea.
There are some beautiful gags to see (the police takes the time to look at the television, how Americans may be doing it with football).
And the list of the famous speakers - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides for a strong game 'Finde'.
But "Comrade Detective" is very involved in the reality of a unresolved propaganda damatic -- a murder that leads a reagan mass will be included - that it is often playing as one one.
For six long episodes, the comedia is not fast or often enough.
"Comrade Detective" who was reiterated on a lower length, could provide his Aigprop seats better, since Gregor and Josef always visit the American news, whose Lobby is always appointed by two dick men who disappeared a hamburger's call.
The message for the imaginated communist publication is that the West culture can make everything for the flower.
The physical Roman Creators do not lie: we are doing it even with our own youngest story and with the heroes.
Battery against drug mafia in the country
The police is a fight against the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.
On middlemorrow, there were many objects in the Blackwald-Baar crisis in Rottweil, Constance, Stance and Stuttgart, which were partakers of the State authorities on Friday.
15 complaints were arrested between 25 and 77 years and have already been adopted against these complaints.
Moreover, the officers of Marihuana and Kokan, Shopping weapons, and more than one hundred thousand euros.
Two people were arrested in timely razzis in Italy.
On the two suspected Italians, there were German orders.
The two will therefore be delivered to Germany.
The action was involved in Italian and Bayeric Ermitteers.
In total, more than 300 policemen were used.
Mafia members are organized by drug criminality, severe violences, trial murder, rain and expression.
Since summer 2016, the Government's prosecution has been established against the organized drug trade in the southern space.
Among the government authorities in Constance and Palermo, a rare exchange and the producers of the Crypto Rottweil had closely contact with their colleagues in the Guests.
Therefore, the great use of the middlemorrow was also joined from four officers of Palermo.
In the visa of the investigations, the Italian State membership has focused on a reference to the Italian Mafia.
A case of 27 May in Hufingen, when a few bulls were displaced in a guest, should have gone to the account of bands.
In terms of the External Register
"Dates of citizens who do not have to follow: a report shows significant minority in Germany.
This leads to severe deficiencies of asylum procedures.
As Frank-Jurgen, a media report has given attention to great suitcases in the Foreign Strategy Register.
Meanwhile, data registered there could lead to the asylum procedures and disappearances "for part-related deficiencies", warned in an analysis that preveals the "Sudden Journal".
According to the registry, there are ten million people with foreign nationality, including approximately 5,7 million from non-EU States.
The data shall be managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany.
Since the data are not sufficient, the data quality in parts was not well.
In particular cases, data were found by 1921, "for those who have no longer been alive, or by citizens who have become Germans and are in fact not to take up any more in the register."
"Introductions of data may result in significant return processes," the report follows.
In the statistics of extracted persons, EU hosts are override that do not need to expire.
These false rules, however, conducted "to a dismissed debate on the transition of exemptions", means the analysis.
The Federal Government has clearly began to return refugees families with children under 16-year-olds to Italy when they were entered from there.
This issued from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the "New Osn printing Zeitung".
The paper means that the BAMF leads such procedures "related families with children - with exception of dogs and little children - to Italy since 1 June 2017".
Since the end of 2014, it was not practically possible, in relation to the difficult situation on the place.
According to the Dublin Agreement, refugees are responsible for the EU State to achieve them first.
If a migrant continues to another EU country, this State can return him to the entrance country.
To congratulate, the Office now writes: "Individues has significantly increased the ability for families with less age children in Italy."
Italy has issued for the accommodation and accommodation of family guarantees.
Even the European Court of Justice for Human Rights (ECMR) holds these claims sufficient.
Other EU States would also return refugees within the Dublin Agreement.
The internal political speaker of the Left Crimination on the Federal Day, Ulla Jelpke, criticised this decision: "Fomen with children are due to the minority in the Italian Asyl system of human rights ensuring conditions and the danger of child age."
Second results achieved
In total, 220 liter blood of living persons in higher bach was already available for others.
At least of the twelve citizens who were described on Friday.
All previous Jürgen Greule, who participated with his inknown 100 symptoms inknown 50 litres of blood.

"It's a gentle way our body has been created for it and we are engaged in the respect of the spenders that have their blood for for strangers, not inevitably," underlined citizen Karlheinz Kistner.
"A single blood penalty helps several people," explained the chief of the German Red Cross (DRK), Holger Maisenbacher, because the conservations are scattered into their parts.
Three people could benefit from a blood pen.
At the same time, Mass bacters reported of the actions carried out in the early year.
"In this year, we achieved 114 expenses the secondest result," said the DRK Critical Head.

The Bank of England shall hold the rates at 0.25 %
The Bank of England will therefore be informed later that the rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and the decrease of inflation have faced the speculation on an increase.
The Bank of England warned that the "country" growth will remain when they are accompanied by the interest rates on family revenues in an increased pressure.
The bank decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) agreed to 6 to 2 to keep the rates at 0.25%, while less Members have enhanced the weak growth in this month.
In its four-year inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth approaches for 2017 to 1,7% and for 2018 to 1,6% and warned that pressure would continue to be on the budget agreements, and the inflation in the occ. should attempt increase at approximately 3%.
However, she reported that in the next years there would be needed to raise the inflation set by Brexit and said that credit costs may increase more than expected to the financial markets.
The members also decided to resume a part of the Mammut Conjunctural Package issued a year ago.
It will be requested time for the financial plan to provide more financial resources for banks from the next February, although it has been said that it is now expected that 15 billion thresholds will be available in the framework of this system - with 115 billion Pfund sterling.
The Bank said: "In the central prognosis of the MPC, the BruttoInland Product (BIP) remains shortly low, since the pressure on the real income of the budgets continues to the consumption."
In the interest rates, she reiterated that "a certain punishment of the monetary policy" would be necessary to eliminate the inflation and a "a greater" measure as the markets are waiting for.
The markets are currently the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and a further in 2020.
However, the Bank noted that increases would be achieved "restrictly" and "limited".
The underlying growth methods of the Bank for this year and next are compared to the 1,9% and 1,7% reported in May.
She has maintained her growth preference at 1,8% in 2018.
The Pfund fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.
The threshold fell around 0.5% to 1.31 US$ and fell around 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision on no amendments after recent growth numbers have been attracted by increased expectations at a rate increase and the BIP increased in the second quarter of 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.
In the third quarter, the growth will be at least 0,3%, although it is easy after the bank end of the year.
The recent inflation report has to be less damages for households affected by growing inflation and low increases, as the deterioration first is worse before it will be better.
She added that the monetary policy in the next years could not "precise income" but added that the loans would be acquired at the end of its three-year word "deeply".
The economy will also increase the demand for British goods, which is renewed to the weak fund, which will compensate a part of the lower consumption expenditure.
The decision is one year after the decrease of the interest rates at 0.25% in the last August after the EU-wide vote that causes the meaning of the foundation.
The Bank appreciates that it is likely to be four years until it is completely reached the prices and the economy.
On the last sentence of the Bank to the census, the call was increased after a currency increase, since the inflation increased the pressure on hard-related budgets, and three political decision-makers in July requested an increase to 0.5%.
The inflation has been reduced in the past month of 2,9% in June to 2,6%, although the bank said that this was expected and will be backed into the coming months.
The Bank said that the exchange in relation to its purpose of 2% was "intensive" to the weak threshold.
Andrew Montlake, Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: "In view of the recent decline of the Swap-Rates, the Hypotheken market should be re-employed more competitive, since the creditors are looking for business and want to end the year more positively.
The market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals are outlined and excluded the new hypothetics, and many of them with free options and lower councils will always be loved."
NHS (NHS National Health Service) should describe overriding HIV drugs 100,000 people
The patients will have access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment from September before the High Court against the financing of the NHS medications.
NHS England reported that a pre-exhibition profile (PrEP), which could reduce infection risk at high risk patients around 86 percent, is now delivered by the health service on a first three-year study for 100,000 people.
He stated that it was ready to finance the process after the vocational authorities confirmed a sentence of the Chief Court of Justice in the past year, which NHS had the power to pay the PrEP, despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it.
The announced on Thursday was welcomed by the NHS England Chaef Simon Stevens as a "white new intervention" while the National Aids Trust (NAT) was described as "defined moment".
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be included in the first places that allow people's invitation, and other clips will be followed in October before entering into England in April 2018.
Preexposition profilelax (PrEP) is a consequence of HIV parameters that are taken before the sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Students showed that PrEP reduced HIV transfer in dangerous infections.
PrEP to take before sexual traffic means that medicine is sufficiently present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sexual traffic.
For those who come to the treatment in question, they include schools or bisexual men, transexuals and persons with HIV positive partners that have not been treated.
In Clinics, appropriate participants agreed to the study are identified, including men, women, transgenous and individual persons who have a partner whose non-retroviral status is controlled by antiretroviral treatment.
People who live in England and are registered with a household can also be advised for a possible participation in their local sexual climate participating.
The programme is signed by £ 10 million and NHS England a treaty on delivering medicines in this week after an international competitive proceeding.
The study should assess the whole potential of PrEP by collecting clinical allocations, as appropriate in the large measure table, to be used, and implemented.
Stevens said: "This great new intervention should complement and overcome the widely and increasing efforts to prevent HIV.
It is another milestone in the over three decades of progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of humanity."
Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said: "This is an essential moment in the fight against HIV.
PREP, if it is designed to needful and dangerous people, offers the possibility to change English HIV epidemic.
From September, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS funded in England to develop a new tool that is actually controlled individually and not undertake a negotiation with a partner that leads to improvement of many and many lives.
We welcome this announcement completely."
Ian Green, Vice-President of Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority must now be on the fact that the study will be carried out quickly in the whole country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left.
Now, since the PrEP has been conducted, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people."
Sharon Hodgson, the Teacher Health Minister, said: "The start of the PrEP Process is welcome and overcome after months of breakfast and long-term implementation by the Government.
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of these change infections.
This trial brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP.
Now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible in the whole country to protect people who are infected by HIV, and that it will contribute to the completion of HIV dissemination in society.”
The great life: Interests and fine designer tricks have transformed these small earls of the Court apartment into a large home
Joanne Leigh, an former banker with an on-going affiliation for real estate, rented from a large house in Knightsbridge to an earls Court apartment.
It is in the first Stock of a elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold.
"Therefore I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a very greater room," says Joanne.
"I was looking for something that was comparable to my price.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high covers.
I loved her and made a offer that day."
Since the first view, the 1,000 square feet was overcome completely.
Originally, a single room equipment with a slightly layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get in the bedroom - Joanne Stauraum and an interface sample to use the great ticket height.
"I wanted high clothes, great window, a lot of light.
It was my request," she said.
To this end, she advised the architectur and design study Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet of high covers and to create a house which was not only a development but also a place for Joanne's life.
The deck was not large enough to put two rooms together so that the architectonic challenge was found in creating an interface in which you could stand.
Erfan had to think creative to solve the instruction.
"The steel work is quite complex," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were shot one another without we had to beat us.
It was not only to build a simple platform, but to put the steel so that he had the right height for the function above or downward."
This order allowed to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.
For the interface, a classic clothing window of Retroveius is seen above the glamourous habitation area.
Screened gold meal, silver accents and vintage Serge Mple illumination sets the style for the program.
The use of speeds plays a role when adding theater, space and light.
At the end of the two ends, a short corridor is reflected in order to give him more action.
In the kitchen, the speed feels like a window in another room.
At the entrance, there are ones reflected places for all the beachs and gloves of Joanne.
The beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.
Comprehensive kitchens are nothing new.
The particular thing is that it is about a garage door.
"A little engineering artist went into it," said Erfan of the steel markets that burned MDF temperature.
"It's opposite that it is when you driving the door up, it's very easy."
Thanks to secure use of room and stauraum, Joanne could win additional 16 m2, a additional bedroom and a better layout.
"To the end of the day you'll sell the foundation - or how your real estate is appreciated," says Erfan.
"In a rudimentary form, a real estate will enter and make a calculation based on the ground size."
Here they have made it to increase the surface and to use high quality materials that provide for the room its luxurious benefits.
"The materials are the things you touch and therefore help to create an emotional binding in a house", says Erfan.
"You don't love the electric stackdoses in the walls.
These are important, but they don't play with your heart."
It shows that a apartment can be converted through a good design and increased square meter of something normally to something totally successful.
In fact, like Joanne, you could decide to not leave them.
Brothers fight for a 500 million US Dollar real estate
Two brothers were four decades after their Italian family founded the Dynastie, in a relaxation because of one of the greatest real estate experiences of Victoria in the value of $500 million.
The former director of the Carlton-Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a village in Toorak, only three doors from his young brother Paul. This has brought him to the Chief Court to make it clear how your ownership and their business must be divided.
Paul wanted to get away from the family company since 2014, but a sharp composition on the division is placed in the Chief Court of Justice.
With her mother Anna, the brothers of 38 real estates in the value of more than half billion dollars collected, since the 1973 family bought a business in the Smith Street, Collingwood.
There, the Westco Jeans family founded and grew to a cake of 160 shops.
It was sold in 1999 for 85 million dollars.
This money was invested in Immobilies, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as the purchase centres in the city.
After a agreement with her dead father, Colin has been described by Paul as a "heavy manager and the dominant personality" in the family De Lutis, about two thirds of the company and a third part of Paul.
A court act claims that this means Colin's property in the value of $316 million and Paul in the value of $176 million.
The allocation of real estates and barriers has been made to Paul as a problem point.
"The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I kept for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first embidavit.
On Friday last, several misleading convictions took place on the first hearing of the Chief Court of Justice.
The brothers are now fighting for the control of the existing business - where Colin said that Paul had excluded him.
Colin argued that this is not true, but Paul suggests to manage some facilities incompatible.
In a former Imperiavit who was invited by Colin, he says he hoped to join the fight.
"My Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority," he wrote.
The costs are increased in the case, with hundreds of sides with Postidavits, E-mails and reports of companies, including deloittes, pitcher partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and of both sides of lawyers.
Ms. De Lutis and her dying marriage Luigi were the Italian immigrants who operated in the 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventy-year-olds.
They used the security to buy the Collingwood license in Colin opened the first Jean load of the family.
Colin says he began there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (only 10 years old).
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi died in 2012 hoped to continue their ownership to their children.
"Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers before the court of the country," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis Undertaking Group, which Colin claims that Mark was paid at the leave of the company $10 million and $26 million.
Even though Lukas and Mark are, Paul says: "It has been prohibited by the conditions of their financial division."
Colin departed very much, although he was an former AFL foreground member and after a biografie from 2015 by Eddie McGuire of the best friend of the television.
Fairfax Media took Colin and Paul De Lutis and their advocates contact.
Only Colin answered by SMS to say "I can't really say much," because it's the case before the courts.
"It's very sorrowful that my brother Paul has decided to resolve me and to move our family names through the courts," he wrote.
In mid 2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfil the requests of his brother.
"Our father wouldn't want Paul and I would have ended in our current war," he said to add that he was "against to a solution."
On Friday, this hope seemed to be ended.
"Our affair will be removed by the courts in close future," wrote Colin.
Trumps plants new stamps to reduce the media attitude of the President.
Others tried it and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it actually.
If yes, he'll be the first.
Political reports that the new stage of the white house plans to include the information flow to President Trump - including the reports of the media - in hope to keep the head on an equal course.
Here's a part of reporter Josh Dawsey:
"When John F. Kelly, the new stage of the white house, joined his first working day with leaders, he made a major problem in President Donald Trumps white house, which he wished to repair: bad information in the hands of the President.
Kelly said to the employees that information should be made on him - whether on paper or in letters - because the President would take better decisions if he would receive good information."
Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to secure Trump by monitoring his medicine.
The President Trumps relations to television is just ten years back - and now where he's in the white house, his television is still strong.
"When Candidat Trump was enhanced because of an unfair report refund, it was productive to show him that he received a fair report refund of offices to be convinced," said the former electoral partner Sam Nunberg in February.
Political Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that "the key to keep Trumps Twitter accommodation, according to six former electoral campaigns, is to ensure that his personal media consumption contains a steadily lobby".
Okay.
But the idea that Trumps Twitter accommodation has ever been "sub control" is deep.
Maybe these campaigns know something that we don't know others - that Trumps Tweets had contained more drunk materials without their interventions.
We will probably never learn about the seconds that Trump hasn't sent.
If his employees had made it some time to keep worse from him, then their efforts were made.
But no one could prevent it as a result that Trump is calling for controverses.
A part of the problem is that people in a white house which are combined from competitive parties are always trying to forward their own agenda by presenting Trump material, which may promote their views from the world.
Politics - fully employed with this story - reported on the intentions of the advisers to the President of strategic reasons.
This was an example described by reporters Shane Goldmacher:
"Usually the current and former tromp officers say that Trump can react as a volcano on negative press sets, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he is hidden about where they are.
The same end of February, when someone welcomed a printed copy of a article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Prosecutor Charles C. Johnson, who accused the designed stabsh fin Katie Walsh to be "the source to be behind a call from Lecks" in the white house.
Although Johnson was permanently dismissed from Twitter or he didn't offer concrete evidence or he expressed false prejudices in the past.
Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh."
Goldmacher added that the reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter, "requested to implement a system to manage the paper screen and documentate the Trump."
How did it do?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.
Maybe he will be demonstrated as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impotential itself, and his advisers still strive after influence.
These unchange factors make Kellys mission very difficult.
Received most flatters Post of Europol
As the address is unknown, the support of the population will be granted and demanded.
Police is sent to this summer (virtual) post cards to dangerous crimes on the flight.
Since the addresses of the searched fresh frequencies are naturally not known, the population's reports will be removed and worshiped.
Europol reported on Friday of the action followed by the "EU Most Scheed" inventory of the winter.
Experiences would have shown that many refugees were hidden in vacant detentions, it was the following Europol.
21 post cards for searchers from 21 EU countries have been gathered.
Since 2016 there is the www.eumostwanted website, more than 2.5 million times this site has been seen.
36 of the online visits could be determined, at least eleven of them based on the basis of information after the publication on the website.
Return negotiations about a grave and return to 'Milionary River'
Some of the most pleasant households of the West Midlands are returned with some decisive travelers at the war board negotiated by one of the community's graves to call for a field before their masters.
The travelers have paid their 20 rental cars in a field outside a pleasant road of Solihull, which is called "Milleonary Reihe".
They have brought horses, babys and a arm of transporters after they were earlier out in May, but without being deleted from one buried by the Council to prevent their accidents.
The tangible group found a lie in the defence offices and pressed its vehicles by a section left unprecedented to find a way.
Society people have threatened the Solihull Council, who said that it was "ust to address the problem."
One anonymous inhabitant said: "They were brought to the Montaguedn after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passors.
The Council has to be advised by shame to implement the facts, since it was inevitably useful.
The travelers were there in May, were moved and now returned.
More at last evening, probably more today."
She added: "The Birmingham Council knows how it is about by keeping long instructions to protect their parks.
I live on the streetbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my community tax if the Council can not even stop it."
A resident who didn't want to be called said, "It's obvious, we've just seen the last round of these travelers, just to be paid by another road.
The numbers have been increased this time and have even seen a horse in the park area."
One of the Solihull Council's speakers said: "We are a unprofit campaign on the country beyond the streetbrook Road and work together with the Solihull police. We take the necessary legal steps to continue as soon as possible.
To support our evidence collection, it is very important that most of the inhabitants may report an anti-social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101.
This aims at creating a picture of the situation in which the court must check when we are present."
From Birkenhof is Waldhotel Luise
The Waldhotel Luise is the former Hotel Birkenhof.
The house before the gates of joy City is currently renewed and will be opened again on 1 March next year.
That's good news for the city.
Since the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the timely ambient company mbH at April 13, 2014, its time was lost about 30,000 overviews per year and also receipts by the Kurtaxes.
In the last of 2014, it was dramaticly higher numbers of refugees who came into the countrycree, the hotel's accommodation offered as a collective accommodation, which was provided for controverse discussions.
The city prevented the submission of asylum providers by establishing a construction plan to ensure the area as a hotel location.
The decision was not in the municipal Council at one time.
But especially in the city of the Supreme Minister Julian Oswald defended the location of the hotel and spoke of serious interests at the house.
He should keep the right.
The group Luisenhotels with business directorin Birgit Scheere with Sitz in Bad Bergzabern has bought the former hotel Birkenhof with voluntary destruction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three stars-Plus catalogue under the name of Waldhotel Luise.
The group has four houses with the joyful town object.
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.
You call Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.
In the previous hotel Birkenhof, a long time of building container is already before the entrance, and when you enter into the house, it will clearly be taken by numerous renovation work.
The pools were built out, covers for part, old bathrooms from the rooms.
The whole hotel is a unique building.
To March there are still much to do.
"It's really a beautiful hotel," says Thomas Schere in conversation with our newspaper.
Everything should be renewed in the blackwald style.
The rooms are equipped with large accommodated ducks, which will be built in the entrance area, and new windows will be built.
Everything later must be "pleasant bridgenah", as Thomas Schere expressed.
"We want to make a shock."
Swimming pool, Wellness area and a meeting area includes the allocation.
You don't want to place on the high level of hotels in Lauter Bad, but already on a high-lood inner city-Niveau, high-speaking screen.
The Waldhotel Luise, with its 60 rooms, wants to be widely made, further explained cheaps.
Although individual vacants, groups or business officers must feel likely in the hotel.
Discussions with OB Julian Oswald and Director of Tourism Michael Krause, he's already carried out.
The ideas of the city are equal to which the hotel group.
We're on the same line.
Following the height of investments, Thomas Schere does not wish to fix exactly.
It's under a million euros, he's calling.
External installations are also brought on front-man, that is clearly visible.
In a internal court, a large terrace that is from the restaurant that is public will be available.
Thomas Scheare is optimistic: "Freudenstad is a good market."
Russian Officer: US Special Ministers sets a Great Jury
In the Russian Office of the US President Donald Trump, the Special Committeer Robert Mueller has established a so-called Great Jury after a report.
In the past few weeks the Group took the work, the "All Street Journal" wrote under vocation to people who were confessed with the case.
The newspaper noted the step as a sign that Mueller has extended and intensified its statements.
The CNN senter reported that there are first invitations of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between the old son of Trumps and a Russian advocate.
US Secret Services accused the creaml for more long in the 2016 presidency election camp.
Mueller studied whether there were discussions between Trumps' choice team and Moscow.
In the context of the summits, several men who acted in the election camp should be a consultant of the Republicanor.
Following reports, Mueller also took more and more Trumps of private and occupational environment under the lupe.
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Middleman Trump had pressed personally in the Centre and investigated the prejudice whether the President had probably dismissed the Justice in the course of the cases.
The main instruction of Grand Jury is to examine evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether proceedings should be made up.
The Great Jurys will therefore be called complaints.
Better they will be enabled if it is a major and contraverse case.
The procedure continues to follow closed doors.
In addition, the group can be included by the State authority to invite persons to disappearance.
According to the sender CNN, there are already invitations issued to congratulation between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian advocate.
The report contains those who were involved in the meeting, as requested by an explanation.
They should also prepare documents.
Besides Trump Jr., Trumps and Swiss sohn Jared Kushner, and his timely election campaign Paul Manafort in the conversation.
The legal experts said in the Thursdays of the US windows that the establishment showed that Muellers wouldn't undermine themselves in his work and that, if it was necessary, he wanted to act quickly.
But it should not be obvious that the Grand Jury will be enabled at the end to decide about the enlargement of an accusation.
However, the establishment of the group of the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for the concern for President Trump.
In the new enthusiasm, the President used a talk in Western Virginia to make Russian officers as a campaign of his political gentlemen.
"The Russian story is an overall heavy," said Trump.
The topic gives the democrates a chance to "spond good because they have nothing else about which they can talk."
His special officer Ty Cobb explained in a opinion, he knew nothing of the establishment of a Great Jury.
But it also usually worked in secrets, he revealed.
The white house encourages any measures that accelerate the work of the Special Messagingers on "faire" way.
The former FBI Chef James Comey said three times that it would not be determined against the President.
There is no reason to accept that something has been amended to this, but it is further in the declaration.
But Mueller was used first after Trump Comey had eating.
Because of this rauswurf, the warrants were mocked against Trump, he wanted to disappear the justice.
Comey said in June before a Senate Committee, Trump asked him for a settlement against the national security officer of Michael Flynn.
The President is on the basis of the investigation under great pressure.
Following US media, the white house was gathered against special media and its employees.
The most outstanding speculations of whether Trump Mueller has left the desire.
In other words, as an independent specialist of the Congress, such as the Watergate Office for the later returned President Richard Nixon, Mueller has made a position in which he could be theoretic to the terms of the President of the Minister of Justice.
More senators of both parties want such a step but they want to predict.
Two groups of Republic and Democratic Senators presented on Thursday's Declaration on which the Special Medicator could not be so easily solved.
Antarktis: Gigantic Eisberg is located in the Antarctic
In the Westantarktis, a huge island was removed from the nearly seven-fold size of Berlin from the board.
The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Sea Research on Wednesday.
The over a Billion tone is hard and 5800 square kilometres great coloss is in northern and will probably need two, three years until he's been stubborn.
It is 175 kilometers long and a width of up to 50 kilometers of the largest iceans registered by researchers in the past three decades.
There is no danger for people from him.
As the climate change has played a role at the breaking of the island, it is unlawful after research instructions.
However, in total, for about 30 years, a series of iron pearls in the region has been set in the US research centre for snow and ice (NIDC) in a fair reason.
In view of many researchers, this may be able to join the earthquake.
The coloss that has now been a part of the Larsen-C-sheat.
The shining feed shoots on the sea, and it is sweared by great gloves.
It is so that it is still growing in the sea and is regularly exploring.
The Larsen-C shape is southern from South America nearly on the side of the antarctic Halbinsel.
Northernly, this feast was the balance of guns and abrupts before some years.
A complete bottle was broken there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.
Some are talking about the fact that the Larsen-C shape fee is in danger, because the previous Kante has never returned so far as it is now.
Furthermore, the iron drive grows under swimming and can be broken, if a piece is broken on a key place.
The mixture of skin feeds and iceberg does not increase the sea level, since it shoots on the water and the iron destroys so many waters, as it seems to be self-shake.
However, the loss of the feed leads that the gletchers are directly moving in the sea and can be more faster than before.
This could have increased the level of the sea, however, only in a lower measure, the British research project is written to observe antarktis (Midas).
The Larsen C-S-Free is after AWI indications with almost 50 000 square kilometres the fourth larger weight of the antarktis.
At the transition of the festival, it is dick to 700 meters, to the front quarter to the free ocean, about 200 meters.
It's a regular end of it.
"Although it is a natural event and no direct connection is known to us to climate change, the railway comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary by the British Swansea University.
"This is the pleasant return since the beginning of the appointments," he also confirmed.
For scientists, his colleague Adrian Luckman said: "Our models say that it will be less stability."
But this development will take a decade.
Even though these researchers do not return to the climate change in this huge island, in the past decades, many iron cells of the antarctic semi-binsel are destroyed.
This long cycle of the antarktis is stretched towards South America.
According to the research programme, British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Halbinsel has returned to 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.
The temperature increase has been reduced.
The Antarctic Halbinsel has risen in the past 50 years around three degrees and has counted the areas in which temperature grows faster.
CCDU wants personal home tariff
Because it is always more difficult to establish free offices, the CDU requests to get more attractive.
The first time before the summer pause, the round of 41 new places in the management.
More than 1100 officials and officers work for the environment manager in Mettmann.
Now, there are more than 17 examining their first working day behind.
The learnings in the environment are clearly aware of.
Along 620 reviews were to describe the places to be delivered in this year.
However, there is no further staff in order to address the duty requirements and tasks.
Now there are no places in the round mettmann after 50 years ago.
Other doctors and engineering are visited as well as powers of the general management.
The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the round day and to meet the training manager in the management.
The manager must develop a concept for personal gap and personal development according to the desire of the parties.
The goal is not only to discover short-term needs for professional forces but to affect access to the comprehensiveness, it means.
The overall concept should be directed inside and outside, opening concrete actions for cylinders and maintenance of training, require CDU, FDP and UWG.
This is a good approach.
Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know so early.
Other towns will leave good offices and orders and provide more attractive conditions.
The talk is of a regulatory rights "Certainment of the public employer".
A high number of employees that differ from the service of disease or older condition.
So, the highest time to act so that there are no longer places in order to remain unfair.
However, Klaus-Dieter people, the CCD Group Chief, is still out of the common request.
He was so long in the round day for a false surprise when he put the personal cost delays publicly in question and the rest of the parties.
People want to verify all possibilities that allow a exit from the Common Working Labor.
"When we come here shortly to a satisfactory solution, the circuit management with the company should be able to endeavour a home tariff with the created cities," said people.
The CDU is attempting to pay better the officials and officials when it is actually the tax regulation for the public service.
The holders are currently exactly prescribed, increased or more money only if they are changed to a higher level, directed to professional years.
But the tasks of the environment have always grown in the past years.
For a few weeks ago, new rooms had to be established in order to protect the prostituted prostituted laws.
Not last by the increased number of asylum providers, the Landrat Thomas Hendele and the Environment Director Martin Judger has a problem: you have too little staff.
Italy raises the sound of NGO Migrant Responsement Boats
Italy has warned NGOs to use the delivery boat for migrants in the Mediterranean, that they cannot continue this if they do not keep new rules for their operations.
"When NGOs don't sign the new behaviour code, it's difficult to see how they can continue," said the Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin Day Time La Print.
Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had proposed a boat of the German helps organization "Jugend Resttet" because their mansion effectively cooperated with human men in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.
The aid organization, which has been in operation for a year, allowed to explanate the executive prejudices of the Italian State Law Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, and remains the rescue of human life our highest priority, so we are very sorry that we can not operate in the area of search and salvation," the organization said in a opinion to the social media.
"We can assess all of the accused that are currently entitled to assess once we have collected all the information and can assess the situation."
The Italian authorities had the ship of "Jugend Resttet" that Iuventa was watching since October.
It will be regrettable that his order to slaughter migrants take on boat that are directly delivered to them from human hampers, and that the smugglers can get off so that the ships can be reused.
At least, such a meeting was just 1,3 miles before the Libyan coast, in accordance with the Act of State Auditors, whose content of Italian media was published.
The design is desperated to monitor the authority of Italian coast monitoring, rescue rates in the area from humanitarian reasons and not from any other reasons.
Under the behaviour code, boats such as Iuventa must have a Italian police officer at boat that monitors their activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue rates have been prepared to keep the code: Save the children, MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.
Last Thursday said that the new rules would be unnecessary but acceptable, since they would not bring "entry changes or disasters" with them.
Those who refuse to sign themselves shall be the Nobel Price Organization of Doctors without limits (MSF).
Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived after salvation measures in Italy had been strongly returned in the past weeks, and that the efforts were made to strengthen the Libyan Coast Watch and cooperation with the local citizens.
"In the last days we started see the light at the end of the tunnel," said the Minister.
He gave plans for further discussions with citizens of Liberia in this month on economic development initiatives and with tchad, niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that have left these countries in hope to achieve Europe.
Railways and trials
New Weilermer Biker, the "Berliner External Positions" and two guests were in Wachenheim in the northern floor to enjoy four days of trials and seen worthities.
Three pleasant leaders were available.
The accommodation in Wachenheimer Tal appeared as a good starting point for the tours.
Wachenheim's village and vineyard was a welcome extra.
The first tour has led to the highest temperatures of the vine to Michael's headquarter above God's home.
It was followed with views, partly on tours, which could be seen far over the forest and the plans set out.
In that case, there were always a longer attempt for those long trials.
On the second day, he went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and the Great Worst Market.
The point of view was revealed to the point of view, linked by "flow" trials and moderate attitudes.
During the last two days, a number of metres of heights were recovered again.
Holes, stones, tours, burdens, ruins and homes are welcome patients.
In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers in the Lift Inhalator are awesome sun.
Neusstadt was also controlled.
After 173 kilometres and almost 4 500 metres of height, the group had the animal forest from his best side - sports and cultural - knowing.
Console instead of Rasen - Bundesliga is enriched for E-port
Are the sports future for computer consoles, instead of fighting wind and weather over the stadioners?
The fact is: E-sport is long to a serious sector, becomes a luxury business - large stars, millions facs and huge tours with high gases included.
It also has recognized the first Federal Trusts that are increasingly involved in this area.
On the beginning of 2015, the VfL Wolfsburg, later, followed the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, which founded a E-sport Division and took two provisions for the computer game FIFA 17.
"We hope to listen to all new young target groups for the VFB," says Jochen Röttgermann.
He's sure that there's still some truths on this journey.
The next weekend of the FIFA football world connection in London organizes the first "Interactive World Cup Club", in which the Gamers of different clubs arrived against each other.
Besides Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-German or the PSV Endhovens have been qualified.
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in the e-port.
The ex-trainer by Bayer Leverkusen and Whore Bremen offers an agent for virtual football players.
"The real football must be combined with the 14-30-year-olds that youths are still going in the future", says the 52-year-old.
And: The truths tried to erod all possible markets, especially the Asians.
With a perminent E-porteurs under the treaty, weitaus may be present in advance on these markets only once in the year to send the Federal Federal Managing Society to Asia.
Why is it exact?
In the e-port, computer games such as "League Of Legends", "Dota 2", "Counterstrike" or the football simulation FIFA at competition levels.
Longs have been, like in normal sports, deablized lips in which the prophecy is attracted against each other.
And at the Asian games, E-port is already part of the official program.
But is it a right sport type?
For many, the idea is safely needed.
Ingo Froböse also has been a long time with the question.
For professors at the German sportschool in Cologne, E-port is a sport, because he is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in the classic sport - for example increased heart frequencies, stress reactions, hormonal changes.
It also needs coherent capacity, technical and tactical understanding and rapid reaction capacity.
Professional Gamers should not only train their body and look at food.
"The fit player is a good player."
Frobose also sees problems: "Doping will always be a subject."
Controls are difficult in online games and in the center lacked the structures of the classic sport.
The scientist has the high integrative effect of the E-port.
The players are under way international, that is like a great global family, there is no intercultural disappearances.
A study of the Deloitte and Federal Relations Interactive Communications Software (BIU) said to the E-Proport a rare growth.
In Germany, 50 million euros are used, mostly about advertising, sponsoring and large tourists.
In three years, the expenditure is 130 million.
In contrast to the knapp 2.4 billion euros of the football boundary, it is little.
However, the e-port "not far far than the other designed sports, such as Handball, Basketball or Eishockey," write the deloitte workshops.
There are already many countries.
Great markets are Asia and the United States, where Ex-Basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NRG eSports.
Hollywood School player Ashton Kutcher invested in the eSport Weban provider Unikrn.
There is also some of us in Europe.
In a Norwegian school, E-sport has been introduced as a simply, Froböse says.
In the Netherlands and France, the football primary verses are obligation to establish an E-port department.
"In the European comparison, Germany is behind", says VfB-Vorstand Röttgermann.
Only to disappear in Nostalgie, and to explain the old times, it is not easy today.
It is important to keep the tradition of the agreement, but it is also the company to operate in the modern market.
"We live in a digitalised world," also says Dutt.
"It can't be sure that only at football remains everything as it was always."
Gift-ove ade - Ei-alternatives to cock and back
From the scanal around donated oxen are nearly affected by almost all the federal countries.
Aldi South and Aldi North have reacted and has taken all the oxen from the sale.
The regulations should only be taken for ox, which obviously not contained fipronil.
Michelle Carters because of the text that Conrad Roy condemns for self-assassin
A woman of Massachusett was condemned by two half years because she had encouraged her friend by texts and calls to self - murder.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will be delivered after 15 months of their appointment and five years have been assured.
Carter was condemned in June because of the dangerous death of Conrad Roy, who took life on 13 July 2014.
The father of Roy said on Thursday to hear: "My family is insolent.
My son was my best friend."
Carter stayed free until calling.
She was confronted with a highest age of 20 years, but she argued that both Mr. Roy had a psychic disease.
In red holes and a cream colorful blause clothed, Carter stood there with dreams in the eyes, with smooth hands and in downward eyes when she was condemned.
"They have killed Conrad Roy," said the State advocate to the court.
"It guessed her life to make her own better.
She has no responsibility," she said.
"It didn't show a reverence."
But Carter's lawyer said that it's a "country circumstance that they are fully worried".
But the judge Lawrence Moniz said he didn't find that you have an important impact on their acts.
A lawyer read a statement by Roys Mother Lynn Roy, who said that there was no day in which I do not trust the loss of my loved son.
I want him to be boasting on me, and how I'm going to go around with all. I try, although all my pain that we are to bear with us forever, it says it.
Roys sister, Camdyn Roy, said she would be a "continued" by the knowledge that she will never participate in the wedding of her brother or would be a tante for her children.
"No more have this only person I had been together every day since my birth, is a pain that I will keep for the rest of my life always with me," she said.
It seems to be a legal predecessary case, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to invite another to be murdered.
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found to die from a coal monoxide disappearance in a vehicle.
The case focused on the national attention after Carter’s text communications found that she had encouraged him to end his life.
"Stay up, spring from a building, first me myself, I don't know there's many ways," she said in several news she sent her in the two weeks before his death, while he was with his family in vacation.
At the moments before her own murder, she wrote: "You must do it, Conrad" and "All that you have to do is to set up the generator and you will be free and happy."
The judge Moniz said Carter's attention was looking for Roy's death and commanded her to benefit through any press of the case.
The case has divided the legal opinion.
The few Carters defended were Amanda Knox, who was condemned in 2007 because of murder for her British fellowship in Italy before it was released two years ago.
Mrs. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter provides compassion and help, not prison."
Joshua Kimmich: Learn from the new Lamb of the FC Bayern
The Joshua Kimmich has stopped at Audi Cup as a captain, there is no case.
The FC Bayern has a great time to the Confed-Cup Seeger - Extra mobilization does not harm there.
Something was different on his place in the Kabine, which Joshua Kimmich saw immediately, even if the additional clothes were very small.
But when far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cups, of course, had not been to see Philip Lahm and not even manuel news, he made his shared gun standing on his arm.
"The trainer hasn't announced it," said the Confed-Cup Seeler behind, according to his first use as Bayern Captain.
Well, that's better to run than at 0:2 against the SSC Neapel.
But the signs of the Coach could also describe Kimmich.
Not the eight-year-old Arturo Vidal was elected in the young players, deputys and just from the vacation Professional Professional Elf as a player, but he was elected.
The most lovely ones are distributed to those who have a lot of confidence that want to keep milk.
Thus, who has been exempt to join the heritage of Lahm can only use a small extra mobilization.
Kimmich confirmed: "This is what you want to take for as a player: responsibility."
On Wednesday, the 22-year-old fled over the field.
Right down, now it's his position, the white bridge on the arm made her breasts.
And above all, Kimmich actually operated in this startformat, such as the one who can also take the ruder the best in the hand.
He gave instructions, tried to lay down the none played troppe.
He had the look for a whole while many others were working with himself.
It is important to translate his lacking fitness (lacked); Renato Sanches is so that the devil comes out to the performances of Asian roads (laught also only); and Sebastian Rudy and Niclas Sillae Sillae not to fall in their first attack in the Bayern Tricot.
That's still fine.
Shele moved near Kimmich, Rudy opened before the Abbown, both acters sovereign.
The weakenly dedicated Napoli turm was often hard, also tried to skills also a couple of times successful in the building of the game.
His colleague Rudy said that the result was "not as we tried this."
But he also showed a ordinary performance during the deployment.
Game change, time change: "For this style I've also been captured."
As unhabited this Bayern world is still for the reuse, you've seen the party closely.
For example, Rudy did not give one or two in the cat, but determined six or seven interviews.
Kimmich accepted a few cracking outcomes at the back of his new players.
There he heard a interesting sentence from Süle: "What's going on here, I've already noted.
You just have to win every game at Bayern."
Always, he shouldn't help the news.
Alaba motivated EFB services
David Alaba believes the success of our EFB Damen
Austrian's most famous footballer has reported shortly before the game on Twitter and wants the EFB Damen's all good.
The Bayern Legionary is already nearly club colleagues of EFB Captain Schnaderbeck and fits with our ladys.
The second of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champion League memory should be a special motive rate.
The famous Bayern dull may also need our dames well.
Business satisfied with Rheinland-Feries Minister: Economy Loves Wissings time
It was often unrealised that the relationship between the country and the regional economy was as Eveline Lemke (Green) and the Minister of Economics of Rheinland.
This shows more than one year in which the new Economic Minister of Popular Wissing (FDP) is at the office.
Rooms and enterprises from the region speak on the question of T V a change in economic policy - and the former ministers are at the same time.
Frank Natus, President of the Trier Unternehmen (VTU), says, "Wissing turns on the desires of the economy that the lemke has allly blocked."
The larger curriculum is Natus in the infrastructure policy: the smoke of the railway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now in the priority list of the country.
In this year, the Ministry will take place on a planning procedure until 2021.
A role in the plans of the country also plays the Western environment Trier, which is on the prior need of the Federal Transport Plan.
The goal is to operate the street in December 2020 says Minister's speaker Cornelia Holtmann.
Natus is a way to support regional but international competitive enterprises.
The Industry and Trade Chamber (IHK) Trier strives, such as Wissing advised, to the wine a Rheinland-Pfalz Label to increase the superm markets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports since ten years.
Furthermore, Wissing has an open ear for people who want to found a own company, the IHK.
The Handwork Chamber Trier is in the new Master Buonus an additional intrigue for young educators, says the Manager Mathias Schwalbach.
A premium of 1000 euros for the master audits and 2500 euros is self-resolved within 10 years after the master education.
The list of house-reservations for the country remains long.
In the planned road construction, the country is fast to create facts, even though it does not miss the country on the needed staff, Jan Glockauer says, the Chief Manager of IHK Trier.
From 56 new engineers who want to establish Widing in the country operation mobility have been set up until 29 places.
The IHK requests to deliver more charges to external offices.
CDU-Frakationvice Christian Baldauf refers to the calculations of the Court of Auditors, which invests the country 2017 and 2018 less than 20 million euros in the relevance of countrystraßes as proposed.
Frank Natus also expects a country's concept, as it wants to address the factory of the region.
Furthermore, the wide-band construction in the country is the country.
In 2016, regional enterprises had been evaluated in a IHK survey only with Note 3,4.
They are evaluated about storeing Internet connections and browsers.
Ex Minister of Employment Eveline Lemke is now out of the policy and remains in the supervision Council of Wind power Pro Wind.
The Green group left Lemke to April to become President of a private school in Karlsruhe, where she had regained the field after four months because of immoralities.
Audi will change 850,000 these vehicles - car manufacturers are contrary to the contraaction
One day before the Audi announcement, BMW said that it would offer the software to update more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW Chairperson said that the company was thinking that "the more intelligent options are available as a trail limit", and focused on European cities, including currencies where BMW is safe, to deliver or restrict these vehicles.
Daimler was known on Sunday that there would be three million Mercedes factories in Europe to reduce these emissions.
No of the undertakings described the appeal as a call.
The European car producers have strongly encouraged the use of these vehicles in Europe and the United States to support the compliance of the rules for carbon carbon emissions.
But the steeloxides that emitt these motors are used as carcinogenics and can cause asthma.
The costs for car producers to install devices for reutralization of extracted gases from these vehicles are also taking into account what is difficult to keep the prices of the cars.
The German Federalkanzans Angela Merkel will also appeal to prevent the powerful carfires and ignore the signs of the problem.
The enterprises try to avoid people's errors that have been used for the use of so-called removal devices that could regulate emissions to keep the rules if a car has been discovered but back in normal vehicle conditions.
In the United States, several of the people's cars were accurated, others will be studied on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former leader of the thermodynamic was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany.
The former manager, Zaqueo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected before delivery and could be made before judgment in the United States.
At the beginning of this year, Audi was introduced in German criminal communications to the people's cars after accused of having a system installed to implement emission rules in Europe, and an application focused on the United States was extended.
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could cause people's car difficulty: The Luxus car manufacturer offers overportal to win from people's cars.

Mordillo's knollenas and the laugh against suffering
Mordillo was a timely one of the most published cartoon characters, the nouns of his figus are his marks.
The Argentine also includes the 85s and works on a film.
His message: weeping, "for there's too much affliction in the world."
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4th, 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrant in Buenos Aires.
In the first years he killed himself as an artist, among others as a desker for lucky cards.
"The most happy day in my vocational life was the day when he lost my job," he said once.
After stations in Lima, New York and Paris, he reached his end of the 60th years of the breakfast: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match" and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.
Even in China, Mordillo found many Fans.
The artists are always read again in inspiring cities.
Gross, round-up murder figures are gathered in diagnostics with the craft Turm of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the red place in Moscow.
On the morning, he is still working on the table today, almost ten hours of day.
About calendars, Puzzles, books for green and small, T-shirts, plunders and watches, they will continue to be a lot of dissemination in the world.
Since six years, he worked on a sign trick film and a TV series with his figures.
The main person in the film "Crazy Island" is a Giraffe - Mordillos loved animal in its samples - which has a thousand of players as counter player.
First of all, his figures are talking to the 3D filter, which should come to the knolein bathroom.
"I don't know exactly what they're going to say, it's strange for me," Mordillo said.
The Draw book is not written of him.
This is why he is more on the TV series, which is produced, such as its original names, freely.
Lavendel is threatened from climate change
He became a symbol of the province in South Africa, but there is a warning that he was threatened by climate change.
The Lavendel is deprived because of the conditions mentioned to drought and because of the diseases transferred, what scientists and farmers try to find solutions is prepared for great damage.
Eric Chasse, expert of the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in the Province, said: "The Lavendel in the province is effectively dangerous because the plant has been earned the impact of climate change, which has caused much less rain in the past year and is much more.
This has an impact on the lifetime of Lavendel.
There is also a small cicade, a microbaterium that translates twergcycade, and there are many of them in very dry weather."
And it's a lot on the game.
Lavendel oil not only applies to vacants, it is very asked for parfüm and cosmetics.
Eric Chasse said: "Instead of a very long plant with a large number of flowers, we have more small, developed and missed or disappeared.
So we have less parts with etery oil."
The solutions taken in consideration include a better water distribution and the acceleration of disappearance from the ground but also the tests of plants with a protected mixture from tonn and water and the development of sorts that are more resistent to drought.
The city of Geisa in the Turkish Rön is its 1200-year-old substance.
The fixing point is that Saturday and Sunday with a Mediterranean feast.
Foreigners, tens, feeders, warrants, warrants or a landscape must be in these days.
The killing of a journalist stresss the growing threat in Mexico
The workers of the week period of Riodoce usually take place in the middle of their plans for reporting the recent Chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organized crimes, corrupt officials and uncontrolled drug wars.
But that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.
It was reported to them that it was important to change their routines.
Two high-range journalists discuss what feels more safe: you should take their children to the office who were the target of a attack with Granaten or leave them home.
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front side of the room: Genger, Neutrale, devoted.
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, acceptance and building feelings.
There are drug smugglers, politicians, business leaders, journalists who are defended to stand on the Government's contents or cards, a catalogue of pollutions that make the Chaos of Mexico danger.
There is no rest of violence, and while the bodys are sold throughout the country are always more journalists: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Neo had come to its office in December 2012. 589 are under attacks and drugs under federal protection and until now there were at least seven dead in seven States.
The latter is its producer and its inspirer of Riodoce, the Master Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The greatest error is to live in Mexico and to be journalist," said Valdez in one of his numerous books about violence in the connection with drugs.
His fault is deeply affected, although his presence is in all parts - a great photo of Valdez, which shows his medium finger with the word "Justice", stands at the Fassade of the Riodoce Year. Two reporters in the thirty years, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, bear T-Shirts, shown its slight face with brille or its typical Panamahut.
The workshop will find more than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the dreams, their alptrooms, sleeplessness, Paranoia.
Although 2010 has been established a special Budget Administration to edit the cases of journalists, the Committee has introduced only two criminal procedures for the protection of journalists.
Like the most thousands of murders that are connected to drug trade and organized crimes, the murder of journalists will only be sent to court.
In Riodoce, they still have to treat the violence of Sinaloa, although they are insolent and although the terrain is now more corrupt.
Without information about murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security has little benefits, says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to destroy my time in this workshop," he said.
"When we don't know why, we're all missed."
On May 15, Valdez left the Office of the Zeitung Riodoce in the town of Culiacan.
He just made it to go a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was arrested by two men. He was moved out of his car and 12 times on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which was translated with "Tweight Foot Fluss".
The shield went out of his car and laid it nearly.
Valdez was 50 years old.
He left a woman and two adult children.
Indeed, in Culiacan's free circumstances.
But Valdez's topic is practically nothing like weakness.
Sinaloa, since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the delivery to the United States in January, became one of the most blowest flags of the country, where rivalizing groups were fighting here to fill the Vacuum.
There is nothing to say that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people will be killed on the street or that the Peacehof is full of sended, twice massives for drugs, which are greater than many houses for life.
Remember for a minute that there is a state of the "Rue" if only a card has the control of the coast State with its valued ports and drug drug roads in the United States.
Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the danger of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a fellow manager and director of Riodoce, destroyed the fault that he could not protect his friend.
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.
First in February, there was an interview with Damaasso Lopez, a manager of one of the revalising card fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.
This publication may have enhanced the sons, the drunken Gang members bought each example of the expenditures as soon as they were delivered to newskisk.
The second error was not to deal with Valdez after the adoption of another newspaper that had published the same story to leave the country to its own security.
Valdez was a lie in Mexico and foreign, and his death is considered as a mile stone in the Mexicon violence against journalists.
He had been surviving so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.
He worked as a learning reporter for Norway when he concluded with five colleagues to create Riodoce and sold participations for 50 US Dollar.
In Sinaloa, "although it's impossible to conduct journalism without deploying the problem of raw shooting," said Bojorquez.
With time, the newspaper received a call because of the courageous and honest report refund, and the switch and publication.
The reporters liked it to be able to publish hard investigations without fear of Zensur, and the readers were designed by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody had to be treated.
Eight years after the creation of Riodoce, she received the predominant "Maria-Moors-Cabot-Preis" for her reporting in Latin America.
In the same year, Valdez won the "International Press Freedom Award" of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his encouragement at the persecution of the Mexican Drug story, wherevery had been conducted.
He voluntary said he was afraid.
"I want to continue," he said at the time of the CPJ signature.
Drug trade in Sinaloa "is a life way," he said in the past October in an interview with Rompeeveno-TV.
"You have to take the task that pleases you as a journalist - either that or you're playing the dumps.
I don't want to be asked, "What have you done so many dead... why didn't you say what happened?"
The Riodoce Team lost Valdez, the funeral bottle, who could flood as a portal worker, the friend, who was greatly with relaxation and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.
They trust his routines.
He'd always bear his hair.
He'd always go to El Guayabo, the bar in front of the office, and there he's always sitting on the same table.
Now they ask: Was his love for Routine his death?
His death also encouraged her own adoptions to ask how they can best implement their work and stay in life.
"You don't like if you're going to move drugs with their wives, their children, their cleaning business, their secret starting and country trains," to move drugs.
"This things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.
The result is, even in the best times, a high measure of self-sensitive and self-defence.
Trust their own institutions.
If it's wrong, stay away.
The worse is, the producer of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "There a sense that can be drunk... and then the thing happened to Javier."
The old rules, as he says, are no longer in Sinaloa - not just as in Tamaulipas, Deacruz, Guerrero and other States where a damage of luxury misconceptions, weak institutions and corrupt government officers is home.
Agriculture is constantly changed.
In the room where the employers of Riodoce had not been allowed for the security training, there was no mobiles that before it was known that the Skinware was sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and actives in Mexico.
Draws were looking for two policemen's protection before the hit of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a building.
They were forced by the country government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a fourth building in a Mediterranean class Value of Culiacan.
Half of the sharp, some of the reporters asked whether these officers were the 50 percent of the policeers, which the Governor himself was not confidenceable.
There are months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape where drug drugs are under the fact.
For the output of this week, Riodoce looked on three main stories.
There was a murder of the brother of the former known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.
They also had an exhibition to the State expenditure focused on the city of the Governors.
And there was a group who led a removal in one of the most swimming restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the State Resident.
There was no official word about who was released or as it was done, so it was ordered to write time that everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drugs and authorities.
A reporter had reported from public names that the restaurant was registered in the name of a policyist, who heard the governmental institutional revolution Party (PRI), which almost controlled all the world of the political levels.
Several PRI governings were recently accused because of high-carriage cases.
Villarreal asked the reporter to write on previous cases in this local local, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman has been a military accident.
Only a few months ago, the readers had seen the columns of Valdez as the best informed source about the introduction.
"We had already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the name "El Flaco" because of his sleeved body.
"Today, all the channels of communication are broken with our sources."
Valdez's office was to maintain the space for signs and clothes protest against the murder of journalists, because the employers had become something that they had never been expecting: assets in the name of the press.
The reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went the next morning to a demonstration because of another journalist to the Office of the State Auditor.
Salvador Adame has changed three days after Valdez was killed, in the Western Federal State of Michoacan.
A burned body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.
In the whole country, newspapers have become more stronger by spelling "SOS Press" on movements and constructions in organised proteins.
On that day the Register Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy out journalists and kill them because they said the truth.
She also asked her to be re-parted by the government because she is concerned that her wealth has disappeared its objectivity.
Valdez reiterated that journalists in Mexico of organized crimes, attended government officials and an equal society would be "of giving".
In his last book "Narco-Journalism" he wrote that reporters will not only be killed by drugs, but also on the command of politicians and security forces that had been covered with the organized crime.
The Medical Watchtower Group "Articul 19" has admitted more than half of the attacks on police and officials in the past year.
"You die in Mexico because they want you to keep your mouth," said Ramirez.
Apparently, the murder have a huge effect.
Nobody forgot the death of the bloggerin Mary Elizabeth Mazias in the north border of Tamaulipas six years ago.
Her body was found together with a notice signed by the Zetas card: "I'm here because of my reports."
A computer stat and head audiences are laid next to their disappeared head.
Some fleals have chosen to close, such as the newspaper El Norte in the north border of Chihuahua after the murder of the Miroslava Breach respondent in March.
Others continue to make the way El Manana of Newvo Laredo had done after the murder of her director in 2004.
2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez was public to the drug card with a leader article on the title page with the title "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists are flighted from their home countries or even from the country.
It is a terrible decision.
It is difficult to find out the exil work, and they still watch the roads and seek dangers.
And sometimes they'll be disappointed, as it's evident to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed with four women in a apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Deacruz.
For those who remain and continue the work, it is a dance with riskable decisions.
Ibarra, who wanted to be the first disaster, gives the drug traffic to fear him.
"Mexiko goes to hell, and so I became reporter," he said.
During the middle of the last Friday, when the last expenditure was already completed, the reactors of Riodoce sat on the town before the office and tranche bier, when all their phones once began to summ.
A number of shooters with banden rivals and security forces near the Badeort Mazatlan had left 19 dead.
The war continued to scalp as it was promised by a number of cards in the region.
From the frontstein kante, they have published the news on the Riodoce website on Handy.
The title page should be amended on the next day.
Siren healed nearly - another shooter in the area.
Bojorquez looked at the policemen who kept the washings to see whether they were in the presence.
When they were afraid, they didn't show it.
Under the powerful portrait of the falling founder of the newspaper, whose medium finger was visible for all the Sinaloa, the employers of Riodoce followed his springs.
"What can you just think about this," said Bojorquez, "with the same day when Javier was killed, the practical girl asked me to send her to the road refund."
Dinosaurier used Tarnation to exalt his enemies
On the first view it looks like a status, even a scary.
Now researchers found that the first knowledge of the unbelievable Nashorn's canadian mountain worker was so good that experts have described it as "Mona Lisa of Dinosaurier".
It was so good that they could even recognize that his sweet hair was of a red brain - and they said she had had something of a "related past".
The report in the "Current Biology" magazine described it as "the retentioned dinosaur that has ever been found and one of the best Dinosaurier Examples of the world."
The Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the currency between 110 million and 112 million years.
His unbelievablely well-received state has researchers that describes it as " actually notice"
According to reports in National Geographic, the famous planter is the best fossy of his kind.
It was found by Shawn Funnk on 21 March 2011 in Suncor Millium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
He found something of the rock seeming to be missing on the place, and decided to look more accurately.
The founded Fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paloontology.
They used the next six years to discover the wild animal within 2.500 kg of the earthquakes (1,100 kg).
After all this hard work, the complete result is now ready to be completed.
"If you just have a little bit with your eyes, you could almost believe it is sleeping," said the Main author Caleb Brown, scientists at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where you can see the creature.
"It will enter into the Science History than one of the most beautiful and the best Dinosaur Examples - the Mona Lisa of Dinosauriere."
Researchers discovered that this plant grasser, although he is covered with a plant and likes a walking panzer, probably was threatened by the meat of dinosaur.
The strong painted Dinosaurier used a red and white tarnament to hide himself before raubts, and used a removal technology known as an opposition, which is also used by many modern animals.
This would have been allowed to mix in its environment and to spread his enemies, experts say what argued that it was threatened by greater dinosaurians.
The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family has done the first time in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.
Researchers now studied the wild animal and Borealopelta markchelli called the museum Technical Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has sought to discover more than 7,000 hours.
The magnificent maintenance of the Exemplar allowed Dr. Mitchell and a international team of scientists to document the model and form of shoppings and disorders on his body.
They discovered the contamination, a widely wide defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the shadow of the creature was its subsection.
Although it is usual, the results are surprised, since the size of Borealopelta is overcoming the live animals today.
It pointed out that the dinosaur of sufficient pressure by the flesh of dinosaurire was made that the evolution benefited the densation of the confrontation as the resources of the survival.
But most of the temporary animals that take the container - think about race, cebras or goods - are much smaller and unnecessary than tests, which indicates that this Nodosaurier has been made a real fight for survival.
"Starkes Raubtier behaviour on a massive, strongly armed dinosaurier shows how dangerous the dinosauriers should have been the creators of the creative time," said Brown.
The chemical analysis of organic connections in their scales also shows that the hair of the Dinosaurier was broken.
Scientists continue to investigate the animal on indications of his life, including his stored terms, to find out what it had eating as his last meal time.
They believe the Dinosaurier, when he died, turned into a river and was thrown out of the sea, where he looked on the back to the sea's ground.
At that time Alberta was so warm as south flowery today, and the flowers and the oceans probably spread much further lands than today.
"This nodosaurier is really valuable because he is fully covered with smoother hair, but also receives in three dimensions and keeps the original form of the animal," said Brown.
"The result is that the animal today appears almost exactly as in the early creative time.
You don't need to use a lot of fantasy to rebuilding it. If you're just a bit with the eyes, you'll almost think he's in bed."
The surrounding time was a time, as a huge theopods, flowing dinosauries that were on two knees that passed the earth.
Although the King of them lived by Tyransaurus Rex, millions of years after Borealopelta, the famous Dinosaurior was taken from some of his terrible prejudices.
The Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six key monsters.
Scientists, whose recent knowledge appears in the Time Time Biology Current, believe Borealopelta, after death in the sea, and mumified in the shalam.
The creation was found by Shawn Funnk on 21 March 2011 in Suncor Millium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the most famous dinosaur of the world, including hair and skin, and is completely from the scene to the heat.
The creatures were average of approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and reached up to 3.000 kg (1.300 kg).
It's enthusished two-20-thyle-hour scenes that falled from his schoolers.
The researchers believe that the western plant grass was shot through the West Canada until a overwhelmed river flew into the open sea.
But the underwater refund of the Dinosaurier kept his equipment in exquisite details.
The stoned oversight of this special examples are so well received that the other H still cover holoprige Panzer plates during the Dinosaurier
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, this level of maintenance is like a gain in Lotto.
More I'm going to see it, so it's going to be shot.
The rest of the hair is still covered by the holpriest panzer plates that take the skin of the animal.
His right predecessor is on his side, his five fingers are shooted up.
I can count the shooters at his suck.
In weight: Mass cardambobed on A8: Very recent
Increased accidents at the Thursday dating on the A8: Knapp 30 vehicles have been developed in a mass-carbed.
There are many last, kilometers of staus - and Gaffer.
On the Autobahn Stuttgart München (A8), there were 20 people in the latest Thursday afternoon day at a massy caramboblation.
According to the first information of the police, approximately 17:00 between the Adelzhauses and Oldzhauses (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg) were about 30 cars, including probably car rental.
There is no information on the exact number of the last.
A police speaker said that it was easy to mixed injuries.
A large offer for rescue vehicles was in the accident.
The A8 direction of München was completely closed.
In the travel station, Munich was a 10 km long back.
As an AZ reporter reported, it was also on the sideway of massive disabilities - by numerous gaffers.
The firewave noted the characters of the vehiclers that have now been calculated with sensitive crimes.
Soon after 18:45, a second accident was reached on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dering.
There was a collection between a car transporter and a pkw.
A rescue shot was on the way to an accident.
German Bahn: Konzern testing "Comfort Check-in"
It's a moment that almost everybody has lived once: nothing indeed are setting in the trip and sleeping.
Or if you're deep in his work and just have a great thought.
And then, puff.
When the Creator comes and takes a disagreement or drives the car gas in middle of the workflow.
Checking cards.
But the time of the breakdown is soon ended.
The German train is currently testing the uncannable card checks.
It's just confirming by mobile that you're taking your place and evaluating the card card.
Currently a test operating on two streets.
"Come on the offer, we're laughing it out.
A train speaker will then be available on many further televisions in Germany, for example.
"Comfort Check-in" the train calls the card review without creators.
However, for use, some conditions must be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or a tablet.
And you need to visit a online ticket -- whatever the most carriers do.
Moreover, it is necessary to buy the DB Navigator's app, which is the most famous type of tickets booking.
And last, you need a seat service.
Since the "Comfort Check-in" functions as: A man runs in the train, calls his card under "My tickets".
When the test box is checked, a button appears to be electronicly assessed.
The drivers will receive on their mobile devices a message that drive gas X is located in the train and took the booked Y seat.
When the train card checks on Y place, he knows that there is a passagier with an already estimated online ticket.
You can therefore continue to sleep, continue to work, to sleeve.
The "Check-in" has two benefits: one for the customers, one for the train - what again needs to use the passagiers.
"Whoever wants to travel without tickets controls by our pipeline staff, you simply check on the DB browser.
This allows the drivers to set up their travel time at the travel of personal travel", says Michael Peterson, the DB television status.
Second More, "And our employees have more time than today to get on the individual customer needs."
Those who often run the train knows that the card controls include the most damages.
Because often you have yourself, in any case, but one of the missiles is not all the documents that you need to assess online tickets.
Whether there is no credit card or personal evidence or other document that you need to show.
The consequences are conducted without end-of-term discussions between the driver and the trail gas, which is to worse in the part or large space and delays in the control of the own tickets, and the Creator takes the time to take care of other sites.
Again, only a small number of testkuden can use the new service.
And this also only on the ICE 915 village gardens and ICE 912 Stuttgart eating.
Further trip numbers on the same street are not yet disabled.
How was a activeist to learn the answer to the question: "Who's Street?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was disappeared to her corner.
Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the in St. Louis Geborene was on the bed of a air condition that she missed and rolled by Facebook on her phone.
She slaughtered about a post of someone from the high school.
"The police has just killed a 18-year-old child, and it's still on the street," he called there.
Vermised because nobody else had sent the information on her feed, she concluded Facebook and opened Twitter.
A user with the manual @TheePharoah has constantly been removed on their timeline.
The rapper out of the area of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo.
He posted a image of Brown's light body that was spread on the street and would stay there four hours.
"It's so wild," Ferrell thought.
But death was for her and her community nothing news.
She put her phone to return afternoon to Tweets about people on the Canfield Dreive.
There were photos from the police band and people who were crying, and by a man who said to be a Brown's father who had a script with the title: "Ferguson police just killed my unwashed son."
She observed a Live Faed where a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a beautiful dog.
In another video, she said, she endeavoured another policeman's sake and cried, "I'll kill you all animals."
"It's not usually," Ferrell remembered her explanation.
"This is not the kind of murder that we used to call typically."
At that moment I felt a shot.
I was warming and wept."
She took a back and went the next day home.
After the landing at 23:00, she took her six-year daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson on the next morning.
What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film, "Whose Streets?" in the knoos from 11.
It is a story of survival and proof, love and loss, strength and opposite force, which consists of the view of people living in the Community and have filled the roads to ask answers.
As Ferrell and her daughter, who had a flower clothing and a suitable kron, went to Ferguson, the two talked with a conversation that they had innumerable times before this morning » about the black experience and the black condition.
"Do you remember how I teach you when the black people need to fight for what they believe?" She remembered what she said.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right.
"I couldn't take her," Ferrell said later.
"What happened today is a high point of that ... what happened in the past.
She needs to know and see it and get on it.
It must be well developed, not only assetism and organization, but also the various shields of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to be free to save us.
Even if I have the luck to give you an experience in which they personally don't have an eklaant racism, she is not different than the next black female knee.
I feel that I would show her a bad service to keep her away."
The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was at the South Florenti Road, a place against the police authority who was in a campsite when the actives were waiting for the possible non-againing of officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and her daughter were connected to a local businessman who made a summer.
They prepared cups and helped them to continue to demonstrators.
A new type of activism for Ferrell Institute long started.
"My activity has changed a total change after the 9th August," she noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Texts Association and focused on eating and health in black communities.
"I didn't have any experience in organizing.
It's all coming."
After weeks, Ferrell occurred during a evening demonstration of Saaah Folayan, one of the co-registers of the film.
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farar were just wanting to document, what happened.
One question came in the meaning, "If you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"
This scepsis was closed by unnumbered cases of people, often from white - in a community that benefited from their pain and opposability.
As Folayan recently said in an interview, "We heard that people who were born and grown in Ferguson have not focused their voices and we wanted to do it different."
Folayan had already been working with the timely co Register Damon Davis, a artist from the area known for his activityism about death-traditioning inses.
His Engagement took the project closer, together with six other homes, the team of "Whose Streets?" in the years after Brown's exhibition.
"It's not one who speaks to us or speaks to us.
"That was the main chain for me, as these people are presented, because I will be presented."
The goal was not to concentrate on Ferrell's experience - to show that it is not for a Messiah leader, but for a community that gets together," said Folayan - she looked as the most open participants of the film.
Then show documents of "What streets?" surprisedly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, as she loves and married her wife.
"I felt like nut," said Ferrell, and laughed when she saw the product made for the first time.
"But I understood that it has to give some vulnerability at this work and the maturity of black people."
Moreover, Ferrells History reiterates the role of the black white women in the wide Black-Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three reasons of the movement that, after the damage of the black teenager, Trayvon Martin in 2012 the film "BlacklivesMatter" in social media is identified as sword.
"Now, skill women in leading positions have been overcome," said Ferrell, "and so we continue to fight different fronts.
Black, school women must take the main charge of all."
Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is actually kept by black women and many black women. "
However, it is that "these is not a claimable type of action", in the Ferrell, because of its identity as the heart of the film.
"It was the person who drew this energy," she said.
"It's no case, although she was in front of the Front, because in a life of these creatures as a black, swimming woman is so much on the game.
You can open their energy through the screen."
The newsrooms in Ferguson have been disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police remain.
Ferrell is on warning for 21月2 years because of the blocking of a car railway in a demonstration.
She describes the social atmosphere of the area called her home: "Ein Chaos".
However, she argued and feels obliged to this memory since she went to Ferguson three years ago.
"It's our obligation to fight for our freedom.
It's our obligation to win.
We need to love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose, except our chains."
From "traum" to "Green Watch", TV readers discuss Bit galerie
The Bit galerie moves people, although it is not yet built long.
But the idea of a sell center in the south end of the footgänger zone since the first presentation of 2009, the population is in defenders and hungers.
Calt can't make this topic a little bit.
Also on our Facebook page "Volksfrreund Bitburg" the topic will be discussed.
During the one to the Bit gallery, "It would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "It would be real class" (Nicole views), comes from the other side: "No man" (Siggi beats) or very easy: "Greund waves!" (Lars School).
While the complaints build that a Galerie is more clients in the city, which also benefits the other business, the huge ones fear that then the footway zone blows.
Together, the gallery is planned exactly on the basis where the agricultural market hall is in which 13 direct marketers offer their products.
With the beginning of construction, it will be ended.
The Galerie Machers want to integrate a market hall in the new construction - although the Beda plate will be able to sit outside.
Simone Rooms: "We buy almost a few years in the farm market hall.
In most cases, our eggs, but also the arts of the flowers are always very pleased to be again.
We also discovered the metzgei for us.
We would like to have the opportunity to receive this offer, even while and especially after the construction of the Gallery.
In other cities, it is also.
Besides the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."
Gerd Densing: "If direct marketers care in a market hall in the gallery, the height of the honey is attracted.
The new project should be not just low."
Eva Kilic: "What's about buying spaces in Bitburg?
Obviously waiting, shoes, drugs or superm markets: I find it overflowing.
There's already enough in our city.
Seeing how many loading jobs are empty for some months and years.
Since there is not even a ordinary week market here, it is more important for us to receive the market hall at least.
For it is always the fresh products offered there, mostly offered by the producer and is valuable.
As you can see, loading in a sale center is added only by larger firms, because the loans are often not twiceable for a individual housing.
Damage, special businesses are almost no longer, and the remaining thing, then it will also be disappeared."
Wolf Fandel: "A sell center with a market hall does not get me together.
And the gallery doesn't go to Bitburg.
In particular: Where should the farmer market hall go during the building time?
The old Edeka would be the solution - even on time when the Bit galerie comes at any time.
Or is it the most sense of Bit-Galerie to carry out all business from Bitburg?"
George Marquet: "It's just going to work.
And a shopping center that's empty, no one needs.
I think it would be better to promote a right agricultural market instead of this gallery.
But for a farmer market hall, it has already been given by the weakness of many - as I find - faultless construction projects in Bitburg.
If the farmer market is caused, a piece of culture will again be disappeared."
A suitable identity: Artists create portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery room in New York, many faces have to see - white, black and bright that are almost unlikely - those of the cover.
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg of car towers and hair sections sent by Chelsea Manning.
Maning sent the summits from the prison Fort Leavenworth, where the previous secret analytikerin improved a 35-year-old trafe after it was a secret diplomatic report on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition opened on August 2 called A Becoming Resemblance (a appropriate identity).
It is the product of two years of Corresponsance between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline has made their skills in technology, computer sciences and arts, and manage, a translated and disident whose conviction was changed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.
Dewey-Hagborg has been equipped by the alcoholic analysis of DNA that was extrahed by maning and was created from the 30 portraits, as someone could appear to these genographical data, if not only something intellettable comment on the formability of DNA data - the many wise samples, how they can be interpreted and the inherent definitionism of these interpretations, but also created to the identification.
Maning who was born by Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about the identification of a woman, 2013 has been condemned by 20 complaints, including six crimes against the Spionage Law, Computer abuse and Debris.
By prison, her image was expressed, so much that there was only one photo - a smooth, black-wheat selfy, where manage so far sits on a journey and holds a platinblood pepper - with which it was associated.
In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of its 2012 'Stranger Visions' project.
This has produced the artists of foreigners from foreign arts like cigarette smoke and caugummy by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people could see.
It was the time she received an e-mail from a newspaper machine.
"They brought a interview with Chelsea Manning while they were in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to join this article," Dewey-Hagborg said at a press view of the new exhibition.
And she could not visit this time, and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked them whether she wanted to make a DNA port.
Artists and their inhafted museums were exchanged to unlike letters that were exchanged several letters during two years.
They even call one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic "Suppressed Images", which would be before which the President of Chelseas would change judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally.
In fact, that Obama was only a few days after the book was published, Manings release after seven brutal years in a military campaign in Kansas was a welcome kind of meeting.
There are now some degrees and Starkes in the opening of the Exhibition, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government guarder and against transgender troops to find new, double-scale ways in order to relax the shapes he must actually have to be burned.
When Dewey-Haagborg was asked after the strange term of all these things, she said that "that's going on from a certain reason."
In an artistic exhibition written on the wall of the Gallery, managed with its overwhelmed subtitle (the "i" in their family names has been a end of the "automatic splittering, whose basis was sex, race, sexuality and culture."
On the face of the wall, its mid-ondryal DNA sequence is written in Blestift a thousand fits of Cs and Gs and As.
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the integration of the 200 letters (or nukleotide after the high-developed scientific lexikon of the artists) as a wonderfully similar, at least in biological view, we are all.
"What people will be accepted to this is that our name is not worried about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose videoway of 2007 is also to see.
"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."
The last part in the exhibition which is stored in a own room is a side of the Comic Newsle above.
It shows maning how she has been equipped with a free speaking phone in the hand of the disziplinar corners of the United States like King-Kong.
"When they're stolen your speech, then they've won," it says.
"It never stop your mouth."
"He came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artists who grew out of Philadelphia.
"I'm still going to take a goal when I'm talking about."
Maning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was passed in the comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the space of the mass, from their own geographical simulators, which are shopping as hordens of protestants.
It was also designed, as all in the exhibition, to the size (5 "2 manings station), in which their genetic haplo groups were written with blistift.
"In the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a people," said Dewey-haagborg from the portraits.
"I wanted it feel like a mass movement which formed with Chelsea, like the movement that had gone after her release."
Professor of the University of North Western and an Officer of the University of Oxford for Morning
A wide human day is in the Gange for a professor at the North Western University and an officer of the University of Oxford, who was seeking as a suspect after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago was killed.
On Monday, Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) were designed for murder because of their believing participation to the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as shows the acts of the Office of Cook County.
The documents say Cornell Daurnleau, 26, held after several styles.
One of the Community warning systems published by the Authority of Chicago shows that the body was discovered on 27 July.
The officer received a call, came to the Great Plaza apartments and found the victim with several violations on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was still explained in the place of the event for murder, and detective investigation the style as a murder while the police is looking for the two suspects, the officers said.
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor for microbiology and immunology at the Northwest University.
Alan K. Cubbage, Vice-President for University Relations, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now entitled and excluded from the campus of the Northwest University.
"This is now a criminal matter which is investigated by the competent authorities, and the North Western University cooperates in this investigation," said Cubbage.
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford.
One speaker of the University and the Samrville College said in an e-mail statement that "fore the police in Britain, it is ready to help US media authorities in every sense."
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and wanted to be seen.
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Agency of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said that he urged the suspects to make themselves the authorities.
"The police has an idea of her stay, and our efforts to restore them," said Guglielmi.
Guglielmi said that local, regional and national authorities help to find the suspects.
Guglielmi said that the police had received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza Hall who had just received a relaxable tip that he stated that there was something in the 1008 apartment.
The police described the scene as a very grausam.
Guglielmi said that it was not clear if the case was also held on 27 July.
It was confirmed by security rooms that Lathem and Warren were in the building.
"We believe professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi.
The Great Plaza Management Team published a statement to the residents: "The police is currently working at the timecase and the background of the victim and investigates a number of motives, including a possible home case."
"We will conclude the WADA plan in near future" - the Russian Vice-Premier Mutko
The Russian Vitaly Mutko Vitaly Vitko said that it is not long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA) for the recovery of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
"In a certain stage of the completion of the vehicle criteria, RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAAD (UK Anti-Doping).
The WADA plan was updated in this regard," Mutko explained on Thursday.
The PM commented the second part of the WADA plan to maintain the code describing the criteria for the recovery of RUSADA and recently published on the site of the organization.
According to Mutko, he does not contain anything for Russian Party.
"All has been announced, all will be applied.
And the results are submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and the WADA in close future," he added.
However, one of the criteria referred to in the list states that the Russian Anti-Doping authorities must accept the results reported by the WADA's authorized by the Canadian Law Director Richard McLaren to encourage State Doping in Russian sport.
With regard to the question, Mutko said: "We conduct the investigation that our anti-Doping system has an error.
All measures have been implemented.
But there were no State programmes and we will not give something that does not exist."
The words of Mutkos agreed with Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Committee.
In the conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian Anti-Doping Organizations, he added: "We have reiterated that the report contains positions and rules.
No one has proposed accepting this report without conviction," added Smirnov.
RUSADA was excluded by the WADA by the implementation of Doping Controls in Russia in November 2015.
However, you have been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping (UKAD).
Following a visit to the Chief Research of the Organization in Moscow in July, the WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA moves on the right direction to be used again.
Aldi has not been sold any more eggs
These were shared by the company groups.
It is a pure precautionary measure that no health-respection could be taken, as it is reported in the communication.
From immediately only eggs of Aldi should be delivered, which are apparently negative to fipronilable lyrics.
Aldi wants to make clarity and transparency with his customers.
The start-ups that will help your company will not be on the next browser
Amy Errett wanted to measure the happiness of your e-Commerce Star-up, but the surveys did not work.
Answers were often too far, little helpful or - worse - hurt.
And even if you're talking about anonymity, some workers do not betray the process.
"It was never easily concentration and objectivity", said Errett, who has the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed.
She called people outside to help.
A new race of human resources start-up is on the ground to help enterprises find how their employees feel.
The establishment and licensing of software, which has the specific purpose of measurement of the employer's employees, allows the company to perform surveys to address special groups and demographic groups to provide anonymicity and complaints, and in some cases, to allow the C drivers and directly to the Board of Administration.
"They are now tools like Strava and Fitbit for the persecution of their health, but where is the credit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, Main-baser and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Lent, whose software Analytics programs are used to meet employees' engagement.
Rerett said they're a better intention in what your employees think and feel with glint in the three years.
Additional to the Snap surveys and interrogations of certain teams, it offers a Hitze Card of the company that shows a view that the most complaints have the complaints and which leading forces show low-reaching results - so that you can submit why.
Business is going to find that on the side of the workplace, you should stay so that you don't be the next bus that has been developed in Skandale since a former employer has published a blog location that describes a area of solutions to those who have spoken.
For start-ups like Glint, this wish is a luxurious business opportunity.
The Global Governance, Regularship and Compliance Brand would have 2020 more than $118.7 billion, after the financial website Let's Talk Payments.
Denver, Colorado, Startup Convercent, the company helps to prevent and identify bad behaviour, saw an increased interest and activity starting this year in the middle of the shiphold.
Convercent has almost 600 clients, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber has been informed shortly as a client.
As Glint, Convercent enterprises will send a measured "Puls-" survey, collect confidence responses in real time and see the warm cards of your problems.
It also offers an anonymous SMS host that can report bad behaviour with the employer.
And if the Chief Budget is entered, the complaints go directly to the supervisory Council.
"The court of public opinion has taken the regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the reasoner and manager of Convercent.
If a company is found that is badly treated or maintained by its employees, it can experience cost-reaching consequences by consumer biocott, employment flowing and cards, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 places, has established convercent for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have a simple possibility to reach their company centres.
Before, if a applicant wanted to report a problem, he had to find a phone or email number for the company center, a formal complainant must have been taken seriously.
It was often an inconsistent and unfair experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said that there was no good opportunity to pursue the complaints of employers.
Now, since the company convercent sets, the problems that are previously identified and exposed by leading forces sitting in cities or States - such as discrimination, solving or unlawful practices.
"I can get closer to this integer, 360 degrees in the experience with employment," said Vitrano, who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our actionnaires from employment law. "
The company began to take more seriously Ethics, values and employees engagement in 2002 after booking Fairma Arthur Anderss for ethnic disappearances by the Enron-Scandal, Quinlan said.
But it was long until the "Social Mediens came to their right," that enterprises recognized that you couldn't prevent that their dream wills were online.
"Before the use of technology to monitor ethical hopes, men used as a strategy," he said.
Although Glint and Convercent offers your software as a service service, the companies are renewing costs for use of their products.
It is a business model and a chance that finds the approval of Venture Capital Investors that have supported both startups.
Convercent received $10 million in the financing in February of firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, with which the whole capital was increased at $47 million.
Leters secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and brought all its funding at $60 million.
These investments are pretty surprised, in view of the retained nature of enterprises, culture and Venture Capital.
There is a growing complex on research that shows today's employees' workers are waiting for more than until now.
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high holders and interesting projects only taxes.
The employers want to have a feeling that you are accepted and estimated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to be in a company feeling that they hear their voices, and that the work you do loving, then they feel stronger to make this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, which used both convercent and lents.
Independents are reached if their portfolio undertakings are good. Business works well when employers are used and engaged.
If the Analytics tools promises to increase commitment and use of employees, there is no wonder that you can find support.
The data on the employee operation is important after the experts of the workplace.
But the data are useless if the company manager does not take measures.
In fact, if a employer asks your feedback, it may have an expectation that it is changed on the way.
And if the change does not come fast enough, or, mostly, this disappearance can demostrate and demostrate taxes.
"When you ask for 4.000 requests, you should be ready to have 4.000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Cotter International, the companies who have left themselves too much on the collection of data.
"If you don't follow employees ask, "Have you ever heard me?
Are you worried about it?
And don't worry about anyone, why should I?"
Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly questions, was able to introduce measures on the same day when a problem is reported on lent, is heavy.
And after the collection of feedback of fruited employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add communication education to address the problems.
In Ruby Tuesday, the company always takes new views on the employees, and it is hoped that long-term, this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector that is known for high circumstances.
"If you're not obliged to create a culture of transparency, you'll lose people," said Vitrano.
"And if you lose people, you'll lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you'll lose companies.
The NCAA removes the two-day prints and makes a long day for the Bruin
It's about 23:00 when a lot of UCLA-Football players is undertaken on a side of the new team operators on the campus.
Some disappeared their tricototes and showed the back full weak of the first day of the trainer.
For a good part of the team, these inactive minutes make a sudden time.
Players who are registered to the summer courses will return after the three-year delivery to their conclusion tests before they return to the waterman Football Center at 6:30.
"This is for the boys the next three days a real trip moon," said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before the Monday became on Sunday.
The NCAA eliminises two day-day events to facilitate the latest of the players, and she has actually extended its days - at least until the end of Friday.
Therefore, the first three trials of the UCLA should start at 19:15, to be justified with the already embedded periods of players.
The compromise is away from the two days more than one day in which the Brunes's start of the campaign is almost one week after the last season and during the first school for the first time in Moras, during six games in Westwood.
They have to stop during August 18 jobs. 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their attraction against Texas A & M in September.
Mora said that he supported the change of NCAA, even if they add the multi-employed roads of the players a further point.
"We put this huge charge three or four days on them, and it's very expensive," said Mora.
"And if they've just pressed it, they're still breathing, they're great people.
I think when we come to Saturday and we have more time, it will really be great."
The UCLA will end its practices when the camp is finished, what is in view of the clear view of the fields of its fields from a border park place and the lowest Luskin Center, a hotel of the high class that has already been designed with footballs, which will not be an easy task.
Bruin's players should take the hotel from this weekend, but Mora found that it could give a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season.
"We will use our security," Mora said.
"There is a real problem, and it is not far-related to think that people are sending a room there and then set up there to set up a delivery.
If you have the video connection from a performance, it's a very good business.
But we have security forces there, and we have security forces in the park 8.
We'll be doing the best with what we have.
I don't have to worry about that.
We have a plan."
Facebook wants to intensify facts testing in the fight against miscellaneous messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false notifications to the facts of thirds and then show their results under the original contribution, the world’s largest online social network on Thursday. It is one of its efforts to fight the facts referred to in this event.
The company said in a opinion on his website that it would start using updated learning methods to identify possible false notifications and to send them to facts testing that possible results of the facts will be shown from the original article.
Facebook was criticised as one of the main point of distribution for this fake news, many of which believe they have also affected the US Presidency elections in 2016.
The problem was also made in Europe to a great political theme, while the French electors in the front of the presidency elections in May have been overwhelmed with false stories, and Germany supports a plan to be addressed after the social media network, if it is not available, injury postings like the elections there in September.
On Thursday, Facebook said in a separate statement to Germany that in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts testing will be started.
"In addition to the knowledge of the story of facts of third parties, people want more context to take funded decisions on what they read and share," said Sara Su, product manager for Facebook messages in a blog.
She added that Facebook continued to test its features with the "in connection article" and worked on other changes to his message feed to reduce false messages.
Create a Comic Roman: A lock in the history of England
In his recent past, the small scotney Castle was to see in a squeeze music video and was for Margaret Tachcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But Scotney lived 700 years of tourist history of his well-made seat in the Bewl River Tal and has now become the inspiration of a graphical Roman of Jamie Rhodes, a mophar Yorkshireman with an advantage for historical documents.
"I find it so nice to look at the Handy of someone who's dead for 300 years," he said.
"What's for a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."
'A Castle in England' stresss the time from the Mediterranean to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. Each story was illustrated by another coming British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on a archive: He wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found an unexpected emotional project.
"I only have reacted on the side of a letter, which was written by a Doppelplanner in the 1700s, who worked for your Jacob," he says.
"It's his damage impression!
And the letters always sing to rain, because at the same time they burned a fire because of the light.
For somebody who lives after 300 years, the song has an effect as it would also be.
Oh, I love Archive!"
For someone who has been killed with old papers that it is supported by the National Trust and the Council of England and lived nearly four months in a lock ("I've been honest: I have a little overvaluated my Welcome") it seems to be too beautiful to be true.
Rhodos used his days to consider the victorian "new" lock, to see the archive and to study the many tastes and curiosities of the lock, such as the mounted hydenics on the walls and the flames that had dedicated the centuries in the grave.
He walked through the countryside and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with the ruins of the countryside, the gardens and sometimes with the artists who worked in the pictures of his book.
Then he drank "Whiskey and began to write."
The intime history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust had received full access until 2006, when the last heritage, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes entered a decade later, the officers just started to take care of the archive, which he was "Create of years in which the Aristocrates said "Oh, get it on the dachboes."
Diary books, letters from the time of the English Empires, cards, who imagines what means: "You might say that land conflicts would be hot," says Rodes, "but there was a bird to fight the two families.
You guys, let him go all!"
Some of the stories in the collection uses the burg as a starting point to visit a wide basis in the English history, including 'The Labourer' who follows a man who leaves the new built bug to follow the farmer's station of 1381.
"There is an appointment of a 1380 arising in the closure, in this book with the title 'Knightly Familys of Kent and Sussex'," says Rhodes.
"The farmers started in this area, and I thought a surrounding is a good start.
Maybe the two are connected to each other?"
Other stories are denied in the history of the Schloss - like 'The Priest', who tells the history of the Jewish Pattern, which the family Darrell hided seven years during the English reform.
Or 'The Smuggler', in which the Schmuggler Arthur Darrell was depicted from the 18th century, which was inscribing his own shipment by filled a harvest with stones (a discovery that was done first years later as his harg was buried).
The Darrells are Rhodes' Love family of Scotney: "The Lords seemed to be a pleasant gauner, to make up again punishment and to give money for things that they couldn't be delivered.
Other generations of Darrell men solve their criminal crises when they married old women - I put them to me as an outstanding guy with a talent to marry heritage."
After the end of its use in the lock, Rhodes are searching for other unique spelling events
He has backed a double stay in the Finnish Wildnis for a Comic-Roman over Elemenäki, the area of a Sanatorium from the early 20th century, which was restarted moreover from nature.
But Scotney has a special place for him.
"I was sorry to go back," he said.
It was like, "Ah, now I have to make it again with the bad life."
Start campaign: Over 300 years old Marien Capelle in Rhöndorf
The city of Bad Honnef has started its campaign to introduce a new dachmark (Rundview of Thursday).
Still until Thursday, the citizen Otto Neuhoff and his branding team, Nelson Artz, want to keep the logo and the slogan secretly.
The end of August it is to give a festival on the island of the Grafen value.
"That's nice for us.
Or?" The machines of action since yesterday on the places at the Rheindorfer's capelle.
"We think this (naturally!) does not really," they write on their yesterday released website.
"but we use this action to win your attention.
And to make clear that some are better than it seems.
In the reason we are the firm conviction that we are a Bad Honnefer citizens about the beauty and attractivity of our city."
The action is more than "nour" a logo and a slogan, it means further.
"It is appropriate to formulate a single promise, one that gives an unchangeable feature of alliance."
Finally, it grows in competition with other communities.
A average five-numeric amount allows the city of Bad Honnef to cost its new dachmarks and campaigns.
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogans fears the army
Every year beginning August, Ankara of the Chief Military Council (YAS) was requested on pensions and transports in the official cart.
So this week.
The first view is a normal step.
But nothing is Routine in the Turkish forces a year after the put investigation.
The meeting was not more held in the building of the General Tab, as previously, but at the Office of the Ministerial Chairman.
At the consultations, under the Chairperson of the Government, the five Vice-Premier, and the Ministers of Defence, Internal, Justice and External.
These were the civilians in the YAS payment.
In the military, the government approves the cells.
General Board Hulusi Akar remains in the office, but the commands of the army, the air forces and the marine were arrested.
Since the unnecessed couple, Head of State Erdogan 169 of 326 Generals and Admirals had felt.
More than 100,000 soldiers were removed from the series of the army - mostly because of the amazing connections to the movement of the Exil Prediger Fethullah Vallene, which Erdogan sees as a dragon of the investigation.
With 486 persons who should be involved directly in the push investigation, they will be negotiated in Ankara since this week.
On the day after the push, Erdogan had described the survey as "Godged Gessenk", as he gave him the opportunity to clean the forces "to be complete."
But Erdogan's army really in the griff?
At the end of February, the newspaper "Hurrive" published a article containing the title "Incapacity in the military headquarter".
In the General Table, it provides concerns for an increased "islamization" of the army, which was written, among others, in the resurrection of the head-law for soldiers, the newspaper.
The great army and security forces will continue anyway.
In the middle of July, Erdogan allowed further 7395 State Services, including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers.
It seemed like Erdogan took the military.
The generals had seen before than the real masters of the country.
Three times, they called on their role as a observer of the World State Regulation.
After his election session 2002, Erdogan returned the military step to step, not last in vocation to the reforms of the European Union.
The former officials say that Erdogan is faithfully aimed at islamization of the war forces.
In the Magazin "Vocal Europe" a non-signed officer who was looking for a fear of persecution in the foreign Asyl, the Turkish army will be in a few years of "pleasant extrems and Salafists".
This couldn't allow the Nato to hurt this development.
Nevertheless, there is certain doubts in alliance after the summers of the preparation of the Turkish army.
The management structures and operational capabilities are "distructed", say Nato-Diplomates.
Washington changes the Green Card rules
It will be given a new US inmigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card, President Donald Trump, held by the media.
He intends to reduce the legal immigrants to 500,000 per year, more stretch rules for the achievement of visa for a timely employment permit and restrictions for family-oriented visa.
The new rules are proposed by the Republics and supported by the President.
The draft law should be discussed in the two rooms of the Congress.
"This law will reduce the poor, increase the borrows and flood billion dollars for tax payments and will do this by the United States to change the way and ways like citizens from other Green countries are delivered."
The law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system.
This new proceeding process will come to the candidates to speak English who have financial resources to support themselves and to show knowledge that our economy will happen," said Trump, held by the American media.
Ministery wants to send Streets for Renstyleshuttle
In the past months, the future of the renaissance has always been resolved - now it should be very fast.
Before the end of the year, it will be built at the marroid streets on which the tourist rail is going to be built.
In order to ensure the future of the renaissy along the long term, the ministry of transport must still start on the streets in this year.
"For the decision to establish and cure the streets Ilmenau-Ronstyle, the country is aware of this particularly important connection for tourism," said the State Secretary-General of the Transport Claus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt.
The costs for the establishment of the streets were approximately 2.5 million euros.
The country takes 75 percent from this sum.
The Treaty, on which the Shuttle is also designed in the future of the country, will now be completely concluded.
The Ministry and the Southern Travels as operators are already one of the technical details.
"There are the car plan that is negotiated by vehicles and quality standards," said Self.
The planned treaty between the Ministry and the Train Society will be closed for an eleven years.
This should be regulated in December 2017.
Rensteig-shuttle is a train connection in tourists among the trains Ilmenau and Rainstyle.
During the past months, a pilot operation was demonstrated whether the street of sufficient many people was used to resign it in the future.
The street is also built in parts of strong building.
The increase of sex roboters is real and we should worry about
Once you thought it couldn't be disappointed 2017, a new report on the technology developments in the field of sexual robots is reported.
Yeah, actually.
Sex-roboters are a great thing at the moment.
Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of the six-roboters in the next five-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, an emitted Professor for Robotics and artistic intelligence at the University Sheffield and Co-dependent of the FRR, we must begin to take seriously their increase.
Customers can select the eye color of the robot, its shape of the breast black and the type of fingernail.
"The people are pleasing about them, but the enterprises provide a lot of them, and we'll get them more frequently," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report.
Modern Sexpups have developed from their viable partners in Roboters with a silikonhaut that feels warm - with awareness of human reactions that are reached by the artistic intelligence.
The user can also select its robots according to its convictions "Apform" and all of it, from the eye color of the robot on the shape of the flower black to the type or colour of his finger's fingers.
But it will still be worse, since many robots have the "perspectives" that would have been able to look forward to a race Stepford.
Modern Sexpups have developed in robots with a silikonhaut.
For example, the RealBotix Roboter allows his users to adapt their robots to the properties they find precisely, such as the smoothness.
And then there are still the Roxxy Gold Sex Roboters developed by True Companion with pro-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah", which submits the impression of suspicion and "Wild Wendy" with a "intensive" personality.
"Roxxy Gold has a personality that your personality is as well as possible," he warms the website of True Compansion.
So she loves what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.
She also has her shame during the day - just as real people!
She may be worthy to be fixed on conversation or she can 'in stimming'!"
There are many incredible aspects of this increase of sex-roboters - not at least because they replace real human relations - but the underlying female properties, playing playing on Frigid (hereinafterly here: contrary) Farrah, makes a more intrigued.
On his website compare True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.
"When women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then not have roxxy?" it says on the website.
However, these sex rubbers are not only a Feature or stop only another sex game.
Their disappearance and their growing refreshances show on something dark and tier in our culture, on a decrease from the ideal of the equality of genders to a desire after sex with support as an optional allocation.
Most men are indeed not keeping sex rubbers, and while FRR notices their increased population, they remain in the border of the consumer culture.
But what is translated from the races, in relation to the spirit of the time in which we live is very teaching.
And many people are not rare or politicians until they give the free market to it.
There is, however, some circumstances that these high-developed sex roboters are attracted in a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the white house, which has spoken to have been sexually attacked by women.
The worst aspect of the TV series 'The Handmaid's Tale' ('The Magd') are not the graphical images, which are dispersed body and the eyes extensive, but as realistic this vision operates.
The Republic of Gilead is a speed, but it is not a great speech at the moment.
The goal behind these sex-roboters is to create physical equality to females as realistic as well as technically possible (including pornostar sports).
Her constructors want to feel humanly that they follow the movement of a real body.
But, on the point, if it's about their personalities, the robots do not make real women.
You can't distract from their meeting or simply leave.
They have no delivery or a background story, nothing meaning about independence or something that could cause the phenomenon of total subsequence.
Otherwise expressed: You're likely slaves.
Or to express it in the revealing way of 2017: Service offices
Trumps great performance?
He makes Middle Romney to understand the healthy mind
It has become a creativity of the Trump Erra that the political efforts that have been polarized by the US university have also paid families in a small format.
Alongside the Christmas and the Western Western celebration, it was in the US newspapers with advice on how to be chosen with the Trump Horror.
We all strive to put our filter bullets.
Meanwhile is the power of Trumps to gather families.
I mean this because my cousine, a left-oriented detective who lives in Chicago and worked for a long time with the republics in our family, visited me this week in New York.
She recalled me that the unit against a common enemy could have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the white house, every one she knows, including the republic revolution which she had fighted for ten years of the policy, immediately and fully on the same side.
This is certainly a good thing, but it is in a further connection that this also brings considerable risks with them.
The left has been strengthened by Trump, but the decisive effect of his presidency has the power to send us all right.
When we talk about "Normalization" and Trump, we move to the green opportunity that his machines will not be abstracted any more.
However, there is a more heavy long-term scenario in the Trump Republic "normalised" of the right flower, which at once compared to its standards soon as a complaint of convergence.
I find me today by an active Nostalgie for Middle Romney's urcomic version of the Covenant - the dog on the card which 14% income tax (but we knew at least how it was out of his tax declaration) - both in comparison with Trump in fact one of the very mild criminals.
If Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republics must be healthy only to qualify themselves as an unemployed improvement.
When my cousine was in the city, we brought our children to the Carussell in the Central Park, the largest of the Carussels of the New York Park department, and the best three dollars that can be delivered in the city if you do not need coffein.
The horses are great, the Fiberglas designs on the central cilinders - all Clowns are slow and the animals are disappearing to look full of fear about their own students - extremely dark, and the climate music shares this in a wonderful way.
Thus many clinics disappear a city: the views of high buildings will be old to trust Skylines to provide a lot of resurrection, and the reality of the city will not be justified to the dream.
Thirty-five years later, and I'm still not over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is actually not the Swiss Cottage - the theme Pabe Y Olde Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a large tour movement in North London.
However, the Central Park Carussell is still a rare massive experience, as here is two years old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old years and all have a great time.
If I could assess the carussel, I would have given him the full number of points, but no one had asked for luck.
On the other hand, in this week, I was designed to assess my "detection" with transactions on a scala from one to five stars before I could pass my credit card.
In the coffee house on the eck of my road, it is the same option to compare the evaluation with a 15% drink money - this to buy something on the load table.
This leads not only to an enhancement of what really should be a neutral exchange, but also to press the server to introduce personality in a situation where no needs is.
The poor woman in the buying house was grieved while I urged the experience to make you my credit card with five stars.
Oscar Pistorius with breasts from prison to hospital
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital.
In the past year, he was led to his hands in the hospital, which he took the prison authorities after a case in his cell.
Pistorius was condemned by murder after a appeal of the complaints against a first penalty penalty.
He killed stone campaign in the early morning hours of the Valentine Day 2013, once again by a door of the toilette knee in his house in Pretoria on them.
Pistorius said he kept his friend for a nice deployment that hided himself in the Kabine.
The lawyers have announced their intention to introduce this time against the six-year traps of Pistorius Appell by which they say they are too sustainable.
The National Criminal Prosecution Authority said that it would be retained at the Supreme Court of South Africa and that income could be heard in this year.
Pistorius is dangerous that his crime will be increased 15 years when the lawyers have been successful.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

Software updates for these factors: What the concerneds now need to know
How exactly does the software update find?
Should these factors participate in the action?
The main questions and responses in the overall view.
This Gipfel offered BMW, Daimler, Opel and the VW Conzern Software Updates for around 5,3 million cars.
They need to improve the maintenance of cars of emission classs EUR 5 and partly Euro 6.

"Thank to say," Smetan.
The engagement of producers depends on the political pressure.
"When we have seen, the air producers haven't acted voluntaryly. "
How long will the update continue?
The survey itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop.
It may be time-related to get a date.
What cars do not make cars from BMW, Daimler, Opel and VW Concerts?
The ACE returns to the departure.
Foreign producers, such as Smetanin.
Is there a large price accident of euro-4 cars now?
The ACE is afraid.
But even in the regions where road prohibitions are driving.
In the rural room there are no value losses for older those.
The ACE decides to wait for a sale.

We make the city living value
Roland Wacker, Haslach's City building manager, is the next year in Rent.
However, the position is already outlined - the appropriate applicants are rare.
Since 31 years, Wacker is city building manager.
And the work makes him still great fun as he reported in the press talk.
He reported from a rich resolve but also required tasks waiting for his followers.
At the same time, it is wondered that the profile of request is not fulfilled until the request.
The city is looking for a architect or builder at the first time.
This should be, taking into account the regular declaration periods, enough time for the preparation.
Since Haslach is a underlined Authority of Building Rights, the applicant must provide such conclusions.
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.
If they can't do it, the citizens should go to the meeting to Ofenburg.
But the citizens are close to the city and himself important, says Wacker, reported by a good operating climate and good shape between the authorities and citizens.
In more than 30 years in the office, some important projects were gathered to the wacker with power.
"We make the city valuable," he is sure about the construction and his employees.
But in the future there are also numerous projects on the agenda: the reconstruction of the former Hukla airport and the neighbouring park around are increased.
The kitchen browser between bollenbach and stone will be renewed, and the stadiation order is still the subject.
The latest will be killed with approximately 1,5 million euros in books, "when we do that right", Wacker appreciates.
"All of my followers are waiting for great tasks.
The work here makes fun."
A city building manager is available for a large playing area.
With Haslach’s own building and garden trip, many can be flexibly reacted on many of them.
"You can move a lot," so Wacker, and the establishment of the green plans is often mentioned by citizens and visitors.
As the ancient city is a comprehensive enterprise, it is important to "take an eye to pursue what is corrected," if new buildings are authorized, the different city building managers.
The City building manager has high responsibility.
He's Bauher, "the end of all about my table."
It can count on long-year-old employees: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been for ten years, Manfred Schöner (Tafbau) for 15 years.
Also that his followers remain a long time, wacker wants: "We are looking for someone who really identifies himself with the place and wants to stay."
Because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate, but also for the further development of the city.
If Roland Wacker wants to serve, it should be possible to provide a final study as the diplominger or Bachelor with the architecture and to provide a good knowledge in the areas of construction and planning law.
The city building includes high and deep construction, construction planning, basic business areas, steadfast licensing, steadfast operational court with the building court and city marketing and under-age Authorities, including the protection of thinkings.
Guide shipped on guides: South Street closed
According to the police, the unknown thresholds had thrown the blue route from the train transmission in the field of Leoben’s road (B116).
These were so much damaged that the originating goods had to be kept.
The capturers are going out of two male tonnes and are looking for them since the night hours.
Nevertheless the term, the Witnesses were observed a royal role and a road factor.
"That's far beyond a Lösbubbest country," said EBB speaker Christph Posch to APA.
Those or the thirts would have been largely dangerous and also threatened the train.
Besides the damage of the lower and the installation, and the period of explosure and the costs of railway transport could also be able to arrive on the drivers.
In total, you're out of a "called" sum," said the speaker.
The damage were re-evaluated on Friday afternoon, the train movement on the South Street could be conducted without disabilities.
Once persons were disappeared on Friday, two of them faced television.
The goods were not falling out, but they had reproach.
According to EBB speakers, Christph Posch had to be exchanged about 200 meters of leaders.
Isolators and masters were also damaged.
Red meat, milk products and chocolates could help leaving IBD (industrial disease)
Red meat and chocolate can cry for your dumb system like an alpt space.
But a new study describes exactly the contraction: a diapositive that is rich to flesh-based proteins and milk products may reduce symptoms of patients with inconsistent diseases.
The inaccessible situation in the U.S. is about 1,3 million and in the Britain of 300,000, caused mass warming and lowness, returning or blue accidents, weight loss and extreme courageousness.
During the concerned it is usually likely to reduce flesh and mild products to leaving their symptoms, researchers found at the Washington University that the essential ammoniose Tryptophan is intended to develop immuns that promote a tolerating damage.
The leader, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immunizations are paid in the dream to ensure that the damage of microbours hiding themselves in the food would not enter into the body.
Cells who are able to solve disappearances are combined by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damage sensitive weights.
If the equality is too far in the direction of disappearance, it may result in a consistent disease.
In experts, a type of tolerance promoted immunizators in museums has been identified that a certain bacteria has been put into their inconsistents.
And the Bakterium needs Tryptofan - one of the building stones of proteins - to solve the appearance of cells.
Prof. Colonna said: "We have a connection between a bacteria art - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the Darm microbioms, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerany.
More triptophans had mys in their food, so much more they had from these immuns."
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one to Tryptofan real food tolerating, less comfortable dammilyos, if the same system is also effective in people.
The postdoctorrand Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Baragan studied a kind of immunizel which promoted toleranz when she found that a group of study cells had such cells, but another group of the same tribes that had not been separated.
She believed that the difference was to do with the dramicsobiomes of the mucosa - the Community of bacteries, viruses and pills that usually live in the Magen Darm Tract.
The thresholds of the museum were sequered and there were six bacteriates found that were present in the mixtures with the immuns, but without they were mixed at the pools.
The mixtures were drawn up in a sterile environment so that they missed a Darmicrobiom and they didn't developed this kind of immuncals, and they received the L. reuteri and the immunics.
In order to understand how the bacteria resulted on the immun system, researchers L. reuteri grew in a fluid and then translated small amounts of floodness - without the bacteria - on unrealised immuncals that were isolated by the muels.
The immunics developed to the tolerating cells.
When the active components were cleaned from the fluid, it became a neighbour product of the Tryptofan metabolism known as Indial-3 mile acid.
When the researchers were associated with the amount of Tryptofan in the flow of the museum, the number of such cells increased around 50 percent, but when the Tryptofan values were half, the number of cells around half.
Dr. Cervantes-Baragan explained that people have the same tolerance cells like mys, and that most of us are protecting the magnet traffics.
It is not known whether Tryptofan-subjects from L. reuteri cells have developed in people as well as in foods, but defects in Genes in connection with Tryptofan were found in people with a flat note.
She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote, since these cell resolved on the internal surface of the Darm.
Possiblely high triptophane values can lead from L. reuteri to an extension of this population."
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United Namanja Matic has bound a "Genie"
At some of the U.S. has signed a "Genie" with Nemanja Matic, Jose Mourinho believes, after the Mediterranean players had his duty against Sampdoria.
The 40 million Pfund Subscription of Chelsea began with a 2 2:1 victory in Dublin, the last presaison game before the UEFA-Super-Cup starting against Real Madrid on the Sunday, and imprisoned in the stoper Roll, as people as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira were formed by beloved.
Matic, however, was excluded from the preparatory Asian tournee of the Blue and made only 45 minutes, which Mourinho showed that he had to improve before the first League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, understanding, a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him to be ready to be later."
Besides Matic, Victor Lindelof and Romalu Lukaku started in the Aviva stadium, when Mourinho formed its start-XI to the beginning of the Saison.
The Independent endorsed that Mourinho wanted another three new obligations, but he found that the Club had already made a "fanttic work" to fulfil three of its four priorities.
"Tree to get from four, I thank the agreement," he added.
"I'll be more happy when they get four of four for me, but they have given great mourning."
Booing "malt" Dreamliner in the sky
The US flug producer Boeing has drawn silhouette to the sky.
The pilots fled from Seattle in the U.S. State Washington, the Zeichnung began but in Marquette in US State Michigan and went in the form of a dreamlinders over the United States, which are a few thousands of kilometres.
The action was 18 hours and a minute.
On the radar screens, it was to be the form of a dreamliner.
The whole was an extent test for new motors.
Boeing had already done such advertisement.
So the number "787" and the Boeing-Logo was set to heaven.
New Tip for Martin Schulz - Hannover, we have a problem
As the wind turns: When Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD-Cheef, the Social Democratic Ministers looked at elections with a certain concern to Berlin.
Don't blow the stairs from the participation street, unless a wind from the bound, the most important desire of the electoral fighters.
Since Martin Schulz leads the party, the party has changed fundamentally.
The workers from the Willy-Brandt Haus with growing removal of the events in the SPD-regioned Citys.
What punishment has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach.
It's been the prosecutors.
And that's one of the others.
The Federal CCD, after the surprised end of the red green majority in the lower scenes, is a general sign against coalitions of SPD and green.
"There shows more: red green can't simply be able to rule confidence," said the Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the Edition Network (RND).
The surprise of a Green Deputy President, President Stephan Weil (SPD), has caused a serious crisis.
Five months before the Landday selection, his red green coalition was lost so that their unstimal power to the opposition from CDU and FDP was lost.
The Green Budget Director Michael Kellner has requested the Absorptive Decree Green Deputy Allke Twesten to repay its mandate.
The transmission to the CDU means a clear deployment of the electoral purposes.
Each west must immediately return its mandate," said the Federal Officer and electoral Champagne of the Green Edition Network (RND).
"It may not be true," a SPD-wide fighter, as the new Hiobsbotschaft reaches the participation trail on Friday.
Stephan Weil, SPD Minister President of Niedersachen, is here after the conversion of the Green Deputy Members Allke Westen to CDU without own government majority.
It is the provisional point of a whole range of large and small crises in SPD loading changes.
And no one knows what's coming next.
The misses began with the unexpectedly significant removal at the Saarland Valley in March.
A blue eye, no longer, the geniuss of his time were revealed.
After the landday selections in Schleswig-Holstein and Northrhein-Westfalls, everything will be different.
And then it became - and it became clearly worse.
The SPD's ground in How the SPD brought into the Taumeln, the düsseldorf plate highly cuts the party.
The gentlemens were shot again in the weeks later.
Then, when they've just made a new mount, the G-20 G-Gipfel of Hamburg came.
And the next trip came with him.
Sister Olaf Schoolz, the last strong SPD lanceer, lost his nimbus last week, because he sat in the Elbphil Harmonie during his city.
And because he's in the crisis communication then did so much wrong what you can do wrong.
Since the fight fights for its political survival.
So now, Stephan Weil also.
The Minister's ministry has already been lower in the critics.
Miese survey values came to.
Despite this, or perhaps exactly, he tried to make it more stronger in the last weeks.
The efforts of the former citizen of Hannover to build his power in Berlin was not even hidden in the area of Martin Schulz.
They allowed him because they discussed a stabilization of the party.
Now, it could be the exact counterparty.
There is no debt on the partial Zwist of the low-speaking green.
And it's not a fault.
Sometimes, the genomen are seeking to keep their own series.
Their wrath turns on the green and, above all, the defended parliamentarians of West.
"It is unrequested and democratic, as Mrs Twesten presents its own carrier interests on the interests of all others," says Matthews Miersch, Chief of the Participants in the SPD-Bunde Day College, the Editions Network Germany (RND).
Mrs Twesten has not been elected because of her person as direct candidate but on the country list of the Dutch Greens in Parliament, so the Decree Deputy Member.
The logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate.
Thomas Oppermann, Chief of the SPD-Bunde dinner, claims a "undemocratic manager".
"The elector for four years ago was clear: The people made Stephan Weil to the President of the Minister", says Oppermann, who led the Dutch SPD candidate to the Federal Section, the RND.
"Now, the personal carriage rate of a future CDU Membership is the election result," Oppermann said.
He asked to explain the Hints reasons.
I want to know whether there's been more or there's further addictions of CDU's lower stocks.
Fabrics for local clothes III
Whoever wants to be in the years to be healed may receive the first support from the country.
Moreover, the citizens informed Albert Schindler and three representatives of the STEG City Development on Wednesday in Empfingen.
At the beginning of the information event, Schindler gave a look at the event until now.
Since 1991, it has been given in Employment Systems.
At the same time, in the sanitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the country of Baden-Württemberg has taken two thirds of the support rates.
In sanitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the grant continued to be at 60 percent.
For Schindler, the present sanctions are an " successful project" - finally it is important to promote the internal development, not only to exclude new areas.
On April, the President of the Government Karlsruhe has received information that it will be provided to a sanitation area III.
The amount of support was 833 333 euros, which is 500 000 euros from the country, the rest of the community's Empfingen.
How is a sanitation area now?
You will continue to find out where the " actually old" houses are.
However, it also plays a role to cure in the planned area.
In the case of this, the region limits could also be moved again.
The STEG was distributed in the middle of Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.
Keller presented the contents of the Bund-Lund Programme "Social City" in which the sanctions would then be carried out.
The programme is the revitalization of internal urbans, the improvement of living and workers and the maintenance and the construction of infrastructure.
Those measures would be made objectively, which is a basis.
The sanitation area would then finally be set as a settlement.
The grant period for the grants will take place since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.
However, even until September, this year would be implemented only once the extension of the material, in the context of those parties in the sanitation area, a question boundary for complement.
In November or December, it should be possible to carry out the sentence decision in order to begin with the sanctions in the next year.
Pietzschmann then explained that each communion should carry out the proposed preab investigations.
It is to assess the steadily constructive misconditions and to decide when healing and in what level.
It will also be introduced in the basic book for the relevant basis.
Pietzschmann will come again after receipt and make a picture of the situation, she talked.
Gotzel noted that a significant success factor for the project is the impact of the participants.
This is why the questionnaires that are postly sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed until the end of the summer feasts.
The yellow questionbow is the "Based and Chemistry trees", among others about the construction and sanitation views.
In the green questionboom that "Housten and apartment trees", information may be made on size, allocation and inhabitants of a living room.
The blue "breaksbows" is only complete when business rooms are operated in the building.
However, Gotzel is to notice that a complemented question item is not at the same time an application on funds.
In addition, new construction measures are not promoting.
Schindler still stressed that the distribution of funds according to the "Windh and Principe" function - who first comes, please first.
You can't be able to "reservate" for later.
At the end, photos of the "Ortskern II" project have been shown to make the presents a "smackful" santion.
Britic founder himself sets a microchip to get in hand movement into the house and the car
A British founder is the first in the country that is equipped with a microp to open his home door, enter his office and even with a hand movement.
Steven Northam, 33, had planted the small chip between Daumen and Zeige fingers and has now offered the service for enterprises and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq.
He took himself together with Dr. Geoff Watson, a consultant anaster of Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester, Hants, to ensure that the implantat was carried out according to medical standard.
Technology is like a kit and dog planted microochip and takes only 30 seconds.
The company of Mr Northam also wants to change homes and cars so that they are compatible with the chip, all for a price of EUR 300 per lock.
The married father of one has now built home as well as at his BMW Z4 technology that begins when his hand is on tax.
The public costs of the white house costs the payment of thousands
The decision of the white house to run a marine-substrator to the South Law for a event exhibiting the American festival in the last month costs tax payers according to the information of the military that have been granted to the TIME magazin up to 24,000 US dollar.
The green-wheel Sicorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when President is on the boat, was the heart of the event in the white house with American construction programs on 17 July.
President Donald Trump, Vice-President Mike Pence and Chief Officers of the White House made a cross through products from all the 50 States.
The in Connecticut was designed by a jacket from Maine, a firey car from Wisconsin and a Gabelstapler from Mississippi.
The military officer of the white house requested the presence of the Hubschrauber in a fragmentary order or FRAGO, about 36 hours before the South Law, after the names of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the Hubsrauber.
"I just wanted you to be aware of because it is a very unrealised event with high visibility," the commander of HMX-1 wrote at the presence of the event to his representative, the designer Marine Commander for the airway.
The message showed that the Hubshawser had joined the South Law on 17 July at 7:00 tomorrow on the South Law for the event at 15:00, and remained so long until the race was held between 18:00 and 21:00.
The note adds that if the waste should be detained from the white house, due to the restriction of the service hours, a second manner for the recurrence would need.
The original aircraft was during the advertisement at the hamper, while the security staff of the unit remained during the time at the airport.
The names available to the TIME did not clear whether a second aircraft was recently necessary.
The Hatch Act offers federal officials to use State property for political purposes.
Data sets show that HMX-1-1 has asked whether the event could disappear the order.
"A question that we argued was whether it was about a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander.
"Please if you're locked," the team commander answered.
The event "Made in America" was called by the White House as official event and would not be covered by Hatch Act.
But the official events also have political principles.
In the event, the Chairman has made an effort to reform the health reform in the Senate, and it has promoted the efforts to finalize the government rules.
The use of the aircraft that is known as Marine One or Air Force One is a political advantageal purpose of a new phenomenon.
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip.
But to ask for a photoOP only, it's not usually.
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the President flighted its first campaigns in Melbourne, Florida, Taxi Services, and his Twitter account is full of reports that assess the use of the President's flight by his advancers.
"The white house is endorsed by the Show "Made In America" - the products shown from all 50 States produced by American workers with American materials," said the Stellpresident of the White House, Lindsay Walters.
HMX-1 is often conducting training flights in the area around Washington and the South Law to set the US Presidencies in the white house with precise census rates.
As Trump was early July on the G20 gipfel in Germany, HMX-1 conducted in the white house 58 buildings.
The airport for the "Made in America" -Ereignis numbered at the training need for the month, a officer said.
Helikopter units flew further 11 hours in this day for "No presidency sub-identity missions".
The white house said that the payer had received the charge for no of the other claims presented on the event.
One of Sicorsky's speakers said that the company was not involved in putting in the South Law.
HMX-1 does not submit budget names for President flights, and it is difficult to produce the exact costs for the event.
However, 24.380 USD per airplane period in the US defence minister for the biennium 2017 is the DoD refund rate of 24.380 USD.
The titles of the unit describe the airport period as a 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.
The white house argued that the real costs for the operation of the Hubshubers are far below this race.
"The costs for tax payers on the basis of the reimbursement rates are higher irregular," said Walters.
"These equipment contains staff, maintenance and many other covered costs contained in the annual resources."
In accordance with a RAND study from 2015, DoD’s refund rates are not the staff costs, but are taking into account the costs for trailer, maintenance and contract exclusion.
At that time, the former pressure speaker of the white house, Sean Spicer, the use of the Hubshawser for the event.
"The idea is to present things that are produced in America," said Spicer.
"And I know that Sicorsky and the State of the Federal Connecticut are very privileged that they are contributed to our national security, and I think that hundreds, unless thousands of people are independed.
And I think how most of the Americans are we all privileged on the hooks and other military equipment for which many Americans have worked unfortunately.
It is of course appropriate to express this."
It wasn't clear whether Trump interacted with the Hubshawser when he turned around the South Lawn for the event, but he was located in the road of a firey car.
In the white house Trump said to the representative of Sicorsky and shot with the media about his own flower of firm products.
"I know Sicorsky very well," said the President, "I have three of them."
TC BW Neuss before kniffliger task
Head of the second Tennis-Bundesligation is the third part of the tables searchdorfer SV.
The TC blue-Weiss new acts tomorrow from 11:00 in As at the third tabled searchdorfer SV.
Despite five parts, the head of the second Tennis-Bundesliga has always received the sense for reality.
The team Marius Zay has any respect to the gentleman.
"This is a compact team that always plays just similar training.
I find the mankind very good on the back positions."
For class and stability at the searchdorfer SV, the imports are mainly guaranteed from the high north.
"Thanks and feeds can even prove on the taxes in the Davis-Cup.
And they are also strong in the double", says Zay with regard to Harri Heliovaara (Finnland), Andre Viansson (Sweden), Sören and Esben Olesen, Martin Pedersen, and Andreas Bjerrehus (All Denmark).
"It will be how hard for us.
There you also need a good portion happiness."
The neus manager for the trip in the high north is practical.
His duty for blue-weiß could give maximum Janvier.
If it is not yet done at the Challenger tourner in the Italian Biella active Franzose to the Federliga, it comes to Zdenek Collar in the Czech Library (Tschechien) to his first use in this saison.
The unprepared Chilene Hans Podlipnik-Castillo was yesterday with the white race Andrei Vasilevski and the ATP tourier in Kitzbühel on the ball.
He should be like Botic Van de Zandsc assistance, Niels Lootsma (in the Netherlands) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina.
After his two winters on the last Sunday, Maté Valkusz could also return to the team again.
If there is a 18-year-old Hungarian who was still one of the Juneoren World Years, no, any of the trainer's table on Marius Zay's cader.
How America can harm the WHO
Actually, Donald Trump did not work when he put his signature under the law to strengthen the sanctions against Russia.
"In his hate to adopt the law," the Congress entered a few "constitutional provisions" in the term.
The reaction from Moscow was as sweet as expected, and even Brussels had disappointed the U.S.
The project is always intended to combat European companies that help Russian to build Gaspipelines in the EU.
Relatedly, there are more investmentrs of the home WTO, which are funded together with other European companies to build the Russian Eastern Guideline North Stream 2.
The drugs are managed.
However, it is too early for the estimation of the consequences, the official declaration of the oil Concert.
In fact, Donald Trump has to enhance the sanctions even by executive order for life.
Two weapons are to choose him.
"The press" has seen what the concert could disappear, and who could really hurt him.

Role back: The city provides 46 coffee helps
The city organizes the Kita-day table again.
With fixed interview partners for children and an adjustment to the team.
The hour is turned back in the stedding childday places.
On 1 September, the city of Krefeld returns the food supply in the Stedical Child Days institutions (Kita) to its own region.
For Sonja Pommeranz, a comprehensive leader in the Team of Youth, this is a good newspaper: "We all have very pleased us."
Purchased is continued outside the house: A Caterer takes this task and provides fresh purchases.
The city is situated in the crop area of 46 days of children, in 44 children get a warm meal time.
In the past year, 2800 children sat at the table, and the need grows steadily.
"The middle often eats not only kids that are paid 45 hours in the middle of the Kita", explained Pommeranz.
"The offer is also applicable in the 35 hour relaxation when children staying at 14:00."
46 parttime forces have from the 1 September kitchen service: they are enhanced the angel foods, add them to Salat, Rohkost and fruit, share the meal time individually, give the food, dwelling, sprinkling and cleaning the kitchen.
"The employees will be assigned to a Kita", says Pommeranz.
The size - there are two-groups, as well as seven-groups - decides about the time number.
"The kitchens are now close to the Kita team," says Pommeranz.
"They are more strongly connected and it's easier to use the catalysis to use pèdagogical concepts."
For this is also: healthy food and cooking.
"The children must help prepare food."
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is comprehensive.
And for the kids.
"They have a known power in the Kita, a person who is trusted to them, and not always changed people."
This continuity is important for the children.
The smoothing of the Kita-rooms - until now also the work of the cow forces - will be implemented by special cleaning personnel.
This variable - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the improvement of quality of the kitchen performance, also has the character that she has expressed in comparison between owner region and foreign provision for the city as the most economicly, it is from the President.
And this, although 46 part-time forces are renewed.
"But these hours fall at about 750 persons in the area of education not so strong", says Sonja Pommeranz.
The Afghan Democracy depends on the political role of women, the United Nations says
The elections can only be representative when all society members, including women, play a role, said the Chief of the United Nations Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the United Nations Mission, said that hundreds of women will be candidated in the Council elections in the provinces. Three women candidate the role of the Vice-President and more than 30 percent of the new registered electoral are women.
"The role of women cannot be appreciated," he said in the middle of a statement.
The elections can only be a real representative and credible if women are unlimited and included in all parts of the election process.
Afghan's elections for the Province Council and the Presidency elections will take place on 5 April.
The Taliban has published drugs against a election process that joined the transition of international treatments to a consulted role.
In this year the elections will first be delivered to the power of peace by a democratic government elected.
Haysom said that a strong role for women will still strengthen the democratic success of Afganistan.
The Afghan independent election Committee reports that 1,2 million women are registered in a total of 3,6 million electors.

GMB investment services in the McVision Fabric in Glasgow
A company wants to ensure that the managers of the Biskuit producer McVitie have the long-term obligation to produce in its work in Glasgow.
GMB Scotland said that the company has evaluated the future of investments at the Tollcross Stándort.
More than 500 employees work in the work that produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse next to other products.
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million feet in the past years.
He added that employees and employers would learn as first if they would change their activities.
In a letter to the Philippian manager of the company, GMB Scotland McVitie requested “remember that the financing for the modernization of production lines will not be extended.”
GMB Senior Organisator Drew Duffy said: "The fact that we can win from the General Manager no clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross, our members are highest.
Family generations have worked here and the work forces focused strongly on the local community and the Great Space of Glasgow, an important column for human employment in a area with high unemployment and social care.
Therefore, under the perspective of jobs, loans and well-beings, and before the Brexit, the increased life-keeping costs and chronic production restraint, the East end of Glasgow urgently requires a flowing production presence at McVitie."
An outlawner of Pladis said: "The Philippian leader at Tollcross has received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday, and the company will react directly on the fact that we appreciate the continuing commitment to employers and employers.
Two months ago, we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross, and some questions were openly discussed.
We have discussed the employees that we are like all undertakings that operate in an extremely competitive and insecutive economic climate, and that is applicable to remain competitive for all our business areas and locations.
She added: "In the last years we invested in our Tollcross Sttandort more than 5 million pounds, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We recognize the inheritance of Tollcross as a production site full and fully. If our buses are changed in the location, the employers and their employees will be the first to learn this."
Have the PSG Barcelona won three years ago Neymar?
The La Liga’s Site may be able to check her interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain is not allowed in her persecution of Neymar after she offered a £ 189 million to solve its release clauses, but have they warned Barcelona three years ago?
The sensational approach has added the transfer window in the summer, as the ligue 1-club is ready to break the World Record more than the double of the current mark, and Paul Pogba returned back in the past season for 89 million Pfund to Manchester.
After the end, Neymar is offered to the world's lowest player and the highest Profi Sporter in the world. PSG offers borrows of more than 500,000 GBP per week.
Barcelona is angry about how Neymar has disappeared his way outside, although a source is near the Catalan War, the Club has always granted his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But the football world has been warned by the PSG Presidency before this view?
When Manchester City 2014 visited the interest in the signature of Blaise Matuidi, Nasser Al-Kelaifi had a close warning for each agreement who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG.
"I'm not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players, we'll stand at opposition with them, we'll contact their players," said Al-Kelaifi.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they are trying to sign one of our players at the same time, this will have consequences."
Barcelona seems to have override this line, expressing the Spanish agreement the start of this summer interest in the PSG player Marco Verratti.
The PSG made clear that they would not allow the international from Italy to disappear in any circumstances, and Barcelona could spend the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar.

Interview: "Dom Package Order of Papst Brader Georg Ratinger"
The Regensburger Domestic Patent order for misuse cases deployed Papst-Bruder Georg Ratinger.
This means the author and historic Michael Hesemann.
The final report on the misuse canal at the Regensburg Dom Pacts is further guaranteed for discussions.
Christian Weisnder, a speaker of the reform movement "We are Church", explained by publication against the German Presse Agency, who was expected from the previous Regensburger Bischof and today Kardinal Gerhard Ludwig Muller, and the Dom Chapter Georg Ratinger, the 93-year brother of Benedikt XVI.
It would serve very the view of the Catholic Church if Mulllers and Ratingers would express their deep delays on their own submissions or their false estimation of the actions.
The Vatican newspaper "Osservator Romano" criticised that the report on violence in the home pacts will be measured with "pleasant measure".
With regard to the circumstances in Regensburg, nobody convicted that it is "while and damaged" manager that prevents and in the future; it is attempt but the "Grad mediale Manipulation", so the author Lucetta Scarfia, Historic and member of the National Italian Bioethic Committee.
"The accommodation to describe the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of the whole day investigation and prepares the public view to keep the normal", wrote Scarfia.
Perstin Gloria from Thurn and Taxis said in the interview with the Bayerian Rundfunk: "You're pleased to go to the church and that's a reward found."
She also emphasized that in her youth, "laughter a totally normal pedagogical resources" had been "with fresh children, as I was, to be completed."
It is unfair to apply today's measures for the previous decades because the world has changed.
In relation to the misuse reports, Papst-Bruder Georg Ratinger was often opened.
In law, the author and historic Michael Hesemann said, "My brother of the Papst" (on 12 languages translated with Ratingman).
"I must take Georg Ratinger to protect," Hesemann said, "and all this had nothing to do with him," he assess the results of the final report.
What is exactly in the 440-side report submitted by the jurisdiction author Ulrich Weber by the Bistum Regensburg?
Total 547 Regensburger house paats were used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s "with high placeivity" victims of oversights, 67 home pacts were missed sexually.
In the final report, Georg Ratinger, who was operating in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "According can therefore be found that the Dom Capeliter R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.
At high emotionality, it could also be more strong for students.
Nevertheless, there are many other accusers that many victims estimated the general humanity of R, and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, are even positive memories with him."
In the interview Hesemann, why the final report on the misuse candle at the Regensburger Domspatents Georg Ratinger has deployed his opinion.
Mr Hesemann, the 440 page order on the "Precaution of violence in protection proposals at the Regensburg home pacts" is an opposite image of Dom Cape Master Ratinger.
For a old student, many teachers exhibit their "Mensity".
Otherwise, he appears as a cholery and perfectionist, who was manually capable when a Domspatz had no top leadership.
How do you like your biographer to make this final report?
Michael Hesemann: If you do the museum and read the 440 pages a long report from the front to the bottom, you must ask more than why the name of Georg Ratinger is about it.
Only eight pages have been granted and it will be clearly free of any disappearance of the middle or fellowship in the horror cases of sexual abuse.
The violence excesses at the school were also reached outside of its effects.
Anyway, you can propose him to learn later or to have not taken enough seriously.
The Domspatentgymnasium, on which he operated, was found by practically all consulted as - "resolve", "Himmel" and "the best world".
So, the wide majority of his students' comprehensive comprehensive testimony also describes it as "warmhered", "learn," "competence", "competent" and "comprehensive" as an extremely good teacher who has been regularly assembled the boys with kitchen, kitchens and bunbons and "ever of drunks of children".
Only a minority appreciated about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which has also leaded to wrecks.
That he did not only snipped with pillars and shot the key band on the ground, but also divided ears and went to all fresh guys at the hair or ears, he has already granted himself for years, deeply harmful and excused himself.
However, it should be said that such education methods were widely widespread in the 1960s and 1970s, for parents, such as teachers.
Do you still know such authorisation methods?
Of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968.
I also lived this in a world school, a state gymnasium.
Comparison with what it is actually in this report, that is the detrimental sexual abuse and violence exhibition in the school, are free batteries.
There is already a question of whether it is not higher with his presence and his role as Benedikt XVI's brother.
Many of them who have never understood him are still fair.
But the truth is: the report is detained by Georg Ratinglers in every way!
In the media, the report was very much reported on the subject of misuse at the Regensburg's home pacts.
Will Georg Ratingers also put any development or partnership in terms of sexual abuse?
Michael Hesemann: It's clearly no.
No one of the 67 victims of sexual circumstances claims to be confided to the Domkapsel Master.
The parents were not even understood.
"I never trusted to talk to my father or my mother about it," said one concerned to say to the others, "It was all very gentle. "
The real problem in the declaration of sexual abuse was, and however, most victims have disappointed.
If they have not even trusted by parents and prosecutors, they wouldn’t mean a colleague who would have been a colleague of the teachers.
How do the Dom Patents of School Ratingers a role in the regard of the misuse?
Michael Hesemann: a consulted student formulated it: "I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratinger) had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the devices.
I guess it ... also for really absurd to accept that it is exposed to him ... to have opened bubbles of closer or higher or higher than their parents, internat teachers, confidence teachers, etc.
That's what you're talking about sex.
The report comes to the totally clear result: "These students involved in the front area and/or their environment could not be confirmed within the investigation."
With regard to sexual abuse, Georgian Ratinger is therefore free from any partnership.
So it can not be advised to him, not to be prevented or brought to the advertising.
Therefore, there is no reason to connect its good name to this opposite crime, as it was, unfortunately, in some cases.
In the media, many of "managed" were to read at the Regensburg's home pacts.
The former Domkapsel Master Georg Ratinger is presented in the report "WegViews".
He's supposed to live with this prejudice?
Michael Hesemann: This is the great problem that, in the reporting report, everything was missed and changed to a huge angel of sexual abuse and violence exchange and somewhere, in middle, Georg Ratinger.
But that is exactly a weakness of the report.
In fact, it is separated: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the home pacts, between sexual abuse and violence, and, once again, other prejudices.
The report also treats cases from 1945, such as four decades in which Georg Ratingers were not cholered of the Dom Patents.
The horror testings, the cases in which boys of scatistic teachers were regulated and disappeared and disappeared, including deeply lifted, were all learned on the pre-school in Ettern Houses and pill palaces where they really needed to have a real scand solvent situation.
But with those, Dom Captle Minister, Georg Ratingler, had nothing to do, because he received the boys first to face when they were already on the Dom Patentgymnasium.
On that, as the all-mentioned Witnesses revealed, the topic "Vor school" tabu.
You were just happy to be able to get out and enjoy the so much better treatment and even "paradise" situations.
What else was on the Dom Patentgymnasium?
Michael Hesemann: There was no sadist violence.
And this also applies to the complaints in which the report concludes that "will victims estimated the general humanity of R, and therefore, in many cases, despite violence, even positive memories with him."
Thus remains higher the prejudice to have been seen away.
However, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which the situations were reported to him at the school.
The first time, 1970/71, when he was started to deal with the courses of a school at which he was not actually responsible, (such as the Witness) wanted to hear, and then again at 1993.
Don't Georg Ratingler agree with the situation?
Michael Hesemann: No, since 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dom Patentgymnasium, which even reproduced the report.
In this way, he stressed that "the continues to be practicated in the pre-school."
In view of the risk of negative press publics, he recommended urgent records.
This was of course at a time when legal clarity was found, as the tests were also prohibited in Bayerns.
They had been in a legal green zone, as each of us knows.
There was also difficult to assess him where the concerned could overcome or dramatised, and where the reliable border was actually override.
But you can't say he'd always looked out.
That's not just right.
In the first year 1980, the testing ship was also officially dismissed in Bayern.
Perstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said that it is unfair to apply today’s pedagogic dimensions to the time.
How do you see that?
Michael Hesemann: We are Historics talking about the "Fallstrack of Anachronism", so the risk of evaluating the past after today moral measures.
There's the princetine right.
But, of course, this does not apply to sexual abuse that had been crazy at all times and not even to what was disappeared in the school in resistance and violence to unlawful children, which is already far beyond the same time.
It's all terrible, and I'm glad that it's finally worked.
But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratingler's protection, because all this had nothing to do with him.
His resources for diszipination and dissemination, so ears and ears were widespread in the 1970s.
When physical disappearance was forbidden then, he has also kept it strictly.
What picture of his Regensburger time has Georg Ratinger only reported in the conversations with you for the book "My brother of Daddy"?
Will the topic also be in the language of test?
Michael Hesemann: Well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Papst Benedikts XVI, says of his perspective, that the home pacts played only a next role.
Yet, I don't disappoint any way that he leaded a stretch government there.
However, it should also be said: Without this perfectionism, without the requirement of an unrealised discipline, it would have been possible to form from the national regensburg Pacts to form an institution of the worldrang, true cultural boats of Europe and its musical tradition, which were the same two times in the United States (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).
With kicks and boosts only, there are no large singers now, and before any success, even in what area, but always disziplin, suffering and self-translation.
What kind of people have you lived Georg Ratingler in the conversations with their book?
Michael Hesemann: I have learned Georg Ratingler's work in the book and also really well well and again as a wonderful, humorful, deep faithful and well-believing people who couldn't imagine that he could also do something to do.
I take regularly with how many former home pacts still today, 23 years after his embrace, keep contact with him, visit him to read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of his family.
Those who don't forgive him that he was sometimes stretching with them are clear in minority.
Most home pacts are grateful to him today because he has enlarged their life and brought them the world of music.
And that he's always a good, perfect teacher - a stronger father, know that it might be - but also was a favorite person of respect to whom they still look at today and that they are right to teach them.
And please, once again completely clear: everything that is offered to him is methods of education that have been at the agenda.
We can be happy that we have overcome this time.
But it's highly unjust, a man only because he's prominent and has another prominent brother to do for a median sinbock.
There's the bad intention that is inside, only too clear.
Because the report which has been issued now is deployed.
Now, it would be a man who has gained great services without the outside Bayerns, and perhaps nobody would have known the Regensburg home pacts to finally allow peace.
