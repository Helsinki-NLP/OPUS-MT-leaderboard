UKIP terms that refuse those who live with HIV are an perfect example.
You are talking about when Nigel Farage says that NHS should not serve to pay for those who come to the United Kingdom to make health tourism, and when, with this mind, he answers yes when the interviewer asked him specifically whether people living with HIV are included in the independents.
First of all, you use special arguments and then discredit them by a hardly kicked homophoby.
Every time I or my family need the NHS, we have to do the back of the intolerants to chronic hypocondry that thinks everything has to be needed.
I think you're using special arguments.
The health tourism, as defined by the cingles of the right, does not exist practically.
I think this is what the democracy is called.
So no one would affect UKIP's measures against health tourism, so there is no problem.
There is only in the Parallel universe of UKIP that Carswell can appear as a revolutionary.
A throwing citation of a torch is not a proof.
Yeah, then, go on the messager.
The Email did not write the report, but he just commented it.
Those who control the majority of media in this country should be forced to have propained such a popular propaganda as if it was the reality.
I don't think you know what a special argument is.
You don't know anything else than my personal situation or my identity, then you should take attention when you try to kill the debate by accusations of homophoby.
Farage's phrase has been very surprised, but only because we are talking so rarely about this problem.
He did not absolutely comment homophobe.
It's necessary that you'll get successful to give it to you.
I'm not sure where you want to come, but I think you don't love when the media talk about what you don't like.
It is so rarely spoken because in contrast to Farage and his cingled disciples of Toshcher, who think that AIDS and inondations are a sign of god and not a reflection of their own incapacity to understand that the complexity of humanity is something good, then not.
Finally, the situation is too deep in Ireland and Spain.
With the new crisis that comes in the austerity period, nothing will arrange.
Speaking almost 5% growth in 2015 is a huge plastic.
Ireland's the 'TIGRE OF THE EUROPE' we had, there's a few mothers.
We've known the follow!
This begins to read the article.
It is attempting to believe that Ireland is a vertuous country and that a 'NOUVEAU MIRACLE ECONOMICO' is going to happen.
With the Brussels agreement, impots on the lowest European partners, a three-related work walk, an emigration that continues.
With these ingredients don't have what 'tho' to throw' for the moment with the Poland coming.
In the 80s of the twenty-septe sect, Irish and one of the poorest countries of the European Union, with the portugal In view of a constant perimetre, without the new countries, the situation is always better than it was.
Greece was walking before.
Their development is not a long quiet river, because of recent events.
The lowerest impots in Europe?
It's wrong!
Latvia has an impot rate of 0% on enterprises.
Now there is a real hypocrisis in France of the policy of impots that are really paid by the multinationals.
If a report issued in 2008 or 2009, they pay less than 5 per cent in general.
Only PM pay full pot.
Now I confirm that the road traffic has become large, and there are new cars (and swimming) has all road coins, just as before the 2008 crisis.
I've seen Dublin since 14 years old, the repair is revealed in the daily buckets since the entry.
Is it worth to be the economic newspaper?
Don't worry, I'm sure the comments will soon be burned.
In another article they are in writing, 2 Vauxhaul Astra are involved in an A140 accroach.
Is Ryanair now accounting to transfer passengers from one flight to the other in this way?
I think Mr O'Leary will soon buy a new flat of devices, so some woods and races on the elderly will be forgotten.
This says I want with him the next week, so I hope that it will not be on one of these two times relaxed.
So this would be completely the fault of the other pilot.
Did Ryanair pay an additional payment to the passengers for the additional fear that we wanted to provide them?
But without that kind of Irish business, you can't allow you to leave vacation, young man
I never took Ryanair and the last three times I took the airport that was with BA.
I prefer when the air company offers a quality service.
No, but it's Ryanair, then they can give it to heart.
Any Article on Ryanair defers the tens of people's comments that would never take Ryanair on the place of those who like to take Ryanair and think that those who don't give any other thing than the basic tariff will only take it to themselves, etc.
It's quite transparent.
Ryanair will not be satisfied with additional costs for this incident.
I wonder what will be the late and if the passengers are going to compensate and, if Ryanair will be able to avoid payment by saying that it was a mistake of airport controllers.
Passengers have been put in another aircraft at least one hour, they have no compensation.
I'm sorry to decide you and your dreams of immune.
Welcome to that British Airways flight that takes the English ISIS in Syria, not true as you say.
Good trip
Tuesday last Sunday in Paris, the street of the Francs-Bourgeois: the Marais is largely pitonnier, and the world's lits.
People don't come mass for the quality of restaurants (which, for most) or for the Review Rooms in the Space of Belarus (hyper-intellectal and lightly poussy).
The reason of this people is that the stores are all open and that the village is incrediblely living and animated.
With many strangers who are exempt ....
Do you think the opening of the dinner will be created jobs?
Go to Paris Rue des François Bourgeois where the butics are open on the Sunday, with 50% tourists.
- Go!
The only argument I would appear to be acceptable is that of the areas receiving an important number of foreign tourists and it is reported by the fact that they buy in detached.
Touristic areas perish a significant volume of case number for the same reasons .
Stay the industry where costly equipment operated on the Dumanche are allowed to reduce prices .
Dominican rest is a right, except for the exceptions, employees.
That is why it is planned and regulated by the work code.
Nor the Minister of Economy, nor the rest, the foreign affairs, have less competence to reform the work code.
So they're closing her.
What does the law do?
To satisfy a part of the population and enterprises who want to work on Denmark.
In Montréal the Sunday apm I bring my little children to the municipal library.
In my Ville of 30000 people in which I live in France the municipal library is open 4 days per week but not we!
This is access to culture...
This is also the regulation of work time.

There are piintures.
Some are good, others are terrible.
Unfortunately, his success would like its part of the shot, if you're talking about me.
His preference for a victory of nationals/Franco in the Spanish civil war...
And his hostility at the independence of places, such as Ireland and India, and his ideas in their together and add his well-known hate from the Jews.
Churchill wasn't perfect.
I don't.
But for five years, and only for five years, he was perfect.
In 1940, he held the other government's actors who wanted to discuss a “consent” with the nationals and he was very courageously gained.
Thanks to its great revolutionary and energy, he joined the country in the idea that fighting fascistics was the only way to gain.
The inhabitants of the United Kingdom, and France, and Belgium, and, finally, the whole world can thank God for those five years, just these five years, Churchill at the bar and any other.
Churchill's size has nothing to see with this debate.
The benefits of the money of succession costs may also be profitable to its descendants to sell their wages on the market.
If the public wants to be able to admire it in a museum, they gather the money to buy it.
It's so simple.
But we could use the money of taxes.
No one can deny only when it was "the time of truth," Churchill's personality was a positive advantage for its country during the Second World War.
A relation to the internal market by public work will only promote large societys who will increase their shareholders by avoiding building, infrastructure cancers are lowly renewable.
With regard to the social reforms made by the Minister, they are well reflecting the real bad fair: the disappointment towards the dialogue
Return to chief values.
A reform of unemployment insurance is not contrary.
Let the weakest of us be not in the need!
If we are solidly helped, or it has DROIT in exchange of services that he provides or gave a minimum of resources.
The SM40H, which I prefer to the music, corresponds to this vision.
There is also the bailer who lives from the income of its own properties.
It is necessary to distinguish who invested for a return at the time of his pension and who lives from his backs.
A good pleasure to see two for a couple upstairs, it's seen
The small age of the Finance does not fail to imaginate.
The new deal was a policy of great work, but at a time of care in large infrastructures.
Today, in Europe and in France, this is not the case.
Developed countries are equipped.
The need for infrastructure is therefore marginal, therefore, in nothing a new deal, could be a solution.
About a time when the question of decrease is in response to a recession that is only a brutal decrease
You would have reasoned 30 years ago: more need (or possibilities) bars, carbon mins, authors...
But if you want to make less red the future climate-energetic shock, then the need for investment is critical: isolation, renewing the rail network, urban transport, transport and store of energy etc....
A fiscality that promotes high income and revenue.

Charles Arthur is really a galopin.
Samsung's benefits are missed by iPhone 6 and its competitors of the same gamme
The mid-September entry by AppleTM larger screens for iPhone 6 and 6 More may have disappeared from buyers that would have bought a Galaxy
I tested all these phones, and I decided for the G3.
So Samsung lost me as a client, but not the benefit of Apple.
I think it's essential that we have an alternative.
When Microsoft set this philosophie, we knew a tenth of washing that finally broken by Google, Apple and the open source community.
We must have several dynamic platforms to stimulate competition and development.
Moreover, we all have different needs and they cannot be satisfied by one manufacturer, because they are not compatible.
For me, I have tend to buy Apple, because I love their philosophy and I appreciate the design.
Some persons do not fit any value to design, for them options, functionality and prize.
There's nothing wrong about it.
Let's stop looking for a better platform.
Is there that there's a better car constructor," not really, they are different, but similar.
I would like to see a floring portal industry, with radially different approaches for people and markets.
It's more healthy and has to be encouraged.

I'm glad you found exactly what you were looking for and that it's not a Apple product, even if I have made a different choice.
Most people I know have iPhones.
Our hum-frontist friends who are according to one of them fighting the ideas and not men (or otherwise on parish booms ) could tell us about what author(s) they fighting the ideas on the kind and show us the work they are just hearing to fight.
Or do they just touch the kind as described in Le Figaro, Minute or Actual Value?
Their sources are Judith Butler or Eric Zemmour?
Well, John, I love you well, and you're one of understanding and acting.
I said this about Judith in the vessel of Furusato evoking Holopherne, along with which he didn't come to me (I don't have his spirit life.)
No, in the "ground", because you're back to it, this subject is not interesting me, and I certainly don't see where the problem is: I hoped you and your friends could get me out of my detriment, because I'm slow but I understand well...
@Juan: Recommended that, culturally , ship Judith to Holopherne, that's done.
Who feared himself asking the world?
But what do we fear those who fear?
Furasato and @ gives us answer elements.
The first by calling Judith of the Bible, the second as Judith Butler of a very symbolic gorge.
It is seen how these studies touch the most immediately at home.
We are obviously not in the idea debate.
That's another thing, more deep.
@ Did you read , Jean, because the world has published a article on the need for the theology?
I thought it was agreed to go to the sources.
Bearing ideas from their detractors (Cardinal Ratzinger, inventor of Genre Theorie or X Lacroix , theology ) does not seem very exciting to me.
But well, as I expressed this to our umpfrontist friend, it's all the difference between having a clear opinion and a simple view.
I am not on the other hand that he understands noise.
I didn't read Judith, the very symbolic tranching of orange, I've been satisfied with the "Two sex" (I've been more than my time) which I believe the source of "the source" according to the votes of Lo.
When I looked at the eclipsis since Melbourne, I saw red lights when the moon was browned when the clouds were opened.
This sudden appearance of the red moon had his charm and compensated little the desire of having sometimes blocked the view of the clouds.
It was fabulous here in FNQ.
Yes, the cloud of the last night would actually enter the Victoria and NSW coast, while the major part of the rest of Australia had a clear time.
A special moon of blood.
Tony Abbott / Joe Hockey is responsible for the Labor.
But if the Labour accepts our unjust budget, we will make him the real color as soon as possible.
It's obvious, isn't it?
I was in Melbourne, of course, I saw only clouds.
Melbourne also succeeded to cover all the week of the Persise meteor race and to practically all important astronomic phenomena in the past years.
I begin to think there is a bad gentleman whose only goal is to prevent the inhabitants of Melbourne to see what is from heaven.
Melbourne is really not the best place for a observer, even though things are greatly improved on the other side of the Cordillère.
There were periods from 10 to 20 minutes where I couldn't see the eclipsis because of the clouds above the Melbourne bank.
I'm gonna put a TAXE on this epipsy.
QUICON looks at this elipsis should pay a TAXE.
I am obvious that your first thought of the day is for Abbott, just as the last before you sleep.
Who or what will be obedient when he will end (forwardly) with disappearing?
It seems that you've been a lot of time to read the discussions looking for messages in which people critical on the Abbott Government and then accused the EUX to be obeyed.
Super photo of the moon above the Sydney Bridge Harbour Bridge.
It seems Mars to go into collection with the Earth!
Nothing on the bourre and reality speculation.
Nothing about inequality between employment and capital income.
Nothing about tax offence.

Nothing on the gardens of Babylon...
The article says too or not enough.
The detail and arguments of these preconciliations are not given.
No hypertext link to the origin documents so that it may be considered.
Go see Tuesday Tuesday 15 October the results of the wonderful receipts: Spain, exports are at least lower for five years.
In Greece, the boost is grounded.
However, this is paralyzed to follow the examples.
The reform of notes would generate an appeal request for the order of 8 billion euros.
The Ministry of Economy states that these requests are not based.
What in the case of an error of the Ministry of Economy?
Did the decisions enlarged the political benefit resulting from the cool attack of notes will they be the same forgiving during the presentation of the factory at the State budget?
The follow-up in his time.
Okay, thank you, JYL.
@lol Not the State is comparable to the girls with regard to the management of its budget, since the timely horizontal of the State is the theory, while the household is born by the life of its members.
Furthermore, less to consider that public expenditures are improductive, they contribute to financing material and immatrical gains of growth tomorrow and therefore future revenues.
Some response elements.
A regular decision.
But remember the holy sweet of Hyptocratics: the health of the benefits of global pharmaceutical societys must be preservated before all.
Joy theory of the complot.
Unfortunately, the truth does not match your fantasm.
The medical personnel would like to be able to serve it, but they have the hands associated with the law as described by the policies.
This is the same situation as the product which causes medical abortion rather than having caused chirurgic interventions, secured shoot rooms for toxicmans rather than having them in the streets, etc.
On these questions, politicians want to enjoy the intrusted mass.
In fact, doctors do not win money with medicines.
That's why there are farmers.
Doctors don't win money with medicines Since the Liberals want our health system is similar to the United States, you should learn how it works.
Alongside the world, doctors are cut in the same way, but it is more or less visible.
Maybe it was missed to put the fault on toубes, but the reality is only many countries, including Australia, give priority to the benefits of enterprises and the 'research' benefits.
Read the few rare reports on our costs of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the negotiations with pharmaceutical companies relating to other countries.
Compare the global prices of medicines present everywhere, as well as the differences from a country to the other of what is free or only on order.
This strengthens the political and economic process, not a medical or scientific, direct or indirect medical process.
Actually, some undertakings are at present even testing on marijuana inhalations against unecological doubts, despite the laws that deliver them and the unfair allowances necessary.
Although producers of certain medicines may not be happy only using alternatives such as marijuana, those who come to a version offering good quality products to known doses will be widely benefited.
I'm sorry to tell you, ladies, but you're wrong, it's a lot of things happening in medicines and pharmaceuticals.
With regard to this hospital, they were satisfied to serve it until someone put the push into the ear of a person responsible for this hospital.

If researchers were searching for social sciences instead of policy and networking, their “work” could be used.
A investigator does not compare a fact to another.
Compare it's not looking for.
Compare this is not to search.
You can't say, "the search is overwhelmed" and then in the same thread "I must experience everything."
If your searches are conducted why expertise?
If your search is not moved, why are you asking them to apply?
Can you explain me how a "chreacher" can decline that a student who cannot simulate only mathematics can easily simulate mathematics and other materials?
New technologies can learn the condition that students learn to serve new technologies, but how would new technologies learn if they don't know it?
The pool tests are only a indicator that allows us to find indicators that are satisfied.
What would it be to build a indicator that reports you about what you are set, a self-promoting will, a lie?
One track to form teachers: far away from the training of sophists and ideologists and that practical teachers are teaching practicals.
manufacture the paragraph on the stages (which is not very argumented) and you will see that your conclusion will make us the most ineffective conservatism: "It is a device which leads primarily to the reproduction of existing practices, and that does not allow you to progress the system" .
In view of the general consensus on the status of the French system, only practical teachers may not wish, even if they have all their place in a modern training of teachers
The theoryans of education must have no place.
Practices must have one.
Would you submit to be operated by a chirurgian whose training is purely theory, and who never put his foot into a operative block before?
There is no consensus on the cause of educational system problems.
To give more weight to education theories, it would be definitively destroy it.
Your similarity is totally faithful: if I wouldn't like to be opted by a practical who has only a theory training, I would like to do less than me to operate by a surgery that has no theory training and learning on the taxes.
Mike Weatherley, Conservatory Deputy Force against the violation of the author ' s right by David Cameron
Why didn't he just tell Cameron to stop?
Someone should make a popular arrest.
Thank you to MDR.
If one day I begin to feel guilty of punishment the author's right, it's enough to read a article like this.
In a information economy, the violation of the author ' s right is a flight.
That's the same thing because they need to circulate their sources correctly.
Soon, get a license does not cost anything.
No, it is a violation of the right of author.
Not at all the same thing.
By using content without having the appropriate license, you will pray the artists of their poin's winner.
You can always discuss a pending hypothesis - but it's flight.
And you can repair it as much as you want, it will not be for as much true.
It is a violation of the right of author.
Come on. Repeat him again.
If one day I'm starting to feel guilty of the author's right.
Of course, it doesn't depress you to pray the artists of their income.
If they think they should receive money for images used in school currency, a almost perfect definition of what should be a reasonable use, then I am pleased to provide them from this physical income.
Reading No. 1 should be shown how, if children themselves create anything and publish it on their favorite social networks, they leave all intellectual properties on the site under the general conditions they have passed from a click.
Maybe if they share the hearers of their mp3 bathroom with a cop in the school bus, they should be expulsed to entitle the law so.
Oh, if we could export this resource we're rid of, the riddle that says that it's wrong....
If it's a PS deputy that confirms it, we need to believe it.
I have 2 kids and when they're in the age to choose, I'd advise them to leave France if nothing changed from there.
France moves people down by continuously assisting them.
I don't want my children to support the debt that this policy will be created.
What's going to France down, these are the talks like yours.
@gus I'm working in private business forever.
I had the CHANCE to work in business designed by excellent business heads: it exists in France but it's weird.
I am employed because I know that I have no skills to lead a company and this choice allows me to throw in red bullets on the shots I often meet.
At the rise in my baskets I fully share the post of Jean-Pierre Bernajuzan: he says the horror truth!
@gus, if you are compared to the German enterprises that French undertakings continue to ask reforms in France, the enterprises have restructured their industrial tissue to make it competitive, particularly by ensuring the link between the large enterprises and the small and small - what are the French patrons to do so much?
What's the State keeping their hand?
Is that the State they accuse of imperity?
Enter L@item: intable Text context
Always this anti-prises of your part!
Repeat me, what have you created as a job, as an added value, to be so serious?
@ Pat I understand your reaction.
In fact, France is contrary to an unresolved problem: the uncomprehensiveness of French undertakings who cannot create jobs and that are deployed and threatened by waiting for the Permanent Asistant of the State!
It's terrible!
But they have solutions: removal of the Working Code, patronal charges, impôts, work for 45 hours/seven payed 35, and some, walking on eggs, makes it possible to recall the loneless wages!
I've tried to see all the comments on this subject.
What is ironic to see how people always enjoy the First Group.
As I see from where I am, Last has not really been an investment for us.
They tried to keep flowers rather than transforming.
This does not mean that the ecosis roads are not improved since Last is busy.
But they were also improved with their predecessors, including British Rail.
Unfortunately, we don't have the power to do this, hela.
I tried to have them recently, but I didn't succeed.
But well, the Labour's gonna shoot us out of nerve, isn't it?
It's an international filial.
They have already operated trains in Germany.
Nobody prevents people in the United Kingdom to create more moral business and to participate in offer calls.
But it seems that we are not very good in management, most of our privatized services end by being managed by a foreign operator.
I still remember the scandal and criticism when the Virgin contract has backed, so that the decision is finally can be canceled.
And there's better: MTR, a Hong Kong society paid the Crossrail Operation contract for 8 years.
The Labour, as they repeated it during the referendum campaign, is totally for common development and sharement and thinks that workers must all go beyond the borders.
It is therefore possible that they will be happy of this decision;)
This may be because the Netherlands management is on good rail while the Britishs are not.
What ScotRail needs, is not just a owner's change but mostly new ideas.
Abellio may be the less bad choice possible, but the real problem is the ridiculous system of franchise, not the franchist.
"It was a battle girl."
Lord, I hate, but I really hated that kind of expression.
To suppose that the fact to be "batting" is a higher quality than many others, the question of others, the understanding, the hearing, for example, the fact of being "batting" has nothing to see with the survival to a disease: the "batter cancers", which are not less dead, I know the palancies.
Except of a disease has nothing to see with merit.
Let's go again.
I don't tell you that it's LA condition to generate, I'm telling you that it's AIDE.
Nobody's seen with some fucking merry...
When in the examples of your life, there are only you to judge them.
I'm getting.
Insincer, it would be just a moment that we can have merit to get out of a disease or that we can describe it, it is simplely monstery.
The body follows or does not follow.
A body that leaves everywhere, despite your trust in the doctor, do you have a vague idea of what C?
I wanted to think about the contrary, if a solid moral allows, without sure, to make more easier treatment and to prepare it, to try experimental treatment as this woman has done and not to refuse them by fear.
Somebody who is fighting in a doctor is primarily everyone who trusts your doctor.
But if we prefer to be sent to the "seacher" is something else.
Not with mercy, nor with strongness.
These considerations are subject to moralists.
When you're attracting a salt, a real, you're going to be just a zombie.
I personally touched it two, sales, bigs, and if I'm "battu" as they say these psychologist purposes, it left me completely.

I thought the accusation against Milosevic was decided and ended a ten years ago.
I didn't see that name in the newspapers for at least that time.
What's going on?
It's a birthday.
Forgotten birthday.
Its procedure was "sheating fast" and then bailed under the taste.
Is the story that we've been told at the time?
The communist became national who has decreased three wars in the Balkans in the last decade?
The Communist President of the Federal Socialist Republic of Yugoslavia?
Please ask, therefore, what is voluntary left from the side: 1.
How could the OTAN bombings be legal in accordance with UNMINDRE international law rules?
What country has Serbia attacked?
About RTS (Radio-Television-Serbia), why don't you mention that the OTAN destroyed the same building by killing civilians, then considered it as a valid target.
Milosevic had no way to get out of it: if he had not defended his country against the attacks of the OTAN, he would be crucified as a traders.
And if he defended him, he would be valuated by the Western composer.
The Westers used a smoke screen to detain a part of a sovereign State which then announced unilaterally its independence and was pretty recognized by the Western States who then have a bit on the ground situation.
Serbian population is now totally disappeared (ethnic cleaning).
Vojislav Kostunica, mentioned here, is politically dead after his first mandate to understand the situation that has been developed.
Zoran Djindjic was one of the most controversed figures of the political world in time.
Finally, the Guardian should not qualify Milosevic of tyran (unless we did not love it).
I know it is only in Greece that a method of prevention of seisms walks nearly, measured the pizza level in the quarter.
This kind of studies is inconsistently useful and thanks to share the results.
So a hope but the skill is to put this water has nothing to see with the name HAT-P-11b, located around 124 years of light of the Earth in the Cygnus constellation, which would “the smallest and fresh planet to present detectable water molecules” , according to a study conducted by the team of Drake Deming and Jonathan Fraine of the University of Maryland.
So method to follow.
Like those involved animals feeling a threat to come.
Thanks Pastor for Sciences to regain us, often, of these expertise that are done in the world.
How would the animals know (A advance )?
It is uncertainly that other elements of which the rate is evolved in the case of seisism.
Like the race, for example.
A gas has an inoorable priority for man but may be dismissible by animals.
All these methods are undetectable for man, but not for the measured instruments it is available.
But we don't have confidence results on these tracks...
It was many times observed (and since the centuries) that some animals act along a few hours with seismo, including pools, dogs, but especially fish and serpents.
I had seen an art report that told the fight of two scientific teams, the Californian, the other Japanese, to recognize the validity of their work that had to be aware of animals in the land magnical fields, and more particularly to their change before seisism.
So I wasn't scientific, but their hypotheses had convinced me!
Or are we on these searches?
Why so much disappearance against this track?
We should learn to listen to the nature...
If you consider things quiet and severely, it is published in a serious page, and no one despises it.
Since we speak of the "signs" given by the animals, the same beast is mourned: everyone will remember that five minutes before a seed the red fish turned ridiculously around.
I don't understand that we could think that Boris would be a good leader for the Conservators.
He did it too much as the killer of London.
When you listen to the LBC program, you can't stop thinking that this man knows nothing and he's always trying to divorce with a blague.
He never answers anywhere directly.
He also said that he was agreed with Farage, then Nick Ferrari asked him about what.
He couldn't mention one point.
He made so many promises to choose themselves as a master, and he did not hold it alone.
It only emphasises what the rest of the Conservative Party is only a mercy rassy, right?
Because he's popular.
Because he's funny.
He was in "Hay I Got News For You".
Because it's a celebration, and we've been taught to people the worship of the celebration.
The Londonians voted for him and it will be the same for the rest of the country.
When (and not if) he takes the party direction, the popularity cotton of the Torries will grow the plate I'm sure.
Let God help us.
I'm not so sure: people love blasphemies, but they don't want to be their first ministry.
That's exactly what the Londonians said.
He should have brought with him his friend the parking, more smarter than he.
Well, I think he's trying to copy R Branson

Continue to make us back, and show that the Bretons are great travelers!
Peter, Trinity and Tobago.
Good morning I think the good red that has demonstrated against taxes is happy to know that this trip is sponsored by the Britain Region and the Brest Ville.
More seriously it seems to me that local collectivities and public agencies of any kind should not conceal a so-called of our imposes to finance the dreams of some sympathic attractors as well as those here!
Is there players in the current Serbian training, or cosovare origin?
I know that Dusan Bajevic in Lyon and Milos Krasic, once in the Juventus and now in Fenerbahsch, are from Mitrovica, but I don't know if they are still in the team
It's Bisvac's defender, not Bajevic.
Bajevic was a middle of terrain or before in the 70 and 80 years and entered many teams in Greece, but I don't know where he is.
Bajevic is Mostar, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and played as an attracting the Great Velez team, which, under the Legendary Suleman Rebac, completed two times in the second place in the Yugoslav link (and also contained points like Vahid Halilhodzic and the faithful equipped with Arsène Wenger, Boro Primorac).
Well, thank you Mole!
Sure I know Halilhodzic and Primorac.
Just with wonderfulness, what happened to Krasic?
It was said he would become a big player when he was at the Juve, he's currently in Turkey, but the last time he appeared on my radar screen he was linked to Blackburn *frisson*
There, I can't help you.
I know he lost his place when Conte came, then he went to Fener, and so much I know there's no title there.
Maybe he can do anything yet, maybe in the Indian Super League?
Successfully, Serbia.
Successfully, Albania, he doesn't be afraid.
You should love Albania because you are neighbors.
The thing is that this drone is not the drapeau of the true Albanie today.
Apparently, it was the dragon of the Great Albania, which includes all the regions where there is an important Albanian presence.
A little extreme nationalism, actually.
Successfully, there was no too disappointment (which I know).
In fact, it was an Albanian dragon with the card not what the Great Albania is called, but the Albania before 1913, when the large European forces decided to give ends from the country to the neighbouring countries.
How could we feel "a joyful explosion" when seeing two tours are confused, knowing that women, men and children are inside?
How?
What me bound a little in this "themognage" is that the only fact that he could, would only once, rejoice spontanly of the terrible death of thousands of people, proves to my eyes of a "border line" person whose all the "themagnes" should be taken with the greatest circumstances.
Unfortunately, at the short time of "joy," we wouldn't think to the dead or to the reality of the inflated horror.
It is just a moment that musulmans had been able to do true and apocalypticly bad to the great evil of Satan in his heart.
To do the powerful.
That's great.
It seems that this feeling was shared by thousands of musulmans rose by their feelings of humiliation.
With witnesses filmed in Palestine.
Klasse shapes.
We've got a bit out of it.
The Western "Christian/blanc/Gaulois" cannot measure the density of fruitation, anger, hating museuman, when he conforms the genereal miserre, the social and cultural development of the Arab musulman world today.
I speak about Caire or Alger fauburgs, not Dubai's tours.
The past wonderful one, certainly magnified, is not a comfort, contrary.
How do the musulman world come out of this diabolic enthusiasm?
Totally in phase, 2 major poisons irritate the Arab world: the conservatism drinks powers and fascistic nocism.
The common point, the weight of the thought and the excommunication (double or army) of its critical expression.
That was before, you shouldn't get the Muslims back.
It's the only way.
Is Edwy Plenel read this article?
I guess it's true in many countries.
But in Great Britain, the automne marks the beginning of six long months of shadow, humble and depressives that affect the well-being and the humor of many people.
Furthermore, everyone falls sick.
Solar depression.
I suffer it myself.
When the light goes, it becomes the weapon for me and those like me.
A vitamin D dose should help the humor and well-being.
The car is beautiful in Great Britain, with or without rain.
The particular campaign is to cut the seat in automne.
Not so much to cut the soupl as the green of the age when everything is alive instead of being on the point to die.
In Great Britain, if you have a chance, the age falls a weekend.
We've been a nice this year, don't make your grind that wrecks out of the clips!
Not everybody.
I'm rarely sick and winter.
But now I am at the pension and I don't develop any immunity in the outdoor germen, that can change, I guess.
It's not on the point to die, it's just a stage in a cycle...
A wonderful stage full of shelters, with a festival that collapses with festivals like Halloween, Guy Fawks, Noël, the risks of enemy and full of other wonderful words.
It's enough to stop doing things!
That's my recommendations for feasts for you.
Yes, these months of dark and green make me more happy and more detention.
For the control of majorities for children , it is the amount undertaken by the State which is mainly the decades of 8 to 10 .
But as regards the number of female income , as their costs are increased according to this measure , these are mostly the decisions of 4 and 5 concerned ( median income ) in accordance with graph 2 .
The removal of half in terms of widows is not any of the treated in Articles or rather of its impact is comprehensively evaluated: 230M of euros is a plastic that does not take account of the impact in 2012 and 2013 and understood that it is indolorate.
And it's not ready to arrange.
Well, we're not on the ball, but the songs.
For once the PS makes a left policy, we're not gonna weep...
It is obvious that those who are part of 20% of the richest must support more than 75% of the increase of taxes, why not 90%?
Continue and encourage these 20% at least work or leave.
Well, I know, it's not politically correct, but I'm telling it even.
Live the trots and the OCI recycled to the PS: they all understood.
Adam, you're bad to see what you look at.
The proportion is always the same, here or Bahrein: 20% of the population are 80% of riches.
A fair impôt, is when he prohibites anyone to appreciate as much as he can.
Over a certain limit, money lost all its use.
And once we over the use of the money, money will be more than to do money, that's to say to make the worse of the greatest number.
There are 20 per cent of the richest.
Unfortunately, 20% of the most workers (and creating riches whose part is logically distributed).
A fair tax must allow those focals to benefit from a part of their efforts.
Or then so much wear the arms and live social minimum, especially if we have a social housing.
The oops of the head cuts to the red khmer were happily alive.
I made two AirBnB recently in Norway.
No problem.
In one of the two, we had things that we wouldn't have in a 5-star hotel and we have not had to present us to the receipt or face the least trace.
It's enough to go to someone, to sleep there, to sleeping behind yourself and to repair.
Before this will be my first option when I'm on travel.
The logo changed, people...
Check your insurance before loving your house.
In most cases, you will need a kind of owner insurance.
Make sure you use a service with the good logo!
Oh, six too late.
I love Airbnb.
"It's very dangerous and highly rising" Not true.
You just missed a chance.
According to the link provided in Article:
At his download, the response from Airbnb to Themen was fast, almost absurdly fast.
During 24 hours, after an email provided to Gawker by Teman, Airbnb had sent a serurer to change the serrures, it took provisions to pass a week to the hotel and transferred $23,817 (for which Airbnb is secured, but even).
So why does this article refer to the subject that it has not received any support from Arbnb?
I'ADORE AIRBNB, to receive as to travel
Hello, I'm looking for people who have already used the bnb air just to reveal me.
I guess to pay an appointment and a month to wake in a moment, but I'm a little afraid to send 1 600 pounds to a site I've never heard to speak.
But where are you going?
“ Support the troops” shouted the Bus $heritage on all tons...
So unofficient arms.
I am sure that this will enjoy families and neighbors of thousands of dead cords to learn that their parents and friends have succeeded otherwise than the chemical bombs of hospital saddam.
Unless the content of the article has been radically modified by the author, your comment is unapured (for the rest of the police).
Furthermore, what would this crime of mass committed in 1988 prove that chemical weapons discovered about 20 years later were still useful?
It is not hyper clear the style of the author: “for the search for mass destruction weapons.
We're well agreed.
You believe it is time to enhance the army to strengthen education
This is never the time to strengthen education, because we are still in war.
Alternative: Is this the time to strengthen education, because we are still in war?
Together, we would have already enhanced education if they would work 35 hours instead of 17.
At the time, our teachers now gain more than engineers.
And that we don't believe that teachers apply to 18 hours a week to prepare their program.
But it does not be seen because national education has no way to provide a office to college/liceed professors so they drink at them.
A kind of teletravail forced in the sum, unless the employer pays neither the computer, nor the Internet connection, nor the providers.
Furthermore, this is so the 17:00 p.m. and 4 months of vacation that we are not going to fill the mates, come here, wait.
How do you don't desire to cut you badly educated clocks whose parents look over you with brandler?
I think that the priority in this area is to disarma djihaiti so that the khurd population could better be expanded.
Where we see that Bush's administration has absolutely done all over.
My first diplomed job was in the sale in London to win three times, and it was still a post for a diploma.
A year later, I saw an announcement to be opened for the Metro of London, it was paid for $5,000 more per year and not even asked the patent.
I never regretted.
In this regard, don't do it if you don't find a diplomed job, try to find something or pay good, or you like to do.
If I had left the diplomed jobs, I would still pay my student ready.
I don't like the work in business so I hope to go through or in public or in the university world.
LOL LOL This article is really late!
Exactly, when I got my diploma in 2011, there was a three-year-old.
The best way to reduce the number of unemployed diplomas?
Exhibition of biscuining pools like art / letters / theater / media / philosophia / political sciences, that is what is called the unemployed diplomas.
I have one of these diplomas and I've finished the production director.
It was warned that the interesting was not the diploma, but, as the above article said, a good professional course, starting at school and throughout the university.
Of course, the starting salary was lower, but we're fast moving, because in the real world the results are more than knowledge.
This debate of engineer / artistic branches has been over years.
Scientists cannot solve all the problems, it is more important to be able to rise early, reach to work at the time and to interact with people in order to get results.
Litters, philosophia and art are bishops?
It's ridiculous.
I guess you're talking about a kind of media study or whatever the absconded area where you went.
The letters, philosophy, political science and art are true filières.
We need people who can explain the major questions to the licenses, who understand the importance of cultural bases such as literature, art, etc., and put them in value.
This wouldn't be better a real territorial policy to disagree Paris and disagree the rest of France?
Personally, I see the inhabitants of the Eson' fin fund and the Val-d'Oise to do 80km around every day in glass to come to Paris.
Inhabitants and small ceinture already have many ways of transport in common otherwise more practical (metero, bus, tramway).
> Secure secure and key parks, as already exists in the northern cities of Europe, Dijon or Lyon, will be installed on the neighbour.
Good idea.
On the surface, space is cannibalized by 2RM.
Indeed, it is hoped that the Paris Ville is working with the Netherlands and Denmark's professionals.
Instead of their great experience in the field.
However, there was no place for UN SEUL vessel acquiring devices.
The motivation seems stronger when it is to find a office for Bertran Delanoe....
Well, it's not all right.
When discussions with pietons and other useers of common transports of the reasons for which they do not prevent me it seems that the main reasons that are present are: 1/ this is dangerous with all these bathrooms, these camions, the roads that run over speed and mistake the survival of 2/ are fully pollution in the head For me the cyclable tracks are walking, it is necessary to reduce the car movement (urbain type combustion), reduce the speed (Paris = 30), to respect the road code in systhematicly speaking road (sounds in the blue that it needs to adapt the writing code for the bagnols there has been 100 years, to reduce the total zones, to keep the ways in which they are not relaxed in the paso, but not relaxed.
The cyclable tracks are apartity, it is necessary to cooperate but re-balance the busy of the urban space.
Nothing on the glass in the Great Paris?
Doesn't a word on the place of the glass in common transport?
EELV's right.
The Objective of 15% of velo movements is ridiculous.
I'm starting to believe that Anna Hidalgo broke the green in the meal.
Furthermore, the OR report, the EELV adjoints seem to be sceptic.
You prefer earlier optimist.
Before the wheel starts, it would better be to find who really hides behind this mask.
Index: This is not Russia.
Not sure to love how the world is evolving.
It looks terrified.
My children are not a financial activity.
A lawyer expressed its intention to put the case before the CEDH, but I didn't hear that a complaint had actually been put.
Furthermore, it would be necessary to submit a complaint first in Germany or Ukraine.
I also hope that these cases will be resolved by waiting for the result of the investigation report on the incident and the criminal investigation that would be discovered.
Yeah, but Liby hasn't explosed Pan Am 103 anymore.
Malaysia Airlines is not inaccessed, in this case, the Ukrainian Government is injured.
Was the accident previsible?
Other aircraft had been killed before, Ukrainian launched in the area of aircraft attacks against rebelles and all aircraft could certainly be considered as a possible and immediate threat.
Did the Ukrainian Government have taken reasonable precautions because of a clear threat or has he chosen to play with innocent life to pay airlines' rights?
Where are all the pro-Kiev trolls that defend their U.S. U.U.U.U.U.O.D., and who want to demonstrate that Poutine has shot MH17.
As long as I know, there is already a complaint against the Kiev government because they are responsible for what happens in their heavens.
The previous: a decision of 1986 by the International Court of Justice concluded that the CIA delivery of weapons to the rebel forces of the Contrascreens in Nicaragua was not meaning that the United States was responsible for their actions.
No chance that Russia leaves this case to the CIJ.
It's amazing to think that Abbott says Poutine that Australians were killed by rebelles supported by Russia.
I hope it can provide evidence to address its allegations.
The investigators haven't said anything about this.
He's called Ricardo and being such a cootic beauty, it's awesome!
His caller Polaire is losing the north is glad.
One question: Is the poorer today worse than the poor here?
I can't make sure that those who criticize the Piketty's book haven't read it!
It's easy to read, I've been in a few days.
It shows the statistical development of income-production, capital income, inequality, unquality of work income, capital property, merit and heritage in the term log.
It shows that the concentration of the capital is now joined from the beginning of 20th before 1914, shows that it is the 2 global wars that have lowered the concentration of the capital from 1914 to 1945, and then how the concentration after...
Bernajuzan: You're not going to something.
I ask you how long this has taken you to read this shot, knowing that a person's concentration capacity has a few limits.
Then the question is not to know if it is easy to read.
The question is whether the resolve of the central thèse given to it is just or not.
If it is right, we can discuss this without reading the book of which the most important is to argue on the unique sense for this.
No, it's easy to read...
Bernajuzan: How long have you read it?
Is the central thèse of his pressed shot false?
I didn't read, and I don't read it.
So I am glad to the summary of his central tea, and this is the one that looks like clean smoking.
The concept of disappearance between rich and poor is subsidiary.
Is humanity not globally rich?
And this enrichment added to growing population is the real political question today.
Malala Yousafzai is an impressioning personality and merits the price without any doubt.
But remember that she's only 17 years old.
A age of which most people are just starting to find their place in the world.
I hope that this price will not be a hammer for the young girl and she will find her way to walk a happy life.
The problem is not the price but the political capital of the Western governments who want to prove the old advertising that the colored pervers are the incarnation of evil.
All my happinesses in Maala, but she must notice that it is used and that nothing will be done to educate girls in Pakistan or otherwise - not even in the popular villages of Great Britain!
Somebody thought his talks were a little weird.
She thanked her father to have given her a lot of freedom, but she mentioned that if she was not where she is now, she would have been married to 14 years.
Does she not be part of these “colored ”?
You should not have any “antune time ” on this site.
You're, you're a terrible pervers.
It's absolutely refreshing.
No, his father wouldn't marry her for 14 years.
She was 15 years old when we pushed him up.
Her father leads a school where girls are learned and is for women's rights equality.
It is, and has always been, to receive a higher education and to decide her own marriage.
As soon as it is one of the inhabitants in Pakistan, in the way he thinks that women are equal men.
What she said is that a mean Pakistan girl must often marry to 14 years without having his word to say.
I'm sorry she didn't set it out enough elective for you.
It might seem contrary, but maybe it might mean that, if her father hadn't given him liberty, she would have been married to 14 years
Instead decreased by this season 4 and particularly by Jessica Lange, which apparently has a little bit bad to find his societies personalised by Marlene Dietrich.
I came to look at the last two series that are enough different, but I have to admit that it's one of the best horror series, one of the most proud!
A first exciting episode.
The achievement is near the perfection and show of Jessica Lange chanting Life on Mars de Bowie is quite simply reverse.
I have not yet looked at this new season (which will be last for me, without Lange Bof bof).
In the case of American Horror Story, I prefer to see 13 episodes of 3 to 4 months.
But one thing is about, outside Jessica Lange, is mostly the risks of skins and mountains that set me down.
In AHS, there are an aggregate of original plans that does not miss the acceptation of the production of today.
It's a little bit of seeing you throw the explanation for the next seasons without even waiting to smoke the quality.
Jessica Lange is certainly a pillar of this series but, you say so well, there's still other things.
It's not just for me Jessica Lange (and especially its way and how it uses it) is really UN pilars of the series outside technical qualitys.
And a good garden I look much for her.
Then I find that the series are sining by writing, she wants to do too much things at the same time.
Section 3 was lightly below, in the 2 it was too disappeared, although some excellent episodes.
I don't see them to do 10 weeks of American Horror History, or it's going to end as 24 hours chronic.
But everybody's good doing what he wants.
That's why I'm saying, 'I'm not going to look later' that everyone's obliged to do the same!
I just share my point of view, nothing at least.
The loss of Jessica Lange, JE think she's gonna be fair.
But then, here, it's just my opinion.
Speak less of taxes, please - let's cut in the costs of the State.
No, let's increase the expenditures, please.
Those who wanted to rescue in expenditure failed.
Declaration of polymics on relatively small expenditure positions, such as development assistance
The problem is that it represents less than the margin of error in the Government's expenditures to the United Kingdom.
The truth is that we're all talking about clouds rather than about the change of orientation than the elections seem to be calling about their vessels and for all this time some, in each camp, seems that these clouds are more important and sustainable than they are - and the elections seen clear in their game and find them bad faith.
More than 1 per cent of expenditures.
“Debt” is principally assets undertaken by financial institutions in this country.
"Debt" is nothing to worry about.
I would not see any problem in which the government adjustes a third of my income (although to talk about consumer taxes) if I thought it would be a good career.
But that's not the case, and many contributions have the same feeling.
It is said that Nigel Farage has not been very honned about how to reduce taxes but well, if you add our net contribution to the EU, high Speed 2, the development assistance to the Eolians at little unnecessary, and the nuclear centres that cost the double of what they should, you're going to a ridiculous number that makes the Labour's tax and the Lib-Dem on the most luxury residents.
Your first $10,000 is not imposable.
This means that someone who wins 35,000 digits per year paid approximately $5,000 (sept of their wages), some of them paid around $50,000 (fifth, etc.) and some of the payment of approximately 70,000 digits (a little more than one third).
What about social costings?
More social costs, more local taxes, more stationing costs and car rental costs, and it is before TVA.
Quite exactly 30% of my money is delivered to the source before the local taxes and car rental.
I'm decently paid, but not extravagant.
Not that it is a problem, of course, I'm glad to pay my taxes.
But don't seem to think that money falls from heaven, or that it is not important to know where thousands of tax books match.
How can a unemployer seeking job at the door prove it?
Even though, 20% of the unemployed wouldn't find, this means that 80% are looking for and not finding.
As I am unemployed, do I have more interest in what others are looking for or not?
What a potential recorder receives 10 or 20 CV, this increases my opportunities now.
In fact, I haven't had any news from Pole Emploi for months, that means that agents are more occupied to control operations that will actually come back to job ads?
I don't see the interest.
Because it is not the State to provide work.
If Pole Emploi does not provide enough posts, then we need to go through Pole Emploi.
What is the meaning of a sensitive subject?
We all have rights and debts, in the case we assure that unemployed are well satisfied in contrary to their rights.
As a controller requires their title of transport to the users of a means of transport, a service leader or the employees of their work, etc.
Nobody cries to the stuff in these cases, isn't it?
It is actually good to remember that the unemployed have rights: the only two times when I had undertaken in Pole Emploi, my right to the ARE had been badly established, and on one of the dossiers, paid by 40%, it had to be close.
It takes time!
I'm not an expert in law.
The fiche and control takes up now, while the Statute Pole Emploi is near to be, in fact, a insurance company.
I would add that the issue of immune should be regarding only employees, these are those who pay the costs.
Politicians and non-Salatarian non-Salarian policies have no right in fact!
It's not normal.
I would add that an unemployed insurance is worthy of the value of the employment.
More than waiting for two murders in the Arabian...
Actually, a direct military response in Iraq / Syria will stop Isai so that this virus does not end this conflict zone.
The situation would then appear to the propagation of black weight in 1348/9 in connection with war and movement of populations at the time.
The Saudians had the spirit of prohibiting this year the Hadj to the Mecque to the muscles from three touched countries.
The country reports that 7 400 had been rejected by their country of origin or their recent travels.
In fact, there was a couple coming from Bosnia who contracted the variety to the Mecque during Hadj in the 1980s, probably polluted by a pair from Somalia, where there is still disease.
I hope the rest of the world will have the same spirit presence.
Is it without heart to propose to prevent Ebola's diseases to take a aircraft for Europe?
I thought it was a simple good sense but apparently those “which knowing” decided that we could risk the life of ten thousands of people...
These western African countries, where Ebola is out of control, should be set in close quarantine.
Nobody go.
Only health personnel can enter.
21 days of waiting after treating patients before they could go.
If they contract the Ebola virus while they're there, they're staying there until they're healed.
There are no dramatic measures.
Nothing last week, people have been contaminated after having been contacted with people in Western Africa while they had taken “all the needed precautions.”
We can stop the event of this disease.
It is mainly available by airlines.
Let's ask them to offer flights to these countries.
Furthermore, customs agents in airports should be formed to resume people with typical symptoms of Ebola, so that they may be immediately put into quarantine.
It is going to make the message of the first and the group (including religious) second and he will miser the Nobel of Peace.
I am sure it is capable of dogme to dogme the image of God characterized by the whole cortex of the operational planet.
He's still far from this concept.
This is only 20 years old that information is appeared as the press of humanity, while religion, the ceremonial issue, leads our actions from Lucy may be.
What is the interest to become an elderly protestant church?
For those who have not not noticed it, the catholicism is widely minor in France today, no person has been forced to adhere to it.
Those who are criticised will not make the feet to the Church, only see the low number of protestants in France.
What is the next stage, the concept of sin is removed, too "anxiogen"?
@Louise: I'm sorry that the church has no limited vision to France.
And in the world, it might be allowed to touch more than the world...
@Martina E, to be honorable (as usually) the respect of emotion as you consider the Christ's encouraging.
For a century before him, he said, "Don't do what you don't want to do you, it's all the Torah and the rest is only comment: go and study!".
Christianism is well beyond a simple reciprocity but introduced the apocalyptic.
Your "pour progress to righteousness, peace, brotherhood" but without God?
Is it a return to the Community? :-)
Next step: remove incarnation and resurrection.
Jesus will remain the hero who has overthrown the moral laws by refining the respect of eye.
Christians will then be ready to take their role in the ethical debates of our society and to make progress in justice, peace, brotherhood.
Not very catholic?
I remember that the lower number of protestants in France is mostly explicitly expressed by the fact that their ancients have been extermined then converted in force and pushed into immigration a few centuries ago.
I'm hospiting too much between buying this, the new Alien game, or Watteland 2.
And the new Elite game goes soon.
It's not invented.
I would personally choose SoM.
I like Watteland 2 (I even participated in his funding campaign) but I don't think that's 30 £.
If this is the PC version that interests you, Green Man Gaming sold current SoM at 30 £ and offers a good 20% reduction.
Green Man Gaming is currently selling SoM at 30 £ and also offers a good reduction of 20%.
I'll look at it.
Of course not at work.
The rabat joy of the computer department blocks all the sympathetic sites.
Hello, is that it's 30 digits then 20% reduction, or is that the 30 digits include 20% reduction?
Attention but: PC version is only for DX11.
I got it with surprise, I bought it, but I can't play it.
Moreover, I bought it on Steam, so no remuneration, it's zero.
It's time to buy a new video card * makes the wheel*
It's a Brazilian site, but you get a valid Steam, I think.
Caveat emptor and all this: I didn't use it myself.
Amazon 30 £ for PC, 35 £ for Xbox 360 and PS3, 44 £ for Xbox and PS4
Thank you, I would be afraid that one day they operate it from your library if they decided to disappear against people who buy it there while they are out of the planned region.
So join the beta version of Elite : Dangerous.
So, was France in 1940 a "three throat"?
So you say, this Nobel price has all seen a gift that has been impressed.
You need to love France from 40, the "the defected strand"?
When you see the literature Noble, you will ask if Proust or Dostoïevsky had it today.
Nobel is not even a event, we have not even desire to read printed authors.
Brazilians, Chineses or Australias will read Modian, which is already hardly liable in French and who describes a universe as limited and as well as gendered?
I hope the other Nobels are more credible but I certainly doubt.
Modiano, Levy, Musso is only a far-related report with the literature.
Did you read it at least?
Or another Nobel price?
It would be better to judge.
With regard to the Chineses, Brazilians and others, don’t worry about them.
Foreigners are very sensitive to the literature and French culture, they.
They will appreciate M.
Modiano to his right value, if they don't know him already!
On your side, keep Levy and Musso frequently.
I share your opinion.
Marc Levy and Guillaume Musso keep all their chances.
Then let's see who got the Literature Noble: H.
Pinter in 2005, D.
Hello the afflicts.
Since I brought it to Iceland, I stop seeing Kia Sports everywhere.
I think that thing has followed me up.
Maybe she wants to replace me?
Or do you hurt me as the Superman III computer?
Hello, Dantra, always hate it?
Hello DQ - No, not today, I took my methods.
That's funny!
I had a few days of rest.
It was fine.
The last week I went to the Beer's feast and Nottingham cedar.
It was a barbecue.
I succeeded to degu 19 different birds, Wobbly Weasel as one of my favorites.
I was pleasantly surprised by the migue of people there, there was not only CAMRA fanatics (not confronting the camera fanatics).
Manage on the Sunday's return was really hard.
Monday night we went to the grandfather of a pot to play at nine card brag.
Thanks to a real chance of starting, I could resolve with several decades.
I hope that if I'm coming to 95 years, I'd be as vile as him.
Yesterday I went to a cheque cocktail bar in Farringdon.
One of my drinks has arrived with a layer's pocket upper.
I appreciate M.
Read a little Bouddha and you understand what you are doing, my dear Christian.
This says, without wanting to worry you, I think you'll get away from the subject.
This total famine, it prohibites investigations for djihadistists from the exit of muscles.
It signals without late arms traffics.
So we have the big eyes open like Meddeb and Taia or Boubaker or have the big eyes closed.
You need to choose.
This is not keeping the eyes closed that we get access to light.
Excuse me, my dear Christian but once again, you do a monumental countermeasure: the totality of the authorities, organizations or associations represented, musulmans or not, who formally condemned the II and its crimes, French, musulmans or not, have nothing to add to these unanimal official convictions.
That's the word that you agree.
The problem is that people like you first see them like musulmans, Arabs or Africans.
Not like Frenchs.
Unfortunately, sir Kentoc'h Mervel, the doubt there is for everyone.
As I said, thousand times, some doubts of the approval by the Frenchians of the Israeli massacres in Gaza, but it would be stupid and uncertain to accuse them has been a priority and to express that they are publicly demonstrated to prove the rest of the French society that it has missed to doubt.
This principle is the negative negation of the Republic and can only contribute to the delivery of French society.
If there is no doubt, so much as you say.
Who does not say the word agree, but it allows to what?
It agrees to a neighbourhood with EI or the condemnation of EI.
Silence is well practical, is the main weapon of those who want to harm the cup and shoes.
Your position is intelligently honorable but practically intentive.
Alex Salmond predicted that the Ecosse could, in elections, seen the parties represented in Westminster because a huge fossed was crowded between their decentralization proposals and what they promised to the view of the independence referendum.
Cameron has to be painted with the idea of losing all these seats in Westminster...
Cameron's gotta go to laugh.
What are these threats?
The Conservators are completely mistaked because they have no seat there.
They can do what they want to do in any electoral immunity.
I don't think even Cameron is enough stupid to believe that the Labour losing seats in Westminster for the benefit of SNP is a good long term for him and the Conservators.
Who's going to thunder for the Working Party.
They will be completely eliminated by the SNP and UKIP, who will cut their head in the north.
And Miliband joined the "PROMESSE" thinking that he could be his party but noticed that he signed the death stop of his homemen.
It is not wondering that some Deputy Deputy Members ask accounts to their leaders.
If the SNP wins 20-25 seats and there is no majority in the parliament, even though the seats don't come to Conservants, they will then be in a very good position to negotiate any coalition and they can immediately strengthen the Conservators and the Labour to do what they promised for a maximum decentralization.
I think it's rather important.
Not if the Labour or Conservators want to be resolved one day in England.
Cleaning 8% pumps at 85%, it is not a super electoral strategy.
Furthermore, when the Economic Deputys can no longer vote on the subjects concerning England, the Conservators will gain all votes.
Oh, I guess he's.
Cameron may not have much to lose, but Miliband like this.
Maggie did it with Ulster's units, and it's well done to him.
However, he is still in license to be first Minister in 2015 and since he gave the direction of the Working Party.
So, in large, these boxes will virtually be behind each reader to look over his shot and see what he's lying, how he lies, and until the end.
It's "The Life of Others" of Eastern Germany or KGB applies to the FRIC world...
Always the same fascination for monitoring techniques.
At the same time, it will at least have a stealizer effect.

Thank you for the article.
As under this system, the DRM management is not implemented, I still read the pirated files, the books of the public area or bought with some editors that have the understanding of proposing without mouchard files.

In your great public library, you will be systematicly noted that everyone gives its reliability card (fn*c, d**itre, ...).
There are also required heads of work, including the opening and completion rates are uncertainly decided.

@Thomas: In the age of the Big Data, the data is not really needed to be personal to be relevant.
Attention to not put the entire literature in the same bath.
Anonymous data collection when a profile is...

But Kobo has all this information, he.
There have been such exchanged, erroneous and contradictory statements from the Turkish Government in the last few days that the country seems to be guided by a full class of spizofreen children under acide.
It's worse than that if you take into account the religious fundamentalism of Erdogan.
It's interesting that some parties of Erdogan think that the islamist is such an insult that they abolish your comment, but not my. ;-)
While seeing:-P but Turkey has no desire to throw a balloon into the feet, less to win something.
If it attacks ISIS, ISIS will resume, so it is actually throwing a balloon into the feet.
A diplomat to the pension written on its blog: "The AP reports that Iran has retained the United States that it would be an error to try to reduce the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad because it would be dangerous to Israel ' s security.
It is not clear in the article if Iran had sent there a serious warning of representations or if he was just consulting the skills.
This second option is more likely and, in all cases, that really surprises is that today the diplomatic commitment of Irish and Americans concerning Syria, Israel and the security of the region.”
The reading of Indian Punchline is to recommend strongly everyone who gives attention to the details rather than the traditional c*neces undertaken by the traditional media. The short article you give the link is important and should be read by keeping the realistic observations/ previous warnings from Iran to the Afghanistan on 1979 to 1980.
Who are these "modified" who have seriously fighting the Lake Lake Asad and at the same time the ISIS pervers?
The pilgrim politics makes the world to the abim, and I will suggest those who are referring to the "modified" unesistent to take attention to the facts and alternatives before sending the children of others to fight in the Third World War.
"Is it even worse than if you take into account the religious fundamentalism of Erdogan" And does it have other religious fundamentalists in the Middle East?
I got one in my head.
Soloemberg's process should be required for the armed genocide committed by the Turks.
Does he ‘ need? ’
Do you know that no crime nor victims have the less chance to be still alive?
A little late for that, my lord...
Will the criminals not be pretty old now, like 120 years?
A little late for that, isn't it?
Particularly with regard to the triumvirat of the CUP planned and directed genocide, Talaat and Dje раз killed just after the 1st World War by Venge by the Army, and Enver killed by bocheviks in a paumed place of Central Asia at least at the same time, when it was gone to found there a turre.
What disappearing!
A impressive master of the sophism of fatal pente, but in addition, we are searching in vain contact with the reality.
That's no argument.

It is a shame of designing them as unbalanced psychological futures.

The GPA is unfortunately a "provisional" resolution in the evolution of the doctor that knew our world.

The interesting in the matter is that this practice will be focused to be limited "marchandization" of the body.
But static chirurgy, cosmetics are not also goods of the body?
Anakronic factory...
It is certainly more illustrate to make a good in far-related countries via Internet and Pay Pal than to send its responsibilities and or to avoid the scandal in another century near home without crying it at this time on all towels! ...
These practices were not more done in the name of the church! ...
There are only Christians and believers who refuse these practices...
There is nothing less than the body operation is a real problem.
Oh, doubt, this man is suffering of something.

I don't know why there are so many depressive comments about what Paul Mason said, perhaps they are posted by people who never were cool, even for a few years!
I think there is an article on foot that waits for your comments in the sport section.
Super article, very true.
Since Tony Parson's movie, there are a newspaper of reportings that really reflect the reality of the Northern England culture.
Never wondering what Paul Mason has well understood the social and political context, he understands things.
Norwegian soul is still alive, but she has been vampired by capitalism and today it is mainly a surface phenomenon.
This says, you can throw a ear if you are in London region in November: 99psoul will go back through soul wines, including the full of northern soul, on Saturday 15 November to Betsey Trotwood in Farringdon.
I also thought "ever the same story," but this is a little goodly written article and well thought.
Your critics really need more constructive.
Super article.
I loved your documentary.
I guess you're happy to escape to Newsnight.

The Palestinians have no partner for peace.
Unfortunately, Netanyahou has never paid an opportunity to raise an opportunity to negotiate peace.
@Jonathan: Netanyahou does not seek peace because he wants to continue occupied-coloniser (or otherwise, it was also Rabin's case).
It is clear that Rabin, Netanyahou and their elections have all prefered peace occupation-colonization.
He took his clothes, put them on the rock and entered into the water.
A Israelite flowed them.
The representative of Israel was kind of anger and voted: "What are you talking about?
The Israelites weren't even there at the time."
The Palestinian Representative (ONU) was driving and added: and now that the things are clearly established
Israel and most of his population have no confidence in the biological government of the Palestinian authority and will not disappear the guard ...
That translates to Israel's anti- Israel's an revelation, that is not the goal seeked ...
Antisionist: But I answered you, I translated: the global geopolitic report ...
And it's always so since the political is globalized...
Probably, avoiding...
In the Israeli Colonial conflict, for the creation of the Palestinian state, it is certain that it is lost!
For the creation of Israel, you don't answer.
What force report has Israel's creation?
Antisionist: Israeli-Palestinien conflict is still a force report today!
Are you sure?
Nevertheless, it turns not only around Russell Brand, but the Guardian journalists have seem to have a bad way to go beyond whatever he doesn't have to say.
Many of what he says is only pseudo-chomskyst Balles written of others.
That's what proves you don't understand what Russell Brand says, or what Noam Chomsky said.
It's just a follow of personal attacks and insecutions (My daughter of 13 years loves it well, which would mean that it is an immortality question).
A really close charge, with just a soup of conscience that Russell Brand says some truths, perhaps the truths that you don't think.
Become, this feeling will be growing more!
I can understand why Brand horrily some: it is sometimes prominently speaking and after all the absurdities of the tableids he actually gives the impression of being a people starting, but all this story to not vote has been completely badly interpreted after me.
The general consensus seems to be that he just said to people not vote and rather believe the arms and ignore all the political process - but if you look at the Paxman interview and other articles / videos that he has posted, he said that all the five years only for the Labour or the Conservators (or the Lib Dems I suppose) and limit the democratic commitment to this is completely unnecessary, both parties (to legally different levels) go ahead of vote in favour of particular interests, multinational enterprises and rich enterprises, at no time it's not only to ignore the political commitment that these parties are not governed in our name: it is more than to say that it is just to vote and to connect for five years, more politically, it must be aware of politically unrealised.
I do not say that it is necessary to agree with its solution (for I think that it is politically active with its requests, which can go pair with the fact of vote, seeing that the political tours that will change opinions if they can really lose the elections), but it is a reason for seeing all these conmerging replies that Jesus has said to youth not to take the difficulty to vote and just hope that everything will be better because it is really to deform its arguments.
His solution is extremely discussable, and it would be, though, people discussed what he says actually rather than to label it as unfair and put the concerns of him and of a large number of persons left in account.
Yes, thanks.
The vote was completely deformed.
The continuity of leaving a bulletin in a rain every five years is deep when my vote really notices anything.
I would like more referendums, electronic vote, direct democracy and deputys that take place in the presence of their elections.
In addition, I say that the proposals by Russell Brand are not theirs (written by others).
It is sufficiently intelligent to have its own proposals and ideas, even though they are strongly affected by the genre of thoughts and universities anti-statistics in the contraculture that Suzanne would want to grow up under the label “pseudo-chomskyists”.
I am rather convinced that in a debate it would be able to convince Suzanne.
Maybe it's what the Guardian could do, that Suzanne does like Poly Toynbee and Russell interview on a veranda, with even the head heights in the mountain!
As Max Keiser, who at the beginning attacked Russian but ended to become one of his fans and by inviteing him in his emission, is too easy to attack him without really understanding where he wants to come.
It is a political talk that exists since generations, but that has been marginalised by traditional media, including the Guardian from generations.
This "fraud" is especially revealed in my eyes that the intellectual debate has not been holding the DDV of the History, where the middle stories became minority and where the exchange of specialists have been opened to the benefit of pre---pender condensed type Sciences Po for press papers.
For my part, I had seen in the intellectual attitude of Peter Bourdieu as well as that of Michel Foucault, a need to take it to an emitted buck.
They develop one and the other of the very reasonable reasons, but this rationality remains on these emitted bucks that are the key of their thought.
I believe that the State was as a fault for Foucault.
This is a very archaetic thought, sacrificed thought, which is also magic thought.
The problem of the report to the other is addressed in the election.
There is an anarchising pente, neo-lib and / or /liberator ( of two terms mark a duration of the State removal desires , the first knowing to go looking for the State's assistance for its markets ) in the sense of at least State / not all State in Foucault .
The old dream of the base which is beautifully organised.
His thought is built on the fault of the State: without this fault it is not detained.
Who says a crime, says elimination, murder, sacrifice.
This is not a position against the three intellectual towns here .
No further support .
The whole left remembers the good old time, the one of his God of high, Staline, the small father of the peoples.
Oulala, you have surely read a too fast chouya if you have taken Foucault’s Foucault text on Iran’s revolution for a Khomeiny apology.
Today, even Peter Manent wouldn't like to attack Michel by this bike...
Gauchet has a deep reflection on the contemporary individual and the collective, on the difficulty that represents the adhesion mechanism in our advanced liberal societys.
Whatever we agree or not with him, it is an original and respectable thinker.
See this stage orchestrated by researchers in human sciences of the hard left which do not support the allegeance of their mantras, is sufficiently real.
Narcisism and authorism of these people is without limit.
A important point to add me seems to be the post of these "rebellions", which is only intellectual and theory.
The treatment of the Chinese and other "jaunes" which I have been witnessed in Russia is absolutely incredible.
You haven't been pleased to hear our friends of Australia on this matter, then.
And where was it in Russia, that a Russian can meet a Chinese and have a personal opinion?
I don't remember when I saw a Chinese last time.
In London and they were sympathic to me when they learned I was Russian.
In Russia here - in the 1990s the last time, in a market.
The Chineses think like the white!
My family lived in Australia after being come from Hong Kong and Guangzhou, in the midst of the 20th century, and I still hear of some of them to hold anti-Blancs violence.
My father isn't glad that his old daughter goes with a white.
I also believe that the attitudes changed in Russia since 1990 and especially in the last years: they are more rich, the prosperity lives outside the large cities, and through this prosperity people travel to foreign and see how others live.
What I said is, the Russians have especially prejudiced to temporary workers without qualification of the origins of Caucasus and Central Asia, who work in households and areas where they have a lot of chance to be operated by their employers or faced by criminality and high violence.
Although I lived on the River Ienissei, Siberia.
Unfortunately, I heard Australia's opinions on China and the Aboriginals.
It's really strange that a stranger says me that I don't support the Chinese, while I met it two in my life (un of the strangers), I have not kept bad memories, all people stand and, in fact, those in London were very nice, it's the only reason why I remember that they were Chinese.
Unless we don't remember who you meet, all people are worthy, how they remember who was who.
You know what weird is?
That you and the other Russia here talk about the Chinese as an uniform kind of fascination, like if they were an attraction in a zoo.
And yet you're still going out with the white man.
How many Chinese men are with white, comparison?
No one, because there are many chances that the parents of these white would attack them.
No measure of the impartiality of justice.
However, it is the mother of all battles and justice in France remains managed by strongly marked groups as the jurisdiction syndicat...
@Marabout: Excusement, but the court environments are franchely marked.
When in the Justice Syndicat, it is only 25% of the judges.
If a measure of its partiality may be made from the relativeness of the application of laws in the courts, it commands to disappear two obstacles.
That of the political vision of the observer as the actual interpretation of the judge.
It remains then the obligation tool of the law to recently assess the basic assessment.
The measure of its in observation in all the judicial acts of judges, including, is the force to act a distinction between error and partiality of judges.
It would be obliged to ensure that the acts of justice are not separated between these three groups.
Preservation and misconsciousness does not include an objective analysis.
And if all this has not been analyzed, how then say that justice is improved in France?
If that is only by statistics it is implicitly part of a well-below.
The previous preamble allows to include well what follows in the third ratio.
That of corruption* of the judge.
Subject sensitive in the proportion of the noising power* which is confided to the judicial institution capable of a heiring parliament.
The area concerned is the spoliation of heritages who have been committed to the procedure* by successful genealogists mandated by notes.
This Professional approximately receives 150 million euros with the benefit of covering* secured by the practical judicial ununity* of the French notariat.
For the understanding of their mechanism, a part in the comments following the first publication was reported.
Where it joins this statistical improvement* moderated by the previous commentary, it is that the judicial institution has produced, in many differences between genealogists and herories, to make it a lot of jurisprudence contrary to all the laws favourable to heritars.
The presentation of European statistics isn't this kind of rational criteria then an developed form of lies?
Of course, totally prohibitive prices.
Another material for disabilities.
You can say this, but my brother has one of these ground tricycles, built on measurement to its size and weight, and it really allowed him to benefit from full air as ever a normal wheat, with rocks and guns, couldn't.
As we say, the knees and the colours...
Tankchairi is like Jeremy Clarkson could invent a challenge in Top Gear.
Tankchair is PIEC air.
I think the Whill's inventor never had to clean a dog crott on a kitchen.
I'm sure my sister would love the tricycle all the terrain, but it's just too sweet.
The long distance wheel would be perfect for a disability with a pending for the longboard.
There are collars that would like them.
The prices seem actually high, but there are actually people who put this kind of price in a glass, then “see”.
The tricycle of all fields seems to be specially useful.
All disabilities are not poor, however.
Many of them have provisions of a reasonable amount.
Only if they have become disabilities.
The matter is that the market of the wheel is a neck, so they can allow us to practice high prices for things they are constantly known that they are needed.
We can't really say that Whill is a minimumist.
It's an extensive example of design.
Unfortunately it's just a building, it's not intended to manufacture it.
I'm CONTENT that the long depth is not going on the market because there is no way to lead this truck.
Approximately 20,000 homes were destroyed by the Israeli Army in Gaza, in intensive bombardements of deeply few residential villages.
Two million human beings are prisoners of the Gaza block since 2007 (Israel is the occupiant power of the Palestinian territory, not Egypt).
Half are children and young children who have less than 18 years.
Eight-year-old children lived all their life under Israel's blocks!
The unique situation in the world, unacceptable, illegal situation also, as this block affects a "collative penalty" all civilians in Gaza.
" Employers who work on their projects turn a little bit of their cell to the black market " ...
Oh, that's not the wood tongue, rather in beton and army lady...
The references are here to support a argument or a fact.
Antisionist...
The good clothes go in the tunnels!
The black market is certain and recognized.
Two million human beings are prisoners of the Israeli block since 2007.
The unique situation in the world, unacceptable for any person who has a heart and moral sense.
The United States have a good field: Saudi Arabia.
Morsi did not have the time necessary to control because the dictator (advertised by whom you know) excluded it!
Don't forget as well as after you raised it, Morsi retained the block!
And I'm a Westental, so I appreciate...
Jonathan...
The Block is Israel and Egypt...
The children of Gaza live on a subterraneous force, equipped with the people who had chosen his masters!
See a boat, it's a lot of work, Aleks.
I hope you've been well thinking.
Couchsurfing is better than Airbnb.
It is even the definition of the shared economy, without a lucrative goal.
Many are looking for one night on Couchsurfing.
So it is to be paid (or at least hope) in another way.
It's always much less than a hotel, if you need to search the good addresses.
Furthermore, the owners and locators who confidence are often stopped using Airbnb and are directly treated in species of species.
Where is the community in all that.
"What is she placed on"?
No problem with the bever, what's the problem with your grammary?

In 2017 the middle of the night you say!
Capitalism will not help!
The high financial, special, plays with our businesses, with our first materials, so our purchases, therefore our foods, with our health care structures, therefore with our debts of our institutions.
They are a threat in our daily life by the same and our money they have.
All this is to the use of hyper-methic objections of fresh.
To the contrary, FH said, "Our enemy has no name, my enemy has no face, my enemy is finance."
It was 2012.
In 2014, he called an elderly minister of the Rothschild Bank to defend the interests of banksters, only responsible for the crisis of 2007.
Did there be no one else competitor?
You call it how: back his clothes, smoke his pants?
First Reaction and People
In fact we don't know what Marine Le Pen thinks.
Where did you see that?
Because the Germans refused to help survivors.
I'm not sure Spee has really 'reheated' to help survivors.
One of the aspects of this battle was that no parties seemed to be sure of the exact force of the enemy.
Robert Massie in his book "Catles of Steel" suggests that Spee had quit the area because he had received a report indicated a British coast in the area.
The sea was hot at the beginning of the day; I don't know if it was still the case at the end of the battle?
Likewise, the fight ended after the sun, making any more difficulty of saving operation.
Compare this with the next battle, the Malayines, where, on the photos showing survivors to be helped, you see a quiet and fully sea.
Furthermore, savings knew that there was no more German fighters in this area.
Hmm, it really doesn't match what I remember to read on this battle, so I've made a quick search for Wikipédia:
“A certain confusion occurred among the German boats about the kind of the two curased crowds, who had lost in the black after the stop of the turt, and a start-poursed course.
Leipzig lives something in the fire, but when he's raising, he saw that it was only a shoe.
The Nürnberg, far longer than other German ships, joining the battle later and lived the Monmouth, pending and seriously damaged but still in movement.
Following his projectors on the ship board, the proposal was rejected and opened the fire, finally cut the ship.
Without reliable information, by Spee judges that the Good Hope had to escape and stop the research at 22:15.
It is concerned of reports indicated by a British kirassy in the environs, he took the north. ”
So, if it is true, the Germans, to taste in the darkness before the radar invented, didn't know that a ship had shot, and so they couldn't seek survivors.
They also thought that there was a more important cussed of the Royal Navy in the area that would be able to destroy them seriously, so in the shame they had disagreemented to benefit from their progress.
They were far from their base, and Spee had well known that they should strike a way through many boats of the Royal Navy.
The victim of Cradock had already caused the punishment and had cut them around half of their munitions, condemned them as well as when they were finally taken.
Several votes arise to the UMP in order to request that it is included in the law that a definitively condemned election or that is definitely unrealisable.
This is a courageous position, which would also touch the right left elections on.
But nooon, it's a blague.
POUR CETTE JE PROPOSITION INSCRIPTION TO THE CONSIDER MAGISTRATS
A When is the prohibition of trade unions in the already protected sectors?
How long will this distortion of equality between citizens be tolerated?
Income by politicians (e) whose vision is limited to these sectors, it is always rapid to encouraging those that will benefit from their immobilistics to bring real policies actions, which are actually trying to move the things, not the beautiful parliaments whose immobilism is in the measure of their sufficientity.
I met them in the middle of the middle with their small pancartes of their justice" they came from province and did not make the difference between Bercy and POPB.
It supports the existence of politicians syndicates whose members make the huge power they hold at the service of the party.
It would not defend the same thèses if legal syndicates, including extremely right, were designed for the purposes of the personalities of its side and leaded to them against a legal-medic war.
Your claims are completely free.
If the right now disappears the actuality of the court is just having done facts that rise up!
There is no example of the left personality that had so much to do with the Justice but all those who had made their attention have not been treated for it.
On the other hand, it is necessary to recall that the jurisdiction unions who are left is not the only unions of judges and that it is minority.
The Minister supports the syndicats with so much commitment to how they can be useful.
@MCR The syndicat that you quote may be minority among the judges, but his influence is great to the Kencelarian, is not a secret.
We now ask whether the "mission" of some judges are not going out rather than teaching.
@ gus - You should be satisfied, the SM is minority.
What do you like?
@Pivoine: You forget that the judges are not officials like the others: they are the only to have the power to put the accusation and to incarnate everyone.
Jade Goody?
And if any of the participants would never return?
Hello, Katie Waissel.
I believe that even the most weakest weakness of glory finds that X-Factor can only mean the end of a card, then I would be surprised that someone accepts their offer.
Many of them were served as a tremplin to start a successful card.
The One Guidelines fill the whole world stages.
Others then sold a lot of disks or went to West End.
Popstars, the precursor of all these programs, started Chreyl Cole, who actually made a part of the jury.
Even ABBA, Olivia Newton-John, Celine Dion, Cliff Richard, all have made Europe's support, as well as others.
Although others like Frank Sinatra and all the others participated in support to the United States.
In the 70 and 80 years, New Faces and option Knocks launched most of the light-speaking stars from the British TV.
Of course, some have falled in the memory.
But this is what happens in any way to most stars that do not participate in concourses.
Rare those who, after a tube, succeeded to do others.
In any way, most of the cantors / groups can best hope three albums and a best of.
Yes, but now Cole, or whatever his name is, is just in the United Kingdom.
His celebration comes part of his marriage with a footballer who respects the mouth.
Most Americans know that is Jeremy Clarkson.
cannot only mean end of a card
In fact, it has more chance to move on a cart than the typical rock travelling, even though in your dreams you think that all the cow flowers who flew from herd in the garden of their father and balance three agreements on a primary school level will be certainly of stars and that the only question is how they want to touch even before you get out a album.
And worse than ridiculous: this establishs a completely artificial distance between the Western public and the peoples studied – a distance which seems quite fast to the racism, because the sacralist ethnologs present us these people as unlimited superstitious and periods of ritual magazine, while most of their ways to do are strictly equivalent to ours and inspired, such as ours, practical views at the daily day.
Unless you interpret in inverse sense.
So, but rather than to say that the tambour is disappeared by holy character, is it better to admit that our Marians and our Molières have not a little holy character?
Our biish is as remembered to see the sacred as a kind of well-defined object and circumscribed to religious sphere.
It's very interesting about whatever it is.
It's the ten ephesy to mix the empty.
Nothing more.
Super article, thanks.
The recent Panthonization of illicit figures of the Republic is an illustration that the sense of holy is always alive.
Who still believes the interpretations of the archeologists!
Any other discipline would throw to the goals of the interpretations of all scientists that keep the life of a mandarin, rarely less.
When is a confronted critic of disciplines to make a bit goal?
Because what happens to archaeology is also for the interpretations that give the other disciplines.
This would bring a healthy dose.
Your disappointment for Archeologists is all injustified!
They are constantly discovered treasures, valuable witnesses to restore the History, understanding societys, and the example of comparative archeology is passionate.
This method is not very old and before the archeologists had become their “instinct” and their knowledge, and they could lie.
From our days there are technical and scientific means such as performing that the interruption of flocks is better but it can always be sent because of other discoverys!
There is full (and old) polymic on Chamanism developed by the prehistor Jean Clottes (cf his book The Chamans of the Pretory), particularly the re-edition increased of scientific controversity, according to the editions of La Maison des Roches.
Thank you for this strong instructive article
The heroes like anal sex?
For you, Mike, I could put it on.
So it's done between us?
I really don't understand why we can't keep three?
This newspaper is supposed to be serious, made for adults.
Are you really needing to fall in the hair level?
No, but we're not against a teater piece there.
We couldn't look at a musical comety over there, that would be too gay!
We could have been expected to have this kind of comment on your part.
It seems Mary Whitehouse came from the dead.
Since your trial offer is almost completed, I can suggest you to go to the Catholic Times.
I'm sure you'll feel more at home.
He's pregnant mykedow.
I could suggest that we were all looking for a newspaper that pays real journalists, courageous, to write them on the Middle East, Ebola, etc. to their risks and dangers.
Before to make riddle with these pueral culpes.
Not very bad.
Come on, then.
If these "poeral culpes" you are so chocolate, you're not obliged to participate, aren't you?
You also know that this magazine also covers the Middle East and Ebola and that it is in fact possible to do both and to publish an Anal sex article?
Is it the subject you choke, or the fact that people are ridding?
Nevertheless, you're found the crash video amator on the network...
I'm a crash ambassador on the network...?
If the FOM has chosen not to show these images, it is only to protect its interests in any case of the pilot.
If the FOM wished to protect pilots, she would have been secure, because at the time or a other vehicle (e.g., depannish) had gone into the circuit.
But it was necessary to end fast before the typhon we knew it came, but for which the FOM hadn't juded good to advance the time of the start (the telephone, pub, money...).
But they are well protecting pilots.
Well, see, I'm also shared this opinion.
But there is also so that if the very British FOM brings the SC, she will allow Nico Rosberg to have a chance to fight English then...
You leave that blog, my dear Dayrton.
But it's not serious, I have a little time to break all your c*****"reaching.
No, just not.
There were rates of conspiration in F1, but never one who puts Commissioners in danger of death for a farthing history of victory of a pilot in the detriment of another.
This is not the FIA's safety, because it's FIA.
Size noise.
In view of the favorite images, the absence of image allows the FIA to avoid the gentle questions of the type: How does the Commissioner acts a green dragon in full intervention and continue to do it after the incident (see the full video after the incident)
No, it is not because the video is played too violent that FIA blocks the images of the accident but because it is clearly seen one of the Commissaries affected a green drap, sign that the course can normally repair and is more under yellow drap.
Some comments show a shadow of the F1's shadow.
Yes, dear Ethiopia, the course is no longer under the green drapeau APRES the place of the accident, from where the green drapeau is agitated.
This is the usual procedure.
The post of Commissaries right at the accident (the same cases, it may be 10 meters as a 100 meters after the incident) moves the green to tell pilots to resume a normal warrant.
The sensationalism is sold from pub.
Before I thought the media were an integral part of the ' patriotic' proliferation' of the government, but I'm very afraid that it's just for money.
And sex, don't forget sex, fear of not having sexual life, pub and media are good to sell things worth us to improve our sexual life.
Informations do exactly the same thing.
Make the buzz with information you really don't need to worry about this is just to continue to fear people in order to continue to control them.
"When tableids are all about Ebola, we all take the fear" it should be "resolved," not all.
In view of the medical reference, “aller ” is better saying in this context than “relating. ”
I ask whether all people who are encouraging that Ebola could be able to move through airways see that they are believed in the evolution now?
You do them too much.
They probably think that this is the end of the world and that Ebola is just one of the signs of the apocalypse that approaches.
Ebola's anthechrist!
You confound Ebola and Murdoch...
Super article, thank you!
A short and concise article that ridiculous and firmly describes this pseudo-journalism.
That made me good rid of it.
I think that the media are talking about most of these things with this optimism.
The goal is once again to maintain us sufficiently feared and angerous (or coming to the hystery) for the government can make us to disappear when it is necessary.
I believe it is perfectly logical that, if we have to take a budget emergency in the absence of any crisis, a terrorist urgency in the absence of any attention, why do not have an Ebola's crisis in the absence of any abortioned case?
It seems that this government seeks to save us from crises that he has discovered himself.
Is there something fundamentally problematic with the idea of governing by fear?
Congratulations for this post, and to be still from this world nearly 35 years later.
Before this had to be terrible, seeing the context of the 1980-90 years.
I'm blue, live with the assurance of passing there for years...
Too perfectly unnecessary.
As always when we're talking about sciences.
Not only witnesses serve nothing: they have taken isolationly, they can't serve scientific materials.
But they have a negative influence on the objective appreciation of facts.
@trafic: Tests cannot serve scientific material.
This may be why you are absent to ask patients with psychiatrie when there are reliable observations in the coming of the neighbour.
My psychiatric records that my mother psychiatrist explains that I have been studied telepathicly by his beautiful mother.
This is therefore a symptom.
When I say it's a mistake, it's a substantive witness.
Ah, because the expectation of a fact (= here this witness, which attempts of pollution and effectiveness of new treatments) does not serve anything in a scientific development?
What are you based on search, then?
What about fantasms?
Are you put on the same level fantastic theories and facts (= do you give place to verificational witnesses)?
“Resilience”: the word added by the grand-masters, fans of J-L Delarue, which takes place for large psychologists after reading of the anembourg.
@Jim: There are full of buzzwords in the psychs.
Cyrulnik made us the touch of “religion. ”
As a great scientist, Cyrulnik, I hope he will have a reliable range of measure to quantify it, this famineful resilience.
I'm asking if the Sentines of the air could all save us from Farage and Society?
Don't you think about the Team America?
Successfully, it's not *not* a good idea to resort the air Sentines...
So why?
It was a gentle series, and it seems that those who resort it have aware of it!
Let us therefore give our salvation to all that can make miracles.
But how are they going to make kids grow?
The only solution that comes to me in mind is the pit-ca-ca-homour, which would kill the series.
It's already a series of kids.
Children grew up.
Oh, because it's a series of kids?
UKIP work for mysteries.
So keep your Team America.
Always in Supermarionation?
It will not be like if you don't see the sons and the animation is well done. :-)
I'm angry to see this (such as an adult), but I hope that this will give the idea to a chain to redirect the old ones.
The series have almost never decided to be distributed here in Australia; it does at least 40 years that we have episodes of one hour on Saturday and 06 h.
Since the arrival of the free digital television has a few years ago, it is on one of the second order trade chains and you can always see it at these hours.
And in addition, the episodes of a half hour are now approximately at 05:30, from Monday to Friday!
All right, I'm probably a 'treaty' man of 60 years, but I don't look at this series every day!
There is no "Men of the temple" in or under the mounting of planades !!!
Racial syndicates discovered this to give a political legitimacy to colonize Jerusalem.
Furthermore, all Israeli flocks under and around the mounting of planades for several decades have not been able to find anything.
The mountain of the temple, if there is, is otherwise.
Should I be in argentin?
This mountain is not searched for the simple reason that it is the hill on which the planning of muscles has been built.
His summit, or the Rocher's house, makes sail in the middle of Omar's muscle.
For musulmans, Mahomet is mounted to the paradise from this rock.
For the Jewish, this is the mount Moriah, where Abraham lay down and sanctify his son Isaac.
Since it was taken and contexted, there is no propagance, but information, dear K1K1.
Israel also takes into account its extremists, it is good to recall it regularly, and they are unfortunately referring to the Government (Naptali Bennet, Abigdor Liebermann, and even Netanyahou, the last had accepted the plan at 2 states, and has continued to address it!).
It is also good to show how Jerusalem’s approach is not a peaceful fact.
Can God recognize his people?
The shortest of Jewish blame: "God be loved!"
To move to the tourism in Israel, we are often shown of young naïades to half disappeared, alangus on the street.
The reality is, as usually different from what we show publicity, as we can see it on the photograph that illustrates the article.
It's a little scared, even though.
And this photo is a wonderful work of propaganda!
Since the photograph of Reuters had not taken into photos the hundreds of Palestinians authorized to return to the mountain of the temple and who were preded to cattle the faithful Jewish in contrabass, praying the Moon of Lamentations.
@Mat, if this photo depresses you, it's right, it's not the newspaper or the photograph, but this woman and the idea that it's supposed to be condemned.
This system is not weeping and will end weeping.
The only way to end this system is revolution.
Since the economy seems to be leaving, the large enterprises have fully benefited from their employees.
They succeeded to convince their employees that they have a chance of employment and that they can't allow the increased salary, while at the same time and without hiding, they have given more rewards to the small election at the summit.
You're right, it's not difficult, but it's gonna change in this country only when workers will speak about one voice.
Instead of relaxing and genemising when someone else makes herself, support them, prove a bit of solidarity and understand that their greeting is not only about their problems, but also shows your employer that people are not implicitly endure.
Only if we leave democracy, wherever it is, it's unfair.
I'm totally agreed.
The only thing you forgot is that British and American enterprises sold our industry and now our services to countries where social and environmental conditions are worse.
For example, China and India.
All this can't end well.
That's because we are in democracy.
Did you vote for the PTCI?
The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (PTCI) aims to increase the benefits of the companies undertaken by these people in short-term coordinating national governments by secret courts.
This appears incredible, but it is exactly what is the mechanism for the regulation of differences between investors and States proposed by the Agreement.
The Verts are contrary to this project and are trying to learn people about imagint disasters that this agreement will be on our lives.
It's only recently that we're starting to talk about in the media: Independent Guardian World Development Move, so see these links and you understand what is being negotiated in your dose.
Didn't Churchill say "of blood, of dream and dreams"?
That's the one who makes excellent retombed, while digital money has no reason to fall and even less to push on the trees.
The next low mail will be uncertainly the vehicle market.
In the 19VIII, there were syndicates in all regimes.
In the French very Catholic army, there is a sacrificed dimension.
Leave that (learnestly his officers, others, no one knows anything) believes the co-fort of the eternal values of France, and it will fight and close its ugly.
And then with the decline of the country, globalization, Europe, the crisis of values, short: the dissolution of the Nation's idea, having this small relax, is comfortable.
Even if for her, it's more inconsistent...
They still miss you the syndicat married men, celibrates, married women, celibrates, lost dogs and I don't know what still
If you don't write Français correctly, I syndicate.
You're preded, it'll be your fault.
For the defence of categorieal interests, protected professionals have already been sufficiently protected by unions, which has created a rupture of equality with other citizens.
We are urged not to laugh about the fear of the risk of a official.
It is very well possible to imagine a system that provides a certain freedom of expression without syndicats, or then without the right of green, like in Germany, in contrast to the protection they play.
No safe catastrophe.
And with the charters that are prepared, the Government welcomes it.
What security are you talking about?
Ignore...
I'm not aware of Sybille ignored, because it's the subject commented here.
Supply "for the intermediary of his delegates" in article 8 of the preambule of the Constitution of 1946.
He will be "8.
Every worker is involved in collective determination of work conditions and the management of enterprises."
This is absolutely essential with the elimination of the information power.
And yet you have opened, really read then how a specificly entitled "The Great Britain Bake Off review".???
Wait, the section was there, all the empty.
I thought it should be starting the conversation.
In every way, it's Joffrey's marriage I looked, and I can tell you that some have been good assembled.
In the episode of Joffrey marriage we have one of the best moments (Chuckles: it was the wine) in the television history.
So from the card mmh...
Game of Thrones!
I love GBBO!
It's the second time of fact that the emission ends with a victory of the least worse bulanger; nobody did like "boom, here's my shot now bottle it and knock it before your master"!
Maybe the additional pressure of friends and parents finally had an effect for them?
The previous weeks, all of those outside persons were disappeared.
And there is also this idea that "good security, there's always the next week" that disappears last week.
I like to kiss, but I don't think I'm thinking about this.
I am grateful to those who do it and thus offer us a great funeral and we can try new things.
Before for GBBO 2015!
I agree, the last challenge of the last year, the marriage female, was absurd.
Professionals usually put days to do them and they had to spend one at 3-4 hours.
The three challenges were really difficult to leave, I don't know how they could choose a winner.
In Luis, the only real standard they could find it was the base a little sweet (when I agree with Hollywood to say that the green glass on the moulin of Richard wouldn't deserve, in any way Richard had already lost this moment).
I must advise that several challenges of this series seem to be a little artificial because of the wrong time.
There is also the cancer that leads, with the swimming winds.
Decisively, we've been successful at this time.
A bad time to pass for humanity, we hope.
You're confounding the solar wind and ultraviolet radiation.
UVs are mainly blocked by the ozone bottle, which is just formed by the impact of residual solar and UV residual wind.
So even if the magnetic field had smoothed, there would be no enough sun wind for "rain" the ozone of the stratosphere.
There would be even more, and so less than UV and cancers.
Successfully that the ozone cottage does not block UV.
They have a tax of useful functions that you don't suspect.
If we are limited to the man, they have the interest to have bones (synthese of vitamine D), to calm us (more than infraurbs), to module our immunity system and seem to improve our moral.
The blow of ozone the cancer UVC and leaves the UVA and most of the UVB.
You know you're not obliged to be surprised and to consider your interlocutor as a delay when you post a comment?
Surely for a minor specification that was understood in the commentary, which himself hears to prove pedagogy.
Without saying I am a melanome usual, UVs are only ACCELER's development.
They're not the PROVENTION.
For evidence: all persons falled have not forced melanames.
So, when a tuberry tells you that the sun must avoid and live at the base of a coffee, it is better to not listen to because the UVs are needed to all humans.
On the other hand, it's like everything, he kills.
But for other reasons.
UVs cause melanome directly.
Can we steal him?
And, more important, can we get it to the mixer?
or to take it to the mixer...
I believe that the majority of those concerned have established that all can be increased if sufficient force is applied and the strength of iPhone 6 is perfectly acceptable, for the use of which it is intended.
I think the army would need something more residual and has not yet adopted the iPhone6 as a first line communication material.
But for others,
That remains a good choice.
the majority of those concerned have established that all may be extended if sufficient force is applied
Only one Nokia 3310.
More precisely, is it already grown?
We do this fault in each debate.
I decided to account them.
It's the fourth blague on the majority I read in the comments today.
It's difficult to understand how a prototype can be distributed like this.
Before you install specific software, you imagine that the telephone has been removed from the main production chain and it is bad to see how it could come back.
So, hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.........................................................
The most likely is that it is a production unit on which iOS has not been correctly installed and that is therefore linked to the installed use test code.
I don't know how they're doing these things.
But are they gonna put test software on all?
Ebay photographs clearly show the absence of FCC or CE logo and the presence of a red prototype prototype connection.
(a) the article for bottle by excellence.
We want little sweet products and we are endeavoured that industrial produces in 'Industry' We are enclosed over U but all teachers and small trade are concerned How boffer good, bio aac 1650€ (Free Medium Salary)?
But to answer your post, if it's possible to eat correctly with a small salary.
After everyone is free to put its priorities where he hears it.
For my part, food is one.
Come on without a race, I'll get you out.
It is called Bobos, or better boboecles, people seeing the world through an ideological software that leads them to disconnecting realities.
It's the total deployment of thinking-raison.
They are experts in managing, for example, willing to save the planet because they refused to take a shower.
There are also experts in tartuferie, joining the left-caviar, of which they are sometimes isolated, for example by condemning CO2 residues while pasting their holidays to Maldives.
The large majority of our concitoyens does not support this mix of crude ironology and tartuferie, too, be not surprised to meet criticisms often on them.
Waou, thanks for this complete and exhaustive theory and for all related details (avion, shower...).
I'd like to take it well, but I don't find it.
The concept is not so complex.
Boboecles are monobloc.
You understood the concept of the left-caviar?
And well you are able to understand the concept of the boom.
It's the perfect copy with just an ideal nuance.
The classification would be more comprehensive if we are interested at schools.
In fact, the boboelet is partly but only the most visible franction of schools because it is the infection of the media.
That's a beautiful round.
Apparently, nobody wants to look at this road in front.
She's so bad that she looks like a female nest.
Chut, you're next to the plate.
It is necessary to be part of the artist microscome to understand the amazing beauty of the truth of this work.
But you don't just have the legitimacy to make a comment because you haven't passed out of innumerable decades to study and flying great artists.
The interesting is not the fact that Emin doesn't know disappear and seems always obliged by the same subject.
The interesting is that she has really succeeded to become rich and famous by having no artistic capacity.
That's a *l'art*.
No, it's cook.
The fact that Emin don't know to disappear
That's not really a warning fact.
It's just a view.
Only if the only thing you could appreciate these are real dog reproductions that flows by playing the billard.
Playing art may be a problem, but not in this case.
Deserve, it's more than just representing the reality.
If you're looking for this, a camera will make the business.
The author also speaks of Emin's expression.
Look again and let the image talk about herself, without comparing it to the kind of design that you may prefer.
If it's so easy, why don't you do it yourself?
There are more things to do economies: equity activities, the number of horses of the Republic's guard or the status of generals that are no longer active service...
L(honestity is obliged to say that France reduces its effectiveness, but as all countries have done it, sometimes more drastic, starting by the Great Britain.
It's only half encouraged...
The operational without support finds its limits quickly!
A separate approach, at the time when we observe weaknesses, the insuabilities of our defence tool, particularly in Sahel.
A wrong fault for the local collections concerned, which loses a size of their activities, including a part of their history.
Where is the promised sanctuation?
@edmond: It's well that I said, see where to do economics but mostly not at home at me, that is really not possible...
That's exactly what you're proposing to do, see where the gagie is certain.
Let all who have cooked little or proud the military thing hears to come here, the eyes in the eyes that there is no money played in this piece and that's not going to laugh...
The same position is applied to all public functions and public finances will be a little better.
And for Josi: Really pleasure: Look at the inflation of public jobs in other departments and you understand why Defence may be a little charged!
Well, yeah, the economy that everyone agrees to say that it should be done, but it must be seen somewhere, right?
Many of pots, those on whom it falls get a murder when it happens to them, the poor kirise.
It should be done but mostly that it would not fall up, because, in this case, it is a crime and not a economy.
Guignols, go!
What will the Grace Valley close to our Sahel Defence tool?
With regard to local collectivities, the story is repaired to each post closure, maternity, hospital, case.
But everybody is goodly heard for the economy.
It is a strange, a UMP mass that wants compensations and does not rejoice in the economics carried out in public costs.
This article is really the most exciting thing I've never read!
The first three people who comment the same bad fault.
It's the depress to deploy his Facebook board and see that 80% of his friends have started their status by the sentence "This embarasing time".
I think they're going to make a movie.
It will certainly be based on hylaring scenes where someone falls on his ex in the bus by going to the work and only considers where his gun is back into his clothes.
It's not embarrassing, it's completely with.
Not indeed, after me, the author takes the role of the British man to whom we have always learned to foster his emotions and to shoot the dents.
I'm sure if you're a Kate Bush fan, the announcement of his return on scene after 25 years of absence was something strong.
You think your comment now is in the heart of a battle to know who will have the right?
I don't have the Internet.
So I don't think I can't comment.
No computer.
Oh, my God, I need to see this movie before I die!
I can't believe what this article is the most incredible thing I've never read!
Charlie is really to demonstrate that he is all over the sum of the cosmic universe that is the Sattic Journalism!
I'm pushing it back!
It is absolutely necessary that I share with all my friends on Facebook and Twitter so that they finally have the lightning and discovered the incredible lightness and the insurpassable gentlemen that smells Mr. Brooker's key as a divine leather.
Oh, God, it was really zero.
Sure if they're not women or trafficking.
I'm a parasite.
This shows a positive evolution within democracy: the currency of regional policies and effective partnership initiatives.
To the new order, we trust the right to save our planet by States who play cards at each meeting to save the planet.
We therefore decide, citizens, to take things in hand.
With the Commissioner they planned in energy, all these beautiful recommendations have been implemented ....
Translate: Eolians and slots are the Rond Points tomorrow.
It's all funded by the con tribute.
Please stop this pro-nucléaire talk.
The contamination does not be limited to CO2.
The radioactivity is much more negative at the level of its waste and in case of accident.
Since the cell is not administered in its integrity, it is better to be limited to laboratory.
Renewable energy is our only salvation, with a consequence of drastic reduction of our consumption.
The electricity by renewable to fight CO2 emissions?
France is nothing concerned.
Nuclear electricity is wheat emission of CO2 to the production and episodes for other stages.
Electricity by renewable olive oil or PV is already more than GES on the other stages and especially gas, or worse carbon as in Germany, to compensate intermittenance.
Replace nuclear by renewable olive oil or PV against CO2.
I don't blaspheme you, I'm a Doctor of State in Physical Sciences in 1981 more I have made research in nuclear physics I put you to the challenge of proof in contrast to what I said.
So I haven't said you are that make me ideas I haven't told anything about Germany. You haven't responded to what I said, and as all people of right disappearing the interlocutor I never do.
In addition, I refer to you the conclusion of experts mandated by the German Government: the current programme of Germany for renewable energy is an ineffective and uneffective means to reduce GES emissions and should be stopped.
0 emissions if you do not consider the extraction of uranium and construction and if you do not account the gas water vapour in effect to smoke less than the Co2 is true to remember the two thirds of the energy produced by a central water vacuum and a little in the water of rivers.
I stopped reading when you talked about Pakistan as a “South Asian gent...”...!
The last time, Pakistan gained against the Hindustan.
It is not me, most Indians posting comments do not want to read and make comments only on articles against Pakistan.
In fact, this shows well your mind status.
It would be like if they had qualified the South Asian India's gentle India...
I have nothing against the fact that some Pakistan players participate, but have a Pakistan's version would be unacceptable.
This would just open a full Pandore of corruption and mafiosi.
With regard to the ISL, today's opening game was very interesting, the Colkata Athletic Athletic is 3-0 against Mumbai.
Pakistan has a lot of way to do.
In comparison of milliards and billions that India has dedicated the IPL cricket and now at football, how can we revalue a day with our "blood neighbours"...
The low cost launcher rate pays cash.
Damn for such a beautiful project.
For the incident, the possibility standard of design is only shown with a too cold helium.
So, perhaps we are not in a low design, but in implementing...
In contrast to airspace that is a private society, it seems sorely belonging to Russian status...
And if the rules are the same as here the state is its own sureer.
They're going to pay the satellites in flats that they know.
This is now more fresh than many media are the only titles of articles - and many readers have only these titles.
In total, this creates an erroneous impression contrary to the content of the article itself.
In fact, the title is not appropriate, the project is injustice, while it is only a problem of launcher.
