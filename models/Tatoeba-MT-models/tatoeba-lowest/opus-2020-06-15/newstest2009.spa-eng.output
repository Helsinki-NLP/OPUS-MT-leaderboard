Prague Bolsa ended with less points at the end of the day
After the slightly falling in the morning, the Prague Bolsa corrected its losses.
The transactions of ≥EZ actions reached approximately half of value in a normal day.
The Bolsa of Prague, at the beginning of the trade March, immediately reacted to the fall of the moon when approximately 6% down.
The downward of this time must be falling on the actions in Wall Street.
The reaction of the market was also expressed before the vote of the American Assembly of representatives which had been refused to support the stabilization plan of the secretariat of the financial sector.
Catalogue of actions in Asia
The Asian Bosnia Acts lived on Tuesday a dramatic fall, although the index finally attained some of the losses.
The Bolsa Hang Seng in Hong Kong in the middle of its financial day marked almost four percent, although later his loss stopped by reducing the decline in practice by 2.5 per cent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises that continued the movement of Chinese actions in Hong Kong has descended to 3,8 percent, in Shangai, the markets were closed.
The actions of Jesusey's Bolsa lost more than five percent but finally lost to a 4.3 percent.
According to the Index Secretariat, the Taiwan Bolsa was 3,6 percent.
"The rescue actions programmed in the United States are insecutive and that affects the financial market of the world," said the Chief of the Office of the Hong Kong Monetary Office, Joseph Yam.
Although Hong Kong is a part of China, she is only determined its monetary policy, i.e., without dependence of the Central Bank of China.
Hong Kong interest rates are at the same level as the United States.
The American legislators should again be meeting as far as possible, according to the first Australian Minister Kevin Rudd, and adopt a proposal for support to the financial system.
Otherwise, threats that falls will feel in other countries.
Blood Bad of American actions
On Monday, the American Assembly of Representatives rejected the financial aid plan to which $700 million should be devoted (such as approximately 12 bills).
The legislators in this way ignored the invitation of President George Bush to support its plan.
For Bush, the plan would solve the fundamental causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilize the whole economy.
On Monday, American actions lived a bloody bathroom and mainly the action index collected the most caught in more than 20 years.
Dow Jones' index was almost seven percent. A similar volume fall was recently registered in 1987.
The index has already come down before being announced but soon it was shown that the proposal of the Assembly was not going forward, the index began to fall freely.
The Congress is removed: The United States Government can inject $700 million in the bank
The highest representatives of the Congress and the Government, President George W. Bush, agreed in a broad terms of financial assistance to the American financing system.
Its vote shall be held at the beginning of the next week.
The American lawyers caused a short short in the discussions on the adoption of the rescue plan in its form of assistance to the American financial system with the amount of $700 million (approximately 12 krones).
However, it's not yet winned.
Congressers must provide some details of the contract before they can publicly make the final form of law and to be voted.
The financial assistance plan will be discussed in the Assembly of Representatives.
He said on Sunday to the Reuters Agency Barney Frank, President of the Committee for Finance Services and the Assembly Bank.
According to some sources, the plan vote could be held in the Senate not before the seat.
According to the economicists, the arrival of the ratification of the rescue plan should represent the announcement of a first psychologically significant factor for revitalization of the financial market.
Afterwards, however, will be reached to the "descanning" thanks to the complex mechanisms whose market assistance will also be achieved in practice.
Paulson: The plan must be effective
"We have made a great progress.
We solve our disappearing opinions regarding the way that the package of measures to stabilize the market has come to the National Pelosiá Democratic Agency.
According to this, the final vote could still be held on Sunday.
Representatives of legislators gathered on Sunday by night with the Minister of Finance, Henry Paulson, to give him a definitive form to the Government Fund.
This should buy from financial societys the non-producted hypothecrical activities that lead to financial enterprises to severe losses and threaten the stability of all the system.
"We are about to close the plan Convention, which will function and must also be effective on the market.
We need to continue with the sanitation plan, but I think we're already in this", said Paulson.
A sign for Asian business
The global financial crisis is expressly affected by the market of actions which are rapidly lower.
According to the Democrat Senator by Nevada, Harry Reid, the legislators are doing all the possible for the Congress to finally approve agreement this Sunday.
They want to calm the business of investors to the Asian financial market because these are those who are on the first hour and where the Congress could affect the moon trade.
However, now there is nothing clear with security about the votes of the two American Congress rooms and, not even if they are not held at the last time with any problem.
The legislators believe that it will be adopted in the next days.
However, the law will suffer a series of changes.
The total amount intended to assist the system should be divided in two parties.
The first 350 million must be available as soon as possible, and as President George Bush requested.
However, the Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it had the impression that the programme does not fulfil its role, which would be of other $100 million and, more later, of the latest $350 million.
Bush appreciated the progress of the meetings
Furthermore, the President can see this decision but the Congress can overcome its vessels by a majority of votes.
Despite these changes, the basic idea of the programme consisting of winning financial resources for the recovery of bad hypothecs whose value falled because hundreds of thousands of Americans are not able to end their hypotheks.
"We worked everything.
The Assembly of Representatives should be prepared to vote on Sunday, and the Senate on Monday," commented the Senator, Judd Gregg.
The American President Bush is also satisfied with the progress of the meetings.
His portfolio, Tony Frato, announced that Bush is satisfied with the Sunday advance and valued "the initiative of both parties to stabilize our financial market and protect our economy."
Limitation of a blind contract
The Chairman of the Senate Bank Committee, Christopher Doddd, head of the negotiators, said that the lawyers decided on the responsibility of the money of the programme for the protection of the taxes of their losses, an alitive closure of the programmed financing plan.
The new law should also be limited to the named blind contracts for the directors of participating societys, and create a committee that will have a control of the Fund.
This should be addressed to the Ministry of Finance.
"We worked very hardly in this way, and we made a great progress towards the convention that will work and that it will be effective for the market and for all the Americans," Paulson said.
The plan also seems to help house owners having problems with their payments.
The Government should be agreed with the new payments of the hypothetics to buy in order to lower the monthly wages of debtors and to allow them to stay with their houses.
Marek: Psychological assistance
The proposed plan is, according to the economic head of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea that will be done but quite difficult.
"And this is why you don't know what mechanism and what prices will be bought the problem-active.
This will be decided for the reparation of losses between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week, for the iHNed.cz server.
The plan is now adopted or at the beginning of the next week is not, according to Marek, so relevant.
"That more important is that, this week, the congress are agreed in their support and gives you a good view all before it can.
This important and psychological agreement that this adoption is, at these times, the most important", stressed Marek.
Armed hand lounge: MP3 MP3 Reproductor against the mobile.
We advise you as to choose
While almost every mobile plays MP3 files, no MP3 player can be called.
What seems clear that it's better to buy only the phone.
Yet there are sufficient reasons for the man to acquire only the player.
The election is practically depending on the way of its use and the requirement of the own future.
It probably will be difficult to acquire the most modern tokadiscips to listen on it the latest Turbulenc album.
Furthermore, this type of musical products such as the LP discs are no longer coming, and in the meaning of your quality there is no one objective reason for following them.
If you are enclosed in your stories the wine disks with rock music, jazz or blue art, you probably are dreaming at least with this kind of tokadiscips.
This is the same thing with the music that is on the way, that is, the comprehensive, simplified music - the music in MP3.
And here there are prices and quality categories.
For some can be unacceptable to win eight thousand crowns in a player, the same as for a Pink Floyd friend who will hardly test the cases of merchandillo to twenty crowns.
Two extracts, among which there's enough space for each one.
The election is wide.
Also decides the duration of the battery
Some of the best players get much more than just play music and even those who have not even most mobiles.
No current device is as universal as the phone.
With the most elemental functional functions such as calling, sending messages, you can play music and video play, grab the two, you have a better or better photo device and until you can get navigation.
And when we consider the Smartphone and the PDA will also have a small computer on your box.
This is a little wonder because no one ever knows to make a parrillade and no television can photograph.
The universality of mobiles also brings us disasters.
How many more functions are used in the mobile before the screen indicator will be lighted by asking to be reloaded.
And the reproduction of music is one of the greatest energy tragons.
A few are the mobiles that can play more than ten or twelve hours, most less.
In this sense, music players (especially simple) have clearly more performance.
Therefore, consider that barata mobiles will not play more than two hours.
If also, above, they are constantly calling for more security, a loader for the work - this is also valid for the highest devices.
With the MP3 player, this problem will not have, for even the worst watertan at least 9 hours of interrupted operation after a load.
Another problem happens to the music grab in the mobile.
Unfortunately only one part of the devices have the USB universal connection and, further, not all of them can be connected directly to the computer without a special software.
Of course, you can draw music directly in the memory card but only in some readers without reduction can be connected the small memory cards used in the mobiles.
In players, with any exception (iPod), there is no special software need.
Just fill the device with music via the USB computer.
Most mobiles and players will only create their order in the musical library according to the name of the interprete, album title, gender or also according to user value.
Some devices only show a directory with tree structure similar to a Windows Busquet and some are recognized both (river, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, computer phones with operational system).
The player is trying to serve, the mobile knows more
For the selection of a concrete team, it is interested for the resistance of the acumulator, the memory capacity, the quality and the type of sound output and, of course, for the comfort of its manager.
If you hear, especially, music as a background and you will hear it every day just a time, like in the transcript, then you're enough with any mobile that reproduces.
What is actually going to make any mobile.
It should not even be interested in the format where the mobile or the player plays music.
The MP3 plays it all and, practically, almost all music you arrives will be in this format.
It is found between the most expanded and unless it is the absolute majority of the devices playing music in WMA format.
The least include the AAC format (format used by Apple and iPod company).
The best mobiles can also, for example, buy music on-line.
Based on the Internet of the mobile to visit the competent sites of the operator (or any other service provider) and to buy a song or an album.
This service could only be an argument of weight to buy a mobile for music.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is miserable and most are only limited to the issues of success from radios.
The prices are not the lower.
However, it is generally supposed that exactly this way of music sale (which by GSM, Internet or unlambly Internet) in the future will dominate the music industry.
Most people always take a mobile.
Before you can listen to something, you will find the mobile in your cup, while the MP3 player will be forgotten at home.
However, it's still dependent on if you're always taking some auricular or at least the hands free.
If it is not so, you can use an integrated player that has practically any mobile, although at least a MP3 player.
The greatest advantage for many of the mobiles with music will be your price.
The most baratos normally cost less than three thousands.
between three and four thousand crowns you can already buy a good walkman.
Most of you will limit the absence of a entry for classic auriculars.
The best, even in terms of the technical part, such as the telephones equipped with a 3,5 mm. for classic auricular auriculars are appreciated to fifteen thousand.
Again, the advantage of players is not anything else than your easy service.
The easier players - in no way the most barried (see our selection) - really manages any person.
The minimum functions, their manager similar to the previous cases or also to the tokadisks are clear.
It does not represent a threat in the sense that we are connected to the Internet with the mobile and, therefore, greatly, accounted by low data.
For which device to be decided
Even the most barned motors (e.g. Vodafone 527) are generally a slot to change memory card (type M2, micro SD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of an appropriate card, it will reach the two thousand crowns.
Nevertheless, take care.
The basic models, usually, are equipped with a maximum 2 GB GB card.
Only the shoes have an 8 GB memory.
If you already have a mobile and you want to buy a barried MP3 player, I'll buy a cowon, creativiv, Sony, Samsung, Emmgeton or Iriver.
According to the capacity (as maximum 2 GB) it does not have to be exempt over 1.100 crowns.
If it is considered to be among the most favorite music equestic hands of the most specialized mobiles (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have independent keys for the MP3 which makes a so comforted service as well as the same player.
The most specialized of all is Sony Ericsson, whose line walkman mobiles are almost identical to use as an independent MP3 player.
The same service and the same category as pricely, on the four thousand crowns, but with a greater memory capacity (to 16 GB) and acumulator (normally 15 hours, with a maximum performance of up to 35 hours), the more warranty brands of MP3 players.
The first virtual operator will be reached this year to the Czech Republic.
Probably
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators are practically offering all services as their West Europe partners.
However, here we still have something - the virtual operator, who would oblige those to be more barried.
It's probably not late to come.
Checa operators are part of the most card Europe, we have already written it in mobil.cz.
The rest also confirmed the Office of Tsha Telecommunication (PPETU) which warned that the price of the SMS messages in our country is of the most cars of the entire Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming rates, it is probably reached to a paradógic situation - for some clients of cheque mobile operators, the SMS sent from the foreigners will be more barried than if they send them from home.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high in comparison with Europe?
The response is simple, lack of competence that I would really want to fight.
This probably appears to us for paradically, because we have three mobile networks and their high cover is more than 100%.
On the other hand, motor operators like to laugh that there is extreme competence in the Checo market.
The President of the Council of the Czech Telecommunications Office (PPETU), Pavel Dvoаák, already expressed that there was no place in the Czech Republic for any other operator.
It may be true that for a classic operator with your own network there are no decrease opportunities (for the rest, it would be very difficult to find some frequency).
However, there is still a possibility - the virtual operator.
Precisely the entrance of the virtual operator on the mobile phone market brought a significant decline of prices to which the classic operators should also be reactioned.
At the same time, still before the entertainment of tiburones, such as Tesco Mobile or Virgin Mobile to the Britain market were heard similar voices there and there.
It was shown that there was a place for this type of operators and that they could be successful.
Otherwise, there are no need to find such examples too far.
In February this year we inform you about the street of the virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
Soon after half year, this operator has been able to get more than 100 thousand clients and to become the fiveth larger operator in the neighbouring country.
On the other hand, the Penta Group is found in the Czech Republic, the owner of U:fon.
The advantage of virtual operators is in a position to concentrate in many more concrete meta groups.
Furthermore, so that you can operate effectively, it's enough with many less clients than a classic operator.
They are not relatively large costs in construction, operation and maintenance of the network.
In the world, this kind of virtual operators is usually transfiled with lower expenditure - offer barato SMS calls and messages that often contrary with the most adapted services offer.
So, for example, Teco mobile in Gran Bretagne offers SMS as a minimum half of baratos concerning competition.
However, as the example of Mobilking in Poland is shown, it can be a good battle also offered by a none trivial meta group.
This operator is specifically directed to the man.
"The correct man elige Mobilking - is the operator who loves and in whom you can be trusted", says David Seibert, the CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, who works this virtual operator.
It's difficult to say if it seems like a concept like the Poland could enter into our country.
In this regard, Vodafone portrait Miroslav íepický: "The Checo market is relatively small to access by segments in which most virtual operators are based.
Furthermore, from the point of view of the service offer is relatively saturated."
There are no possibilities in the Czech Republic to say motive operators
However, it seems likely to be sure that if any virtual operator in the Czech Republic does not be motive.
"We are talking about the expansion of this project, however, in the Checa, it seems not too much hopeful.
Moreover, it is the launch of Mobilking in other countries of our region," he said in telephone conversation for mobil.cz, Jana Studničková, leading to the Penta financial group.
Indirectly assured that the current mobile phone operators in the Czech Republic are finally not addressed to this idea.
Nevertheless, they try to do all that possible so that no potential competition is overcome.
Interesting to launch a virtual motor operator already shows the GTS Novea GTS group that I would like to give a further step in order to become a real competence of telephone O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest in this, to offer our customers not only fixed telephone services but also mobile phone.
And how much before, better.
With this opportunity we found once again with all the Czech mobile phone operators.
With some of them we achieved progress at the meetings," the group portrait, Pavel Kaidl.
So, maybe they can make better time.
It seems that, by non-official information, the first official operator would have to reach already a year end.
But now your appearance is accompanied by an immense wall of silence.
"In these times we believe that the situation is worthy for the appearance of a virtual operator in the Czech market.
The Chess market in comparison with others is a very specific market.
Until this person has been directed to us with some complex and serious project on this ground," he expressed for mobil.cz, Vlastimil Mrsšeć, port of Telephone O2.
The specificity of the Czech market is related to other operators.
The T-mobile portrait, Martina Kemrová, in accordance with the O2 opinion, added: "We have not registered any viable commercial project that, in bilaterally proved, can continue to develop. "
And adds: "In the T-Mobile network, there will be difficult to find any virtual operator until the end of the year.
We should now have a specific contract on the table that would be able to study in so shortly horizontal."
Vodafone is more attention to the fulfilment of the own requirements of a 3G license.
Miroslav ≤epický adds: "We are open to negotiations with virtual operators and that concerns the costs and infrastructure reparation.
We just consider it as the greatest approximation from the point of view of customers.
The main Vodafone strategy in this field is found in the partner with which establish a shared network for a fast internet on the mobile."
Responsive Offices - with Women's and Life Operators
The progress of motor operators can easily understand, but the entry of another operator would mean to increase the competitiveness that would result in a lower price decline and, with this, to a decline of the gains.
Then why facilitate access to competition?
When operators want to get something, they are able to throw the same memory, test it is the agarron when you arrived:fon.
Maybe the greatest pressure to ◆TU was at the time of entering U:fon for the T-Mobile society.
It shows the accessible public information on the web pages of the μTU.
But exactly now U:fon serves as a argument why not accept a virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová adds to this: "Adam, it does not so much that the competitive environment on the mobile phone market was opened to a room operator.
With regard to the character of the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic, it is natural that the entry of another player on the market would submit to him and, above all, for its large requests."
That is why this access to mobile operators is tremendous disagreement because of the absolute interest of the Checa regulator.
It is not only the post of the NATU, which unfortunately has no competence to intervene in trade licenses, differently from British and other developed countries.
This includes purely the Office for the Protection of Commercial Litifications (UOHS).
However, it expressed its kind of posture to this problem.
"The entry of a virtual operator to the mobile phone market would be possible after a convention on the purchase of the necessary infrastructure between a mobile telephone operator and a virtual operator.
Until today no convention has been closed since the offer of the most interested potential was not sufficiently interesting for the classic operators," he added to our question Christian Chalupa, from the Department of External Relations of UUHS.
These statements do not be surprised by the representatives of the operators.
For the offices that should represent the interests of consumers, it is something more than a consideration, otherwise it should be noted that no one is entitled to its position on the market.
Specially when Christian Chalupa adds: "In the foreign where virtual operators work normally, we can note that their entry into the market has contributed to the lower price of mobile phone services"
Of course, pressure concerning the correct functioning of the market environments and lower prices is not within the interest of UOHS.
Actually dramatic dramatic drug in all this case was shot in the disonant reactions resulting from the three mobile operators.
The question of whether it really is an accidentality, it is offered by himself alone.
It is the same as with the price of gasolines in the gaselines because it is clear that it is the work of casuality and a hard fight for competition.
" The Office in this sense has not found characters of illegal competition and has no reason for any way to intervene.
No one of the operators has a dominant position, therefore, no relevant responsibilities in their undertakings on the market.
The tools required for opening the mobile telephone market to virtual operators, mostly lack, as well as telecommunication regulators", added to their Chalupa response.
The interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of the many conflict points.
There is obviously an analysis of relevant markets prepared by NATU as the telecommunications are from the point of view of trade licensing a single market.
In this type of market, no of the Checo operators have a dominant position.
However, some legal experts offer another vision - to overcome a virtual operator is always necessary to agree with the manager of the network.
And the mobile phone operator, with all your logic, has the monopolium of your network.
Therefore, in a specific segment, it must be necessary to dominate.
And if this argument was not accepted, at least UOHS should represent an avertising that three mobile operators are called on a similar basis.
The current complaints of stakeholders (including the GTS Novean Society) show that in all negotiations with operators there are many similar preventions.
Charging the responsibilities in the μTU is a quite common truck in the field of telecommunications where the UOHS is washing hands in all this matter.
We found him already in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, there was a new amendment to the Telecommunications Act for the extension of the Competition Competition law in the field of trade licenses that did not be effected, even when a series of specialists promised that the situation would be improved.
This should perfectly know the representatives of UOHS, but it is clear that their interests are in the other part.
It's okay when nobody looks
At the same time, weakly still working something as a pseudovirtual operator that has been in the cheque mobile telephone networks already exists some.
They are undertakings that make their own prices to mobile phone services that, however, only one part are public.
It usually is companies dedicated to the multi-nevel marketing.
Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others offer their own mobile phone services.
Normally, only some selected are the list of prices of these companies.
Magie is that the company, with regard to the operator, acts as a business client class of the same by charge of a large number of SIM cards.
As a special customer, you will receive after special prices and other offers.
The problem is that trade conditions in all mobile mobile phone operators protect that type of return.
"If cases are discovered like those cited could be spoken of infraction in the conditions of contract that could be translated at the end of cooperation with the given society," answered the question on this problem Martina Kemrová.
But it's pretty uncertain that an activity of this type carried out by mobile phone operators will not come to people responsible.
Exactly in the case of the three quoted enterprises, it can be a thousands of customers.
No one of the operators is against this procedure.
With the activities of these enterprises, there are nothing unprecitable gains and, at the same time, - a distinction of real virtual operators - in no way threatens their own official marketing.
Miroslav íepický warns us about the possible problems: "The law allows a speculation of this type, however, the services of this company are used only by a declined by a hundred of customers.
Moreover, these must accept that the SIM card of your phone is not on its name, so they can not be absolutely available from him as a normal client of the operators."
That's exactly what should look like the minimumly strange.
There is also a new question for UOHS.
If it is that mobile phone operators turn the eyes in this type of procedure, why can they block the entry of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that the UOHS has sufficient competence to discover this kind of activities and if it is not to want to do not have the explicit explanations of the operators that they have neither idea of this story and that their commercial conditions are not allowed.
When will we leave the sweetest ones
As it was already clear in the text, the entry of the virtual operator on the mobile phone market brought a significant decline on services prices.
At the same time, practically in all countries where the virtual operator was surrounded, classic operators tried to protect more or less of this abruption.
The arguments used by these were practically all the identical - too small, a market, eventually too saturated, problems with quality of service, etc.
Nevertheless, in the most advanced countries, regulatory bodies have intervened at these times and in no case they have defended operators but their customers.
It was already with formal or informal pressure to achieve the first virtual operator and with it began to rise further.
Unfortunately, the Rules Authority all this case happens like if it is a burning slaughter.
For our experience we can't let us impress that the confusion of the allocations in these cases will condemn them.
But we won't desire.
If this information is correct and virtual operator is actually reached to these lands, then the Czech phone market probably starts to move again.
If any of the operators leaves to enter any virtual mobile phone operator will be difficult that UOHS may remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other interested persons.
And we may let us call more sweet than the rest of Europe.
The new Checo wine has four new versions.
Select the best
Listen to the four presentations of the new version of the Czech official.
On Sunday, first Minister Mirek Topolanek at the time of the Checa official celebrations presented the new official recording of the vine where my house was home.
The new wine grew it the orquest of the National Teatro under the direction of Jihai B月lohlavek.
There are four versions - two versions that are Solos, one to male voice and one to female voice, another with Coro and another instrumental.
The song is charged by Kateינה Kn月ínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the Hein's ordinances are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz server you can listen to the four versions.
Bålohlavek considers this national cheque song as one of the most beautiful heavy.
The Checa Radio has already said before she had intentionally chosen for the Slopes with representatively young voices who are more expressive and popular.
"Take the principle I tried with the two and then, with the Core that would be set in the word so that the text might be well understood, so that it might be consistent," he commented.
The Czech official leon celebrates the next year on 175 anniversary.
The song where my Hogar sounded first in the 1834 tables of the Theater of States in the original Fidlovačka Checa of Josef Etetán Tyl and corrected with the music of František ≤kroup.
He winned popularity and people did it.
The first step of the song after the surrounding of Checoslovaquia in 1918 was naturally converted in a part of the official hean.
One of the seven official symbols remained even after the surrounding of the independent Republic of Czech.
How the "new" wine sounds
The MHD of Prague brings us the middle for the first time with the chip
On Wednesday, 1 October 2008, it is written in the Prague Transport Employer's history the date when the first passengers enter into the meter, the transcript and the bus with an e-mail bus in its bottles instead of a paper ticket.
This may be acquired at these moments for almost 100 thousand people who have the Chip Opencard card.
Passengers can buy the good of 30 days, 90 days and the annual (this will be valid from 1 January 2009) and simultaneously load it in your chip card in the info centers and places of the transport company in the stations of the Metro, Muzeum, Mãstek, Ndraí Holešovice, Andrizl, Roztyly, Letzany, Kobylisy, Rajská Zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
Goods can already be bought since yesterday on the transport sites, www.dpp.cz.
The service, until the late, was used by more than four hundred people.
Those starting to use the internet as a trade form, can finally begin to forget the bills sell posts in the metro stations, where until now they had to make chocolate to get off a normal bill.
The good is buying on the Internet, and the Opencard card reloads you in some of the Municipal Library three daughters.
"In these places, there are a sale of the passengers with prepared staff that helps interested with the buyer by the Internet and also with the recharge of the good purchased in your card," said the project card, Martin Opatrný.
Besides the library, it will also be possible to download your email bonus on Opencard in the automatic expensive machines that are found in some metros.
How are these expensive machines?
They're red, remembering us to a cart machine and travelers probably have already been set in them in Roztyly metro stations, Budиюjovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Now there is five in the city, but at the end of the year it would have to have earned," made Opatrý.
Good is controlled by the machine instead of the driver
The use of the machine, which will start working tomorrow, is simple.
It's easy to introduce the Chip Opencard card and the previously paid good will be loaded only in it.
E-mails since tomorrow are valid not only in the capital, but also in their surroundings.
It is, in the circulation trains and bus lines from the numbers 300 to 499 that are mainly using the inhabitants of Central Bohemia.
"In the trains admitted to the integrated transport of Prague there are reviews with a reader card that will help confirm the validity of time and good area," also explained the control of the bills, Philp Dápal of the Ropid Organization, which sets for the collective transport hours of Prague.
Circumification buses have their ready cards mounted on the driver's box.
When entering is necessary not only show the card to the conductor but also needs to be closed with the Opencard in the place intended for it on the side of the Caja.
With this, the conductor controls the validity of the good.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of goods there is nothing easier than asking the conductor this information," Drápal completed.
Passengers that don't travel in circulation buses and do not remember when the good is completed can be directed to the expert machines where the cards are uploaded.
Here, on the machine screen, you will have information on the validity of your document.
Southern people wanted to form part of the United States in a referendum
The German Southern requested Fumba as part of the United States in 1945.
This is what is excluded from the letter that is saved in the collection of the scientific Library of South Bohemia.
If we can't be a part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the United States sponsory.
In 1945, some South German groups were designed to the President of the United States in 1945.
Results of the letters that are stored in a particular file and today are stored in the South Cientic Library Collection.
The Germans of Krumlov request in a letter to the American President that does not allow the revolution of the "Terra †umva" - occupied by Hitler on the Munich Pact again to Checoslovakia.
"We correctly understood the situation and we really want your word that the American units are coming to the German lands not as oppressors or enemies, but as deliverers" are written in the letter, signed with a "the people who brings the destination of OUumva in their heart."
Considering that the union of Checoslovakia with the southern Germans is presumably suggested - according to these, the country of Checo - a hope only in brutality, disconsideration, pressure and slave, the authors call in the letter to the American President who is today and to always under a protector.
"We can't believe that without considering the opinion of four million inhabitants, it gives us to a foreign state that opens and rejects minorities and that in absolute collaboration with the victory of the fellowships," is written in the letter.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is presumably fearfully to reppresidentals of the "checkopers".
If the President of the U.S. is presumably concerned about this idea of the German Germans, it would suffice to organize a referendum on whether their inhabitants want to form part of the U.S. or to live under its patron.
Although the text of the letter, with the knowledge that we have actually of the poker history, we can sound a little child, according to some specialists attractively paint the expectations of the Germans in the south of then.
Although the Czech Germans had to consider at least that it was to handle the expulsion of the republic only some few admitted this possibility.
Some hoped that the United States and Britain negotiate for Southern States some clear form of autonomy.
Others believed they will stay in Checoslovakia.
It confirms even the austriaco Gustav Calupa periodist, born in ◆eské Bud月jovice.
This was in the war, as German of Budquamjovice, enrounded in the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war, the Britishs took him and led him in the Holstein prisoner camp of ten German prisoners came to him to teach them cheque.
"They believed that when they returned home, the hair would come well," said Kalupa.
None of the German prisoners who lived before the war in Checoslovaquia, according to him reported that on the basis of Benes Decrees would be departed from the Republic.
You don't think - Paw!
Emotional campaign attacks leaders
The biggest action in the Czech history directed to security on the roads.
The Campagne's emotional event that decided to launch the Middle of Transport in the Middle Agency.
The Office of the Minister, Aleš ◆ebízeek promises that he will deliver the dangerous conductors to the flight.
The campaign of 150 million will feel in television, radio, film, Internet and follets.
It should be necessary to dissuase the leader of high speed and alcohol to volcano.
And to remember them that before you get out, the citrons have stopped.
It wants to reach awareness in all the young conductors, motorists, peaks and lastly also of professional leaders.
What's what we can see in the newspapers?
Basically human stories that affect emotions.
And this is why we testify the announcements "sanguins" during the whole campaign:
You don't think - Paw!
The word "Don't think" is written with large letters in the matricule.
And in a ring of blood is the word "pagas".
This must symbolize that man at a moment of disappearance can get to pay with his own life.
The advertisements from "meased meter" to the spectators until 2010.
The Ministry has remained inspired by the campaign carried out in English lands where the images of strong victims of accidents could be observed.
Promis that in this way it will reduce accidents and the number of dead in the cheque paths.
The advertisements have been developed by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Use and layout for conductors
" For conductors, the system of sugar and lacture is equal to the system.
Using is for him when, for example, a red seed is passed and so time.
The layout is a threat of many or accidents.
The leaders must recall their risks," said the hospital psychology of Na Homolce, Martin Koćán.
And this is why a newspaper campaign needs and mainly a negative publicity, particularly the psychologist.
Effective men, for him, are the panels that advise the conductor of dangers.
"If there are any installed panel to warn any danger probably will soon be combined with the environment, and the conductor will not give any more attention," he warned Kozan.
Olmert would become almost all areas occupied to change peace.
The Chairman of the Provisional Government of Israel, Ehud Olmert, has announced on the refund of practically all the land occupied in 1967, i.e., Cisjordania, East Jerusalem and the Highs of Golan, to change peace with Palestine and Syria.
I suggested that the moon appeared in the Yedioth Ahronoth daily.
"We should reach agreement with the Palestinians, which means we need to restore almost all the lands (employed) if not all," said Olmert to the daily.
"I am sure we will stay with a hundred of these lands, but the Palestinians will have to cease them a hundred like (of the lands of Israel) because it will not be peace," added.
He admitted that this would also include Jerusalem in the case of restoration.
"Whoever he wants to secure in Jerusalem, and therefore he doesn't want the tractors or excavators to go over their feet as one of my best friends has passed, then you'll have to deliver a part of Jerusalem," Olmert pointed on the two attacks in July in which there were several dead and tens of people were slain.
According to the President, there will be a special solution for the Temple, a holy and historical place which is located within the old city.
"The one who wants to keep the Israeli sovereignty throughout the city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work," he insisted further.
Related from the Highs of the Golan
Olmert was also pronounced by the retirement of Israel from the Highs of Golan, what from his view is an inherent condition to close a peace agreement with Syria.
But this would also suggest concrete efforts by Damascus.
"I don't propose to close peace with Syria only on the basis of Golan's retirement," he warned.
"Sirish people know what they'll have to be disappointed to gain the Golan.
They must leave their current relations with Iran, they must leave their relations with Hizbula (Chile movement), must be removed from the permanent support of Hamas terrorism (chita movement), Al-Qaeda (Terrocratic Network) and Yihad (Sair War) in Iraq.
Questions after the accident: Are you illegate the shots in the bus?
The law is unknown, it cannot be walked in a long distance bus
With regard to the tragic accident of the company Student Agency close to the Italian city of Padova, we ask whether the aircraft and passengers can be moved through the bus during the trip.
"If we want to comply close and formally with the law, the work of the azaphat is opposed to the law of vital transit," said the carrier of the Department of Transport, Karel Hanzelka.
The accident in which he died last week the axe of 20 years, apparently was caused by the driver of the truck only that the bus moved on the road.
The girl was unfortunately sitting on the side of the driver on the lowest place of the vehicle, although they had other two sites.
Nevertheless, the bus can have an accident or abusively, and at the time that the sufoto repairs the coffee or the newspaper.
This is what you play the paper is if the bus is added, according to the technical permit, with footplaces.
If the bus is not homologized, the passenger must go sit.
The long distance buses of Student Agency's long distances do not have places to walk, which confirmed the company director, Radim Jančura, at Updaten月.cz.
"There we solved it with the ministry and the movement of passengers is not allowed.
Finally, it was removed and we arrived in the agreement that passengers can go to the bathroom by closing the bus if they have a seat, "we commented their position.
Azaphate does not know the law
"There is no legal interpretation of the role of the azaphat - no legal provision to analyze this role.
No legal provisions are even prohibited by transport officers to carry out any service.
The road transport law only knows the terms of the Vehicle Review, whose rights and obligations are not defined," adds, at least later, the Hanzelka portfolio.
The Director of the Department of Vehicles by the Ministry of Transport, Josef Pokorný, thinks that the law is sufficiently involved in this problem.
"Depending on whether the bus has the authorisation allowed to have foot sites.
That's all," he said.
The buses are divided between the urban, where there are places to be stage and maximum speed, interrupted with sites to stay with a higher speed permit and long distances without feet, with the highest speed permit and with security seats.
As in the airport, the expert says
BESIP's security expert in the transport, Jaroslav Hoíín, does not see important problems with regard to the movement of sugar in the bus.
"In the course of the development of the trip there is no much dangerous situation, the situation may be compared to the service in the airports.
It is not even safe that the turbulences are arrived and that azaphate can be struck on the head."
"If the autobus is so clearly invalid, physical laws.
Likewise in a city bus or in the transcript.
The security of the azaphate must solve it in the internal regulation of the transporter, and also believes that this problem is without solving.
Jančura is ready to announce this service
Student Agenty is the only transporter that offers azaphates service.
He's working on him for two hundreds.
The director, or after the accident, considers this arrayed work.
"Again, at the time you have the impression that the position of azaphate is arrayed, then I will surprise it.
Café and journals can receive it, passengers, when entering.
He said, "which would also be expenditures."
In security interest is the reason why Asian lacks acephates in its vehicles, according to Alexej Litvin, which leads a small line in comparison with SA.
"We don't have aggression, we're against them since the beginning.
Before or later, this will end in a mortal accident," said less than one year ago for Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy occurred
In the case of the line a Napoles died a young acephate of Pilsen who had been working for the company two years.
A slovene train that probably turned from the station car by blocking the step to the bus. without using the intermittenants.
His conductor tried to a rapid manager to avoid it, however, shot the right side before.
Jančura refuses to have been sold the two sites reserved for the rescue of the azaphate.
"This site is not possible to reserve them for long distance connections, they are blocked."
The company has an intention to ask the train driver.
The Agency will not wait for the verification of the judgment on the compensation of the girl's family, but is awaiting financial expenditure also by the fault.
Reform of law?
No, for now.
The reform of the law could lead to a greater preciseness on the movement of abus in which a year ago thirty experts work for a group of the Ministry of Transport.
"Again, they have not reached any concrete conclusion.
They are not too dedicated to buses, but rather to the pointing system, the maximum speed in autopista and the use of the mobile during the journey", says expert Hoaín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activities of the acaciates that leads importantly to the security of passengers," concluded the Hanzelka carrier, that security control in the bus is the police and the Security Office.
Dusseldorf's hope is supported in Francfort
In the letter of the Guideline of the West LB Bank for its partners, there are no large words.
For the fusion of Dusseldorf bank units, the DEKA bank can be formed a 'the central market of capitals of the financial group of Sparkasen', as said the writer, which is published in the Monday
The West LB bank, breaking the 'competence' bloom with sustainable benefits' capacity would enter into such business.
Furthermore, such a fusion can be a beginning for the following fusions in the regional banking field.
This is how to understand the text when a directive meeting wants to show the ability to act in hard times.
Because the West LB is under a huge pressure.
Not only from the part of the European Union, but also from the Federal Monitoring Institute, which has made a little clear to the Government of Northern Westernland, which remains a little time for finding a solution.
Since a time, too from Francfort's side, it's a lot talking about the so-called unit between the DEKA bank, that Sparkasse customers know about their investment funds, and West LB.
In fact, Franz Waas, head of the DEKA bank, presenting data after an average year end of August, left to know that there was no sense in the bank fuel, situated on the Mainzer Street, with a regional bank, such as Helaba or West LB.
However, the Democracy Board of the DEKA, which is now composed of the regional banks and the Sparkassen Associations, urged the Guideline to begin negotiations with the West LB on the common trade activities.
This could be a business on the capital market or parts of it.
Of course, negotiations have been started, so it is said on the financial site.
It is not the first time that it is a consolidation in the Sparkassen field is the name of the DEKA bank that with its 3000 partners are between the most important business officers on the Francfort financial site.
In 2003, the situation seemed so that the DEKA bank could be with the regional bank of Renania-Palatinado and the Helaba.
This initiative to establish a unit of three parties remained without result.
Nevertheless the plans were made public, the Hesse Government was expressed against the participation of Helaba in this project.
The other two banks also found the same language.
Instead of this, the regional bank of Renania-Palatinado started the dialogue with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank.
But it was always played again with the DNA fusion idea with other regional banks.
But lastly, the President of the Helaba Governance Council, Günther Merl, expressed that he was against the plans of coherence with his bank.
Independent of this, it seems to be more clear that the unit of the different banks in the public law sector is necessary.
Well, when you're going to pass the elections of the Baviera parliament, the BayernLB unit with the Baden-Württemberg regional bank could make progress.
For the Helaba, this is not necessarily a good news.
If pressure continues smoking will increase, Helaba will lack the partners to achieve this.
In the south bank, only a young partner could be, even though it has been much better than the financial crisis that made it Stuttgart and Munich's immunities.
On the other hand, the Sparkassen - and Giroverband of Hesse-Torgia, which has 85 percent of the Helaba, at the beginning of the year, avoided coherence plans with West LB.
In any case, the North LB is only.
But such geostrategic reflections are only a part.
In addition, it is the compatibility of the various bank models.
In June Merl made a basic question on a commercial model that could ensure the future for regional banks, and the German Spanish and Giro-Verband had no answer until now.
Finally, you can decompose West LB, but this is naturally not the own desire of the bank.
So, in the letter of the Bank directive, it is said that it would be tried to find a full solution for all the bank.
As you can combine the coexistence between different bank parties with DEKA, this will show time.
The second end of Octoberfest is known as "the end of the week of the Italians"
For Elena is the first time, for Luca, the third or fourth.
But this time, Elena's attained to him as his friend, and so everything seems different, says he.
After them, at the side of a 5 litres of brand brass Kaiser is built a huge pump that shows nearly 200 participants of Octoberfest that lower sounds are known to produce in their garage.
The first Elena gives Luca a palmette, then a bottle.
From Bolonia they came to Verona.
From there, from the side of the Porta New train station, this night at 23:45 out three buses, 'Administration Munich, the festival of the brass', previsiblely reached at 6:30 of the morning.
Three buses are mainly planned for Italians, one bus is only for brass.
In one of the squares of the scenes on the side of their band they sing the sud Americans, they already began to celebrate night.
With very sound, says Marco watch, what is nothing for the Italians.
In Marco, which brings a long bus with a artificial hair and skins with silver paints, includes these buses.
Since five years they come to October, taking into account that there are only three excursions this year.
From night on the way there, during the day in the dinner, at 22:30 back.
Pasing the night there means only the unnecessary expenditure, says Marco.
The travel rate is 75 euros, including the welcome receipt of a gap Kaiser, which was made in accordance with the law of the cleanness of the Baviera, the safety of disease and guide in German-Marco assisted a language course in Francfort.
Out of night the bus are already on the way in the autopista with the "Brennero" address
There's no brain, not yet.
Quietly the king's quiet in the bus, travellers are sleeping.
All right, they'll still need the forces.
It is for Brixen and Holzkirchen, where other bus with Italian matricule makes another stop in the 8-minute car before Munich.
To the end, when the Marco Group has the arrival planned at the 6st 30 modrugate in the clothing side of the Prade of Teresa, there are already about 50 other buses of all Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others meet, Marco has their last talk about how to go.
First, put you a fucking gorge.
There, from the left side it is written "Octberfest", on the side in the logic letter is the page of the Marco travel office on the Internet: "concertante.it".
Second: "When the doors of the campaign are opened, that means "marry!", crying Marco in the madruged.
"Mark!" Marge and busy the back sites in the camping tent.
"Don't take the places in front, for we're going to block, and you'll not sit in the same bathroom, divided throughout the space!"
A brain litro, rude Marco, costs 8.25 euros.
Don't forget propina
Show the security people that we have a good tonne!
He's just going out of his place, he's already busy!"
Third, "Is this after the ten and half you will have to come here?" Did you understand?
And now everyone goes to October.
One, to mark the road, at the trees, traffic signs and even in a card of the elections of a great Popular Party of Baviera.
You want to recognize the road behind.
It's the second end of Octoberfest that is known as "the end of the week of the Italians"
There are no precise data on the number of people; it is 50,000 people who travel over Alpes and tormentally enter into campaign tents, 10 percent of all came particularly this week end of Italy.
The Munich police receives aid from seven policemen from the autonomous province of Bolzano, Italian voluntariors help the Royal Cruz de Baviera, which makes statistics of the present nations, where Italians, with more than 200 medical assistance, before English (for 60 assistance) and Austrians, are the first place.
The favorite team of the Italian campaign is called Hofbräuzelt.
Sleeping nights for creditors of the Real Estate
Germany’s banking system is relatively stabil, only the Federal Minister of Finance Peter Steinbrück has focused on the past week.
Well, that politics will use the word "relatively" and added that the German banking sector will also be affected by critical trends.
And this happened after the end of the week.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE), Munich's immune finance, which is contained in the DAX index, receives a consolidation of the German banks awards of thousands of millions in order to resolve turbulences on the market.
On Monday, a person who very well knows the situation said Reuters: credit aid was up to 35 million euros.
The part of the capital hypo Real Estate will need to throw interests.
The money is as from private banks also from public law.
The cause of this is the loss of the Depfa filial.
According to a report, the State funding for long-term projects funded them only a short period, and now, because of the disappearance in the markets, it is not possible.
In the first half of the year, the capital reserve of the bank has falled in 95 percent, 2.37 million euros, and the share of the own capital has also paid some 1,6 percent to 1.45 percent.
In comparison with the same period of the past year, the continuing income of financial investments and net benefits of financial transactions were caught to the cereals, tax income for debts and some value titles also were lower than EUR 5 million.
Only thanks to the high and many income reimbursements of the ex-group restructuring expenditure expenditure and the reimbursement of interests according to the federal tax code and the business organized for consumer enterprises, the negative salary could approximately approximately 16 percent.
After privatization in 1990, the former State finance at the principle was lost in specifications with industrial credits for immunities, which served by reason for the funding of the Air Bank.
As much money could not be gained with the financing of the State projects, the Defence began to dedicate intensely the projects in the infrastructure and financing of Community projects by private investors and as well as states (Private-Public-Partnership PPP) and has been differentiated.
The Hypo Real Estate now needs to make amortization on the value of the filial that has an "excellent material effect" on the consolidated account of losses and gains of the group, is very imprecisible.
It's a fact that they canceled the divisions.
Since 2007, they were canceled to two thirds.
After the acquisition of the Depfa, the Hypo Real Estate has become a significant State and financial financial in the field of infrastructure.
As the bank does not possess customer depositories, in comparison with other banks, it is more dependent on the refinance of the inter-bancing market.
With the white of the United States Investment Bank Lehman Brothers, what has happened two weeks ago, the concessing of inter-bancary credits was essentially because the banks were caught their liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate Hypo requires almost 50 million euros to finance a part of credit cards from the Debt of its short-term refinance measures.
According to the report of Hypo Real Estate, the bank covers the need for the financing of the group for a short time and the company is secured by "the impact of international monetary markets which are essentially not intended to function"
Other sources say that this money is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
Georg Funke, President of the Guidance Council of the Hypo Real Estate, explained that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not require monetary markets for the pre-visable time.
The German Central Bank and the Federal Monitoring Institute (BaFin) are based on the fact that the competitivity of the Hypo Real Estate Group has been secured since now.
This must have to wait for the accionists and creditors of the bank.
But because of the dynamic and imbalance of the crisis, there is no constance.
Even it is imaginable that you should not need funding in its full volume.
But the other case cannot be excluded.
The voice was that in last Sunday the bank was still found almost insolvency, so temporary salvation could not be quiet by at least concerned people.
The action price was 75 percent, 3.30 euros.
In contrast, the courses of deprived are really good.
While priority debts are almost unchanged, the courses of the imposed under the position in the proper registration are clearly lower.
Overall the prerequisite of the former Württemberg Hypo filial Württemberg and the emprisonment of which results are based on 2009.
Following the notable growth of the banking crisis and the acquisition of the Depfa which affected the Real Estate Hypo, the current value of its imprisonment that before have been an investment for speculation should be considered as a dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
While the emisor banks, governments and banks who are little affected are still ready to support the system, as soon as you can depart from the amortization of pensions within a period of time.
Or it's going to happen something, what will not be able to imagine nobody. The financial crisis will be over the next 15 months.
But when seeing the crossed news on partial stability, now the security that is already on its border has become a fair hope.
This will be a reason, because creditors will pass nights without sleep, breaking the head on the decision on their enthusiasm island.
Still short-term investors can put the final point and use the new transport account of the losses for next payment of tax compensation of benefits in the future.
Sylvana and the Bent Secrets?-Box
When the first day Sylvana Hiltrop, girl of 16 years, had to be present at Taiwan's High School, the girls began to laugh: 'The German is totally "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows the word of Mangas - in a report on exchanges, she knows Japan.
"The first day in a college in Japan.
I felt nerved.
Before I went to the college, he was afraid.
I live at Tokio's boat in the Kawasaki address and I'm in a train of 40 minutes to High Tachibana.
Once I had to find the way, lucky I didn't lost.
It seems that the start of classs will not be fixed so strictly as in my house, in Baja Sajonia.
From eight tomorrow the students come, at least ninty-thirds start a small meeting with teachers, the 'Home room'.
Before he started the class, I touched me to present me.
Moreover, I'm not a person who speaks with very pleasure in the public, especially before a class of 40 students.
As they still have the former school, I put an old fall of my family anfitrion, and also a blue, blue, black calcelines and black hairs.
Well, so I put me on the pilgrim and tried to proclaim everything correctly: "Sayonara Wo She Sylvana..." - I call Sylvana, I'm in Germany and in a week will be my birthday.
At this time, I was very happy because two years ago I had started studying this language.
All 31 girls in the class have kicked, laughed and made wonderful and all the time I heard the word "kawaii"
I already knew her of my Mangas.
This belongs to the survival vocabulary of Japanese girls and means "mona, linda"
Then I was soon kissed out of my place.
The girl on the side had a great dream, for her was a honour that the girl of exchange had to sit on her side.
The rest of the class was quiet enough, but when he sounded the gong, I felt really smooth.
Everybody talked at the time, weeping and making many questions, at the same time it is very difficult to understand English of Japanese.
Afterwards, all took their Bentos.
My anfitrion family also made a Lanchbox for my - it's something other than the German pieces of bread.
I had a wheat with herbs, small shots, pigs and algas, fruit and something like meat in tofu mass.
Most cases I don't have any idea of what this is here in Japan.
Things are rare and have a new sabo.
What's sure is that everything is very rich.
Well, maybe with the exception of married circles in the salt, bufff!
In Japanese schools, the towns are not just a dinner.
Sometimes it passs that a girl prepares a very artistic blessing for a boy and gives it in hope to know it better during a recreation.
That's what I read on my Manga-Comics.
I have a lot of interest to see if I can see it here too.
"Why exactly Japan?", they asked my friends when I told them I wanted to go to Tokyo to attend school a year.
Then he always answered:
"Well, because I'm exciting."
Finally, for years, I was pregnant to read Mangas.
To better understand the comics and culture, one day I started studying a few Japanese.
For me it was absolutely sure I'll travel there one day.
Meanwhile because I have a flower for tradition and coasts.
Here they have a great value.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technologies and trends, on the other, a serious, discipline and traditional country.
As all is well organized, I didn't feel lost here, though Tokyo is the largest city I ever saw in my life."
Rates also have feelings
It is said that a race or a kitchen feeling the danger is hurry, why did he also fear?
Joseph Le Doux, scientist in the neurology field is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
How can they be controlled if they, taking in a similar way to us, feel the same?
In a web magazine called "Edge" for many years, the contributions of known scientists are published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents in a series of responses to the question What do you think that is true without able to prove it?
I think the animals have feelings and other states of conscience without me or someone else could prove it until now, though we can not even prove that others have awareness.
But in this case, at least we can wait for it because all human cereals represent the same fundamental configuration.
But soon as we give us other species and include questions about sensation and generally about conscience, we enter into the unknown area because hardware does not match.
When a race is found in danger, it does the same as the other animals: it is dead, hurt or attacks.
People are in a similar way, as some scientists make conclusions on comparable subjective experience.
Of course, I don't believe it.
Two aspects of the cerebral structure make it difficult to contain our subjective experience to animals.
First, they are almost always included circuits associated with the human conscience of the front-border pre-frontal lobby of the cerebral corte (to cause their participation in short memory and the executive functions that lead).
This wide part is much more developed in the case of persons than other princes and seems absolutely absence in other creatures.
Taking into account at least the aspects of our conscience depending on the pre-frontal lobby of the cerebral court, among them knowledge of whom we are and the ability to plan and decide, there is a reason to suggest that the man is even different from the other principles.
Another speciality is found in man's language nature: As most of his experience is associated with the language, often means that conscience depends on it.
In this case, animals can be excluded.
But even when awareness would not depend on the language, it would influence it so that the conscience of the animals, created as a result, would be different from most of our conscience states.
That is why it is difficult to explain how the conscience of other animals works.
If this, as an interesting and subjective thing, will not be able to meditize because it has special hardware, nor will be analyzed through our experiences, so your research presents us great problems.
Most of my interventions refer to the content of the agreed experience, but at the same time there is also another aspect of conscience that should be easier for scientific research.
It could be investigated without taking into account their contents, and that is what happens during short-term memory studies, especially in the example of visualization.
But with this approach followed Christf Koch and Francis Crick, the most important thing happens to the neutral relationships of the conscience than the caused mechanisms: both may be similar or not.
This approach clearly emphasizes the importance of the pre-frontal lobby of the cerebral corteness for visualization training.
And what's about that for feelings?
I must have the fact that in the emotional system a part of the brain which is responsible for this, as it happens in fear.
What we describe as fear is, therefore, a mental state in which we are when the brain activity occupies a space of the defence system (or its consequences, for example, the reactions of the body).
In view of this point of view, the senses are very fixed by the cerebral court which distinguishes to princes and especially man.
In view of the linguistic nature, there are still classifications of the end sensation because we can distinguish and classify states with the support of the words and the graphics to be able to describe the states of others by us.
For example, Antonio Damascus thinks that the senses result from the simple activities of the parts of the cerebral corteness responsible for corporal feelings and the encephal tronk, the same thing thinks Jaak Pankseep, but is more focused on the incephale troom.
As this network has not changed much during human evolution, it can be absolutely refer to different types and feelings.
For the theoretical reasons I can't go against this, but I think it is not likely.
Pakseep argues that what rates and men feel as fear, perhaps it is seen in two cases like this: But how can you be checked if rates and men conducting the same way?
Seeing the danger a kitchen runs away, don't it be because he's scared?
I am thinking that the measurement of the behaviour is still not testing the seed of experience.
This is true that the comparison of Neuronal assistance: rates and men have similar rings, the cucarachs at the contrary do not have at least a brain.
Is this the thunder of the inceal who is responsible for feelings?
Even when it is possible for men: How can it be tried in rates?
I think that rates and other mammiferous, probably also cucarachs (Who knows?), have feelings.
But I don't know how to prove it.
I prefer to investigate the emotional behaviour of rates that emotional senses because their feelings are soon different from us (for human conscience relates to special circuits and language).
In any case, progress in the neurology area is expected as men's same ratios and men are undertaken.
As I don't invest tongue and rates conscience, as well as feelings, I don't know if they exist.
It can be said that I don't see any more beyond my neighbors, but I would like to advance that continuing work without results.
Well, I'm practical emotional.
The President of the UEFA Platin: Grace time for Polonia and Ukraine
Iwan Wasjunik, the Supple Minister, said that the preparations would soon be done under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
"The Government considers the decision of UEFA in Bordeaux as the evidence of confidence of the capacity of Ukraine to organize Europe campaign together with Poland," said Wasjunik.
"But this is not an amnesty for our country.
Now the work is about starting and in the two countries there are much to do."

The contrary of Dennis Quaid is not unprofitable.
She wanted to promote a new movie, speaking in an interview about private life- and has problems with her former marriage: the star of Hollywood Meg Ryan designed his former marriage as an adversary.
It's grieved and contrary.
The storming war of the two roses in the former Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: eight years after their divorce, the two actors of Hollywood show publicly a disagradable piece between them.
The week past in an interview with the United States magazine InStyle Meg Ryan pronounced first about the reasons of the marriage phrase: "Dennis was a long time infidel to me, and that was very painful."
She recognised the size of her unbelief only after divorce.
The reason for the revelation of private things was Ryan's work with the press for his new "The Women" film - a story of a marriage fracase.
The reaction of Dennis Quaid to the design of him as an unfaithful husband was clear: "It's not heard that Meg many times takes into account the history of our relationship in another version," said the man from 54 years of New York Daily News.
Among other things is very "lamentable" that Jack, his 16-year son, again "a newly remember the pain and changes, all that means divorce for a child."
While Ryan lives alone after divorce, Quaid is again married and a little time ago is a gemeles dad.
And so it ended with his statements putting on resurrection, "It will be as my life continues.
I'm glad because I have a wonderful family that's good."

In Germany, price change was more notable than in other European countries:
From January to February prices increased to 11.9, in the second half, lowered to 23.6 percent.
According to a study, the prices for national flights in Germany also reduced half.
The cause of the change of prices is of one part the increase in the flow economy, the company explains.
In many parts of the travel market with the airport the demand is lower.
On the other hand, the Open-Skies Treaty is a great competence with the liberalization of air traffic between the United States and Europe.
The tensa situation’s sign is the analization of non-profit flights in airlines, as well as a large number of airlines that declared in the first half of 2008 – only in Europe were 24 airlines.
HSV win against Gladbach 1:0

Dark material affects space sound trajector
Since many years a mysterious phenomenon causes the desconsciousness of researchers: Oscura Matheria influences the speed of space sounds during this caused severe assistance to manobra.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein's relativity theory cannot be so correct.
The Ulysses space sonde has been almost 18 years flying into the universe.
Because fuel tuberries are moving now threatening him a death in the fred.
Since years, a mysterious philosomy, annomalization during the severe assistance to manobra, causes disagreement between researchers.
The gravitative assistance is a manager of the space sounds trace while they get a acceleration using the energy of a planet, for example, the Earth.
This allows space sounds to pursue fuel.
Cassini-Huygens, the European-American space sond used this physical truck as well as the sun of Ulysse.
But what he surprises investigators for many years: myiles are not contained by 100 percent as it is expected in the virtual law of gravity.
More frequently irregularities of speed.
The sounds are more or less speed.
Physicians couldn't explain this effect until now.
They called him anonymy during the gravitative assistance to the maniobra.
Some experts fear that perhaps even the general Theory of the Relationship of Albert Einstein, which describes the attraction force of the material for the currency of the space cannot be so correct.
Stephen Adler, the American physic of the Institute for Advanced Study of Princeton believes now once Einstein did not confusion and try to explain anonymymy during gravitative assistance with the named Oscura Matheria, which remained the astronomies in the universe.
"The reason of anonymy may be the Oscure Matheria that can also be very close to the Earth," he writes.
The universe researchers know the existence of the Oscura Matheria only for ten years.
It is soon posed by the attraction force and its influence can be observed on other plans.
On the contrary, Oscura Matheria is completely invisible what means not sending and does not reflect any electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, the Oscura Master does at least one fifth of the total mass of the universe.
The tourists ensuring in Egypt are free
As the Minister of Foreign Affairs in Italy confirmed, after ten days in the hands of surveys, the tourists in Egypt must be free.
The surveys of the Sudan had requested millions of rescue.
Six surveys must be killed in a tirote during release.
The five Germans are secured in the south of Egypt.
Debates on rescue have already started.
Germans continue to fall again on the point of attention of the surveys.
The WELT ONLINE period tells the most important cases.
Thus, seeing the European tourists in Sahara are free.
The same information provides the State Egyptian television, the emisor of the Arabian TV Al-Arabia and the Italian media.
After the release news to the Italian Sky TG 24 Franco Frattini, the Italian Minister of External Affairs confirmed liberation: "Our concident and other reactions are free.
'Now we control your health status,' said Frattini.
Five German, five Italians and a Roman as well as their eight Egyptian partners are well and are in security, inform the State Egyptian television.
The 19 participants in the wilderness are on the way to Cairo.
What remains incomprehensible is the reasons of a tiroteo before the release of the residues: According to the descriptions of a Egyptian security garder, the surveys were ready to end the survey, but the Sudan’s army of sudden had killed six surveys.
"The problem was solved.
They agreed with the rescue," the guard said.
It was just trying to "reciper the rehenses" when it suddenly came "It was surprised."
On Sunday, the Sudan soldiers killed six settlers and two of them have stopped in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The surveys requested the rescue of the amount of six million euros; the money had to be delivered from the German wife of one of the rehenses.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom", referring to a German mediator, reported that liberation was stopped because the surveys were afraid of their security.
According to the report, the surveys intend to release female remissions after receipt the rescue.
The men had to stay stop until the surveys had a secure road to escape.
Germany's posting in Cairo refused to take the position on this report.
Pattern abuse "laught the suicide"
According to the court, the years of abuse for her father brought a woman to kill himself.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old from Stethians in Cornwall, has been condemned to five years of prison after admitting eight independent offices.
The Real Court of Truro recognized that he had regularly attacked his daughter Stephanie Randle when the girl had five to seven years.
Trerise wrote in a confession role: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court recognized that Mrs. Randle had been killed in Mutley's house in Plymouth on 1 April 2007 at 34 years.
At the time when the girl lived in Coventry, Trerise was driving her up and selling her eyes before carrying her sexual acts, while his mother was working in a pub.
After divorce in 1980, Trerise returned to live in Cornwall.
Her daughter moved to Plymouth.
However, the court recognized that Mrs. Randle, who worked a large part of his time as a voluntary for the National Trust, was affected by the abuse which had been inflated him two times a week.
In 2006, the prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court what some friends of Mrs. Rande had said about her, that after being a great superfist and ciclist, it now seemed "emotionally dead," as if he had "reclared to life."
In April 2007 his true father, Terraza Randle, found a dead woman in its apartment of Plymouth.
Mrs Rande is supposed to have killed himself sofoncing through a plastic bottle.
Mr. Randle met the father of her daughter, who wrote a letter of confidence that was concluded, saying, "I would put it down and sell her eyes.
It was never a sex career.
I feel responsible for his death."
The judge Christianpher Elwen answered Trerise: "You are a very strange fetichist, and for his victim should have been a spanish experience, especially when he had only seven years.
This disgraceful saga ends with the victim taking away their own life.
And even more clear, it is that if she had not done it, the question probably would not have ended in the courts."
And he added: "I noticed the effect that, according to the description made by the father and the mother of Stephanie, the abuse was on her daughter for the years.
Of course, she would have a future promiser, success and happy."
A official loaded for data loss
The BBC was informed that a Gabinete officer who forgot some secret documents in the train in June will be accused under the Official Secrets Act.
The man, at work journey by the Ministry of Defence, left two highly classified documents on Waterloo train.
The documents were transferred to the BBC before being delivered to the police.
This is certainly the less serious charge under the law and does not submit any indication of the defence intention.
The BBC response Corporate for Defense Frank Gardner reported that the condemnation had come as a surprise for many in English administration.
"Their thoughts were an internal matter between the Ministry of Defence and the Gabinete," said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is loaded under section 8.1 of the Law, the clausule related to the safeguard of the information.
The Real Legal Service noted that the officer should be accused by the Metropolitan police because of the highly sensitive entity of its work in the Committee of Secret Services.

The officer was informed on the morning's decision and then moved from his house to a secret place.
Building companies affect the price of B–B
In Great Britain, construction societys could face a price of more than 80 000 sterline books after the rescue/libration of Bradford and Bingley bank.
In fact, the Government has proposed 14 bills of sterline books to protect the depositories of 2.6 million bankers.
The interest on the loan will be paid by all companies using the money of actors, including 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of the Association of Construction Societys (BSA), Adrian Coles, considers the "huld" that society and its members should pay
Eventually, the premature of 14 bills should be refunded after Bradford and Bingley's hypothetics are redistributed.
However, the interests in the income shall be charged each year to the 700 financial enterprises who have deployed.
The Finance Service Independence Plan confirmed BBC that 59 construction companies were included in that number.
It's ridiculous that the institutions who have been conducted with awareness will be called to pay the price of the institutions who have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
This means that each company had to pay for a percentage to bank depositories, and that mediation companys had to pay approximately 18 per cent of the cost.
The Tesoro believes that the interest on the premium will be up to 450 thousand sterlinic books in 2009.
This means that societys will need to recover 81,000 sterlin books to overcome the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Commercial Association of Construction Society, declared the BBC that this situation is injust.
"It is ridiculous that the institutions who have been conducted with awareness in the growth of the real estate market are called to pay the price produced by those who were much less prudent."
According to the BSA, there are no data indicating the fracase of any society since 1945.
"We will consider all the aspects of this matter in the coming weeks to find out what options exist to protect construction societys and their members against what could be a relevant price," said Mr. Cole.
The interest in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year until March.
In 2010, it will be a complete year of required interests, which may be almost two times more.
Since mutual organizational construction societys and non-accessors, their members will end inevitably paying the price, or through higher rates or lower interests in their assemblies.
The milk price below five pence per litro

Requests the freedom under confidence to the former Minister of Bangladesh
A court of Bangladesh rejected the request for the former Minister Sheikh Hasina, in the sense that she could be brought to prison when she returns to her country.
His defenders said that the court had not granted the freedom under fitting by accusing him of extortion of $50 million ($729,700) to a businessman when he was Prime Minister.
This is one of the various cases of corruption to your charge.
His long-term political rival, Khaleda Zia, was set up freely at the beginning of this month.
The return from Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh is supposed to be in the next weeks, but his party, Awami Liga, has requested that the Government of the country, being militaryly delivered, granted the first full freedom.
The core respondents say that while it was given the conditional freedom to go to the foreign and receive some medical treatments, it is not clear now what are the terms of its release or if it is able to stay free when he returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say that they will make an appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the Supreme Court.
"The Supreme Court rejected the request of liberty under confidence for Sheikh Hasina while sustaining that liberty could not be able to obtain under confidence because he had already been treated in the foreign under conditional freedom," said his lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We're going to put an appeal proceedings against the order of the Supreme Court."
His defenders argued that she had needed the freedom under confidence to return to her country from the foreigner and to be prepared for the elections of December.
Sheikh Hasina should return to his father after 17 October, as he declared a leader of the Liga Awami last Sunday.
It was arrested the past year after the provisional government, supported by the Army, undertaken the power, but was made free in June to go to the foreign and receive a few medical treatments.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia reject all the charges they are accused.

BSkyB affects legal challenges in ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal challenge in the Commission of Competence after the decision that the company had undertaken to reduce its participation in the radiodifusion reval ITV.
BSkyB has been informed by the Court of Competence Appeals, which will have to reduce the participation of 17.9 per cent to ITV under 7.5 per cent.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB’s interests are obliging the competition and allowing their unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought its action package in 2006 in an agreement that actually blocked NTL now Virgin Media to buy ITV.
In April 2007, the Anti-Monopolis Office reported that the acquisition of participation in ITV by BSkyB was doubts about ITV independence and encouraged the Commission to open an investigation.
All, including the Chief of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumers groups and Ofcom Regular were used to buy.
BSkyB, noted that the obligation to reduce its ITV package was not reasonable and represented a unproportional medium, particularly why, said BSkyB, would have delivered its vote rights.
New Research in the avengement of Standan lawyers
The United States General Procureur has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the release of nine statistical lawyers in 2006.
The reason was a report in which the General Inspector of the Department of Justice critics the action by the officers of the administration.
The report criticised the officials of the White House, legislators and the former Productor General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was motivated by the fear that lawyers had been removed by political reasons.
The Special Procureur Nora Dannehy is investigating whether the officials who were questioned during the investigation have laid down investigators in the trial of obstaculation of justice.
"Grands of complaints of possible criminal conducts have not been completely investigated or resolved," the Procureur General Glenn Bellas states in the report.
One of the main recommendations of the report was the appointment of a special prosecutor with the power to the witnesses to leave their statements.
The debate started when nine statuted lawyers were removed from its charges by the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department motivated the decision suggesting that lawyers had been released by low performance.
But later, it was recognized that lawyers had not been evaluated worse than other colleagues, and many observers brought the conclusion that the disputes would be motivated by political reasons.
Some of the lawyers concerned had worked at the persecution of some Republics, high-profile members of the Congress, while others refused to investigate electoral fraude statements against the Democrats.
These lawyers investigate and condemnate judicial cases for the Government
and can be released at any time, but not removed by political reasons.
The successive head of the Department of Justice, the Procureur General Alberto Gonzales, under pressure for the dismissed, declared his position.
A number of other officials of the Department of Justice did the same.
The report of the Procurer-General is very critical of the role played by Mr. Gonzales in the matter, and subrayed as he had a "priority" responsibility for the dismissors, which "determined" of his leadership position and was "not fully cooperative" in the process.
Other officials, including Karl Rove, the former Bush's partner, were criticed because they had not cooperated with the research.
Meat Loaf's epic of a lot of honor
The rock Meat Loaf star will be honored in the Q Awards for your epic Bat Out Of Hell.
The song, who will collect the special premium next week in the ceremonie that will be placed in London, said that this recognition will be "a honor".
The song, which remains nine minutes and fifty seconds, constituted the title of the album with which Meat Loaf triunfed in 1977.
The Coldplay group is taking candidates for the premiums of this year and makes the classification of the four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-level of the Q magazine, said, "There are some songs that pass time and gender, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them."
The song, written by Jim Steinman, requires an excellent vocal capacity as used by Meat Loaf.
A instrumental section of almost two minutes opens the wine.
The song was first known as one in the United Kingdom in 1979 and was 15 in classification.
However, Bat Out Of Hell de Meat Loaf remained about nine years in classifications and was sold more than 40 million copies around the world.
Meat Loaf - Real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in the past years, including a chergy operation by his heart arthritism in 2003, after a colapsy during a concierto.
In 2007, an aggregate laringitis forced you to cancel some conciertes.
Afterwards, he surprised that he had a kitchen in his vocal memory.
Oscura street from the city, often forgeted and perhaps ready to sell
The city of New York contains thousands of adventures, bulbers, roads and other roads, some famous, others just service.
However, many people, including veterinary taxists and the locals of long data, are difficult to indicate the location of the Extra Place, especially because many of them have never heard talk about this street.
The small street is located in the East Village and moves to the north of the Prime Calle – before I found the Second Calle - between the Bowery and the Second Avenida.
This street, more or less than 30 feet width and 120 long, is summited to a dust of more than one active path.
No signs.
It is practically impossible to find in an atmosphere.
The street, however, has wonderful.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the company which recently has built luxury buildings in the Prime Calle
who wants to revive Extra Place and create a clean past to the tents and butics that is expected to open in the new buildings.
Other wonderful neighbors include the old date neighbors that are come to be loved by the simple carrier because it is one of the latest rests of the last block before the adaption of the buildings.
However, the Department of Vivid, Preservation and Development of the city, which has the control of the street, has no interest in possessing it.
At the meeting of the Venezuela Community Committee on the use of the land that had been placed in this month, the representatives of the Avalon Agency made a proposal to buy the street.
However, the Committee urged that the road would remain the city, requested a new plan to be submitted the next month, as said Susan Stetzer, the district manager of the Community No 3.
"The city is today properly of very few spaces and we would like to continue in possessing Extra Place," said Mrs.
"We can consider the proposals made by Avalon to solve the problem and manage space, but we also want to ensure public access to the street."
Avalon Bay had announced several months ago that I wanted to repair the small street and install a few seats, including some to be used as coffee, in the hope of renting spaces.
The idea that Avalon could buy the street went on first time during the meeting of this month
But Michele of Milly, a Avalon Bay portrait, said that, although the company wanted to use the street, he didn't necessarily want to possess it.
"The primary concern of Avalon Bay is the renew of this left street and the possibility of transforming it into a public area," he said, adding that the sale proposal comes from the same city.
Seth Donlin, a board of the Pressure Committee, confirmed that it was a desire of the city to sell the road and noted that the Agency ' s mission was the development of the proper property.
In comparison with their more color rounds, the Bowery's Bowery, Extra Place has left a hair in the history.
Some believe that he had received his name in 1802, when the large fingership of Philip Minthorne was divided between their children and that stretch land broke was not called by anybody.
The back door of the CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened in Extra Place, but the road may be better known by the photography of the establishment who comes in the cover of the Ramones album "Rock in Russia".
"The environment was magical," said Danny Fields, the Ramones Manager, who took the photograph in November 1976.
"It was full of balls, roof feet and pieces of barriers, cards, tables, balls."
Some residents, including bloggers that write on the aircraft of the East Village, have been assigned to the idea of sell Extra Place, argued that public goods, still modest that they are, must continue to be public.
Others have elected Extra Place as a rare piece, practically without change, a city race that should be protected.
Jeremias Moss, who leads a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitle, "The Book of Lamentation: A favorly Nostalgic Look at a City in the Process of Going Extinct"), took a part of a charla of the history of the city on Extra Place, published by the The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a little close and without exit road, also dark on the day and marked by the doors of oxidated iron saving and contra-ventanas, with old week periods covered by the canalons."
With few exceptions, the street appeared more or less in a recent late.
A race turned through the back of the street and stopped close to the door used to enter into the CBGB and now choosed a layer's roof teeth.
Graffiti in the walls and an empty brass bottle near 22-oz were close to a new bottle of disappeared periods.
Some passengers said they rarely put attention to Extra Place, but suggested that it could be clean.
Mr. Fields, on its part, noted that some persons underestimated the attractive power of the street in its current state.
"I've passed the best years of my life," said, "in dark places, humble and sweet places."
Discussion on the diversity: English inmerition
In this Watch Education Chapter, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the positions of the candidates on diversity education.
Lance T. Izumi, an old partner in studies on California and the director of the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is co-autor of the book "Not as good as you Think: Why the Middle Classic Needs School Choice".
Appearing effectively to Spanish voters is a difficult business.
The proposals on education made by Barack Obama are the example of this.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that "African Americans and Latin students have significantly less likely to be progressed than white students," and this is a very certain consideration.
In order to combat such differences in the events of learning, Obama's education plan specifically advocates, among other things, "individual transition education" for English schools.
However, the open question for Mr Obama is whether the comprehensive engagement of education, which prevents education in different languages in English, will be effective to analyze the distance in the final results.
For instance, we take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, an officially recognized primary school in the east region of Los Angeles.
In this school, most students are Spanish and family with lower income:
More than one third of the students, many of whom they have arrived, are learning English.
However, a 100 percent of the fourth year students has been positively evaluated in the 2008 Mathematics review.
and almost an equally appreciated 93 percent has dominated the English and art test.
This incredible success has been achieved using a different ingredient favoured by Mr Obama.
The school Sixth Street focuses on revision and practice, constant assessment of competence and does not tolerate any excusations.
Furthermore, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, in accordance with Linda Mikels, the main part of the Sex Calle, the approach of the school for English teaching to students is in the "all inmersion".
Inmersion in English means the almost exclusive use of the language in the treatment of teaching contents.
Mrs. Mikels, who opposed a variety of education, said to me, "We had extraordinary success with students as the last one who came from Mexico and that, if you go into the 12 months later, you wouldn't be able to collect what happened."
"Funciona," she stated, "nobody we think it's working."
Will Mr. Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model to replicate by other schools with large Spanish-anglate populations?
The results achieved by this school should take any doubts on the response, but the idea of the policy of their party on education (National Education Associations have been long-term defenders) and its constant support for the understanding of the dark education is the prediction of Mr. Obama's response.
Although it is that immigrants should learn English, recently Mr Obama has trivialized the question that people should be concerned about the legislation that only is written in English.
And instead of that, he said, "You must ensure that your child can speak Spanish."
If indeed Mr Obama wants to improve the system and close the lake, he should be carefully considering the forms of education that work well, more than to disappear or trivialize them.
The price of the petroleo shot brushly after the renewed economic fears
The price of the petroleum is drastically reduced because of the concern that the American reimbursement plan for financial markets can not be able to reactivate the economy.
The crude petroleum actions decreased from 7 percent by reaching $99.80 the barril in the morning negotiation in New York Mercantile Exchange.
The price has lowered over $20 per barril since the last Monday.
In the last two weeks, basic products markets have been led by the financial crisis in Wall Street and a couple of huracan powerful huracans in the Mexico Golf.
After reaching a maximum of $145,29 per barrill in July, the prices caught at almost 90 dollars by barril at the beginning of this month before returning, once again because of the huge uncertainty in the financial markets.
The concern was made by the investors once again, the moon, despite the leaders of the Congress, who said they had come to an agreement during the end of the week on the rescue plan, the greatest in the history.
The report was endorsed by new concerns that the financial crisis would be far away.
The evolution occurred in the last episode of the fusion process confirms that Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, as said the Government in this month.
The Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg have partly nationalized the Fortis financial conglomerated European conglomeration.
The analysis in Barcelona Capital Analists said that, at the end of the week, the negotiations conducted to the rescue agreement "perhaps they could not reactive the market feelings."
As the economic situation is deteriorated, it is expected to a delay of the demand of basic products, including petroleum.
"The perspectives for global equity, interest rates and changes will be more incertain," the German analysis wrote in a note to the investors.
"We believe the basic products can't escape from this account.
From the perspective of products, our most appreciating concern is the assessment if the American virus will be spread globally and specifically to China. "
Bank Analysis have reduced their expectations for the next year, such as petroleum consumption low because of the economic growth and the reduction of the petroleum and gas price is 20 percent for 2009.
Second Lower Room: team set record
After past, in the last eight times, more time than nobody in Jets' uniform, playing in defence, Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he saw things have been developed in the second quarter this Sunday, when the Jets transformed a game without notice to a game of desinflation.
"I never saw anything like that," said Eliss.
The second fourth started after Jets and the Arizona Cardinals played in perceived under the clouds summits.
At this time, the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles by making a 12-day goal and suggesting the perfect printing for a late, in which the relationship between players had a great goal forward.
Favre found Coles for two meters more in the room, one of these when a cornerback fell down and another came with 10 seconds in half.
'I didn't go out of my way,' said Fare of all the steps that were going to Coles.
"He's a devil of a player.
Our communication has been great, independently what people can think."
While Favre and Coles were played at the press, the Cardinals Defense was injured to the quarterback Kurt Warner.
The Darrelle Revis corner intercepted a walking tickets and returned it 32 jars for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith pointed to another step and intercepted it.
Linebacker David Bowens was bound to the lack of Warner.
In the last turn, the lack of Bowens could have been the best.
The Cardenals took the property with 10 seconds available, and after the Jets recovered the ballon, Jay Feely gave him a 20-through potato to win a definitive 34-0.
These are the highest points that Jets never did in a room.
At the team driver, Eric Mangini asked him to describe the lack of this moment, said, "The second quarter or the third?"
When the Jets were answered - the Jets allowed 21 points without answer in the third - Mangini, "I can say that he felt much more than the second quarter than the earthquake.
They won a quantity of points in a very short period of time."
Genrselassis discanned undertakings of its global record
Another time, Haile Gebrselassis of Ethiopia has shown that many consider him the greatest corridor of the history, over his own global record in the Berlin marathon this Sunday and become the first person able to run the road of 26,2 miles in 2 hours 4 minutes.
Following the winter in the road at the planet at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie has disappeared for 27 seconds his previous record of 2:04:26, obtained last year in Berlin.
During the age of 35, Gebrselassie has established the World Record number 26 in a road of an impresionant length, so he has established a global campeon or a global record for any distance, from the contrary car to the marathon.
In the past month, Gebrselassie has not taken part of the olympic marathon in Beijing, fearing - perhaps too alarming, in backspeaking - that the contamination of the air has increased their problems with asma.
Instead, he was attacked to run to Berlin.
In practical - solated and 48 degrees when starting the wheel, 55 degrees at the end - Gebrselassie won this Domingo, using average 4 minutes 43 seconds per milk.
Since past walkers such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have become long distances, the memory of the marathon was reduced in more than two minutes in the last decade, since Ronaldo da Costa from Brazil gained in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the winning of last Sunday, Gebrselassie said to the journalists that he had suffered warmings in the pantorel two weeks before and that he had lost a week of interview.
It is clear that the suspension left you fresh, not oxidated.
"I'm very happy," Generslassie said to the journalists.
"All was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and today I taught some doubts, but finally everything was fine."
The attitude has been objected to some critical - especially in Kenya, the African Eastern Rival of Ethiopia - for the style of railing too much his cars, in general, avoiding the meeting with many stars of the world's marathon, based on the brands as if it was a road track, and put the records before the sense of competition.
But this critical does not reduce the size of the ability of Gebrselassie as a corridor.
This Sunday, at the walk of four kenians, Garselassie reached the half of the chariot at 1:02:04.
Two of Kenya's election courses, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, began to disappear in Gebrselassie after their marks.
But a little before three miles of the meta, Gebrselassie cooked a last impuls to separate Kwambai, who ended the second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal record for almost five minutes.
Kamathi came to the third place at 2:07:48.
In the female road Irina Mikitenko, born Kazajstán but now German citizen completed a notable year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh faster time in history.
Paula Radcliffe of Britain has the world record of 2:15:25.
The spring, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a surprise and won London Marathon at 2:24:14.
She did not take part in the Beijing Games because it was described as a lection on the back, but she was recovered to gain in Berlin and set his best recorded staff in almost five minutes in the third marathon.
He made an intelligent calculation road, left a quarter of Kynian and Ethiopics to do heads and then recover them after 18 1月2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia gained the second place in 2:21.31, while Elena Kiprop ended third of Kenya 2:25:01.
In a apart city, the fiery and the tests of the color life
Hidden by the expansion of the park to the great Orland, at a few kilometers of the lighting, rudden and colossal city, there is a quiet people, where the fiery and the complications of the African experience are very clear.
Eatonville, the first city of black placed in the country and place of the childhood of Zora Neale Hurston, is not so simple as she described it in 1935: "The city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 men of colour, 300 good nogers, many guayabis, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a accommodation place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Zora! Feria in Eatonville to give home to Mrs. Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
And however, in many senses, the city she described – making it also a tourist stage through its inclusion in the leadership of Florida travels produced by the Federal Schreibers of the Depression Time - remains a separate place.
The city remains independent, worthy and private as it was in the 1930s, when Mrs. Hurston wrote that the rural blacks in Florida often resisted to share his true ideas with the white man, "because so little about us and that he doesn't know what is going to lose."
Even now, in the year in which a black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, has called the attention to starting a dialogue on the issue of race, many still remain guilty towards the foreigner.
"We are very careful about how our story is accounted," said Jones Hortense, 59 years old, a resident of all life and member of the old church of the city.
"I have to be right."
Eatonville has always been defined a triunfo and fight.
It is at the same time a historic model of the confirmation of blacks and a community of almost 2.400 people who live under a double poverty level of the national average.
It is a literary center, but also a repaired example of the southern snow culture - sometimes disappeared, other elogida - born by slave in America.
It's not wondering if those who dwell here are gorgeous and reserved.
A And the concern for the image of Eatonville really started by Zora, as no one called Mrs. Hurston.
It entered its birth city into the world through its deep books in dialecto like "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs in Florida’s Guide turned the city, notably outside Rule 17, a road that runs through the center of Florida often forgotten to the history of the blacks and human drama.
Having a face of cement so much in life as well as in literature, Mrs. Hurston brought his lectors to the ownership of the first hall of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, and then back to more private areas.
"To the left way," he wrote, "the modern public school is marged with his white ends, his well-bearing gardens and patients of game, care by Howard Miller, as he can read and write."
She also mentions the new husband of the Dash Witnesse and writes that Glenn Lee "while of all kinds and everything goes with transitory rooms."
So, in only one hundreds of words, Mrs. Hurston puts Eatonville to the autonom government, but also with analphabetism, the second marriage and sex.
Of course, this Fodor did not.
In fact, not all of them appreciated the post.
"When he described it as it was," said Ela Dinkins, 90 years old, one of the girls Johnson who inmortalized Mrs. Hurston circled men who would sing no colours about her beauty.
He added: "A number of people did not like it."
Mrs. Hurston is still remembered here as a vital excentric that returned frequently after his family moved to Jacksonville, in Florida.
Franklin Augusto, 77 years old, it is remembered that when Mrs. Hurston came to the city, he did it without a warning in a great Chevrolet, smoking and bringing pantalons into a city that is still enthusished to clothe dignity.
Most of the residents were excited, said Mr. Franklin, while many were sarcastly laughing.
"The people were always glad to see Zora," continued Mr. Franklin.
But, adding, balanced on his sleeve in a back pair with view on the Sabelia Lago, where Mrs. Hurston was probably baptized, "There has never remained too long."
When Mrs. Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were no longer in stamping.
As most of the world, Eatonville also seemed to have forgotten her.
Although it was a literary star, a contemporary contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only colour woman in the Barnard College in the 20 years, he was buried in an anonymic tomb in Fort Pierce - Florida, where he was living.
In Eatonville, there were no great memory ceremonies, nor great public readings.
"I don't think their contribution to the world or heritage were understood," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biographie of Mrs. Hurston published in 2003.
A certain marriage came in the 1980s.
The officers of the Coadado of Orange wanted to put a five cars through the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the two main cars of the working community.
The expansion of the Orland area has already been undertaken by the Interestal 4 through the Western border of the city.
The proposal arrived at a moment that Eatonville was recovering a difficult period of his history.
The forced integration, among other things, had delayed its relatively identical isolation of the community.
In the 50s, the fight for the racial mixture took the hate about the community.
"In that time, a group of white boys, went through the city swallowing naranjas and all things against people who sat on the side," said Mr. Franklin.
"There also killed a girl once.
They launched him against a car sandwich."
In a letter of 1955 to Mrs. Hurston wrote to the newspaper The Orlando Sentinel, criticing the powerful integration of the Supreme Court that, in Brown v. Board of Education, "in place to honor my race."
R The residents say today that the disregion of schools, positive in some aspects, had denied the cohesion of Eatonville and have sustained the confidence of their young people.
"The Black Children were atombed to be abroad - I agreed that - he was assembled to busy the professor tomorrow and night," said N.Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive director Preserve the Eatonville Community, an organization without the ends of lucro.
This was hard, added, until teachers and students had not arrived in the same place.
"I wouldn't touch your teacher because he was white - there's a cultural breast there," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Citizen rights, however, helped create space for many more Zora Neale Hurstons – black writers, acteurs and artists who passed above the prejudices, as she did, with boyfriend, trust and lines as: "How can someone deny himself the pleasure of my company!
I don't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker went to the anonymic grave of Mrs. Hurston and began to fight to rise up his reputation.
Five years later, a biografic complaint by Mrs. Hurston made by Robert E. Hemenway appeared in the books, bringing her back into the American canons.
The project of the road came right at the moment that the most famous daughter of Eatonville was again under the reflectors.
And this time, the old neighbors of Mrs. Hurston saw it as a saver.
In 1988, the community began planning a fertility for Mrs. Hurston to show what the road might be able to run with that road.
thousands of wonderers reached the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return to the celebration.
After several years, the condensation has left its proposal for a road.
"The idea risen from the road to five ways, would be put to what you would call curvation speed, a true civil orgasm," said Mrs. Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd said more simply: "The time he saved Eatonville."
The victory on the road project has helped to change the image of the same city.
External people like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to the Church from 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and the residents started reviewing the past.
Eatonville entered into the National History Registre in 1998.
A new library (of course, the name of Hurston opened his doors in 2006, on a revived and embraced Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville continues to be an annomalization in Florida: only six miles from the centre of Orlando, may sometimes feel you like in a past road under a summer race, in a small city as well as which was founded by only 27 black families in the 1880.
(The 90 percent of people is black today.)
Forasters who are looking for the history of Eatonville, of their meaning, are often being treated with care.
To an advanced permit is necessary to make the majority of the interviews, and some things - like the ancient walls in the Eatonville Church, painted by a white man and showing black men working in the field - can't be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Ms. Jones, a strong and convincing professor who has weakness through the bright red, still fear that his island community can be misinterpreted.
And yet, as the Hurston festival has been expanded, it has also reached a greater birth level.
Young, in particular, tend to see Eatonville the same way that Mrs. Hurston saw all their race: beauty, and all the problems, not better, not worse, and also the other racial and ethnic groups in America, orgasm, creative, worker, thorough and mixed.
It is a sincere civil sense that can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's sobriety, Edwin Harvey, of 18 years, which will be planned back to Eatonville after university to work in the local government or the Department of Police, which could need some help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, two of the 11 years of Winter Park, seem to have learned correctly to describe Eatonville.
"The most people, in the case they're attempt to go to here, will have to think, 'Oh, this city is nothing in comparison with any other'," said Alondra Kenon after you go to the church in recent Sunday.
"But if you really stop and take a time to look at your story, it's a very nice city."
Here, in New York, everyone speaks correctly about financing.
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If the turists in Manhattan were staying far from the chess and the big television screens in the Square Times, they would not take account of being found in the eye of the hurcan.
They could never imagine that behind the speculating glass of the neck offices, which are found above their heads, bankers and speculative fund Managers, which monopolians New York are in front of the "mal day of the office" from the 1929 bathroom.
Children for home delivery are still moving their metal carriers for the tea through the axes and carrying moffin bands for dinner meetings.
The Latin people are still driving between the apartment buildings, as well as human mulls, with 50 excentric station beds that are collapsed through their guests. Official workers are still waiting for their dinners to take the morning, and it is still impossible to catch a taxi between 4 and 7 per late in the working days.
Employers are waiting to make a cup through their bathroom to the carriers' carriers, and it is impossible to find a taxi between the four and five of the afternoon in the week daily.
I was feeling like if there had no absolute crisis, until, this Thursday afternoon, with all the pestician previsions that there is, I decided to open a new score account.
Although it had been calculated the time necessary for the operation to agree to the end of the late end in my local JP Morgan Chase, a cut of more or less than 20 people had already been waiting.
And not before the worker's sale, to retain their effective or to make a depository, but in front of the customer's service bank, where customers of all life order their cheque talents, tourists seek instructions to go to the large Macy stores and new customers want to open their accounts.
Most of these people precededed me, I was informed later by Starr, my "fair confidence banker," and were in school for the same reason I.
Apart from me, still, they had already taken off their lowest banks from where they had changed, places such as New Jersey, Pennsylvania and the island of States.
They had taken their money from the so called ahorro associations (a little as a construction society), the credit units and the carriers of their birth city whose branches only operate within the state of ownership, and say to customers as their family.
During the past year, 15 of these banks have quietly broken.
In the last days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 million, entered in quiet, and as the neolorquins traveled to their houses on summer night at the end of the week, another bank, Wachovia, with a number of $440 million, was looking for a rescue buyer.
The workers of the offices and tents that were staying before me, fearing another coffee, were moving their money to a bank that was considered a secure refuge, what is the most of the rescues in Wall Street.
The ordinary persons in New York have become the last weeks in experts of the finance.
A woman in my local Chinese supermerced, speaking by the phone, refered to Lehman Brothers, the fractated bank, and his executive director of abused aspect, Dick Fuld, started the matter with familyship as if they had been abandoned from the inactivity of a colleague.
And Lyn, the fifteenth and something I made up in uniform of my apartment block, has changed the normal rumm of our conversations on Brad and Angelina or my buys to the tender.
He told me, after my visit to the bank, that "I have all my carriers in monetary market funds.
Conversion is done, I'm not taking any risk."
Muslims profaned at the time Austria is close to the right
Heinz-Christian Strache, from the left side of the extreme right game for the freedom of Austria and Philip Dewinter, attended the extreme right party Vlaams Belang, take part in a manifestation to present the "Ciudades against Islamization" organization in Amberes, on Thursday 17, 2008.
Trade signals representing mixtures with a red line that is attracted.
Police is oftaining some extremists of extreme right because it has profaned a musulman census in Austria, the same weekend that the political parties in the extreme right had made huge gains in the general elections of the country.
More than 90 tombs were seriously damaged in the Traun cementary cementary, near Linz, at some moment between Friday night and this morning, in what the police believes that it was an organised action.
The offenders threw the Jewish symbols, such as the David’s Straight on some of the tombs, but the investigators believe that this could have been done by the attempt of hiding the real reasons of extremists imposed by hate muslim immigrants.
It is not clear if the accident was in any way related to the elections.
A local Islamic Community portrait said that they were "deeply chocolate" for the news of profanation, which came to the musulman religious when the month Ramaldan ended.
Until soon, Austria will be prepared to an inspection round after the right round in the yesterday parliamentary elections.
The two parties of extreme right-to-depth parts of the votes, the Libertad Party and the Partnership for the Austrian Future have conducted a concentrated campaign in the anti-immigration vessel and some of their slogans were considered xenofobos by criticians.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Libertad Party who gained more than 18 percent of the vote, made his campaign against the headpairs and the buses, and also expressed its opposition to the food concerned with Islam.
At its last meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a "European Deputy" to prevent the surrounding of Islam.
Both parties are trying to prohibite the construction of mixtures and mines, argued that they were symbols of the actual isolation policy in Austria and Europe.
Researchs and analysis carried out immediately after the elections, which confirmed the extreme right as the strongest political block of the country, indicate that the change was primarily made by young voters who are concerned for their future in the European Union.
Foreign travel Prohibition for Gary Glitter
The courts have prohibited Gary Glitter, the fascinating rock star of sexual abuse of children, traveling to France and Spain.
The judges impeded to Glitter a prohibition of six months after he informed the monitoring authorities that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
The Kent police made the prohibition of traveling to the foreign Thursday after the judges had produced the tests of the previous condemnation of Glitter for sexual abuse of children.
Glitter, real name, Paul Gadd, didn't attend the hearing at the Ashford Magistry Judge, but was represented by the Corker Binning lawyer.
A portrait of the Service of Justice said: "Just 25 September in the Justice of Ashford Magistrates in Kent, the police requested a provision to prevent the travels from Mr. Paul Gadd to the foreign, such as France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd did not attend person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities who wished to travel to the foreigner in order to be found under the registration of sexual offences.
He must inform the authorities in the case he wished to travel for more than three days.
and it is also necessary to communicate the police on the date for seven days of prelimination of its exit.
The police of Kent said that he would not discuss the individual case or the possible place of Glitter in the condensation.
A police officer of Kent said: "The Kent police will make everything possible to protect children in this country, or foreign.
A police officer of Kent said: "The Kent police will make everything possible to protect children in this country, or foreign.
"To our point of view, it is easier to monitor someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have systems to manage all possible risks in more effective way.
"Protect the residents of Kent is the main concern of the Kent police and we are working in close cooperation to monitor the behaviour of sexual offences registered in the state and reduce at least any risk that can exist for the public."
Glitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after 27 months in a Vietnami prison for the abuse of two girls, with ages between 10 and 11 years.
When Hitter was released, he fled to Bangkok, where he took a flight to London.
However, he said he was bad and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities have not allowed him to pass through passenger control and finally turned to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused the entry and returned to Bangkok, where the Thai police and immigration officers insisted because he returned to Britain.
He probably came to the Territory 3 of Heathrow on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Court of Magistrados of Uxbridge, to the West of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied the order to be registered as a sexual crime.
Glitter had been incarnated in the United Kingdom for four months in 1999 for the possession of child abuse images.
A source of the Ministry of Interior Affairs reported that Jacqui Smith, the Minister of Interior was quiet and rejoiced in knowing that Glitter had forbidden travel to France and Spain.
"Capto the teacher out of scene to extract your character" Günther Bauer_Fotograph
We're tagons, we're flighting, not dragging.
The absence of the great teachers of the flamenco, deployed of the concentration in the interpretation to get the relaxed aspect of man or woman.
On one side the artist.
Otherwise, the person.
Inseparable save in the intimity, in those moments foreign to the public, when finding the privacy of a manager, the depth of a rocked look or the expressivity of one hand, is concerned because you're not going out to the scene.
The German Günther Bauer foreign in "Flamenco-people" the theatrality of some loads in scene with cantors, bailers and guitars with that less known by these teachers.
With this proposal, the photograph gathers the particular flamenage icon from different areas.
Including in the programme of the Flamenca Photography, the exhibition "reflects the international importance of flamenco, more every day," the Creator explains that "Flamenco-people" " can be people anybody but, when seeing photos, the observer is not the types of artists in the scenario.
These people "in the street" are artists able to transmit to scene passion, tristeness, joy... captiving the public.
To catch the personality of these artists, there are no need to take photos from the scenario.
Bring your personality and character inside.
What I was interested was creating an endful atmosphere that would allow me to take the camera's personality of the great flowers."
With the "Cante des Minas festival", Bauer started a long journey in 1.997 to return to the cantors, guitars or bathrooms with a plate room.
They are patents that, due to the selection of the camera and the material, remember the classic photography.
The application of various styles is broken with the classic basis of the image, confiding to him modernity, that reflects how the Bauer own understands the flamenca: "A music with very traditional races, which enhances and surprises every day."
It is not the action of the bath, the song or the touch in himself, but the personality of the artist, his nature, which is kept with his art to the public.
The search for a meeting with the essential, with the doubt that it is made visible in a way to feel, to be and to be and to be and has been the continuity of this work that is presented in the Galerie The Fotomata.
You know flamenco figures like Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Librijano, Antonio Canals, Vicente Amigo, among others, configure this selection of almost seventy artists photographed.
The project has become an anthology of flamenco, which will soon be published in a book that will collect the patents listed in the sample.
The past for Bauer's deputys has brought him again the idea two years ago with "Vevian Sporters Reports" ("SportARTProject").
Although the concepts are different in "Flamenco-people", the photograph admits that "I like to get people, to know them and to get in a moment in their life, to be a long or short moment.
I think the photograph is the hardest gender.
You're finding or fighting with people, persons, who sometimes don't know, or have to leave you a few minutes to take your photo.
Despite these circumstances, as a photograph, I always try to do my ideas."
This collection of flower patents from the current flamenco contained by title "Flamenco-people" is expressed in the Gallery El Fotomata, located on the 20th street of the Mata, parall's Alameda of Hercules, where it can be visited until October 16.
Vargas Llosa trusts that the news that writes is " a fear"
It is ambitious in places that still not known and shown on unknown matters, but still so, Mario Vargas Llosa is engaged to bring out the new project on which work, a new new new that has a protagonist to Roger Casemant, an Irish national who lived twentieth years in the Congo and passed through Amazon.
The always favourable Nobel Price of Literature confessed yesterday by the There Festival Segovia that the project today occupied "es a fear" and that "all indicates that I should not write" the news.
"If it was feeling, I wouldn't do it, but I'm gonna do it and hope to end it once," he concluded in his intervention in the exchange festival of ideas, thoughts and words that you've seen passing through the city of the Acceducto to a hundreds of writers, stories and journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The city and the dogs" was one of the most important figures of the third edition of the word party and fulfilled the prognostics.
Vargas Llosa, who has gained the prize There is Festival for being the most voted writer by the participants - an old edition of "Our mutual friend," by Dickens-, filled theory of John Bravo.
He presented by Félix Romeo, found a public delivered to him very shortly when the Peruan, with a wonderful memory and with great humor doses, resumed how he was born in him his literal vocation, resulting from the "exceptional adventure" of the "place to read" and "Vivir more than what he lives"; how he writes from "disciplied manager" to extend its "inspiration" with an intense documentation work, correcting and rehasing many; how Faulkner, Vactor Hugo and Alejandromas influenced in his vocation and what "imagnes of memory" are the foundation of his stories.
The Spanish American newsletter recognized that "no way" to medit and to know if the books change life, "but I deny that literature is a pure interview, an eyeam experience," said Vargas Llosa, who said that it had "related effects" and "has the people more inconformed", so he asked the writers "not leave the freshness" and "asum with responsibility" his vocation.
Climology approves Pozoblanco's ferry that also remains without sides
The reservoir festival that closed the abuse of Pozoblanco Bay was suspended in the morning of yesterday, after checking the announced recycling that the beach was not found in the best terms.
So, the company, according to Fernín Bohórquez, Paul, the Love of Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to stop the course celebration.
Meteorological ingrediences have been made with this ferry, since two of its three festivals were finally not able to celebrate.
On the Sabbath was the rain that imposed the second line of throat planned.

'Sangre of May', the Epica of Garci
In inspiring the National Episodes of Benito Perez Galdós, José Luis Garci recalls the famous resort of Spanish to the French in Sangre of May, which is the most ambitious film in its film with about 15 million euros.
In this way, the cinasta has tried to "effecte the tower of persons and social analysis" which has always been surprised in the work of the newlist, has explained today during the presentation of the tank, with Quim Goodiérrez and Paula Echevar would be in front of a wide list of interprets.
May Sangre, with a metraje above two hours and average, is stretched this Friday in the cinematography rooms, to become in the future in a ministry for telemadrid over four hours of duration.
The great admirator of the literature of Galdós, José Luis Garci assures that " a dream of child," which must thank Esperanza Aguirre, who has been in Madrid's Community three years ago a red red-reaching peak of the second center of May 2, something that was always accepted and when the report was based on the National Episodios.
The 15 million budgets that have been totally brought by the Madrid Community represents a "unique opportunity" to ambite with the decorates and the adjusted vestuary the removal of "A Atolonaded Spain, which was assigned by the chief of fight, since, the fight for independence brought to the people to a great relief with the King of Fernando VII," he pointed.
But the cinema lamentate has not mentioned a financing like Alatriste or Goya fantasmates - more than the double of the Sangre of May - so you couldn't ruin some scenes plated in a guide signed together with Horacio Valcárcel, which has cooperated in almost all its road.
So, the director of Reverre to begin, has incided in his usual form of work, the lapting in scene with the actors, with which he urged to execute before start the road and who does not casting, by seeming "humillant" and consider that "the part of the office of the director resides in the teatro and the cine to know what happens in the industry in which it works".
Many of the interpretations with those involved in Sangre of May again before his camera, such as the case of Miguel Rellán, Carlos Laarrañaga or Fernando Guillen Curvo.
Canded to Oscar in four times - of which one--, Garci believes that any of the three candidates to represent Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the Holy Sangre own, seven French Baller tables and the finally selected, the blind rounds, do not represent a young generation of Spanish cinema, "which is what must be known", has been secured.
With this Garci film, he doesn't expect privileges.
"In the beginning you think you're working for posterity, then you're aware that you're only working for prosperity, and now you're doing more film," Garci explains more than 30 years of professional trajector.
Isabel Bayón recovers the existence of the basilarina Turtola Valencia
A gulillan bathroom will home to a bathroom also.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, from Catholic father (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and fertilize mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), born in the Triana bar and when he was three years moved to London with his family.
It was a free dance bailarine and specialist in Eastern Dances.
I had a appreciating life, female pioneer, such as Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
He was buddhist and vegetarian and abounded by the abolition of the corses that had prevented the free female movement.
The life of this woman who marked a danish and estate revolution in the Europe of wars, was excited to Isabel Bayon.
"I wanted to work with Pepa Gamboa, and she suggested that person and she looked incredible."
According to the battleor, "Don't try to give your life but to gather your spirit.
The titles of your dances suggested me the flower's arms.
So, "the danse of the mariposa" suggested me a guilty, or "the dance of the serpent" a few tangos.
Her bathroom was sensitive, and I said that my bathroom is also within this ethical," he states.
The mountain contains two exceptional cooperations: the Miguel Poveda, which will cry again to Isabel in one in its spectrums, as he did in the "The open door"; and with the Matilde Coral teacher, who has expressly desired to cooperate with who had been his school.
"Matilde does a larger one, the person of the maturity.
I'm happy because you have accepted acting in my work and I feel very honried about it."
The mountain also contains the musical and guitars of Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Poulga and Moi de Morón; the persecution of El Pajaro, as well as the violation of Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of a actor, Johnfra Juárez, "which does the role of the eternal manner of this kind of artists who were drunk in all its extension, and they always walk in love of them."
The work also takes into account the life of this woman who has been developed in so far places, especially for the time, such as India, the United States, or Russia, as it usually lived in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think it is of those women who have a huge influence in a certain time, and now no one knows and much less lays its work," says Bayon.
The spectrum will begin today at 20:30 p.m. in the Vega Lope Teatro.
The publication of the "Journal of a Remarried Poeta" also covers the Trinity
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the Day of a Poeta Residence in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), place where John Ramón Jimenez married with Zenobia in March 1916, was led within the activities programmed by the Council of Culturation of Andalucia to celebrate the "Trienio Zenobia and John Ramón" (2006-2008), organized with the aim of recalling the cinty-annual concept of the Premio Nobel of Literation and the fault of both.
In this way, the "Treinio Zenobia and John Ramón" comes to his end with the reevaluation of this work, with the International Congress held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the famous exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel light chappie" which was inaugurated the past month of May and, after traveling through the various and alaluze provinces, will be preved to New York during the transition of the International Congress.
Furthermore, the Council of Cultural of the Board of Andalucia has acquired a total of experts of the "Journal of A Receptioned Poeta", edited by Peter Tabernero and illustrated by Jameso Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most universal poeties.
America likes less without Paul Newman
"After God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them."
The sentence is of Sally Field actriz, who worked with him in "Asence of Malice", and gives the idea of the decommodation of the American film, and of all America, before the impacting idea that Newman has gone.
Look, he costed them to give him a Oscar.
And that was left since 2007.
And she knew he was very sick.
It's still been a mass for everyone.
"After what a feeling is more than any expression, and now I lost a great friend," we cried Robert Redford, "My life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
Nobody was afraid to make the riddle or exagger.
He had died a father of the movie and heritage at a particularly dark moment, with fear of terrorists and markets, with the American self-exempt for the suns, looking for reasons for dignity.
When so hard is the time and without virtue the men and well little are that wonder you remain, it does not need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
She was inclined for all of an ideal almost plastic of beauty and truth.
He was formal enemy by Richard Nixon and Defender of lost and winned causes, from the foundation to combat drugs created in honor of his firstborn died by overdosis to its mark of case and organic food.
All a gift to a country that has costed you much to be overcome to a suicide food culture.
The expansive wage of the barrier Hollywood wonder without waiting for nationalities and passengers.
The last James Bond, English Daniel Craig, found that a man was not dead but one.
Another English, director Sam Mendes, said to work with Newman was or less than the summit of his road.
The bad boy came from Australia, Russell Crowe, urged him to call Newman his greatest inspiration.
"We have left the list very high to all," said George Clooney, perhaps one of the littles today attempt to try to live as Paul Newman: maintaining the need of hope and to have a serious and away private life from the rooms.
This is not always easy or not even possible in the today's Medical Jungle.
But there's someone who tries to him, and Paul Newman is his example.
It was divorced once but then he was married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, which was faithful when they surely pushed him the opportunities not to be.
"But why am I going to eat hungry out of the house, if I'm in a network?" I used to broke him.
In the sky, it is the pride that his daughters are in the earth with their fans, something that is so common in America.
"On all the great roles he interpreted, of no one was so fiery as the devoted husband, loved father, solitaire grandmother and dedicated filter," they said.
The imperfect road of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that there are olimpied in Madrid and, after the fall of 2012, it may be 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we follow the example of the yesterday road, I say not!
The perfect road called her, and at my judgment, it was the worst chariot with a lot in which I was.
A break of dispropositions that, from then, if they had taken it as an evaluation and I would consider, would be a very clear suspension.
But let's go by parts and from the beginning.
The disappearers start with the dorsal collection, which makes you to go before.
Whatever me feels wrong, but if they do you to go to give it all (including the chip to avoid collars in the car).
Well no.
Here they would only go to gather the dorsal (prep outproposed, go only for that) and (leaving the relevant cola), shot!, only had the 'S' thread for the camisette (as I needed a XL table)
In what world have we lived?
Or is it that by the crisis they have decided to buy only small shoes with less tickets and barriers?
Well, things like these are a threat compared to the car day.
Besides having to go quite ready to collect the chip, the kitchen to reach is 15 minutes and, further, you need to leave the kitchen.
More than 35 minutes long the expectation, something incomprehensible for a road where more than 11,000 people are expected.
Then, as it was to wait, he started the chariot, and we hadn't left the kitchen, although once it had done, the collection was worse.
Furthermore, the rain brought the expectation of more than 40 minutes, which was played with a popular rebellion and reached the box.
I think some 500 people will certainly have pulmony tomorrow, and some like me, they will not even appear with the right time in classification because of the chip they gave me that, I imagine, I don't have marked the output correctly.
From then, if they asked me for the perfect road, this would not enter into my thoughts.
So I think we'll continue to dream with a well prepared olive city.
Microsoft searches Receptionist (virtual)
In the MIT Technology Conference, Microsoft has shown an advance of a new human recognition system and interaction, a kind of Artistic Intelligence without much understanding but able to perform some basic tasks, such as to ask a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a lanceder will be to move through the company campus) by adding what you hear in the conversation.
Thanks to a camera and a recognition system of forms and faces, this "receptionist" can know how many people are in the room, who are - even remember what they hold - and listen to and understand the key words of their conversations.
Grouping to presents according to the conversation groups.
In the show video the receptor detects a third person, but it understands that he does not belong to the group that is talking to her and that he is not an employer of the company.
Question if you're there to visit someone and tell him he'll take it shortly.
No blue screen.
It's impressive.
But that, obviously, is the future.
Now the company has better things to be concentrated, for example, in the next version of your operational system, Windows.
This week he spoke very about a strategy change in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be easier and will not have a lot of related programs.
Steve Ballmer has discovered that if the computers would come with the impressive instead of trade bathroom loads, they would go five times faster - man, Steve, it will be at least.
All of the findings, taking into account that Microsoft, version after version, has added functions and "extras" to Windows.
The rumbo change thanks.
Microsfot is right, the operational system will lose importance, and the software also.
When Google Chrome went out to the network, I was one of those who joined the theory that was the first step of Google to buy with Windows.
Many have noted with a note that a browser is not an operational system.
The operating system will always be needed because it is the unprecedented capture for the engine and software to be understood.
Take the same role as your wife or your husband when you have to tell you something to your sweet.
That's true.
It will never disappear but we need to think about the "mortal" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relatively.
What Ballmer has said this week is the confirmation of this idea.
People always gives less attention to the operational system, and more on the web browser.
The computer only runs to execute the Firefox or Explorer - or Chrome - and we're every day walking more time by navigating than in the window environment.
What are the half of the applications coming in the system?
Mens is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than see.
Deep, less reloaded, less complex.
To Microsoft, it is more interesting to integrate your online services and eventually be an alternative to Google.
They need it unfortunately, actually, and I bring a small example.
The photo of this post I took it in one of the departure rooms for employees of Microsoft, Redmond, at the beginning of the month.
In the reconstruction machine, a card asks you to use your search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees were using Google to search on the network.
The past week, of course, has also been confirmed a delay in the new Windows Mobile 7.
It will not arrive at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, as well as 2010.
In Microsoft, you will certainly search the overall launching of Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The phone, after all, is every day more computer.
But the departure, with Android and iPhone already on the street, will pass through facing.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Paul Picasso led her to the Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio played a 'Diamant of blood' of Edward Zwick, just like Al Pacino in 'El Padrin' of Francis Ford Coppola and part of the uniform of the muscular park.
And if we put us to listen to staircase appearances, we can refer to the image of the large-scale point that would arise weak in a walking circumstance.
Except, it is no more than the gentleman's inner chain in cotton, celled and without mangs.
The 'Tank', which calls the speaking English, but the Fabuleux Marcel of Brussels is pointing on all the others.
First, by his rimbombing name - even though she is familiarly known as 'Marcel' - which has to see with the sport because he receives his name, according to the league, from Marcel Cerdan boxer, loved by the Song Edith Piaf.
'The Marcel' notes the others because of its excellent cotton, by its unisex core, by its different team and by the small Belgian band (unlikely recognisable) that the most emblemtic camistic models are drawn as details in the kitchen.
And attention, because the production of Belgian signature is not only focused on its tank tops.
Also includes sudder college, back boxers, cash cards, coffee pantalons, mariners, babies, mini shorts...
Take thoughts for the comfort underwear.
Although it's a penalty to leave them as an internal clothe.
You have too love.
"I want to be young mother; the candidate doesn't worry about me."
His great similar to his sister has not banned her own personality.
Monica Cruz is warm but full of vitality.
Currently, Cruz sisters are very seriously taking their new activity in the mode.
For Monica, they're much more than some beautiful and famous girls who give their name.
It was in Paris in promoting the signing of Mango in his new seat, besides the presentation of the most important premies of mode than the Spanish house.
Cleaned and ridiculous, wins in short distances.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I came to present the new collection that we thought to my sister Penelope and I for Mango in this new Sunday-On-Onthday time, rather than attend the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner of the Opera in honor of Valentino.
Let's go, a very intense boyfriend but, at the same time, exciting.
In what is your new collection for Mango based on this fourth time working for the Spanish house?
My sister, as well as me, loves the kine of the 50 and 60 years; from there we take many references.
Then, I like to lose a city and watch women as swimming clothing, as combining and mixing their clothes, I do so much.
Bailarina, actriz and designer, you're a very polifacetic woman, right?
I think yes, but, finally, it's all one and there's a lot of ways in common.
I liked her clothes from the little; I wanted to go home to my grandfather to steal in the arms of my tea and to see his clothes.
It was the bomb, almost better to go to the attracting park.
Then, by bailarina, I always tried to worry about how I was clothing.
You know that the bailarines likes us to make our styles for classs and tests, to look at us at the speed and feel well.
And in the actriz paper you give the vestuary is when you really find the person.
Then, everything will be associated, that is yes, with much respect to the designers and professionals.
You haven't fulfilled it over 30 years ago, did you get a crisis?
What's going on.
I'm feeling better than ever, 30 people like me.
I find that woman is done, has experience and saves life with less mistakes.
I don't worry about the biological orange.
I did the things I wanted from the little, and this has given me much luck inside.
So you think you're mother or not?
From then, I know I'm going to be mother because I'm asking the body and, moreover, I want to be mama young; this I don't want to lose it.
With regard to the candidate, I don't worry about.
What I will do is give you much luck to my son and educate it with much love.
With regard to the kitchen, you're expected of several streets that you run last year.
That's what I have to see the light.
I, that I'm a woman who comes from the theatre, I'm very worried and worried, everything I want for already and clear, can't be.
I have gain that they're exalted 'La last hour' is 'In looking for the tomb of Christ'.
See you look...
A few days ago you got to go on a past with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, well, don't say that.
It's not that I get up to a past to make a model.
Simplely, he called me Naomi Campbell, to whom I know for a long time, to invite me to go to London to participate in a Beneficial defile for his "Musers for a better world" and the roof we expressed - I know two pieces of our collection for Mango - undertaken to retain money for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know that dark heart of Naomi.
There's a lot of things about her that I know her, I'd tell you that many are not certain.
Furthermore, I stay with that good part in which she's involved.
He asked me to disappoint for such a noble reason, but if it comes to ask me to make the pione, so it also.
For the benefit of women from the third world, what does not have to do.
Alcolock drivers shall install the 'alcolock'
Internly he wants the conductor with three administrative sanctions by alcohol, to install in your vehicle a system that impides to burn the eve vehicle, or if it is not stolen.
The initiative has already been announced in the past month of June and has already been included in the annual memory of the State General Fiscality, as regards a pilot project that will have a duration of a year.
Its purpose is the reintroduction of the conductor, therefore it will also receive a violent reconstruction course.
In the experience, besides the Vital Security General Fixation, they will participate in the Director-General for Traffic (DGT) and the Technology Institute for Automobile Security (FITSA).
According to statistics, 30% to 75% of the motorists claimed more than once again by conducting ebris returned to coating the car.
The alcolock would avoid it because it is a system connected to the vehicle which missing the alcohol rate in inspired air and impeds to furniture the car if the driver does not soft; or when a concentration of alcohol is higher than the allowed.
The cost is exceeding 1.000 euros and would run in account of the sanctuary.
In this respect, a study carried out in the EUU in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with these devices reduced to 65% of the infraction during the first year of implant.
And in Spain it is calculated that I could save life to 115 persons every year.
The measure is referring to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address such behaviour before the defence of criminal crimes.
And facilitating its implementation, since legal reform can be done by regular ways, and however, the reform required by criminal means require reform in a organic law.
The device is still not available in the Spanish market in no commercial modality, although it has already been installed experimentally in some industrial vehicles and public service.
On the morning, the Deputy Congress will vote tomorrow in an initiative of the PSOE in which this system is proposed to be installed in school buses, as well as has been carried out in France.
In Mexico and without "peep-toes"
In British pointuality at 17.40, the planned hour in the programme was landed in the Benito Justice of Mexico DF aircraft in which the Principles of Asturias traveled.
The sun was removal, but its wheels were still obliged to use your hand in the visual way to see the real couple descending from the air.
At foot of escalery, Spanish embarrassing and other authorities.
I had asked the taxist at the street, if he knew that Spanish Princess had visited the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very good, then you can't go to the airport to load at that time... she's out of here or so...
- No, not sir, she's Spanish but she lived here a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
But the mexican press himself very well knows who are the Principles of Asturias and the importance of the trip.
Many are waiting for the hanging of the aircraft pearl and a military valley formed by 27 marine soldiers who interpretate the salvation of honor.
The Principal appears a sound clothing, marine blue clothes, and she, the Princess, melene to wind, very sore, does not use their usual 'peep-toes', may have reported that the DF was threatening.
They make a sound and an earlier screen stopped with the photographs before passing to the room in which the official commission is waiting.
At the door of the hotel where one of the four largers of the city will wait for a close report of the Mexican TV.
The best premium covered by the mode
Maybe there is no more appropriate place in the world to present a model premium, which Paris and perhaps there will be no more exquisite and pleasant designer than Valentino.
I have been presenting the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to strengthen the international projection of the new talents of the mode.
It's paid with a prize of $300,000.
Ahr Sandrina Fasoli, the Belize winner of the first edition, looked at his designs in the Mango escape number 54 of the bulevard housesmann of Paris and almost mourned for emotion.
Actually, it is the second largest tent of the signing in Europe and has been inaugurated by 1.335 square metres of surface.
The first is in London.
So many events, connected to the desire to thank him to the Valentino designer who presided the jury of the survivor, made us reach in a dinner of luxury in Paris's opening garnier.
With the nearby of the most exquisite Chagals, the presidency table of gala prepared by Mango was still more spectcular.
Nati, with the heart of penality and doing a tripas of heart, by the recent fall of his brother, was put a trail of the house and a couple of ELAH, which cut the respiration, and the arm of his son Luis - a kine of almost two metres long - joined Valentino in the presidency of his home dinner.
Andik, the owner and Mr. Mango, did the honors, and it's so a horse that he ended, together with Rotchil's bar, without all, because the two ladies had been provided.
Mónica Cruz, who assembled the tent with pantalons and bed - of own design - and for dinner transformed with a long black clothing clothes, emotioned when at the night past, accompanied by Goya Toledo, teached us the ballot trial room and she, remembering other times, shot up to one of the bars and made a love of 'growder'.
The Saster Inis was not on the past for the dependence of the palace, but before he taught us in the mobile phone photos of his son.
On the next morning we were able to enjoy the presence of Olivier Martínez - another ring that was moved in move - and by John Travolta, who came to Paris intercontinental hotel, with its sabans, his towels and had asked for earlier, that he wouldn't have been older in his room.
The stars under the stared sky of Paris.
Oh, there's life.
1001, the anti-estate number
There are no 1000 but 1000 more ways to forget cootic and flying life daily.
And if it was little, all are gathered in a book that will bring the books to the books on 30 September.
The disaper is almost punished when it sounds early at 7:00, but it's still worse to imagine to be embraced in the rhythm that imposes the current life.
The office is called tension and the backslash computer.
Stress is the evil of the 19th century.
But there are no one or two methods to fight the daily disappearance and the problems of disconnecting with the working world.
No, the number applies, nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
On the margin of the yoga positions, the classic mass or the 'spa' treatments, Susannah Marriott meets on the pages of a book all a "menu" of opportunities adapted to the hot and minutes of each one.
The antistress work is called '1001 ways to relax" and its calm will reach the libraries of the editorial Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone considers that it is impossible to reach tranquility in areas such as work or through personal relations, this manager dismisss such credibility.
In addition, it offers other procedures as to be contacted with nature or 100% natural recruits that contribute to relaxation.
If the adrenalina is no longer running by your coming to restore the balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, it's time to sit on the sofa, to connect the mind and concentrate in reading.
Sleeping items
Some kids are talking about the night.
I don't refuse to those who are very slowly slaughters tell us something that has happened the previous day, but to the children who speaking as sleeping.
The first time that happens to the best you take a suit, but in fact it is not important.
It is a good change of the dream called dream.
It's quite frequent, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure more than one told him he's talking about the night.
This phenomenon can appear very speedly (and once in life, for example, associated with a high fibre episode), or more regularly (tot day, once in the week, once in the monthS...), the child remembers nothing.
There is no one reason that determines its appearance.
Often goes to other dream changes as it feels like they are pain, night terrors, night-terms (againing swimming pool) or sonabulism, but it doesn't have why to be so.
As we have already mentioned previously, they can also be connected to very high fiber tables, to stress situations or exhibition.
In every way, it is a little studyed philosom.
The intensity with which it appears is also very variable.
It may be taught in a sound of quiet, soft words, a mummel or any otherwise (Gree, Laughing, long talks...).
In the cases where the manifestation is very intense, it would agree to observe the child and consult a specialist, to check whether there is a question that produces much carefulness and gives him out of this way.
We have said that it is a good change, therefore he does not have treatment, except he will be connected to another dream change that he can be treated (e.g. if he's connected to a dream or a stick table).
What you can do is take into account a series of very simple preventive measures such as:
Attempt to not excite a little child before I go to sleep.
So searching for quiet games and avoid television programs or series that be feared or a bit violent.
With very nervous kids and that they want to relax, they can use relaxation techniques to help you to acquire a certain internal calm.
This will help the child to have a quiet dream.
Once the dreams appear to keep quiet.
Remember that they are unforfensive for the child and that the next day he will not remember anything of what happened.
Advice Councils
Don't lose it.
It's unutil because he's not aware, and you'll break him the dream.
Although he's talking, he's sleeping and so he's saving.
Remember that if it is very troubled during several episodes, it would agree to consult or find out what is that generates so careful in the child.
If you understand what says (these is not the most usual), do not fall in trying to make you a questionnaire to play information.
You won't get nothing, because when you sleep, it is not aware of how to organize your thought.
Moreover, you will hear what you say, but you don't know what it's dreaming to say this, with what much care about how to interpret information and the conclusions you're going out.
You never tell the child that you can ask him at night to know your secrets.
Not even foolish.
This generates a lot of care.
In response, don't worry, it's nothing wrong, it's a episode that is only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern finally!
The Futbol club, Illhaeusern, found finally the victory path after a long period of escape.
Without having done a good game, the team created a lot of gol times and was able to make a gol to win the game.
The ritm was not very constant during this meeting in which attractors had difficult to express himself.
After a first attempt of Captain Kauffmann, which throwed the square with a stage of far away, Illhaeusern cuasi would take the "poder" and by turn founderflick from far, then with Hirn up, Romein with the foot point or Diabold would also come to prevent the defense of Dannemarie.
On the front, we didn't leave the campist centre and just left Riahi in an attack position.
The second time principle was crucial, first two times of Riahi gol and timeral for Dannemarie, and immediately after the opening of the marker for the Illhousians with the Marais goal, well placed to collect the ballon rejected in a first trial of Diabold (53).
But the Illhousian goleader can't saving a long time of his happiness and will be obliged to return to them to watch a ten minutes later and then leave your team partners at digital level.
But Dannemarie will not use the occasion and it will be a problem for the eleven illhousians who returned a little for "comprimir" their defense, except in the last seconds of game during which, after an important fashion, the ballon passed very close to the transverse field.
Sarkozy is found to huge fishers
Before you go to the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will give a rod through Britain.
With regard to the demonstration of resistance by the fishermen who strongly perturbed the entrys of several breast and normal ports, the President of the Republic decided to go on the morning to the port of Guilvinec in Finnistry to find there his representatives.
They promised to summ it " with a constructive spirit " and they expect that " with specific proposals " come."
This presidency visit includes the general meeting of the " crisis committee " created by breasttonic fishermen to achieve measures towards increased gas prices, which marks a record on the reach of EUR 1.14 per litro.
According to Eliseo David Martinon's portfolio, the Chairman will discuss with them solutions that may be imagined to assist their companies to be competitive and to save the conditions of employment and reimbursement of mariners " .
Fishers are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy firmly.
On Tuesday, they took operations to love the movement to Morbian and the Calvados, which were so attacts of almost 10 km.
Quiberon's sports port has also been blocked, but the connections to Belle-Isle have not been stopped.
" A filtering bar " has been laid in the Queberon pensel.
The mariners have already shown their determination in the moon by burning the trees, nuthots and wood pallets before the Brest ports, and Lorient, while manifestations had been placed in Concarneau or Saint-Briuk.
The movement was extended to other ports of the Atlantic Coast and Mancha, such as in Les Sables d'Olonne, in Vandea, where the bus stayed in the port, or in Le Havre, where there were twenty boats blocked the movements of trade boats.
The fishermen of the Turball and Crossic, in the Loira-Atlantic region, laid down the block of the important total refineering of Donges.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer fishermen decided to wait for the meeting of this mercury, which will take place to the ministry to think in any events of action.
In Guilvinec, the Critical Committee should think on Tuesday in the development of the movement and in its participation to the meeting planned at the Ministry of Agriculture and Peace in Paris.
But some breathtain fishermen do not want to be represented by the national fisheries committee, which does not substitute their movement.
" The wheel will continue " because " fishermen didn't leave " and " they don't want to move to Paris, for example, " announced Liliane Cariou, the Chairman of the Lorient Fish Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay prices on gas, are currently paying approximately 50 cents per litro but consider that a boat balance can be reached only with a gashole with a price lower than 0.30 euros per litro.

Obama, winning during the first televisioned dual
At the first Friday's first debate between both candidates in the White House occurred another to know who has triunfed between John McCain and Barack Obama.
Without surprise, the four general campaigns of republic and democratic proclaimed their own victory in this televised dull that has been followed by a third of the American families.
The political analist David Gergen considers that the performance of John McCain, although honorable, was not "bounding" to allow you to break its lower in the sondes to five weeks of the presidency elections.
The Gallup Institute, whose sound of the public opinion published by the past Sabbate, grants five advantage points for Obama ( 49 per cent to 44 per cent for McCain), judges that it is the democrat who went well.
Among the indiscisive electors, who are accounting, Obama went out with 39 per cent of the surveys, while 25 per cent of them grant the victory to McCain, according to a CBS sonde.
Obama could confirm its benefit to the Thursday with the good benefit expected of his member of his own candidate, José Biden, during the first and only public debate with his rival, Sara Palin.
"It would be an error to underestimate it.
He has good instincts ", however, Bill Clinton's end of week.
The seventh anniversary McCain demonstrated its insufficient experience in the field of external policy, underlined its adversary on these issues in the heart of this first care.
"The Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that..." he accused several times.
"I do not think the Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge necessary to be President, " also ensured.
These words have been repeated since yesterday in republiced television publications.
Obama emphasized that he represented the future.
Uncertainly, it was conscious and necessary.
He made its capacity to take the good decisions and to restore the United States's image in the world.
" McCain has not yet understood, while Obama has already done it ", replied, this week end, a democratic television publication that reproached the republic because he had not considered the importance of the impact of the crisis on the United States " .
"In the nine minutes of discussion, John McCain had many things to say about me, but nothing about you, mentioned Obama, yesterday before 20,000 people who were meetings for a electoral meeting in North Caroline under a rain.
He did not propose the words "medial class" or "born". "Financial deployment clearly favours Obama, which is considered by the United States as the most powerful person to save the economy which is on the side of the precipitation.
"The next week could be a decisive episodio ", estimated yesterday, the influence and democrat Senator Charles Schumer.
The Democratic Representative Rahm Emanuel, an old member of the Clinton administration, compared the " good economic institutes " from Obama with Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
According to the Democratic candidate, the current financial disaster " is the final consequence of an eight-year-old economic policy implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain " .
Reaffirming that, despite all the reduction of the 95 per cent of the United States, the Senator of Illinois also pointed out that the implementation of an energy independence of the country was its first priority, with the creation of a security and health system.
McCain wants to build a 45 nuclear centre park from here to 2030.
At the same time, both candidates addressed the issues relating to the financial saving plan of $700 million (470 million) adopted yesterday by the Congress and extremely impoverished.
"In Minsk, have you noted Minsk elections?"
Young and Opposers demonstrated the Sunday last afternoon on the main place of the Bierlorrus capital to prevent the results of legislation.
Some hundreds of Bielorrus gathered the Sunday after the closure of the electoral centres in the centre of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent nature of legislation.
Although no result has yet been declared, many young people had come to demonstrate the power of President Alexandere Loukachenko: " The deputer, must be described ".
Some recognize not to have voted: "Why, because they will do what they want my vote," says a young man.
They do not believe that the regime which has set the foreign observers in order to renew contact with the European Union is ready to carry out a democratic change.
The sanctions, including visa prohibition for 40 biological leaders and the congelation of certain actives, could be raised if these elections are considered as clean for observers.
It wasn't according to the opposition.
"We were placed on the side of the electoral committees and our observers could not participate in the receipt of the votes ", laid Iouri Potemkine, the Union’s port of the Democratic Force, an Eterogenic Reruption of twelve parties.
"It is a cosmetic, subraya Alexandre Milinkievitch, old candidate of the opposition to the 2006 Presidency election and leader of the movement for European, because it is important to take into account the votes, and our house is the executive power.
If some Members of the opposition enter into the parliament, it is because they will be designed but not chosen.
" But its entry to the parliament may mean appearances in television, meetings in the regions and proposals of law. "
The opposition should therefore enter into the political game because "the dialogue with the European Union must be started.
For if our economy, which has a lot of experiencing debts in Russia, comes into crisis, and if we don't reform, we're going to make Russian protected.
But we want to be independent."
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe follows the electoral process does not recognize the validity of the vote.
It emphasized that the participation numbers appear too high, and that the generalization of the vote with advance (26% of the elector in Minsk) promoted manipulation.
"Are you noted the elections? Request the Social Democrat Chief Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released in August this year.
There was no one in the electoral centers.
And it will be a maximum of five Members of the opposition to the Parliament, which will be better than power."
The silence of the night returns again in the place of October.
In the television, President Loukachenko and the members of the Central Electoral Committee are happy for their success.
The interview - Sangre returns to be secure
Hema-Québec celebrated her tenth anniversary of its funding, and his President, Francine Decary, had reason to rejoice, because Hema-Québec returned to be one of the most safe and effective blood providers in the world.
And above all, he recovered the confidence of the public that seriously had been vained by the scanning of the blood polluted in 1980 and 1990.
As it is known, the national blood reserves of the Canadian Royal Transfusion Service were polluted by the Immunodeficiency Virus (VIH) and the Hepatitis C Hepatitis 1980.
With regard to this drama and the dispensation of the public, the Government of Canada made a public survey, presided by the Judge Horacio Krever, which was intended to clarify the circumstances they had leaded to such tragedy and to formulate recommendations so that such disasters would not be reproducted.
While the judge Krever was late to present its relationship, certain provinces then created a committee that had been aimed at planning a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Geneva Committee fulfilled this mission.
As a result of Gélineau and Krever reports, two providers were created in Canada: Ema-Québec to prove Quebec and the Canadian blood Society to accommodate all the other provinces and both territories.
"In 1998, when Hema-Québec started its activities, almost 38 per cent of the people still trusted in the blood system in Quebec, it remembers Decary.
The situation was desolate.
Following many efforts to improve the security of blood products and much work for the years following, we recovered the public's confidence, " said, "before it is proudly stated that at the beginning of 2008, nearly 94% of the population of Ema-Québec had successful confidence in Hema-Québec.
Dr. Decary recalls, however, that " confidence is something extremely fragile " .
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, Ema-Québec adopted the principle of precaution.
At that time, we attended in Europe with the birth of many cases of the human variation of the local vacation disease, a new variation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, account Decary.
And we didn't know if this disease could be transmitted through blood.
Then we support in one of the main recommendations of Krever and Genelineau reports, which, when we don't know, and when a serious disease can exercise this, the Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease which is characterised by a degeneration of the brain that brings inevitably to death, we reinforce exclusion measures.
In April 1999, since we refused the blood of people who had remained over one month in the United Kingdom since 1980.
But, some years ago, it has been shown out of any doubt that this disease is transmitted through blood.
This episode showed us so that the principle of precaution had been fulfilled. "
In 1999, a more significant HIV detection technique occurred in the market: the tests of nuclear acid that allow directly to detect the presence of the virus and not the anticuerpos against the virus, which are based on the tests used until now.
The tests of nuclear acid allowed to record the period between the time that the person was infected and the time when the first virus could be detected in the blood by our technicals, the specialist explains.
We can reduce this period in a duration lower than one week.
We have so significantly reduced the risk that certain donors are infected without knowing it and that we can not detect them.
These improvements allowed considerablely to decline AIDS by transfusion of blood.
Today, every 12 million uses the risk of receiving blood polluted by HIV.
"This means that 12 million blood products should be distributed before someone is infected by HIV.
Since Hema-Québec divides each year between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products, they will pass over more than 24 years before a case of HIV transmission for a blood product.
I think you can today receive or write blood transfusion to recover health without concern," said the chief of the Hema-Québec direction.
"Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain our products' security.
You never know what patologist could emerge in the system.
In the past year, the Chikungunya virus appeared in the island of the Reunion that, for example, the virus of the Western Nilo, is transmitted by a blood insect.
There should be constantly monitoring ", follows Dr. Decary before it submits that Ema-Québec should also provide sufficient allocation.
" The needs increase because the older population is.
Since more aggressive cancerhygenic treatments, patients often need an injection of rock or plaquets.
The ancient population has also impact on the blood donor network that is at middle term only 3% of Quebequeses admissible to blood donation " .
All persons with good health, 18 years and compliance with the admissibility criteria may, however, give blood every 56 days, or be six times a year.
By mid-term, 14 per cent of the individuals proposing their blood are not accepted because they are paid of AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they travel into a country where the malarian reignes, they will be excluded for a period of one year.
" With this 3 per cent, the logo holds a inventary that covers hospital needs.
The pains are very rare.
But we need to renew members of this network of donors as they are old and can no longer give their blood.
But it is difficult to convince people to give their blood, but especially to retain them and encourage them to be regular donor.
Since the current life is very disappeared, we found rarely the time to pass for a hour to give your blood, "After Francine Decary is disappointed.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Hema-Québec is not only bloody products, but also tears, including cardious injers, cardiac valves, ocular bullets and pills that is almost exclusively used for large burnings.
These teeth are analyzed, transformed and congeled before being stored in Hema-Québec, which also manages the only public bank of the humble cord in Quebec.
The humble cord that was anti-respected as biomedical disorders is full of a rich blood of mother cells that can be used for the treatment of serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We've been held a few weeks ago, the laptop at the bank of our Millennium Millennium showing blood of the humble cordon and is expected to get out more than thousands of these per year.
We should begin to propose it for injurements to the beginning of the next year ", specifically Doctor Decary that describes this cordon’s toma of blood as very popular.
"My moms are depressed that you can't enjoy this " because Hema-Québec has no resources to propose this complex and costful program in all the Quebec hospitals.
Softbol - The Package in Semi-final
The Montreal Impact was qualified for the semi-final semi-final series of the USL first section, thanks to a winning by 3-1 (4-3 in the ends) at the cost of the Seattle Soners, yesterday, during the second and decisive part of the final quarters, in the Saputo Stadium.
The campsite Antonio Ribeiro marked the decisive gol at 90-minute of the game.
After the first time without gol anywhere, the center of the campsite David Testo and Rocco Plancentino created many times of gol.
Roger Levesque was the only one who dismissed Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
We remember that during the first game of the Ida and turning game, the Impatriate had suffered a decline of 2-1 in Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the suburb of Seattle.
The Impatriate will be measured to Vancouver whitecaps in semi-final.
The Thunder lost 3-1 in the backing game on 4-3, but the Whitecaps attained in the semi-finals of 5-4.
The Impact should face the Whitecaps on Friday and next Sunday, but the details of the series will be confirmed today.
In short – Kovalev's victory gol
The three number of the Canadians is ready to undertake the time.
The composed unit of Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the attack at 3-2 of Canada to the free barriers faced the Panthers of Florida, last night in the Bell Centre.
Costitsyn, the first star of the meeting, marked a goll, Plekanec assumed two helps, and Kovalev took a step in this winning, the tricolor room in six preparatory games.
Kovalev gave the victory by marking the only gol.
"I'm still not ready, I'm prevailing the Russian.
"I need another game to feel comfortable."
He tried to play the maximum at the first time, noticed the Guido Carbonneau.
But I think he'd appreciate the end of the game.
I had a beautiful birth."
Charest is occupied from the north
The First Minister does not exclude to enter elections before the end of the year
As soon as the General Council of the Free Party, John Charest was yesterday in Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc (Left), tried to be elected during today's partial election.
Declined the limits of our great north border: " This is the long-term ambition that John Charest presented with visual force in the great lines, in terms of the General Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec, in Levis, yesterday.
After him, during his spectrum, pictures were designed.
Defilled, in three immense screens, espectacular images of hydroectric emblems, miner exploitation, Quebec seen by "Google Maps", maps, etc.
Most means like during the electoral period.
The Prime Minister believes that the elections will be placed in this ocean, even though she saw that their hour was very full.
The "North Plan" is the fourth side of a "vise", which the first Minister intends to have to Quebec, a "new economic space", which includes an agreement on work hand with France, a partnership between Canada and Europe and armonies with Ontario.
Often mentioned in the words of the first Minister recently, the opening of the North - the north territory to the 49th paralel - had never been subject to a presentation.
However, the first minister was limited to explain why the north was “a great pleasure to the potential”, but did not give a term, investment amounts, nor specific priority in future projects.
In particular hydro-electricity, forest, but mostly the smaller sector, which is the growth of the emergent countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructures.
The North contains " nick, cinc, coffee, plate, gold, silver, iron, titany, and also diamond " according to the list of Mr. Charest.
This " Territory twice greater than France " is our house, is in Quebec.
Not only at our house, but it is in us ", stressed, as to show that he requested a half of national funder.
Quebec built many thanks to its relationship with the North, and subrayed: the road towards the gold in Abitibi, Quebequesa engineering, the Bahia James.
"We are our future," added, after having made a theatral suspension to view the immense map behind him.
The northern, 70% of the territory concerned, includes a part of the Labrator which Quebec always revitalized, precised the first minister during the press conference.
" It is a traditional position that all Governments reiterated.
There is a border line in which it does not go to agree since a long time ago and, when the event is present, I reiterate that position of the Government, " said.
Furthermore, " with the climate changes, we must consider our north vision " , explaining the northern passover, which will be opened every year because of the functioning of the glacies.
In this new geopolitical context, the first minister believes that the territory is a debtor.
And the inhabitants of the Territory, the First United Nations and the Inuits?
The first minister said that the Quebec Government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially to young people.
Two former ministers who come from two different parts, Peter Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (early Member of the Ungava party), have already started consultations near a thirty-three of communities.
A intergovernmental interministeral Committee presided by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Bulet (Ontario Transport and Resources) has a major role started some jobs.
The Prime Minister does not exclude an important meeting, " not necessarily a summit " but a meeting on which " will be given a common vision " .
North Development would be done in accordance with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan " will be concerted, ordened and respected for the environment " .
John Charest described this "visio" as one who is continually with the first free ministers who before him.
" As the freedoms before us, we thought in another way to transform the challenges in new times of growth and development."
This was one of the recurring topics from the end of the week, which started the Friday with a great coctel to subtract the 50th anniversary of the arrival of John Lesage to the power of the game.
One of the adopted resolutions proposes to rebuilding the Central Beauharnois in Embalse Adeleard-Godbout.
"De Godbout, which created Hydro Quebec, in Lesage which made the revolution and nationalization of hydroelectricity, in Bourasa, which made the Bahia James our game so supposed for the future," said John Charest.
At the press conference, he called another reference, that conservator, the Roads to the North" of John Diefenbaker, first minister from 1957 to 1963.
To the issue of the hydroectric embalming project in Eastmain1a-Ruper, Mr. Charest stressed that its service-based service was planned by 2012.
"This remains among us, but I prefer to be there," confided his military army, raised a pleasure.
In fact, the first Minister said in April that elections would not be held in 2008 and, unfortunately, not 2009, did not decree the possibility of making a vote in this ocean, what the law allows it.
Notwithstanding, it is full, especially because of a mission of the Federation Council in China and a Quebec-New York Summit.
The General Council of the weekend assigned a platform containing national resolutions, particularly " constitutional aspirations " which had no problems to be accepted: the Liberal Party of Quebec recalls particularly the recognition of the " and specificity of Quebec " in the Constitution.
He also wished Quebec to call for members of the Council of Radio and Canadian Telecommunications and that they have a vessel right to decisions taken in Quebec.
On the side of the opposition, we gather the major lines of the North Plan with sceptics.
The Chief of the Quebec Parti, Pauline Marois, reiterated the North-Early Development Policy that the Landry Government had launched in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, reaching the power in 2003, refused to apply it.
If I had done it, "We would have progressed today" said Mrs. Marois on the side of his candidate in Jean-Talon (related call for today), Françoise Mercure.
The Quebec Democratic Action was to support the adoption of a North Plan by the Government.
"But what you want, is that it is not just a spectrum," said the leader Sebastien Proulx, under the replacement of Mario Dumont, which returns from holidays today.
Letters - Unhonored country
It is Mr. Vic Toews, former Minister of the Justice (Oh irony!) in the Harper garden, which would have been allowed the past summer to say that Luisa Arbour was a "reverence" for Canada.
To dishonor this woman who took an incessant fight for justice and appreciated all our wonder what he says about the relationships of the first minister and of Stephen Harper.
We are opposed to a government that is the only one, among all the western countries, which has not repatriated their nationals who have been secured in the Guantánamo concentration field.
It is a government that doesn't take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was a very young adolescent when the facts that were recruited have happened.
The only government that, despite the fact that Canada has signed the Geneva Convention, refuses his promise and leaves a child-old in human conditions.
The only one who echoes with a false justice to assess the accused.
Remember that UNICEF, International Association and the Canadian lawyers, particularly, support Omar Khadr's repatriation in order to enjoy the benefit of an equitable process in Canada.
It is this government who closes the eyes of torture: it is little important that a young adult should be psychologically destroyed, unfortunately after many years of exaction.
We have not yet taken into account this, but now we have attended an insensitive erosion of our rights, our freedom and our Democracy, this is the word Harper continued to repeat and has no sense.
There is already the time in which no morals exist: we can push, torture, kick a Canadian citizen, as he wants the Chief of Government to now minority (What will happen after 14 October?).
Many of the electors believe that they will find salvation in a party that commends Virtud, the Law and Order: I don't see that this Government has revealed what the reputation and dignity of our country did.
Mr. Toews is caused by this complaint and by nothing else.
Free Opinion - Barrick Gold Dictionary
In its edition of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr. Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President and Director of the Canadian Mines Barrick Gold.
Following an orwelliana logic, Barrick Gold claims that the world's greatest authorization company attempted a process of disappearing six million euros against three authors and a small editorial house to cause a " transparent public debate " .
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, especially in the case of persecution by dishonorance, but the law.
No surprise, this fundamental difference is completely hidden by Mr. Garver.
Why, according to Barrick Gold, the best way of bringing a public debate would be threatening whoever is urged to support an opposite position?
The result of the pleasure has little importance, the authors and the editor of the Black Book Canada must be exempt considerable amounts to prepare their defence and fight, with very unfair weapons, against a lawyers undertaken by the balls almost without the base of the mine.
The tactics, in these disgular fights, often consists of detrimenting the requested to impose a friendly arrangement that will appreciate the opposition in addition to ensuring whoever will be tried to re-examin the issue.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it's before the public opinion that I should have presented its vision of the facts.
In contrast to what it is done in several countries where Barrick Gold works, the discussions in Canada are usually done by change of ideas and not to kidnapping.
It was aware that mine opened its books, officials and established a true debate through the newspapers, media, publications and financing of independent search equipment that could be able to explain the question.
But Barrick Gold seems not to trust the public opinion and reject requests and substantive letters for the Black Canada authors.
Maybe Mr. Garver could explain how to ask a public debate by dealing with the opinions of this?
According to the Vice-President, this word seems to be designed only to the very paid lawyers and not to all Canadians; this represents a very limited view of the concept.
In democracy, delegators also have the right to speak.
What he doesn't understand - or what he doesn't want to understand - Barrick Gold, is that the public who supports the authors and the Black Canada's editors makes it all because he rejects the brutal way of mine.
This public is ready to listen to Barrick and judge it, but having a basis for civilized argument changes, and not on the basis of what many people have been being as a persecution-mordace (as following the " public debate ", Barrick Gold ended to put an appeal on the Black Canada authors intimidating them that no longer use this word).
Besides Mr. Garver's superreal discussion, the Barrick Gold's process is a direct attack against the freedom of university and truth, essential by all democratic societys.
The right to quote confidence sources and to discuss the facts and interpretations that represent the basis of the intellectual work.
If it is impossible to study and discuss subjects that disappear the rich enterprises in a country like Canada, under the penalty of many persecutions, who can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wants a public and transparent debate, I could follow the scientific rules used by the Black Canada authors.
He has a response right.
The university world, which we share, knows for a long time to manage debates and disappearances and solve conflicts.
Barrick Gold's disadvantaged persecution clearly shows that, contrary to what he intends, it has no gain to make a transparent debate.
It is a loss of university world but also for public debate in Canada, and it is time that Governments have place devices that limit this gender of abuse persecutions.
Wall Street rescue operation - Democrates and republics are agreed
The Bush administration and the leaders of the Congress, at the time republics and democrates, finally reached an agreement on the most important economic salvation plan since the Great Depression of the 30-year-old.
The new version of the United States Plan for $700 million, which is intended to strike the financial crisis in Wall Street for months ago, must still be confirmed by both Congress Chambers.
In particular, a better control by the elected implementation of its implementation, of new mechanisms aimed at ensure the reimbursement of the invested public money, of new provisions to contain the number of houses lacking payment, and the right to control payment of payments to the leaders of aid companies.
The American secretariat of the Tesor, Henry Paulson, President of the Chamber of the Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, and the representative republiced at the negotiations table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news after midnight, at the term of a negotiation marathon that held two days.
"We make great progress in view of an agreement that will be effective on the markets," declared the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
"All has been made to cover the economy and the United States to the current crisis in Wall Street," explained the democratic.
"It is the fundamental point: if we don't do this, traumatism, chaos and perturbations on the daily life of the United States will be immense," said the Republic Judd Gregg.
The negotiations were very fast ended in the last hours because they feared the effect that would cause a new fracase in the humor of the investors.
The last hour they had been fixed was the opening of the markets this morning.
The two candidates in the American presidency elections, which were later adhered to the negotiations, have been more favourable for the agreement, without forget to express their detention to be obliged to reach this extremity.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama provided certain provisions to achieve the agreement, particularly that the owners would allow their home and the wage of the leaders of overcoming undertakings by the State.
" When the contributions are requested to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsability of some, there is no need to be satisfied.
But these measures are necessary ", commented in the American TV.
Her adversary, John McCain, who was interromped in another chain to know whether he would vote by the proposed plan, answered that "I would like to see the details, but I hope to vote it."
"The important points I have read [how] is something that we will have to divorce and with which we can adhere.
He said that the option to do nothing is not acceptable."
The plan of 700 million is intended to buy with the money of doubt debts, risk-related activities and inventive from the American financial institutions.
It is now after 14 months of a crisis caused by the steel of an inmobiliary bubble which first brought the dog of the risk credits before extending other common forms of credit title (PCAA) and provocating a liquidation and a delay of banks and financial institutions.
It is a group of elected republics that had changed the first draft agreement, last week.
We believe we have gone out of the stacking since the democrates accepted that certain "toxic" activities of difficult companies are only secured by the government, rather than buyed.
With the aim of linking the expectations for the whole world to the Congress, we also add a provision that if the Government had to take losses for five years with this programme, it could impose new rates that would wish to help him recover money.
The new plan provides the payment of a first part of 250 million to which 100 million may be added if the President is necessary.
The payment of 350 million should be confirmed by another vote by the Congress.
In the case of their aid, Washington will get part in the subsidied enterprises that will be able to divide you in the case of winnings and that it can return to sell when the warming is passed.
The Federal Government will have the possibility of deteriorating the procedures of embargos in relation to homes obtained by immobiliary costs under this plan, and to set limits on reimbursement and metal compensations payed to the leaders of the companies affected by the crisis.
The architectures of the plan would like to see it under the vote of the Chamber of representatives from today and the Senate on the next seat.
Despite all its efforts, it is not yet sure that its plan will be adopted.
Some people continued to protest yesterday against this project, both by the Republics and the democratics.
The Republic of Scott Garrett, member of the Committee on the Finance of the Camera, declared that " with any evidence, Washington would not understand ".
"We have a very serious financial problem.
There are some solutions.
But not that consists of get out of the contributions."
The Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, which is an encouragement of a small group in the Congress, presents the problems in another way, but it comes to the same conclusion.
"What foreign teachers of economy, including three Nobel Premies, wrote us to say: We request the Congress not to be pressed and to consider attentively the way it must be taken ", said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, we had the test of the global nature of the crisis.
After an urgent meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group at 11.2 million euros ($16.3 million).
The intervention of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg Governments was required after the French BNP Pariba bank would have known that he refused to buy its competitor to quiebra since the loss of $2 million (2.9 million) during the crisis of the risk prices in the United States.
Fortis uses 85,000 people and part of the 20 largest European banks and the ten larger securities.
"This is not lost money, she declared yesterday the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Bos.
Instead, we recover a vote right to bank and influence.
It's just something that the adherents and the families now appreciate that the time is incertain."
During this time, on the other side of the Mancha, the British Government seemed to want to nationalize another bank that suffers the financial crisis.
According to the English prenses, the Government would be charged to all payments in the Bradford Bank and Bringley bank and more than 41 million euros (75.5 million) in real estate.
The Spanish Santander bank told her yesterday that it's the one who would buy successors and bank accounts from the British Bank.
Bradford and Bringley would be the second bank after Northern Rock, which the British government should nationalize from the principle of this financial crisis.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a compromised icon
His bright eyes represented their triunfo for so long.
Did the American actor with a magic song have been released from his narcistic side?
Yes and not.
His power, their sensitivity and talent that was evidently also will be disappeared from the record of power that have the true holy monsters.
But what a big backward!
Paul Newman, died on Friday, at 83 years, because of a cancer of pulmony in his kitchen of Connecticut, remains one of the latest icons of the American film of the fast years.
It is less phenomenal than Brando, who seemed much and was considered for a long time as a rival in the kitchen, more careful in his game, certainly more frighter, but also the apostle of the freedom and the extension of the dramatic conventions.
Mixed bloods often make magical children.
He was born in Oio in 1925, German Jewish father and Hungary mother.
Of these European races, one of the magnificent faces of the American dream will be born.
Without me, the last quality mark.
Because it was designed to all an encouraging country of the man's self, the fighter of the Pacific war, struggled in battle, that at the beginning of the 50s he studied the dramatic art in Yale, then freaked the Actor's Studio of New York before triunfar in the theatre, in the television and soon in the film.
This man who missed civil rights was also the automobile pilot that was classified in the second position at 24 hours of Le Mans in 1979, doubled by a sex symbol, although a couple of models formed since 1958 with the Joanne Woodward actrix.
They also disappear with him the secret sides of this secret star, discrete and binding, warrant the scchands of the world of the spectacle that we don't know very well.
It's a honorable man, in the noble sense of the word.
Paul Newman’s death proved the testing of the films this week end, while their great roles are deployed in the black screen of the memories.
More than a half-eighth of the seventh American art in perpetual movement is unfilled through it.
Many rememberings return to memory as the cow-boy with love of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejected his sensual wife (with Elizabeth Taylor) in La Gate on the adapted ticket of Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More closer to us (1990), we call on Mr Bridge's sensible feelings, detrimentated by a marriage that does not fulfil all its promises.
Others like Paul Newman have passed in the movie history.
This Rocky Grazian box, crime, incontinent, violent, inulvidable in Somebody Up There Likes Up Me (Makered by hate), from Robert Wise, a role designed to James Dean, repeated after his death, which actually launched Newman in 1956.
This sympathy managed in the sting film The Sting (El Golpe), Oscar the best film in 1973.
The Hustler de Robert Rosen (1961) player will repeat the person in The Color of Money of Martin Scorsese, which valuated his only Oscar between nine nominations in 1987.
This face that changed with the years was he.
He was still.
Times change during their road.
The young people know it mostly thanks to Slap Shot of George Roy Hill (1977), in Reggie Dunlop, a bucket team of little ortodoxic glass.
His fans returned in 1994 to The Hudsucker of the Coen brothers.
With a last role of the Irish Mafia Mafia in Road to Perdition of Sam Mendes in 2003, the riz was ridded.
In contrast to several loans from the movie who have left quite soon the chariot, Newman remained a lot in the movie, declared Hollywood, gold, fast and consents.
The French cinema Bertran Tavernier considered it, with humor, " as a challenge that lives in " subplaying " and judges its supported benefits too.
The Profession was not always easy for the beautiful Paul Newman that the papers came for a long time without doing anything.
Yet, however, it was less often interpreted the role of youth galan than marginal: neutrals, alcoholics, crowds or dissobedients, whose races reflected rebels.
As an executive, Newman revealed its real public sensitiveness not very known.
His Raquel movie film, Raquel, in 1968 (as the picture of the Canadian Margaret Laurence), with his wife Joanne Woodward in the main role, was described a female record of melancolia.
He who lost his son Scott because of overdosis gave him his film Harry and Son in 1984, work of painting and tristeness.
"The numbers of households who were dismissed yesterday for Newman, his grand friend and old arms partner Robert Redford (we were working together in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) said, very excited: "My life and my country were better thanks to their existence."
Generity, love of existence are important races of the false actor.
On the other side of his leadership road, a great military for civil rights, ecology, independent film, a contestant against the expenditures of Hollywood.
We've seen a lot of his face to reign on the wine salsa bottles, the salses, the galletes and other foods, judged this method as a bad wheat method, even though it started as a gag.
The results of these sales were given to their Children's Foundation in difficulty.
Newman, rather than satisfying your mess, will be compromised to the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that contained these sentences: "Your father had always been incredible thanks for his good star.
It was a privilege to be there."
And a privilege for us has followed the road of an American artist so luxury and generous.
It's a citizen model.
What were they produced in the Zuhelp & amp; factory factory?
Successfully, on 8 October, the criminal process will be started against János Zuech and its complaints.
Political and its complaints are accurated to commit significant damage against trade, continually and organized, in addition to other crimes, including the falsification of documents.
According to the Fiscality, they used for own purposes the funds obtained in public concerts by justifying the fulfilment of the tasks with false facts.
The public funds and the meetings, in its total, were about 65 million HUF, were partly operated in the theatre of the Fiatal Baloldal Organization and partly in the box of individuals.
The method, given by the investigators also, was to justify the amount of funds obtained in public concourses with false factors from which there was no real implementation, the various associations never fulfilled their assumptions.
According to the accusation, most of the factors were false.
For this, the workshops in the market of the Józsefvar Distrit and the circular salts were manufactured in the city of Kiskunhalas.
And the question that on behalf of the company the falsified factor was decided, among others, by the Supreme Region of Balatón, János Zuech sent to Istan Lados.
This last confessed that for this purpose he should choose hostels and restaurants.
He requested its consumers and they served a model to conceal the factions made among others in the contexts of the Ministry of Juvenile and Deportal Affairs, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour, as well as the Capital Agency.
These features were signed by most of the Lads and their compound András ◆ri, who, according to our information, better wrote the reports necessary to obtain public subsidies.
During one of his "study winters" Lados elected a bracelet.
According to the two factors issued by Zuq and its compliances in 2003, this gastronomic center provided the food for a nine people's Society Foundation Pont Egyptesület.
However, according to the center manager, so many people can't be at once in that place.
Likewise, the factory sent in the summer 2002 for Jobb Jövërt Foundation - later called Egypt to Harmadik Evezредrt - was full of formal and contextual errors.
Because a hostel of Badacsonytomaj's locality had only three rooms and more than ten people couldn't stay there in one night, however, in the factory they were hundred and thirty people.
But the factory factory of great fantasy also exhibited when they mentioned the gastronomic center Pigal Kft. Because in the tendure of books of the same - according to the information given to the Fiscality - they had no documents named Jobb Jövërt and Hopá.
Gyzć Farcas, the manager of that company, informed hvg.hu that when he was cited by the fiscality and showed the facts, he knew it was a false document.
"In the seal the name of our company and NIF appeared wrong instead."
She said: Besides formal problems, he did not agree that there were hundreds of persons, because they have so only once rooms in which there were no such people.
Furthermore, the factory was also included food, while the restaurant was not working.
The factory producers were not informed nor that the Agency of travels selected in Budapest was exclusively organized to the outside, so that in the factory of payment in effect, they indicated as a service for a travel in Hungary, which was also involved in the practice of exemptions of the Agency.
In addition, as it was known during the investigation, the IVA also included in the document, although the travels out of the European Union territory were exempt of taxes.
Among other things the measure of IVA was also wrong in the four documents issued by the Hotel Revlotp Kft. for the funding Jobb Jövért, since the services of the company are not loaded with a 25 but only 15 percent of IVA, and also the hotel employees were only extended to machines, however, the factory was manual.
Furthermore, the "experts" did other errors, such as in the case of a company in which they put on the facture as an activity carried out by road to which - it was recognized during the investigations of the fiscality - does not perform the company based as investment consultor.
Likely by formal differences - inadequate format of the factory, false seal- it is known that the factors issued for Egypt to Harmadik Evezредt Alapitvány, for XXI. Culturalis Egyptesület and For ustos Pont.
Like Ravenna Bt. or the Confeed Deport campaign, whose representatives refused to have sent these factors.
The falsifiers did not take attention to the fact that when the Fiatal Városért Egypt Group had come there (2001) the HIB Kft. of Nyhiregyháza was in the liquidation process, therefore the liabilities process, according to our information, had not been sent to this document.
The facts were expired awarely.
Another group of false factors producers are represented by those who were aware of that they should be exposed by fair factors.
The Esély Budapestert Alapítvány, at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Sijú Szozialisták, expired a factory of about four million HUF in the name of the Egyptian Fundation to Harmadik Evezredért.
The manager of Collab Kft. - According to the accusation - agreed him one of the accused, Ludovic Györfi, to send a fairness factions.
Likewise, the Biogate Kft., currently under liquidation process, provided by a approximated value of five million HUF to the funding Jobb Jövërt Alapitvwany, the Atlasz Egyptesület Association and the Vörösfeny月 Egyptiansület, without real economic activity.
There were no capital movements nor, as they then deployed the prepared factors but forgot to be held in their documents to this entity.
The following group of false factors producers include those who have some connection with the accused.
For example, Iván Kubatov was the requester of the Ukrainian Delta Trio SL Defence officer in Budapest, which was occupied with the trade of fuel and vehicles.
In the months of October, November and December 2005, the company expired numerous factories for an approximate value of 18 million HUF in the months of October, and December.
According to the research data, these factors were bought by the Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas, which is under liquidation process since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a ruin to whom Iván Kubatov had also deployed the documents related to the company between 2002 and 2005.
We have information that Kubatov recognized during the investigation which expired on behalf of the factory company for Atlasz, Hopá and Egypt to Harmadik Evezredert Alapitvány by the amount itself.
The Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt. were funded by Russian albazins at the express request of Iván Kubatov.
However, none of the companies actually worked because of the accused - to which they had not received work.
But he made prove from these companies, as at the request of its compliance lawyer Zsolt Szente, who prepared the registration documents of the company, expired factors on behalf of the companies for sub-related organizations: for Atlasz and Y-Generati.
Kubatov on behalf of the Cash Investment, Delivery Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade gave 15 factors to different entities by a value of 14.2 million HUF.
It was considered that Kubatov had received IVA and 10 per cent of the amount of factors.
This man also made the company in SZ-Beri command to expire physical factories used in the Concursion of Wets Pont.
The Y-Generator and Szövetség at Modern Magyarországent presented a concert in January 2006 to Tancsics Mihály Alapitvány (TMA), public utility entity of the Socialist Party.
The consequence provided 500 thousand HUF respectively, but they did not use the money for the objectives of the concurrent.
In order to not be discovered, five factors received from the Team Kft Works were presented to the TMA.
These were the factors found during the recording of the displace that Arpad Kemecsei had been at the seat of the Ministry of Education.
Part of the accused will probably refer to the judgment - as they did in the Fiscale - the course of falseization of the factors.
The most interesting may be the confidence of the main accused János Zuschlag, if it decides to dismiss everything.
Because their confidences have not been very detailed and although he reiterally promised to talk about everything, this has not done it until now.
The question is: what's interesting is it? For perhaps to change the majority of the money - 50 million HUF - the socialists have reached a agreement with him so that Zusi would assume all the responsibilities.
Who, on the other hand, for these days, could be offered, because in order to align his carrier conditions, he requested home arrest, but he was reiterately rejected.
While the many authors of very high value crimes, which have never returned the money, are free or at least able to wait in their own homes, he has no opportunity for this.
Psychology: Why do we cost more money?
The participants of the subats are provisions to pay more money and overvalue the product.
The New York University Neurologs and Economys discovered the neurological - economic bases of this conscious and apparently irrational behaviour.
According to the study shown in the Science magazine, people do not want to lose in competences such as eBay subtitles, therefore they prefer to pay an excellent price.
Scientists tried to establish the neurological scene of this " game" through experimental subastics.
One of the volunteers ' groups played lottery, the other participated in a subast, while being considered through the functional magnetic resonance system (FMRI) the active areas of the brain of participating people in the experiment.
In both games they could gain money, but during the subats, where there is a fundamental element to put more than the other, when we lose the game has been intensified the function of the complex called stereoted placed under the cerebral corte.
This area of the brain, notably of many other functions, plays a role in the "prior auto" mechanism of the nervous system.
According to scientists, an increase in approximation is explained as a prevention to not cause intense reaction of the stage.
For the basis of their theory, the economicists of the scientific group also conducted a financial monitoring study.
In this experiment, three groups faced a person in different circumstances.
The control group was simply communicated to the real value of the product concerned, and its integrators were addressed.
Another group was promised that, if they gained, more than 15 dollars would be received.
However, the third group had received $15 before the sub-stake, but in the case of losing the subsistents of the group would also lose that money.
Thus, the only difference between the two groups was that for one triumph and for the other the fracase was resumed.
However, by checking the neurologs hypothesis, the members of the group played "considered fracaso" were ready to put more than the members of the control group and the "winder" group.
"These results cannot be exempt from any existing economic theory previously.
For these until now explained the phenomenon of the subastics only with the joy of winning and the prevention of risks.
Only visual neurological methods helped solve this contradiction between the two theories, so that we now arrive to a third explain"- established Andrew Schotter, professor of the economy capacity of the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When should you go to the doctor?
In the world, some 15 million people are paid by hepatitis B or C chronic, and in Hungary chronic disease is considered one of the main causes of death.
The number of containers in this country is calculated in hundred thousand, but only seven thousand receive treatment because many patients do not know that they are contained.
The name of hepatitis is the common name of various hydrogen diseases caused by virus.
The symptoms seem to be a lot; they are characteristics the infection of hydrogen and hyctry, but their pyrogen agents and diseases are very different.
The virus of hepatitis dependent on the patogen agent are distributed by two main forms: hepatitis A and E by food path (e.g. water or food), hepatitis B, C, D and other virus with blood and corporal humors (eperma, vagina humor, salt).
It is recommendable to protect travelers through vacuum against virus A and B, against the C no vaccines.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two or three weeks after consuming infected food, is managed through a bad general state, weakness, abdominal pain and nause.
After this, it appears in the hair and in the white of the eyes, the excrement stands clear, the dark colour earning and healing can continue even two - three weeks.
A million people die in the world in cancer and hepatic cirrhosis occurred by hepatitis B, the most serious forms of this disease.
The main reason of this is that according to the calculations, only one of each ten contained pharmacological treatment receives.
Hepatitis C may also have very serious consequences: without treatment can produce hepatic cirrosis and even cancer.
Most containers do not know that it is sick because this pychological agent destroys the hydrate cells, and often the first symptoms are only 20-30 years later.
So it is very important to recognize premature, systemic medical control.
It is much more often this disease in three groups: people who had blood transfusion before 1991, drug consumers and tatuajs.
At present there are about 200 million people in the world who pade chronic hepatitis C.
As this disease can be discovered with a laboratory control also, it regrets the penalty to consult the family's doctor when experimenting some unknown symptom.
The disease has cure if you're discovered, it's possible to finish the virus of the body, so it can be removed and prevent cancer.
On 30 September is the World Year of Hepatitis, which was first organized by representatives of hospitals for the first time in 2004.
Its goal is to call attention to the causes of chronic infections of the virus and the importance of their pre-matural recognition.
Do you doubt less than those who believe in God?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith has a quiet effect that also alived the death of the catholicism.
The scientists of the University of Oxford made a interesting experiment: analyzed that religious credibility in how human pain affected – informed the British Telegraph period.
In the context of this individual experiment, 12 Catholic believers were electrically applied, and the same amount of athletes, while all were watching a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to exclude most of their pain.
Thanks to the explosive technology of the human brain, it was possible to verify that Catholic believers were able to enable that part of their brain that is responsible for the regulation of pain.
This experiment is the first of the series of research in which the university’s various departments also participate in scientific, philosophys and theologists.
The analysis occurred in the following way; set a chisp instrument on the left hand of the patient, which applied the electric chock.
Researchers requested the experts of the experiment to fix their view in two paintings; the Virgin Mary, the work of Sassoferato of the 17th century and the Lady of Leonardo da Vinci of the 15th century.
The investigators had hope that the spectacle of the Virgin Mary would cause a certain religious sense among the faithful, as they chose Leonard's oil because he was not too different than another, and they thought that he had an effect to quiet.
The patients were average hours in a MRI scanser, received in that period 20 electric chokers in four subsequent parts, while they observed religious or other.
Catholics claimed that when watching the Virgin Mary, they felt in "safeness" as people "protected," "we were quiet and in their heart reigned peace."
In view of the religious theme table, a 12 percent was less than when they looked at Leonard’s work.
The Miguel Faria psychologist who also participated in the experiment, thinks that with any likely affecting images can be obtained a similar effect with the athos also, only needs to find the appropriate image.
"We should find a person who feels very positive, like a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The English obispo Tom Wright celebrated the result of the research.
"The exercise of faith should and in many cases of truth change our personality," added Wright.
After these former results, there is only a questioning: what effect would be for the regulation of pain if the faithful Madonna of Leonardo or another painter?
Does the vision of a Virgin Mary high quality would still have better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
In his tenth anniversary, Google can say: You can be found both in the pool of people, as in the sky above his head; you know where their holidays were passed, what doctors visit and what it's interesting them.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the executives of the company, this is not yet enough.
On the other hand, the sceptics that do a parliament with the orwelian vision do not see the existence of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt just a few years ago declared the Financial Journal Times that Google's main objective is to gather the most possible personal data on their users, and this is necessary to meet the original objectives of Google funders: "We meet all the information in the world!".
According to the leader of Google, the company even after ten years of work that renewed to the World is still at the initial phase of the starting of the power to handle all information.
On the question which is going to happen within five years Shamidt answered so: I want Google to answer questions like "What would I do tomorrow?" or "What would be the work that would be better to me?" - Yet, the software can't respond to questions apparently so simple while there are no sufficient information from users.
Not all the internal sites are aware of that during their navigation on the network the keywords, the IP addresses and the pages have passed in the end of the search.
Thanks for the Personalized Search that deployed two years ago, users can store their own browser history, can again consult what they were looking before, what they opened and thanks to this historical search will generate much more personalized - in this same logic will be based on the Recommendations in which the system will provide us products and services on the basis of the previous and stored settings.
What will happen if you use my data against myself if you collect information about my activities? - Ask those users who are concerned with Google's information monopolio.
In most of the cases the potential represented by the company is what can be fearful and not remediation, fear of punishment, anxiety for freedom or rebellion against power.
However, it is a fact already confirmed that they are not only keeping, but also in legal cases, all the expressions searched, in these cases there is nothing to protect the personal rights of the internal.
The most debated example of the last time was probably the action coordinated against Brazilian petrols, when Google gave it to the Brazilian government the information on your website, called Orkut, to identify the petrols.
Instead, the internal person ' s rights were concerned, in May, when the company together with the EFF, an organization for the defence of electronic rights had demonstrated outcome to the court in its license with the FBI: according to the sentence, it cannot be granted to Google, by any of the points of the constitution to provide any type of information requested by the FBI secret.
(In the same time, the Federal Government has reached a pretext to strengthen the Children's Protection Law adopted years ago, nearly 500,000 Web addresses and a thousand searched phrases, but without obtaining the search lists of individual users, nor the complete lists of web pages and key words of the last two months.)
So it is quite contrary on Google: critical those who fear to provide their personal data because they think that their intimity is threatened, their private life when starting to use Google's services, and they are rebelled against it as against the multinationals of conservative image companies.
While soon, the north American culture and its follow-up enthusiasts, internal and users of other countries, come in them the future generation, the "saving of warranty", not so to its rival, Microsoft, catalogued by its Windows as the conquistador of the world, for many of which both enjoy the same goal.
This may happen because Google is contrary to Microsoft, does not ask users any identification code, nor money for its applications, the code is open and the free software package, constantly updated and seems younger, more collaborative than the practice of the official software gigant.
But it may also be because geeks are precisely seen the very problemtic relationship between human rights and the Internet which has been just one of the most key words mentioned in the last years: Web 2.0.
The Web 2.0 is collaborating, leaving intentional wheels behind us and using the available communication channels, and while the measures of these individually, the existence remains the same: show us yourself.
A normal youth can have a profile in many collective pages from Facebook to Xanga, and you can even join them with other services, such as Twitter or last.fm that offers the list of your music coasts, then you can include them in a monitor system such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also have a blog that automatically appears the most recent photo galleries that are stored in the Flickr or Picasa.
We can know many cases of those who are disappointed that, for example, the girl, seeing the flow of photographs from the next morning of the common friends, we learned with who previous night has passed his collapsed friend or can rescue to the employer of a company because this describes its sincere view in his blog on the direction of the company: one thing is safe, the definition of the private life was completely revalued.
The life "on line" of a person is what she shows himself - this is the definition that is hidden behind the conduct of the youth of our days.
And whoever wants to hide something, or at least desires to remove Google monopolio, you can do it (empty by the Scroole that uses the Google search system, but don't leave pits).
There are many people who don't want to register on the collective pages to avoid you can find them, but they can be replaced "on line" applications of Google, from the text editing software to the image applications and reading news with alternative versions that are not connected with great servers or prepared the most perfect profile on us.
The public view hopes almost openly the day Google shows his true face.
The company with its current value of $156 million is more than IBM (140 million), Intel (124 million) or Coca-Cola (110 million), AdWords/AdSense is threatening the income of public agencies, while services that are always more rapidly introduced cause serious pains not only for Microsoft, but also for many other software developers.
The critical observers, however, will also find alarming contradictions: for example, the higher direction rejected the protest of employees after duplicating the price of the child guard of the company, considered the unlimited number of foods of employees, but all this is nothing in comparison with the fact that Google moved before the Chinese Government's pressure and the company according to the agreement to all information that violate the good moral and interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the internal regulations of the company said that they will not announce any new service, but only when it was ready to function, that if it is sure that the pre-visual problems of the next months and years can reverse to the World: while some believe that the outdoor and book file and reviews of Google will receive such sizes that the company will soon be marked by the Supreme Court of the United States, other fears of their health, because in it we can create our complete health profile, with previous analysis, with our doctors and our problems.
And the fact that Google is going to create a genetic database, you can provide a good primary material for the writers of fiction science works, the Scroogled, the newspaper of the popular of Cory Doctorow, described orweliana to the future, in which only a man of Google data can be described goodly.

On the financial crisis from the point of view of the European pressure
The main European journals in their comments of the marges dedicated to the most deep international financial crisis are talking about a "see 11 September".
The global financial catastrophe should be to the North American President - think the Republic of Rome - the President has not even been able to achieve the support of its own party for the draft law, whose objective is to make it solution to this desperate situation...
Instead of a new "Pearl Habor", who speaked the multi-Multiple Warren Buffett, is more correctly talking about a "see 11 September".
According to a part of the Madrilean press, Washington is the expiatory chief.
In view of the world, the mistake of the United States political direction was that brought into the global economy to the border of the abismo.
It is always growing in the danger of the demobilization of the North American monetary system and then it will take effect in the whole world.
Although Bush's plan was not perfect, after the Congress vote, the danger that Washington does not provide political instrument to address crisis.
The world economy is sustained in the air - just when one of the greatest transformations of the capitalism history is carried out.
You can't make an case abuse this threat - touch the Ginebra's day shower.
Some states today can still be delivered to the tangible financial institutions, able to save them from the safeguard with the money of contributions.
But if the masters are still demounted by the bank, then there will be no longer enough or new funds, nor new improvised.
A long-term needs to leave the European Union Member States on one side their national egoism and focus on the control of fragmented financial markets.
The financial institutions in crisis have received just more than 100 million euros - remembering the winners The Standard, adding that they are always more real about the concerns that, as the North Americans did, also European contributions must pay a lot of money to solve the crisis.
The EU has not since now seriously occupied the crises that happens as an old container's sponsor.
The "salvators" will not immediately present hundreds of euros, but it would be good if they define: What cases are justified to use the funds of the contributions to avoid a worse?
The intelligent car follows the flight of the avenger
What would be the best way to develop technologies in order to avoid collections, if not the follow-up of the sensors of existing obstacles in nature?
For example, one of the loosers.
In a surprise project presented in the Japan’s CEATEC, the deputyers gave the point of starting for Nissan engineers to design the next generation of collections prevention systems.
Nissan, in cooperation with the University of Tokyo, designed the BR23C BR23C-amitator of the nature system, which gave him the characteristics of the ancients, with the final goal of creating a system that can eradicate all collections.
During the flight each browser creates its own special space that actually seems much to our security protection chapter - explained in the Kazuhhiro Doi exhibition, RP technology director and development and research.
The eye of the borrowers who are capable of seeing in all directions at an angle above 300 degrees.
In order to copy the function of the composed eyes, engineers used the measurement system by Laser rays.
This identifies the obstacles before the BR23C within a distance of 2 metres, in an angle of 180 degrees, calculates its distance and sends a sign to the micro processor that is immediately transformed into a manager to avoid the colocy.
In a fraction of seconds the obstacle is identified, then the robot of the vehicle by following the movements of the browser, amending the direction in the necessary measure.
Apart from any existing system currently present, this manager is totally instinctive.
"If it wasn't so, the car robot could not react with enough fast as to remove the obstacles" - explains Toshiyuki Andoh, head of the Mobility Laboratory and the project of the vehicle robot.
It should be immediately and instinctly reaction, as this technology is the most vulnerable internal area of the security chapter, in a scope within which it is currently considered inevitable any type of collections.
All the process must reflect what a borrower does to shot other borrowers.
This process should be done in an open and close the eyes.
However, on the difference of the disorders, the movement cannot be moved up, down or diagonal, but only can be bidimensional and exclusively in the direction of the roads.
So, instead of the infinite opportunities that exist for the borrowers to cut other owners, they only used as an opportunity for the car robot the rotation movement and the speed.
The BR23C uses lighter-polymic battery that are easier and is greater than its energy density, which means that they have a longer life expectation than litio-on.
According to Andoh, the important reaction is instinctive and intelligent reaction and not the data processing capacity, nor less than the storage.
This device in each second should only process some input signs and reaction according to the case.
It is not necessary to save these data or to react with an instinctive logic based on the data of the previous managers, so that only uses some tens of memory kilobytes.
You don't need gigabytes or megabytes.
This is the first step to develop technology to immediately disappear the obstacles, which, according to Nissan calculations, may be included within ten years in the series of models.
Another possibility for its application is to integrate the unit in the GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to your destination by remove the existing obstacles on your way.
You've already got this kid's name.
The written version of the financial reimbursement package has been prepared for $700 million, which will be applied in several phases with the aim of buying the bad bank credits.
At the first stage the half of the money will be exempt.
According to the eastern cost hour during the new consultations that continued until the middle of Saturday, the Congress leaders reached an agreement on the financial reimbursement package of $700 million in total, after a number of days of discussion - reported the Reuters.
We have achieved an important progress - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic President of the North American Congress, stated that it is not only to formify the agreement in a document.
The commitment on the package was supported by both candidates to the Presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain.
Henry Paulson, the Minister of Finance, speaking on the result of the commitment, confirmed: This programme will work and will be effective but other measures are needed. According to Pelosi, it is not trying to save the Wall Street but to return to the economy.
The written version of the package was published before the opening of the Asian markets, i.e. Sunday before the 8 of the night, according to Washington's hour (or before the two of the moon's madrugation, according to Central Europe), without making a spectcular salt on the bottles.
On the draft law called emergency law for economic stability in 2008, the first month will vote the North American Congress and then the Senate.
President George W. Bush consulted the Sabbath night with Pelosi and then the White House also held the news on the agreement.
We are satisfied with progress achieved during the night and we highly appreciate both parties' efforts to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy - said Tony Frato, the Port of the White House.
The programme is different from the original proposal of Bush's administration to pay all $700 million to buy a bad quality credit credit values.
Now only half of the $700 million can be paid, using $250 million immediately after the Congress vote, probably on the month of this sum, the Ministry of Finance will buy a title of credit values, bad qualification and the destination of other $100 million depends on the decision of the President.
This programme will be controlled by a special body in which will also participate the President of the Federal Reserve.
The other half of the $700 million may be paid after a new decision of the Congress.
According to the law, the Ministry of Finance may apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy bad credits, hypothetics and titles of credit values, including other "winnosous" credits.
The purchase may be made in sub-sized or directly - informed the competent persons of the ministry.
The law allows the companies concerned to participate in a programme of insurance where the financing card guarantees the concerned elements, which pay the amount for pre-visual damage.
Henry Paulson stated that the law is ensuring the necessary financial means, that even 700 million dollars may be able to meet the urgent needs of the North American financial system, to carry out the purchase of evil financial means, security or prevention of risks that could cause the democration of some large financial institutions.
We do all the necessary thing to be ready to introduce the law in order to sign it, he added.
Instead, the heads of the banks who are in afar and wait for the State's assistance may counter to the official limitation of their compensations, which the North American argu just calls for gold.
Similarly in certain cases, payments will be limited, also dependent on the form of aid of the Ministry of Finance.
The limitation means that if the ministry buys in the framework of a sub-stake, an extra tax for gold pencils shall be imposed, unless the fresh bank head is judged.
When buying the bad credits directly, the Government will act aggressively in order to ensure that the compensations of the chiefs are not exacerbated.
In addition to the previous, there will be no change of existing gold paracaide contracts, but restrictions are only related to the new contracts to stimulate the participation in the programme as well.
This is the first case in the North American story that will be legally limited to the income of the Directors - commented this measure by the Democratic Barney Frank, President of the Congress Committee, responsible for financial services.
The State will also have the right to acquire actions of the banks participating in the programme, so the risk of contributions will be reduced, since finally they can also obtain benefits with the transaction in which the economy is recovered and the bank is with it.
According to the draft law in the next five years, the President must submit to the Congress a proposal on how to reduce contributions to the loss of the financial sector.
Of course, there were two sides who expressed their reservations concerning the project.
This is not what the north American citizens have recommended, i.e. they are not protecting the dollars of the contributions - declared the republic congressist of California, Darrell Issa.
His Democratic colleague of Ohio, Mary Captur confirmed: the measures urged it the same that are responsible for the democracy of the Wall Street.

German speaking area press period
The right group is intact, only that within the own group the most conscious electors have become - confirms the Der Spiegel of the CSU's electoral weakness in Baviera.
Haider and its followers are ready to rule in Austria to prevent a red coalition.
The speed (spiegel.de)
In the Electronic edition of the German magazine, Franz Walter, in its article entitled "The Baviera Revolution devotes his fathers" analyzes the reasons of the CSU deteriorated dramatic dramatics.
According to the recognised politólogus, the CSU erosion was started a lot before the triste dog Beckstein-Huber would have ceased his charge.
The socialists for several decades would have developed Baviera - and now these modern citizens are those who give you the back.
The change of one was at the same time is a problem of all Christian democracy, also of Angela Merkel.
The fracase was not totally surprised for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process prevailing for almost ten years: he was deceived insufficient hegemony from a state game.
10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU obtained a 47.7 percent, first time under 50 percent since the 50s .
This was resumed three years ago, in the Federal Day elections of 2005, that is still during the mentioned period of Stoiber.
This is the consequent modernization of the CSU in the devouring province of its own suppliers .
The sociologists have been pronounced this, but in the rhythm they have been many mistaken. However, seculating, the results of the Northern Germans and destination in the developed Baviera regions have had their negative consequences on the faithfulness of the CSU elector.
Modernization also increases the possibilities, and it also has political consequences.
The right group is intact, only that within the own group the most conscious, more critical and more heavy electors have become.
It is surprised that in the past few weeks the conventional groups of citizens were those who were disappeared over the CSU; self-names, small industrials, which have bachillerate and diplomats.
Thus, less than 40 per cent of CSU supported.
The press (depresse.com)
The Vienna Conservatory Journal: "Who with whom? In its article entitled "The Presidents of the parties are very reserved on coalition issues" - is concerned with the confusion of the internal policy after the australic elections.
The SPU wants to negotiate with the EVP.
The EVP provides that the SPE is income in its internal matters.
The BZOU is open in all directions to negotiate, the greens in change are still not wishing to make coalition consultations.
The elections have already been held, and now all rounds towards coalition; in the debate held in the public television, the leaders of the parties have just left to see something from their barages.
Werner Faymann, President of the SPU, confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the EVP.
The SPU wants to demonstrate that cooperation between both parties is possible - this already exists in some provinces and social partnerships.
Fayman left the question that if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current President of the EVP, in the vicecancler post.
He confirmed that in any case they had disappeared Schüssel-Molter's war.
This political tendency cannot be followed.
Molterer reacted carefully to the red offers.
He certainly said that cooperation will not be completed if Faymann is trying to take place in EVP's internal matters.
It is still open in the party if they choose the opposition or enter into the coalition, these issues must be discussed, unfortunately, within the EVP own.
The President of the BZE, Jordg Haider, was open in all the addresses.
"To prevent the red-negra coalition, we are willing to assess the government's responsibility," said Haider.
Jároka: We must break the vibrant round of poverty and segregation
Today, the European Summit for Opportunities Reality has been initiated in Paris, his appreciation is France that this year is also President of turning the European Union.
Livia Járkoka, deputy of the European Popular Party by the Fidesz, in his message directed to the full, as one of the chief speakers of this professional meeting, called the attention of the segregation in education, because it is one of the most serious violations of the Guyana's children and also the greatest obstacle to the prevalence of their interests.
This high-level conference was inaugurated - on behalf of the French Presidency - by Xavier Bertran, French Minister of Employment and Social Affairs and by Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equality of opportunities.
They attended the representatives of the Governments, European Social Partners and representatives of the most important European organizations for social rights protection.
Járkoka, according to the presuppose of the Fidesz Deputy Group in the European Parliament, warned that, in addition to discrimination in employment, the Guinea remained out of the labour market first by its underlying level of school.
"The majority of young citizens have not completed the average education and because of the bad quality of basic education, so only an insignificant part can get a university diploma."
It also stressed that education, as fundamental human rights, has a determinant role in the prevalence of the other human rights also.
Investment in Geneva's teaching to a early age can strengthen the economy of the European Union Member States.
According to the euro-deputed, these issues are widely needed to agree between the citizens and the non-Giban.
Since early the school begins a guinean student, there will be more opportunities to become a active member of the labour market; through taxes for income and consumer, they will also contribute to the national budget.
"As the citizens of the European Union, as a citizens of the European Union, must ensure their right to quality education and to ensure the abolition of secret and low-level education," said Livia Járkoka.
According to the Eurodisputed, the objective and active unit of the European Union is required to immediately accelerate school disorder processes, so it is crucial to the correct compliance of existing and planned anti-discriminatory directives.
"There must break the vibrant round of poverty, segregation and unemployment, the possibility of guaranteeing democratic space to contribute to the future of Europe as a citizen of full rights."
The objective of the European Summit for Equality opportunities organized annually from the Brussels meeting held in the sign of the European Year of Equal Opportunities, is to ensure a unique forum to promote the elimination of discrimination and equal opportunities at European level and at national level of Member States.
CSU: Thanks for a transitional period
At the end of October, a decision shall be taken on the luck of the Huber-Beckstein fracased.
Despite the serious delay of electoral, heads have not yet been cut off in the CSU's bases, the debate on personal issues has now been made.
Erwin Huber, President of the game and Günther Beckstein, is still on his posts, but you don't know how long the grace will be long.
The luck of the duo, which suffered a electoral catastrophe of 17 percent, shall be decided at the extraordinary congress of the party held in the last week of October.
The integrators of this criticised have left interview: they are not so opened to their posts.
In this regard, they wished to calm the furious members of its parliamentary group and its basic organization, who one day after the "tsunami bávaro" demanded personal consequences because of the loss of absolute majority.
5 years ago - even though under Edmund Stoiber's direction, which was on the top of his road - the social Christian union reached a 60.7 percent, in turn, a year after the warming tested against Stoiber, only 43.4 percent.
The CSU had a "monopolio" in Baviera, 18 percent of the German OJI.
Although in the southern province, it is important for Hungary economy, conservators still predominantly, in the future, must be coalition with someone.
As the first sign of the restructuring of the party, Vice-President Horst Seehofer, Federal Agricultural Minister, one of the possible successors of Huber, also has a position in the reduction of the intelligence group that begins negotiations with the liberal FDP and the Leaders of Right Books on a possible government coalition in Munich.
The stranger of the destination is that in the list of the Book Electors, Gabriel Pauli, whose action against Stoiber was used for the dog Huber-Beckstein slaughter and then cruelly removed from the scenario to the local ambitious political.
The CSU's maximum leaders are now investing all their energy to stabilize Beckstein.
The transition will also receive an active role that Stoiber has been moved to the fund, the former provincial and old president of the CSU qualified on 28 September as the most bitter day of his political route.
The moon Huber made some critical comments to the CDU, in his view, would have paid much more support for the brother party.
Other CSU politicals interpreted the decrease as a warning for CDU and the own Angela Merkel.
Following the Federation elections of September 2009, Merkel cannot be canciller if it is not able to make together the CSU, which played a transcendental role in the success of national elections in 2005.
According to Merkel, at hard penalty he could hide its deception by fracase, CSU losses will not negatively affect the large berlines coalition.
What is naturally relating: it will not be easier to treat the warmed CSU and the crisis of continuing social democrats.
The SPD with its 18.6 percent reached its worst result from 1946 in Baviera.
The opposition of Lukashenko: 110-0
After the elections of Sunday, there will be no deputy or deputy in the Bieloruscan Parliament.
According to Russian observers, this is explained in the welfare and stability guaranteed in the country of Alexander Lukashenko, in the context of the Security and Cooperation Organization in Europe (OSCE), that is more explained with the violations of the law committed during the account of the votes.
The OSCE sent 450 observers from 43 countries did not recognize the electoral result.
While the legislation of the country of 10 million inhabitants, integrated by hundred and ten Deputates, more than one decade has no opposition before the elections of yesterday the unified opposition under the name of the United Nations Democratic Force (ODSZ) was expected that Lukashenko, which fourteen times renewed his mandate after the 2006 elections of dual legitimacy, therefore the change of the Constitution, this time, "permitted" would be the entry of some Members of the opposition in the parliament.
So the ODSZ removed the boicot that originally wanted to do.
On the basis of the opposition expectations was that Bielorrusia, which is always more economicly depending on Russia, which had a credit to moderate natural gas import always more cardly than Russian and which contributed to the sale of Russia of Belarus, owner of the country, wanted to improve their relations with the European Union, which does not allow him to enter in Lukashenko and other high-level political regimes to have an anti-democratic political regime.
It was a detention character when the OSCE, by assessing the electoral campaign, higher focused on positive phenomenon and not on the errors, such as the prohibition of participating in a third of the candidates of the opposition.
However, the primary report of the OSCE's OSCE also criticised the own campaign - in which the candidates of the opposition could not appear in the press, and especially that the opposition could not be present in the account of the votes.
With all this in view of the opposition, an improvement in political climate is being made: the political prisons and Minsk have remained free to a small confront with Moscow, deniing the recognition of the separation of Ossetia of South and Georgia, although Russia, with which Bielorusia is theory, represents a federal State, a month ago that considers the two regions as independent.
- We have given two steps forward and one back, but the most important is that the dialogue between Bielorusia and the European Union has been launched, which has declared our newspaper Alexander Milinkevich.
According to the candidate of the opposition of the 2006 presidency elections, it is desired to keep this situation, although "the regime is afraid to allow the entry of even an imposer in this parliament without weight."
The opposition does not plan to organize protest manifestations when seeing the results, more attempts to reach the electors' message on the need to make economic reforms.
- This clear causes us many problems because we need to print the pressure of opposition in Russia, local authorities make difficult before their distribution, but even so I see that more people support the change between older age too - said Milinkevich, encouraging the Lukashenko regime, which believes that its main result is the creation of social security, they do not consider it appropriate or even the jubilees, which officially are the most subsidiary by the regime.
Since the defence of the country and the growth of the commercial deficit, it is only a matter of time to the decomposition of social security that "such as the silence of cementaries," Milinkevich said.
The Russian observers against the opposition policy qualified democratics to elections.
Serguei Lebedev, head of the mission of the Community of Independent States, declared the Russian News Agency Ria Novoti: "The people do not believe in words but in facts," so the lack of opposition is nothing else than the testimony of the maturity of the Bielorusian electors.
Brunetta: "To now it is disappeared before starting to work"
It has never occurred in the History of the Chigi Palacio History that have made automatically doors to control the entry and exit of the staff.
But since this day he starts with this measure against which he has set and then goes to the bar to take a coffee in work hour.
This news has been submitted today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta and by the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Masi.
"Automatically doors- says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services" specifics the Minister.
"As a new time of responsibility and transparency is now opened.
This is Reformism," again Brunett subrade.
With Palacio Chigi, the installation is completed in all the Council Presidency's buildings.
For Masi "the selection of the automatic doors is also important from the symbolic point of view."
No resistence was found by employees, ensures the Secretary-General: "There was a change shared by the workers and the cooperation of the same persons has been made. "
Finally, I don't disappear in work time; no longer coffee and medialunes.
Brunetta's Word, which suggests, dreaming, " a good captain at 7:00 of the morning is a holy hand."
During a convention in the High School of Public Administration
by Rome, the minister states that "in three months the absences for public employees have been reduced by 50 per cent, which means 60 thousand more to work in one year."
And adds that it is necessary to make the Public Administration more effective
Italian, "the dynamics which are salarial – explain the ministry – in the last 8-10 years have been doubles with regard to the private sector and well above the inflation rate."
For millions of public employees now have been assembled to address the rules of the Brunetta Decree by addressing the request supported by the Codacons.
"The minister of the Public Function shows the numbers, the smallest austensis of work for causes of disease – describes the consumer association – the people of the 'heavy workers' is constantly increased .
In fact, millions in Italy are employees of the correct and productive public administration who have been assembled to declare war against the illegal standards of the decree."
In particular, there is a response to the exclusion of economic treatments added by diseases caused by service; the extension of the timelines in which medical control visits of the hospital employee and other aspects contained in the new provisions made by the Minister.
Work incidents, Napolitan: " crucial prevention"
Every day, in Italy, 2 500 accidents are examined, 3 persons die and 27 are permanently invalid.
For 2007, Inail data actually confirm that white deaths have been approximately 1.200.
Ciphers that witness the gravity of a phenomenon that is one of the main causes of death and causes almost two of the dead against murderers.
To call attention to the institutions, social forces and means of information on this dramatic issue today, the Animil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy the National Day for victims of work accidents institutionalized on second Sunday of October.
"The concerning data diffused by the Anmil and the same tragic news of these days confirm as important as the matter of prevention in work," said the President of the Napolitan Republic, in the message sent to the President of the Anmil, the National Association and the Defence of Work, Peter Mercandelli.
The Chief of the State expresses its “great appreciation for the constantly linked commitment to prevention in the workplace, protection of employees, assistance to the families of victims and awareness of public opinion”.
"It has been shown, a 'base', sincerely shared, faced tragedias that, by their size, emphasis the crisis of the means and participation of the public opinion, the daily reality offers us dramatic cases, even repeated in their dynamic."
Napolitan does not hide that "there is uncertainly a resource problem: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particularly significantly take the numerous school-based initiatives for a directly awareness of young people who enter into the work world.
It is a need to keep the attention of the phenomenon, not break the alarm on social gravity, implement and improve legislative standards.
For its part, the President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini has subrayed “as the philosome of white deaths represent an absolute social emergency, which offers awareness of each of us and imposes all the institutions a decision-making commitment to bring urgent end”.
"The data on the accidents in the work seems to point out a loud and positive movement, but this does not want the number of white deaths to be equally impresional," said the President of Anmil Peter Mercandelli.
"We do not want, actually, that this "consistent to decrease" is less attention, because it is just when the attention reduces tragedy.
"We believe that at general level there is still too little to address the philosome of accidents and the remedie can be implemented through multiple actions.
It is necessary, to our criteria - has raised Mercandelli – greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this from the world of school ".
"There is a further effort - has added - because it agrees with the communication and awareness of the public opinion.
But, above all, it is a greater sense of liability of employees concerning a phenomenon representing social emergency."
Mercandelli has stated "the progressive progress in the subsequent protection level for the victims of work" and the "assistance duty to which the system is directed in the last years."
"The goal is to reiterate the guarantee of the insurance - he added – because the luck of whom it is accidentally does not have to be dependent on the duty laid down by the legislator always."
Mp3 readers under accused, risk hearing
Listen to high volume music for a long time using portable music devices such as Mp3 readers can cause permanent audition lessons.
As regards the European Commission, in a Communication diffused in Bruxel, the Auditors' opinion of the Scientific Committee on the emergency and recently identified health risk of Ue, which is published today.
"Over this scientific opinion – it is read in the note – it stands that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, hear music with portal music devices simultaneously over one hour to the day with high volume device, will be a permanent loss of auditive capacity".
"I'm concerned of the fact that such a number of youths that are often used by portal music devices and cell phones at high axis level can unconsciously throw their ears in irmediate manner," says Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific tests – continues the responsibility of Ue - emerges a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What I think is to be aware of consumers and to provide this information on public dominion.
We need to re-examin the systems of control existing in light of this scientific opinion to be widely effective and to take step with the new technology."
Bruxel was requested to the Independent Scientific Committee to consider the problem, taking into account the great use of portfolio music devices and the increase of the number of young people outlined to the voice.
"The scientific - concludes the Ue executive – confirm that it is a reason for concern, and the European Commission will now examine together with the Member States and the stakeholders that measures may eventually be taken to protect children and adolescents from exposure to the sound of portfolio music devices and devices."
There is already a European security standard that limits the roof level of the portfolio music devices, but concern increases as hearing damage that can result from an exceptive exhibition to such sound sources.
These damages can be limited by recurring to solutions such as the reduction of levels and the exhibition time to the voice.
It seems that the Auditors of Portable Music devices are listed to high volume (majors of 89 decibeles) only 5 hours per week over the current limit on the maximum allowed voice in the job.
Those who hear music in such conditions for long-term periods will make a permanent loss of hearing capacity after a 5-year period.
It means that 5-10% of the users of such devices and the number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in Ue.
Roman, German gives the Commission the way for the future of the capital
Today, in March, the accounts will be closed in June.
This is the calendar set by the Municipality and the workers of the "Commission for the Future of the Capital of Rome", which has been established this morning in his new seat behind the Caracalla Terms.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission discuss the main points for Rome.
Once the doors in March, the meeting and the Common Council will assess and projects in order to present the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "Official" of the Municipality and its Deputy Gianni German.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and is represented by all political, social and cultural ideas – which is to subray German – must prove proposals for Rome development in which those who decided politically, together and municipal Council may then be assessed.
There is no sovereign position of roles, only the desire to have a place where to prepare a great project for Rome.
In March ended, the work will be disappeared because this experience must have an appropriate time limit.
In June, the intentionant announced – we will submit the strategic plan using the work made by the Commission for the future of the Rome capital."
Who accuses the Commission of non-profit, since its statements are not binding, German answers: " Everyone depends on the work that will be able to carry out the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality is present, as well as in France with the Commission of Attali and as I am sure in Rome, it will be essential.
The policy is almost always in ordinary management and in emergencys that turn back are manipulated.
We, on the contrary, want to look mass there and long-term, in a deep perspective, working with seriousness to the development of Rome and its future."
The intentioner of Rome also pointed out that "This Commission is neither an unutility nor a banality: it is absolutely free, not costs the Roman citizens and will serve to participate and respect the best minds expressed by the capital."
For Germany, actually, "If you need to have a strategic design as reference, not closed or immovable, to allow our city to make our city an authentic slot of level, which we are absolutely needed, thinking with a unitary spirit at its future."
A future that, specifically the intending of Rome, is not only limited to the current common confidence, but also to look there" not only on the optic of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital, but also "and considering the role that Rome can and must be developed as a capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first American president.
He wrote a American politic notice that he interests to pass independently: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, that with its decisions, the U.S. economy and the tube (such as is today private citizen) with the Islam enemy."
Increased attacks against Obama while the date of the elections is close.
He wrote a Lady of Miami on a Web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a great stone face: you believe it will win the highest charge of the nation who had two rulers and five black senators!".
It is actually an attack that does not say much; it is clearly racial attacks and they are not answering the question of the electors: will it be a good President? And there are also dreams; all say that Obama will win and with a good advantage.
In this case there is also one who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
One newspaper of the Misisipic, in the southern parts of the United States, wrote a editorial: once in the cabine to vote, we will well know who will give his vote to the American patriot.
Go on one side from the United States mentality covered until the last.
"Speak what they want, we'll think then where to put the cross, whether on Obama or on McCain."
There are people who swear: if you get to win Obama, we'll go from America.
Those things never before now, that seems almost true the success of the black candidate.
However, all of these reasons, the winning weapon for democratics is George Bush.
They asked for 1500 people: What were the errors made by Bush during their mandate? The 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent her home to patches in the back.
In Iraq, there are 400 soldiers who lost life and Americans have not been forced to make the valleys.
Likewise, Irak for most has been the weak point of Bush.
Whoever will assume George W will have a huge debtor to deploy.
Use, economic colapsy is also feeling for journalists: in the newspapers is time of shortness. Many people will be guilty on the Internet, "asesina" of the printing paper.
Fifteen American periodists have been interpelled by PEW Research Centre on the status of your professional and mental control for the future.
But today the journalists are almost all weak about their future.
However, the journalists have not openly declared to feel less worried about credibility.
They don't feel isolated as once.
The problem for the American periodists is the money, the money.
The 2008 periodist crisis is a destructed economic model crisis.
Furthermore, the courts carried out in the room where the editors work to perform the newspaper is a great problem.
It is a problem that should be solved, according to the interviewed periodists, if you do not want the traditional periodism as it understands, the majority of the public is significantly reduced.
A clear but comprehensive pesism is now predominant about the United States journalist.
Six on ten periodists and executives are agreed that this periodism at national level follows a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
I'm printing against emission.
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the web goes.
Best editor houses are opening a break on the Internet, for many views like the "assino" of the business card.
"Economic pressure" reporting periodists has increased up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed periodists have admitted that they are engaged in technology in hope "and do something good" for the periodism.
The larger rock today in the American periodism is between which leads the newspapers – or the directors – and the journalists working for them.
The 56% of executives at the national level is safe that their periodists share the same values, while at local level the percentage was lower than 23 per cent.
For some of this, you need to see with the "safeness of the work".
The executives that think to lose employment in 3 years are 47% at national level.
The periodic staff is 30 per cent.
The "safe trail" at staff level (of our editors, ndr) in America is always at the order of the day.
Only 13% of periodists work with a contract.
In a large nation such as the U.S., with 300 million inhabitants and millions of newspapers, revised, radio, TV and Internet, the employers often offer what they want and become in a question of "toma or leave it".
The directors are almost always a good wages, while the editors can gain up to $10,000 per month, but the legalization and social security.
For holidays, the razonation is complicated: a total of days in the first year, another after the third to reach 15 full days after a number of years.
But the American journalists, by admission, are "fermen" followed during the year.
It's all a climate question.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL DE ROMA, COPPOLA AND GROTTAFERRATA
The Chairman of the Second Penal Section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the instance of the realm Danilo Coppola, which had asked to move from his city, Grottaferrat, to a room in the city of Rome.
Coppola this inadded by bankerroat in the field of investigation on the Union on the Unipol-Bnl scale.
In the course of the arrest process to its charge, last week, he has obtained home release, transforming it in obligatory residence to Grottaferata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentloni and Gaetano Pecorella, were requested that the real estate could recover the city of the province to a capital room.
According to the Court, these travels (for which the pm has given an opposite vote) would allow him to influence their society and access the tests accused by him.
The elections in danger
The phenomenon has already been shown a few days ago with the vote of the room of representatives against the White House ' s salvation Plan for $700 million: a significant part of the Americans was, and this, more interested to punish Wall Street to save the economy.
We have confirmed the New York Times of yesterday report that the current crisis is being engaged by the Republician party, which is always divided between its old soul of the East Costa, modern, favourable to the federal institutions and the Community business, and its new soul in terms, conservative, hostil to "Bissburg Academies" and the world of finances, strong over the states of the Centre and South.
The soul, actually, has become prepotent with the vote of whom he spoke to the principle.
This unlikely mentioned is an example of the changes, the large changes, which the current economic earthquake declares: not only in the United States but in all the West and not only here.
Being in the United States as in Europe since now, the crisis seems to work as an accelerator of incubation phenomenas that are solidized and going out.
The first of these phenomenas is the renewment, the extraordinary reactivation, of the two-soberany category of state-soberany regarding a type of nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, actually, is a crisis of banking institutions, which have, if, strong financial relations with the outdoor, but mostly the balances of the families living in one country and in one State are more committed.
He who immediately creates a political problem for whom it governs: it is how to respond to the difficulty and the protests of those people and families that, on the other hand, are electors.
The crisis appears to be globally, but it is politically and exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems substantially outside the game or does not have much to say: the crucial evidence is the European Union which is divided as always between the various interests and the various State strategies is not able to decide any common policy.
It is of the government of each state that all are expected to intervention, rescue and reactivation plans, new rules and over the subvention of funds: since the court reaches, it is only the state that possesss economic resources and the financial resources mass to remediate things.
They also have the necessary means and legitimation to use them: two resources of incalculable value, values in certain circumstances where no market is likely and no organization can never be available in the same measure.
This new appreciation that the crisis stands on the state is in perfect synthesis, with the greatest importance of the new economy's development is to add to a very appreciated factor to this element: territoriality.
Paradically, while we were convinced to have entered into the network of technology always more sophisticated, inmaterial, while we were convinced that global financing was already intended to dominate the world, we say that our future will in change to make accounts with little inmaterial things like water, cultures and petroleum.
Everything that, thinking, can certainly be transported from a place on the other part of the earth but are also associated in absolute way in a scripted area, a territory.
So who is found as a sovereign man, has certainly much letters about whom it is not, and who has the desire to live in a place without culture, without petroleum and without water.
I'm coming to the second news that but it's pregnant.
Who says Territory, State, Government, says inevitably Political and Leaderazgo.
In this respect, economic crisis seems to produce two convergent philosomes.
On the one hand, the objective conscience of the need of a leadership, the request of someone who knows to take the situation into hand.
On the other hand, a decreased wage for existing leaders, inadequate economic species with many dark areas.
And together something more deep and in a certain worried sense: a decree, intolerance, an inadequate image, a laginy sense, which remains to involve the whole leading class of the west countries in a growing number.
It seems to be always more progress in different places of the population, the conviction that before its actions are the same as those of the social elections until now, the same way to feel and be, its culture in the understanding of the term, has done the same time and to be greater to the opinions of most.
The demand for lederazgo, in a few words, offers subterraneously a recognised but powerful delegation of the leading classes and traditional political structures, which are marked in a "recurrent" electoral or in the immediate changes of collective humors of these recent times, from the conservative exit in Austria-Bavira to the collapse of social-democratic consensus in British, to the rebelliation of the men of the American congress against Bush (and capable also with the salvation of the right in Italy, which has something to see).
It is the impression that the traditional elections, their parties, their programs, but also their records, their confidence newspapers, their intelligents, their format would say, they are always more difficult to understand and then to represent, those who have been taking form are the deepestestests of the West society and that the economic crisis renewed, growing and potentially acted in disappearance.
On the face of all this to say about a "massa reblation" today is franchely exquisite.
But have your eyes open, certainly, it's not.
Swimming up to walk on the walls
Venge gravity laws thanks to a supper pegament and in a future walking on walls like the Arab man.
It is the goal of several American research centres and now a team of four Institutes is quite closed.
With an attractive only 2,5 square centimeters, scientists could have pushed a body of 100 kilometres on a vertical wall.
EL ESTUDIO – The American Science magazine has published the discovery of some researchers from the University of Dayton, from Akron, Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material contained by the research team is an evolution of existings using a particular carbon structure called carbon nanotubos.
“The principle of pegament can be imagined as a series of harvested tubos as a pile of spaguetis”, explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Atlanta Technology.
Scientists have been inspired to the pit of the gens, microscopic hair covers that can ensure the animal a perfect accession.
The tests on different materials, such as the glass, the telephone and the lyric paper, have shown that the new advasive is ten times more powerful of the paths of this reptil and at the same time" is easily removed from the walls" Liming Dai, researcher of the University of Dayton's University.
"This material could be useful as a transitional adhesion" adds Liming Dai.
Capes to walk through walls exactly like the arance man? Capess yes, but researchers think a much less exciting use such as connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubos are warm and electric flowers.
Other applications could have to be seen with the space air engineering.
Nothing of superheroes at the moment.
OTRA INVESTIGIGATION - also Berkeley University in California is dedicated to the search for a new attractive.
In a article of the American Chemical Society magazine, Californian studies have presented a complainant fact of micro fibers as hairs that are cleaning from the dust during the movement on a surface to keep a perfect adherence.
Family: Never with fruit games
Attention to pomelo play, naranja and manzana.
Those drinks, consumed mostly in summer because they are refreshing and rich of vitaminarms, if they are currently taking some factors to change their absorption by improving or disminuing according to the case, efficiency with serious consequences for health.
To repair the risk of fruit players are invased that fresh fresh relating to the union of some medicines David Bailey, professor of the University of Western Ontario in London, which since the 236th National Meeting of American Chemical Society at Philadelfia sends a new warning: enough a pomelo, naranja and manzanic vacuum to reduce the absorbion of some pharmatics, enhancing the well-being effects and risking patients’ health.
The pomelo game was already under consequence because it was responsible for increased at the toxic levels some medicines of anti-arrhroom, antibiotics, careful, antihystanics and neurological medicines.
FARMACOS A RIESGOS – The same Italian agent of the form had reported in an information bulletin two years ago alarming doctors and patients to not subestimate the danger resulting from this mezcla and to take care of what it is drinked in the case is being considered a fatarmatic, such as the Diasepam or Metadone.
NO SOLO EL POMELO – In accordance with experts, the naranja game and the manzan contain substances that prevent factors.
A wide list of the active principles inhibited by pomelo and other games.
From here the call from Michele Carruba, director of the Department of Pharmatics of the University of Milano: "These discovery in general are pointed out to the various agencies of the international and national factor that are attempting to change the notes of the same.
Therefore, it is always necessary to read the illustrational follets of medicines that are assumed and if there is something that is not clear to us, let us not impresion, ask the doctor or the pharmaceutical" subrayed the expert of the Ansa agency.
The Economy News to Paul Krugman
The noble economic premium has been granted to the American Paul Krugman for its studies, trade models and the location of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a clinician nest who teaches the Princeton University and is a novel editorial of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the major critical decisions of the Bush Administration on the economy and the external policy.
A few months after the attack of 11 September 2001, Krugman was planned in an editorial issued by New York Times that the second most serious event than the first, in consequence with the United States.
There is a prevision that decrease a lot of polymic and that for several years the economy was reproached, but now it has been revealed exactly.
"I'm surprised and a little worried about the memory of the scandle of Enron and Worldcom's colapsy have soon disappeared from public care," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "grown economicist", but also an aggressive designer with a aggressive style, particularly critical against the expenditures of the liberalism of Bush's administration.
Open Office, echo the third edition of the package "anti-Microsoft"
It is the day of the starting of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source of personal productivity that is intended to raise always more users, from the office to the public prosecutors, as an alternative to the known Microsoft Office.
After a year of work of almost a part of the voluntary developers, of which their backs are monitored by SUN Microsystem, the new Open Office is shown to the public with several news: the Welcome screen and the less larger interface are added, such as the compatibility for the operating system Apple Mac OS X and the support for the new format ODF(Open Document Format) 1.2.
Attention also provided to the multifunctional operation with the Office of 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.dokk, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functions of some modules such as that allows to reduce the dimension of the presentation of PowerPoint, for example, to send it electronic mail path, or the possibility to import the PDF file in the graphical processing module, maintaining the original aspect of the page.
You can always create "hybrided DFP" documents that assemble the typical graph of the Adobe format with the elements of a calculated table or text developer.
Cooperation is an element that has received different improvements within the application: in the calculation sheet can intervene in different users, avoiding change conflicts, in the preparation of texts, each partner is given a color in the composition for a better recognition in the revision phase.
Some enterprises are also working to carry some functions from OpenOffice to the web (on the clouds, clouds), and in the next weeks they should give the final result.
The version in Italy can be downloaded in the address http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and added to the English that was found in the mirror from the Thursday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usually the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request you can also be sent the cd of installation at home or work.
And if the theme of free can be a gap for disfusion in houses, it is in business that Open Office's follow-up, try to the great approximation, and can already tell several projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And they are not even lacking the realities offering a training, consultations and ideal assistance for small and medium-sized enterprises, where business prospective could be opened.
Open Office composed of five main modules: Write, for the video write the relevant Word; Calc, is the calculation sheet replaced Excel; Impress, for the presentation of Powerpoint; Dbase, such as in the case of the known Access is the program that allows to work on the base data; and last Draw the graphic module.
Objective for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we reach almost 3 million 600 million, with the output of the new version is likely to be overcome.
Cohl is also the fourth doping case.
New positive case in France tour: it is the austriaque Bernhard Kohl, the team Gerolsteiner, the third classified and winner of the best scaller's best.
To give the news is the page of the newspaper The Team.
Kohl, 26 years old is the positive quarter of the Epo of third generation, after the Italian Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from Gerolsteiner.
The analysis of Kohl’s blood campaigns enter between those performed in the last few weeks in the Labour of Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter tests confirm that it is positive, Austria will lose the third position to the Tour and anger against the two years of canonical discharge.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positive doping to the third generation Epothe is the chief of the French Antidoping Agency, Peter Bordry, who declared the Associated Press to have reported the news to the Austrian authorities.
The Austrian 26-year-old podio at the backs of the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, giving the reward of the best scaler.
INMIGRATIONS: NEW YORK THAT THE PREGUNTA, ITALIA AND RACISTA?
Italy of migrant country has only been transformed to a privileged destination for immigrants" hostility.
This is transforming the beauty country into a nation of racistics? This is what the New York Times has been asked in a long article which has dedicated the debate on racism theme in Italy as part of the case of Abdul William Guibre originary of Burkina Faso, killed the previous month in Milan because he has rolled a galetes cake.
This case proves what New York Times defines the "North Paradies", the Northern regions are at the same time when "max integration and mass work" but also the highest anti-immigrant feelings of the country and the highest support of the northligate."
As confirmed the growing tension between Italian and immigrants, the New York Times also cited intolerance episodes in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
Not alone.
The new legislation laid down by the Law is also covered by immigration and facilitated by the expulsion of the clandests is a paradigma of climate change in Italy.
The tendency marked is by the Pope and by the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitan with the Benedetto XVI in the Congress has asked the State and the church to work together to fight racism."
Cheap rental victims, up to 900 euros for a room
The market of rental for universities does not know the crisis.
According to the last survey of Sunia, the inquiry inquiry was able to rent a individual room at a 900 euro student in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Napoles, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has already been very serious until the point of excluding the right to study a large part of youth by the high costs that the family should support – explains the responsibility of the Solar study office, Laura Mariani – in these cities, the strong demand has fully deformed the market at that point to decline a generalized growing process to residents."
In most cases, the offers of rental contains a series of violations: free, unregistered, without canon limit, under associated rentals.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are required that prices can be regulated through the revision of the tax position.
Taking into detail the survey, we see that in Milan, by a bed in Brianza area, it serves approximately 450 euros; by a individual room from a minimum of 650 (New band) at a average value of 800 (Lambiate zone, Udine and Fiera) at a maximum of 900 (in Victoria area).
In Florence a room in average of 350/400 euros, a room approximately 700 euros.
In Bolivia, where students concentrate in near university areas, served 250/280 euros for a bed in double room and from 370 to 500 per person.
In Rome in the central areas near the University (San Lorenzo, Plaza Bolonia) ask you about 600 euros by individual room and 450 by bed in a double room.
Only lowerly lower values (550 euros per individual room) in areas near other universities (Ostines and Cinety).
Economic is only changed by the area: 300 euros by a bed and 450 by a individual room in the Prestina area, Centocelle and around.
In Napolis, a bed is 300/450 euros, for a room from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Political, Vomero and Colli Aminei.
In Bari for a bed you are 250/350 euros, at least 350 per person.
The prices are lower in absolute terms, but have more weight in the town economy.
In cities such as Peruvia, where foreign students and foreign students are higher frequency, a further anonymy is recorded: an increase in 25/30% of the canon foreign students with respect to Italians.
Return to the old Chinese Paradise, the cities cancel the historical salts
Historic cinematographic sals close to the multiplexs.
"A city without cinematography sals in a blind city, is like a face without eyes."
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornator offers effectively what happens in the large Italian urban centres and also in the province cities.
The process of marginalization of cinnes, which, with the birth of the large metics in the perifer and the consequence of disappearance of money in the central areas of the city, is an inevitable and insufficient event with all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
To disappear almost always are historical places, full of memory," as if he died a friend, a known with which a place and so much emotion would be shared”, notices the director of the new Paradise cine, the film that has 20 years ago gain the first Oscar and the great prize of the jury to Cannes, containing the poesia of a province film room and the notalgia for how to live the film that might be lost forever.
The numbers given by Anec, the main partnership of trade union, speak clearly: In the last five years, 316 traditional cins have been closed, and the major part is over 10 less in Florence, 9 less in Milan, Napoles, Bolivia and Rome, 6 less in Turkey and 5 in Palermo.
Amphia-Romagna, with 82 chines, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardia (41).
It is a demonstration that the license of your disappearance is the acquisition of the multix, these three Italian regions who have made record the largest number of new metic Chineses: 195 mass screens in Lombardia in the last five years, 81 in Toscana and Emilia-Romaña.
“Ittal year has been developed irrationally” Paul Protti, President of Anec, notes, would be useful to build new structures but it would need to ensure the remaining of those already existing, because when a city room is clear, not all its frequentors are intended to be transferred to the metics.
To not speak of the lack of funds for traders: the previous debt of the state is approximately 10 million euros.
It is ashamed of the ethical and moral view that the Government does not respect the laws that exist.
In order to support the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros per year."
In the interest of the case of Bolonia, the first Italian city concerned by the circles decided to be retained with the signing of a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of this type in Italy to promote and protect the money cinema in the historical center and in the perifer.
There are media for fiscal facilitation for the public managers and advantages in terms of movement: the spectators can enter in the limited traffic area and have special tariffs for the station.
"I like an initiative" notes Joseph Tornator and I hope that other cities continue the example of Bolonia by putting other measures.
It is true that, for contrast to the extra power of metics, traditional salts must improve the quality of sound and image, because the public today is more required.
The traditional kitchen defense is a theme that was always important for me: the closure of the cinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the chip that agreed to carry out the "New Paradiso" which had thought for 10 years ago.
I lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I passed before the Rialto or the National Peace Quirinal already closed, where I lived so many shared emotions, so that I don't see the cards denied by the powder, I turned around on the other side."
Law between political and drangheta, has been arrested the Joia Tauro Chamber
"The Joia Tauro Alcald was available to uniform the municipality elections for the Pyromalli cosca."
It is worried about the accused that the judges of the Anti-Mafia Division of Calabria give the intendent and the Deputy of Goia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the intention of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested this morning by mafial association.
Joacchino Piromalli is also deprived, the former mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grand lawyer, the bossman, already condemned by mafial criminal association and compensating 10 million euros.
"In view of any legal and moral standard, and of good sense," the leaders said, the two local administrations had expressed the will of paying consultations to the Piromalli lawyer.
"It would have been allowed to the mafiosa family – write the judges- to access officially into the municipality by facilitating the great possibility of control and command of public administration."
The President of the Café regional meeting Agazio Loiero does not hide that " agreements between the evil-organized life have a month" in its region: "There are areas where mafia intensity is strong than in others, where the agreement is almost inevitable.
But there are many local politicals that resist to the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who keep clean.'
The arrests of this morning will be added to those of the past July after the police had announced the heads of the Piromalli Mafia family.
Since the end of April, the municipal council of Joia Tauro had been discovered, already in 1991 and always because of precondiction between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been settled by the shipment of the municipality.
The intentional Day From Torrione, from Udc at the time of dissolution, after the balota to May 2006, was elected as a head of a right centre coalition.
I have an explanation when the Prefector orders the dissolution of the municipal council.
I call for the Vice-President of the Internal Minister who at that time was Marco Minniti, accusing him of having been organized by a political question, but the judges in the arrest order signed this morning explain that Piromalli has come to request the change of the A3 route project.
Of the ambient interferences made in Dal Torrione, the judges say "the availability to favour the requirements of a businessman, representative of a group very close to the Piromalli clan, uniforming the elections of the public administration on the interests of the Mafia families".
When energy is born from olives, the largers are down to the scenario
It's an overwhelmed age that occupies more than 70% of the planet surface, and they are discovering it now, the great global societys of energy.
Old, flowers, martes are the new renewable sources on which the largers look like Chevron.
The possibility of reinsuring the energy of marine movements has been studied for hundreds ago and in 70s together with the first oil crisis, the investigations have increased.
When the price of petroleum lower, in 1980, the idea of use of marine energy was separated, but now the environmental cases and the new growth of the petroleum would lead to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London was estimated for 2007 that 15 per cent of the global electric need could be covered by improving the movement of the oils of the sea.
This amount would be the double of the currently produced by the nuclear centres.
And they would be the flowers and the sea.
Guide the attack.
The first undertaking on marine energy has been Enersis, which 2005 has set a agreement to build an engagement in the north of Portugal.
When the intention was declared, it appeared a revolutionary step.
Two years of distance to address marine energy are always mass and between these companies who have always voted by traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the ocean energy technology – has declared the portrait of a company linked to the United States oil coldlestifer in the Wall Street Journal – and is evaluating the possibility of cooperating with us."
The cooperation concerned is on the obtaining of a licence of the United States Energy Commission to implement a project to exploit marine energy in Alaska.
It is a very important sign, if it is considered that the EU continues to extrace the petroleum and recently the President Bush has enabled a plan to carry out new perforations.
In addition to Chevron is the Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey to follow the way of the water coming from the sea, the total invested until now, although they are not detailed, show an increased interest.
Technology to develop.
Experts speak of a technology still at the beginning, because marine energy has no doubt that it has a great environmental impact.
For now, the impacts such as Portuguese or Scotts are small dimension and they don't seem to create big problems to the ecosystem.
In order to produce long-scale energy, a technology should be used with a greater environmental impact.
And the options are different: Ocean Power, for example, use a united boat system between them.
The force of the oils, which moves the bows up and downwards, becomes hydraulic pressure with pills and cilindroes inside the same.
Press turns a turbine that eats a generator at its time.
Electricity is sent to the cost through submarine cells.
For now, four impliances of this type on development paths, at the expectation of the federal approval, partly of energy, could serve for a military installation.
Verdant Power, in turn, has already produced energy for a commercial centre and station, using submarine turbines in the East River.
The water movement when there are seasons, makes turning the turbine pallets, creating a round move that devours the generator.
Verdant said you have a long list of customers at the expectation of the necessary authorisations to use energy.
After the oaks, the seas.
A particular interest, speaking in the Institute for Electronic Energy Development, is the potential of marine.
Although it is a intermitting philosome, the seas are the most predictable than wind, sun or oil, and therefore most reliable as a source of energy.
It is particularly about marine energy, such as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others that are close to costs, invested $7 million and average in 2008, and is intended to invest 35 million for 2009.
