How much do you have more or less than have these symptoms?
and the pain of skin must always be treated in this way, particularly at her age
and also fibres
and must also be controled by its colesterol and arterial pressure
And now you got a fiber?
And do you feel this shot pain now?
and has also difficult to respirate
And can you tell me what other symptoms do you have over this?
and how much of fibres you had
and I also have toys
And I have a bit of warming and tas
And today I'm actually got a very strong skin pain.
and this is the time given for your polen warning
and the skin pain appears
And I think I have a bit of fibres.
And I want to describe where the pain feels
and they also have something of fibres
and with their pasts of diabetes
And you know, I'm feeling like the skin's smoothing me.
And you know, people touched me all the time
and feelings of skin pain
and said it's a pressure in the skin
Some of the family has a cardiac problem, heart disease, heart attack, high colesterol, high arterial pressure
Another symptom or problem notes also the muscular pain?
Are there other simps like you with the same symptoms in your house?
Do you have another symptom?
Do you have something lacking air?
Still feels pain in the skin
Because this is the Gripe time
But also you should not ignore us for the pain of hearty origin
But now a more important problem is this skin pain.
But I have difficult to respirate.
But I know that many people touched me up.
But we always have to handle skin pain with maximum series
But you're right now, aren't you?
for this pain of skin I forgot completely
He feels like if someone dreams you out of the skin
Availability is still aware of air
Do you want to be ill with similar symptoms?
Do you have any other chronic disease, like high arterial pressure or something like that?
Do you have any other disease, chronic medical problems, like diabetes?
Did you have something lack of air, except a hair pain?
Do you have high arterial pressure?
Do you have some episodes of lack of air with that?
Did you know what symptoms had?
And the image?
I've got a lot liquid drink today.
However, I do tests for the diabetes
However, he has quite similar symptoms to mys
How much do you get to fiber?
How is your arterial pressure?
if you still have high fibre
if there is a two-year fiber of two degrees
If you believe that their symptoms or problems are justifying a better review
I gave me a fig tree yesterday.
I also had a little fibre.
Earlier today
I have a huge pain here, on the kitchen.
I also have something difficult to respirate
I'll send you a image
I've got a little bit of pain today.
I'm just got a little head pain and something fiber.
I think it's a grip.
I think it's a little grippe.
Are you like someone very, very weak sitting on his hair?
Everything started with head pain and feed more or less at the same time
Dog me the center of the skin
it's a pressure like skin pain
it's in my skin
it's in the center of my skin
is in the center of the skin
I'm sorry pain in the skin
I'm very concerned about this pain.
I want to tell me how to describe this shock pain
as high arterial pressure or diabetes
as just in the center of the skin
Now you can take a Tachipina compromise for the fibre
Now, Mary, it's a few days that you've got the symptoms.
Now he said he's got a kid pain
at times, I have a little bit of skin pain
Well, he's got another symptom beyond this, that it's not only pain
Or someone sitting on his hair?
basicly equal, with fibres and toes, head pain and muscular pain
Just in the center of the skin
Show me in this image where pain feels
Since he has a fever
Do you think some of these symptoms could be related to the wedding?
Did your kids have some of the same symptoms?
knocking on her skin pain
the fibre is higher than night
I've had the last two days
The fiber began to be higher tonight.
This is Dr. Porter in the third center of the emergency room
Well, can you tell me some more about your skin pain?
Well, I feel a pain in the back of the body, here on the hair.
Well, I'm feeling a strong pain in the skin
Well, when I have that pain on my skin
What kind of pain you got on your kid?
When started this pain on the kid?
Where are you feeling pain on the hair?
{NS}
feeling as an emotion in the skin
You know I have diabetes and others
He said he feels this painful pain.
Accompanied rapidly increased disease by coronavirus (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The assumption of cases of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, which confirms that, though in different stages according to the country, COVID-19 pandemia is rapidly progressing in all countries.
Based on Italy’s experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should improve their preparation for patients with COVID-19 who will need medical care and, in particular, intense care.
On 31 December 2019, a conglomeration of cases of unknown ethnology notified in Wuhan, the province of Hubei, China.
On January 9, 2020, the China ' s Control and Prevention Centre reported that the caused agent was a new coronavir that is now known as a crowdvirus 2 of the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then the disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus (COVID-19).
The evidence at the date indicates that 80% of the people with COVID-19 have a lower disease, i.e. an infection of respiratory treaty with or without neumony, and that most are recovered.
In 14 per cent of the cases, COVID-19 evolutes to a seriousr disease that requires hospitalization, while 6 per cent remaining cases develop a critical disease that requires intense care.
The mortality in patients hospitalized by COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we consider trends in the acumulated impact of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union or the European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (RU) and compare them with those of the province of Hubei, China.
We also compare the current amount of cases of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA countries and the RU with Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 Cases in the EU/EEC countries and the RU countries
After China, COVID-19 continued geographically and the dynamic of COVID-19 pandemia in the rest of the world now continued.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (OMS) declared COVID-19 as pandemia.
In the edition of 5 March 2020 of Eurosurveillance, Spitteri and al. he informed the first cases confirmed by COVID-19 in Europe in accordance with the definition of the case of the WHO.
In the EEA, the first three confirmed cases were registered in France on 24 January 2020 in people who had returned from Wuhan, the province of Hubei, China.
On 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected in the 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (RU), in accordance with 31 December 2019 and that included date, 39 768 cases and 1727 deaths were registered, of which 17 750 cases and 1441 deaths were only occurred in Italy.
Obtention of the acumulated quantity and acumulated incidence of COVID-19 cases
In the European Control and Prevention Centre (ECDC), the incentives of cases of COVID-19 reported in every country of the world, only obtained from official sources, such as the Ministry of Health of the countries, national and regional health authorities and the WHO, are updated every day at 8 p.m.
These data were used to consider COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the RU and to compare them with Italy.
As indicater of the prevalence of COVID-19 active cases, we calculated the acumulated incidence of COVID-19 cases operated at 14 days; so we took into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and RU during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the summed amount of cases reported in each country at 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m. in comparison with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 Tendencies in the EU/EEA countries and RU
The trends in the acute impact of cases of COVID-19 in 14 days in the EU/EEA countries and the RU generally followed the province of Hubei (China) (section 1).
In the EU/EEA and in general the COVID-19 acumulated incidence began to increase about 21 February and then increased significantly approximately 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases reported in Italy, but all the other EU/EEA countries and the RU expressed trends above the accumulated COVID-19 similar incidence (additional material).
The figure 2 shows the amount of COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the RU compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It notes that, on 15 March to 8:00, other 15 EU/EEA countries and the RU have already registered a total of cases comparable to Italy only 3 weeks before or less.
Our results indicate that the amount of reported COVID-19 cases is rapidly increased in EU/EEA and RU.
The trends observed in the COVID-19 acumulated impact suggest that pandemia is advanced to an similar ritmo in all countries.
Thus, despite the different stages in which countries are found, the changes in national public health responses and, perhaps, different definitions of case in countries and different protocols to select patients that should be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed tests.
At the beginning of March 2020, the doctors of the Italian regions described a situation in which 10 per cent of the patients with COVID-19 required intensive care, and communication media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
COVID-19 data on admissions of cases in a hospital or an intensive care unit is currently available at EU/EEA level for 6 per cent and 1 per cent of the cases (not data is shown).
However, they should be systematically collected to complement current monitoring data focused on the number of cases reported and the number of deaths.
A study carried out in 2010-11 showed a major variation in the availability of intensive care rooms and intermediate care in Europe, which was from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds every 100 000 in Portugal.
This means that countries can have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 intensive care rooms and intermediate care every 100 000 inhabitants in 2010-11).
Modifying the saturation of medical care capacity, with calculations for each EU/EEA country and the RU prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases related to a risk of >90% of overcome of intensive care capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the rapid assessment of the ECDC risk of COVID-19.
Since cases have been conglomerated in certain EU/EEA regions and RU regions, and that hospitals and intensive care units are normally attracted to a defined regional captation population, the information on cases and intensive care rooms should be used at the level of the Name of territorial units 2 (NUTS-2).
Italy’s experience and current trends in other countries show that COVID-19 pandemia is rapidly advanced in EU/EEA and RU.
CoV-2 countries, hospitals and intensive care units must be prepared for a sustained Community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 needing medical care and, in particular, intense care, such as in the regions affected by Italy.
As indicated in the rapid assessment of the risk of ECDC, it is essential to adopt a rapid, proactive and integral approach to retract the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2, with a change of containing approach to a mechanism, since the rapid increase in the number of cases may not give them sufficient time to those responsible for decisions and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their response correctly if it is not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also includes the necessary public health measures to reduce the impact of pandemia.
There is a short time of opportunity during which countries have the possibility of deploying their control efforts to prevent the proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce health pressure.
If this is not done, it is likely that the health systems of other EU/EEA countries should be faced in a hospital of patients that need intense care in the next days and weeks.
The disease brown by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) (SARS-CoV-2), until the moment he caused death of 3000 people and infected more than 80 000 in China and other parts of the world, which generated a catastrophe for humans.
Like its homologus virus, SARS-CoV, which caused the SARS in thousands of people in 2003, the SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from the wallet and similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has severity and less mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmisible and affects younger people than men and women.
In response to the growing number of emergency publications, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and complete analysis of the research theme, which is quickly developed.
We will address the basic aspects of epidemiology, ethnology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, progress and prevention of disease.
Although many questions are not yet answering, we hope that this analysis helps to understand and eliminate this threatening disease.
The Prime Federation of 25 January 2020 has become an unaudited and impoveriable memory for all Chineses, who were encouraged them to stay home during the whole festival and for several weeks more due to the discovery of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) which caught a severe respiratory syndrome syndrome in 2003; therefore, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (OMS) called SARS-CoV-2 and the related disease was named by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and was quickly propained throughout the country and almost 50 countries over the world.
At 2 March 2020, virus has caused more than 80 000 COVID-19 cases, with more than 40 000 patients given and more than 3000 patients.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is the " public entity of number 1 and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles on COVID-19 have been published, including its virology, epidemiology, ethnology, diagnostic and treatment since the first report of 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the isolated virus of multiple patients.
The objective of this analysis is to resume progress in the investigations on this new area quickly developed.
If possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS, a breath in 2012).
We will also consider what we know until the time about prevention and prevention of disease, as well as some decisive questions that have not yet been answered.
The cronvirus traditionally have been considered non-level pyrogenics for humans, which mainly causes approximately 15 percent of common disappearates 4.
However, in this century, we found two times with highly patologic crown in human humans, i.e., SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused originally a brown in China, 2003, and Saudi Arabia, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with Spanish mortality and mortality.
So the current COVID-19 browser is the third by coronavirus that has been registered in the history of humanity.
As indicated in fig. 1.1, the unknown newmony conglomers of origin was first reported to the National Health Commission of China on 31 December 2019.
Seven days later, if he knew the sequence of coronavirus.
On 15 January 2020, the first death case was registered in Wuhan.
The epidemic was soon propained to cities, province and neighbouring countries.
On 20 January, the infection of medical care providers was informed, which suggested that the transmission between humans was possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan was put in quarter and all public transports were suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on disease reported that the 41 patients with confirmed cases had only 21 direct contact with the Wuhan marine market that was considered the source of infection of an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the WHO declared to the browser a global health emergency.
At the date of this report, disease has already been spread by all China and almost 50 countries over the world (fig. 2).
Since the situation is evolving rapidly, dimension and final severity of the browser can not be determined.
On February 11, 2020, a multicentric study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with COVID-19 confirmed, presented a most updated illustration of the epidemy (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected persons of all ages, but mainly for people from 30 to 65 years.
Similarly half (47.7%) of infected persons had more than 50 years, very few than 20 and only 14 infected persons were less than 10 years.
SARS-CoV-2 infected more men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 was extended in most conglomers in Hubei and its surroundings.
In average, five days (of 2 to 9) between the appearance and the diagnostic of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days ( between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from appearance to death was 9,5 days ( between 4,8 and 13).
The basic reproduction number (R0) was 3,77 (IC 95%: 3,51-4.05) and the corrected R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The amount of infected persons has expensively increased before 23 January 2020, which corresponds to the massive mobilization time before the Prime Fiesta in China.
The mortality of patients with cases confirmed was of 1,44% (IC 95%: 1,10-1,86%), and the adapted mortality of the total of patients was 3,06% (IC 95%: 2,02-4,59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (maculin), age (≥60) and serious neumony.
The coronavirus are a large and enchant virus subfamily containing a unique sense chain ARN.
They can be divided in four gems, i.e. alpha, beta, gama and decade, of which alberronavirus and detacoronavirus are those infecting humans.
The lycoprotein of the belonging (S) is one of its celular recipients, angiotensina 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidil peptidasa 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then the membrane fuel is produced.
The viral genome of ARN is freed to cyclplasma; after the replication of viral genomy, the ARN genomic, together with the licoproteins of the enveloping and the proteins of the nucleocápside, vessels containing virations, which then are combined with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first genemic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was announced on 10 January 2020.
The SARS-CoV-2 is a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of more than 99,98% in 10 sequences taken from the original browser site: the Huan marine market of Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is generally similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
With an e-mail microscopium, parts of SARS-CoV-2 were found in ultra-delgadorized human respiratory epitheel sections.
Human ACE2 was determined as a recipient of SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 protein is one of the human ACE2 more deep than SARS-CoV, which is congratulated with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less serious infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new stored protein encoded by orf3b and a secret protein encoded by orf8.
The orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 could have a function in Viral Patogenicity and inhibit IFN expression; however, orf8 does not contain any known domain or functional reason.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, and al., revealed the structure of electronic chromicscopy of the ACE2 human length in resolution 2.9 ◆, in compliance with the B0AT1 transporter aminoaid.
They discovered that the complex, which had open and closed compliances, was stored as a dynamic, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 composer can join two proteins S, which provides evidence for recognition and infection of coronavirus.
The B0AT1 could be converted to a therapeutical dinaline for the factory study in order to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and the middle guest
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were originated in wallets and were transferred to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
In a philosogenic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronavirus, murcileago was considered the Native Hued of SARS-CoV-2, since the new virus is identical in a 96% to two coronavirus similar to the SARS murcielagues called batt-SL-CoVZX45 and batt-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it was not yet known what the middle warmed helped the virus to cross the barrier of the species to infect humans, and remains dilucting the transmission route.
Ji, and al., I proposed serpents as a carrier of the human smokeetic virus, which involved human recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers of Guangzhou, China suggested that long-country pangolines (longed stomach mamariferos which are eating hormigs and that they are soon used in Chinese traditional medicines) are a possible inter-coV-2 inter-function hills based on a genetic homology of 99% in a coronavirus covered in pangolines and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1 % spread by the total of two genoms remains a great difference; finally, concluded results are expected that providing concrete evidence (fig. 33).
The SARS-CoV-2 physical properties are still widely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a seat environment and up to 5 days at least 20 °C with a humidity of 40-50%.
The SARS-CoV-2 could possess similar properties.
The SARS-CoV-2 has been informed that the ultraviolet rail and heat for 56 °C for 30 minutes is sensitive; the ettery to 75%, a desinfectant with clore, percloroic acid, cloroform and other fat solvents, but not clorhexidin, are effective to disable virus.
All human populations generally do not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and, finally, are potential to the new coronavirus.
Until the time there has been no detailed study on immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies with other coronavirus, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. 4).
In general, after the invade virus is recognized by the immunity system of the housed by receipters of patron recognition (PRR), including recipients of type C, Toll type receipters (TLR), NOD type NOD (NLR) and RIG-I (RLR).
In different ways, virus introduces the expression of inflation factors, the maduration of dendrical cells and the synthesis of the type I (IFN) interferons that limit the propagation of virus and accelerate the viral antigen.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help virus to escape immune responses.
Successfully, the adaptive immune response takes place in the fight against virus.
The T Linfocytes, including the T CD4+ and CD8+ cells, comply with an important role in the defence.
The TCD4+ cells stimulate the B cells to produce specific anticuerpos for virus, and the TCD8+ cells directly take the infected cells with the virus.
The T co-operator cells produce proinflamatory vicinities to help defensor cells.
However, coronavirus may prevent the functions of the T cells by bringing the appthosis of the T cells.
The humoral immunity, including complements such as C3a and C5a and anticuerpos, is also essential to combat viral infection.
For example, the anti-islated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exagered reaction of the immunity system locally generates a large number of free roots that can cause serious damage to pulmones and other organs, and in worse cases, multi-organic falls and even death.
The infection of SARS-CoV-2, characterized by the appearance in conglomerated, affects more likely to larger persons with pregnancy and female female.
It is common that people who are expressed to a large number of virus or whose immunity functions are committed have more likely to be infected than others.
The average estimated incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is from 1 to 14 days, mostly between 3 and 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a 1099 case study shows that incubation period was of 3 days in average and weighed from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described before, shows that the incubation period was 4,8 days ( between 3,0 and 7,2) based on the demograph of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adjust the most effective quarantine time as a result of the most precise period of incubation; this is how it is for the infected asintomic persons to transmit virus to others.
As usual practice, persons expressed to virus or infected usually should remain in quarter for 14 days.
Should the quarter extend for 24 days?
The fiber is the main and initial symptom of the COVID-19, which can be accompanied by any other symptom or by other symptoms such as sec, disnea, muscular pain, sea, head pain, gargane pain, rhythm, diarrhoe pain, diause, nausees and volmies.
Some patients had disnee or hypoxics once a week after the appearance of disease.
In serious cases, patients had evolved rapidly to develop huge respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acids and coagulopathy.
Patients with fibre or respiratory symptoms and aggressive fieber, even without pulmonary annomys in image studies, should be made testing of virus for a early diagnostic diagnosis.
A demographic study of the end of December 2019 indicated that the percentages of the symptoms were 98 per cent for the fiber, 76 per cent for the seed, 55 per cent for diagnosis and 3 per cent for diarreae; 8 per cent of patients were required for respiratory assistance.
Such hallazgos were reported in two recent studies of a family conglomerated and a conglomered caused by the transmission of an asintomic person.
Comparablely, a demographic study of 2012 demonstrated that patients with MERS-CoV were also fiber (98%), seed tox (47%) and disappeared (55%) as main symptoms.
However, 80% of them were required for respiratory assistance, much more than COVID-19 patients and in conjunction with MERS in terms of COVID-19.
Diarree (26%) and gargan pain (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In patients with SARS, the fiber (99% 100%), the seat tox (29% 75%), the disnee (40%,42%), the diarrhoea (20,25%) and the warrant pain (13% 25%) were the main symptoms and respiratory assistance were approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
For the 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was of 2% when the cases confirmed was 66 576 around the world.
In similar way, SARS mortality for November 2002 was 10 per cent in 8096 cases confirmed.
For MERS, in accordance with a democratic study of June 2012, mortality was 37 per cent in 2494 cases confirmed.
In a previous study, R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was high and was high up to 6.47 with a confidence interval (IC) of 95% from 5,71 to 7.23, while the SARS-CoV R0 was only along with 2 to 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV regarding symptoms, mortality and R0 are presented in Table 1.1.
The previous numbers suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater propagation capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but it is less than the two last.
So it is more difficult to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The appearance in solar conglomerateds happens within the same family or from the same meeting or vehicle, like a cross.
Patients may have trips or residence previously in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected persons or patients in the two weeks before appearance.
However, it has been reported that people can lead the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that high patients from the hospital can return to the virus, alarm signal that the time of the quarantine should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced quantity of white globus in Perifera blood (especially linfocytes) in the early stage.
For example, linfopenia was observed with an < 4×109/l white containment of < 1×109/l, including a containing linfocits of < 1× 109/l, and high levels of aminotransferase apartment in 1099 patients with COVID-19.
The levels of hepatic and muscular enzymes and myglobin were high in the blood of some patients, and reactive C protein and erocytic seats were high in the blood of most patients.
In patients with serious cases, the level of diero-D, a product of the degradation of the present fibrine in the blood was high, and the containment of linfocits was progressively reduced.
Anomalships in the tourism radiographies of most patients with COVID-19, characterized by shadows or bilaterally smeraled glass in pulmones are detected.
Patients are about to develop an atipsy neumony, a soft pulmonary lesion and a high-respiratory syndrome (SDRA).
When SDRA is produced, uncontrolled inflation, liquidation acumulation and progressive fibrose affect gas exchange seriously.
The deficiency of type I and type II nermocytes reduces the superfactory level and increases superficial tension, which reduces pulmonary capacity to expand and increase the risk of pulmonary colapso.
Thus, the worst found in torch radiographies are often to be compared with the maximum gravity of disease.
On February 18, 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the exchange of nemotions, the training of a healine membrane and infiltration of linfocites in the interstition, and multinucleated synthetic cells in the pulmones of a patient died because of disease, which is consistent with the psychology of viral infection and SDRA, and similar to patients with SARS and MERS.
The ARN detection of SARS-CoV-2 by a polymerase-inverse polymerase reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criteria for the COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, because of the high rate of negative fairs, which could accelerate the epidemic, the clinical manifestations for diagnosis were started to be used (when no longer was based on RT-PCR only) in China on February 13, 2020.
An similar situation has also occurred with the SARS diagnostic.
Therefore, a combination of pre-accidents of diseases, clinical demonstrations, radiological laboratory tests and discovery is essential and essential for an effective diagnostic diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang Group described a use protocol of SHERLOCK based on CRISPR to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic flags of SARS-CoV-2 from 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copys by sample microlitro) by using a graduated vary in less than one hour that does not require compliant tools.
Successfully, the new technology can drastically increase sensitivity and convenience if it is checked in clinical samples.
Following the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, the doctors may mostly provide support care to patients with COVID-19, as they prove a variety of treatments that have been used or proposed before the treatment of other coronavirus, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (tabel 2).
These treatments include current or potential treatments with antiviral fimatics, immuno topers, steroids, plasma of patients recovered, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
It is also suggested to use the plasma of patients recovered for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are working to see who first developed anticuerpos and vaccines against virus.
SARS-CoV-2 is mainly attacking pulmones at the principle and probably also attacking other organs that express the ACE2, such as the digestive devices and rinoons.
However, respiratory disfunction and insufficientness are the greatest threat to patients and the main cause of death.
Consequently, respiratory assistance is critical to eliminate symptoms and save life, including general oxygenotherapie, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation in accordance with gravity of disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need an extracorporate membrane (OMEC), a modified cardiopulmonal insufficiency technique that is used for the treatment of cardiopulmon insufficiences or potentially mortal respiratory respiratory.
Furthermore, the maintenance of electrolytic balance, prevention and treatment of secondary and septic infections, and the protection of the functions of life bodies are also essential in patients with SARS-CoV-2.
It is known that the burden torment is the result of an exagerated reaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MERS.
Citizens' torment is a form of systhematic response characterised by release of a series of civics, including TNF eius, IL-1月, IL-2, IL-6, IFN月, IFN月, IFNgam and MCP-1.
These cigarettes lead to immunitary cells to liberate a huge amount of free roots that are the main cause of SDRA and multi-organic fall.
Immunosupression is essential for the treatment of civilian torments, especially in serious patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab have been used, a monoclonal anti-recepter of IL6, in order to address civil warming.
Other immuno top treatments for cyclines are the modulation of the immunitary response directed by the T; IFN-gam block, IL-1 and TNF; the inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; a subpressor of the 4-winning route of civic signaling, and HDAC inhibitors.
The steroids, such as immuno topers, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce inflation damage.
However, high dose steroides were not profitable for serious pulmonary lesions in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, severe secondary effects can be caused, in particular by the oost of syndrome, which affects the prognostic notably.
However, prudent use of corticosteroids in low-modern doses has been recommended for a short period for patients with COVID-19 in critical state.
At the date of this analysis, no antiviral treatment has been confirmed.
However, the effectiveness of redesivir, a nucleotic analog, managed by intravenous way in an American patient with COVID-19.
Redesivir is a new anti-viral flag developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marbourg virus.
Afterwards, the redesivir also demonstrated the potential to prevent other virus with ARN monocatenary, such as MERS and SARS virus.
Based on these, Gilead provided the complex to China to carry out a couple of tests infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there are great expectations for the results.
Furthermore, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as possible treatments for patients with adjacent respiratory symptoms.
Diarrea, nauseas, vitamins, hepatic damage and other adverse reactions may be produced after the treatment combinated with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other types used in patients should be carefully controlled.
Platform of recovered patients and anticuerpos generation
The extraction of the blood of patients recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients against the same disease or to protect healthy persons so that they do not fight disease is nothing new.
In fact, patients recovered are relatively high of anti-cuerpos against pathogeneus in blood.
Anticuerpos are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by the B linfocits to combat patologists and other foreign objects, and recognize certain molecules in the patologists and neutralize them directly.
On this basis, plasma was removed from the blood of a group of patients recovered from COVID-19 and was injected to 10 patients seriously patients.
His symptoms improved in 24 hours, accompanied by reduction of inflation and viral loads and better oxygen saturation in blood.
However, it is necessary to check and clarify this to propose the method for its large use until specific treatments are developed.
Furthermore, due to the therapeutic effects, some disasters related to plasma should be considered detentively.
For example, anticuerpos may exalt the immunitary response and cause civil liberation syndrome, which may cause mortal toxicity.
The concentration of anticuerpos in blood is usually low, and plasma demand is high to treat patients in critical state.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific anti-cuerops with sufficient speed to fight a global pandemia.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells of recovered patients and to identify genetic codes that encode effective anticuerpos or seek effective anticuerpos against virus's essential proteins.
So we can easily increase the production of anticuerpos.
MCT was used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects are of greatly dependent on a combination of several components in a formula that would go according to the diagnosis of a disease in accordance with MCT theories.
Most of the effective components are still unknown or are imprecisible, since it is difficult to extrace and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with moderate symptoms or for those receiving serious stages.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du chapters and Lian Hua Qing Wen were effective for COVID-19 treatment.
The main recovery rates in patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces of China used by MCT in 87 per cent of its patients, including Gansu (63.7 per cent), Ningxia (50 per cent) and Hunan (50 per cent), while the HCT province of Hubei was only 30 per cent of its patients with COVID-19, the lower recovery rate (13 per cent.
However, this is a very close comparison, since many other factors of impact, such as the quantity and gravity of patients, should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and her colleagues published a study in comparing the Western Medicinal treatment (MO) only with the combinated treatment of MO and MCT.
They discovered that the time necessary for the recovery of corporal temperature, the disappearance of symptoms and hospitalization was notably less in the MO+MCT group only.
What is more surprised, the empowerment rate of symptoms (of grave lies) was notably lower than in the MO+MCT group only (7.4% against 46.2%) and mortality was less in the MO+MCT group than only in the MO group (8.8% against 39%).
However, MCT's effectiveness and security continue to expect more testing on more screens and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of actions and to determine the effective components of the MCT treatment or its combinations as possible.
Patients with suspicion or confirmation of COVID-19 have generally much fear of highly contagious and even mortal disease, and people in quarantine also experience fuel, solity and anger.
Furthermore, infection symptoms such as fiber, hypoxia and tox, as well as the adverse effects of treatment, such as insommation caused by corticosteroids, can cause more carefulness and mental threats.
In the early phase of the SARS browser, a series of psychiatric morabilities, including them, continuing depression, concern, attacks of pánicomotriz, psychological symptoms, delirio and to suicid trends.
The race of contacts and the obligation quarters, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 browser, may make people feel more nervous and guilty for the effects of the account, quarantine and the stage in their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health should be given attention to patients with COVID-19, suspicional persons and those who are in contact with them, as well as the general public and needing.
Psychological support should include training of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and specific updates on the SARS-CoV-2 browser browser and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
The effective vaccines are essential to interrupte the trace of animal and human reservers infected to potential hospitals, and are intended to complement antiviral treatment in the control of emergency virus epidemics.
The efforts made to develop vaccines based on protein S to generate powerful neutralising anticuerpos and long-during or immunity protected by SARS-CoV.
Vacuums with live virus have been assessed in animal models for SARS.
However, the vital effect of these possible vaccines in older persons and lending models and their protection against infection by zoonotic origin must still be determined before the starting of a clinical study.
This is likely that SARS had expired 17 years ago and has not been registered any new case since then.
However, there still have cases and conglomerates of MERS in the Middle East which are spread to other regions because of the continuity of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
MERS has developed vaccination strategies, using disactivated virus, viral vectors, nanoparticulas, similar to virus and recycling proteins, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a secure and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immunity persons is an urgent and decisive task to control the current pandemia.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months in average) required for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronavirus.
As a new disease, COVID-19 began to demonstrate its complete clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can be gradually recovered without secure.
However, as occurred with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 also relates to high mortality and mortality in patients with serious cases.
Therefore, the creation of a prognostic model for disease is crucial that health agencies can prioritate their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on the clinical studies reported to the present, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognostic of patients with COVID-19 ( table 33):
Equality: age was the most important factor for the SARS prognostic, which also results for COVID-19.
COVID-19 was most occurred in patients from 30 to 65 years and 47.7% of those patients had more than 50 years in a study of 8866 cases, as previously described.
The patients who were requesting intensive care with more probability had subjacent comforts and complications and were significantly higher than those who would not require them (with average 66-year- 51), which suggests that age is a prognostic factor of COVID-19 evolution.
Sex: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 faces to 0.27/100 000), as previously described.
Complications and complications: patients with COVID-19 who require intense care with more probability suffer from an adjusted heart lection and arritmy.
The cardiac events were also the main cause of death in patients with SARS.
The SARS-CoV-2 can also be connected to positive ACE2 colangiocytes, which can cause hepatic disfunctions in patients with COVID-19.
It should be emphasized that age and subyacente diseases are strongly linked and can be interfered among themselves.
Anormal laboratory results: C reactive protein level (PCR) in blood reflects the gravity of inflation or the legation of the tissued and has been proposed as an possible prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
Furthermore, the correlation between the PCR level and gravity and the progress of COVID-19 was proposed.
Furthermore, a high level of dehydrogenasa (LDH), aparted aminotransferasa (AST), alanina aminotransferasa (ALT) and Chinese creatin (CK) can also help predict the evolution of the patient.
These enzymes are intensely expressed in several organs, in particular, heart and heat, and are free when the teeth is damaged.
Finally, traditional brandmarks of heart or hepatic disfunction.
Principales of clinical symptoms: the torax radiographie and the temporary progress of clinical symptoms should be considered together with other symptoms for the prediction of clinical displacements and complications of COVID-19.
The use of steroids: as described previously, steroids are immuno topers that are commonly used as an appropriate treatment for infected diseases in order to reduce the graveness of inflation damage.
Since the use of high corticosteroid doses in patients with serious SARS was extended, many survivors developed avascular syncrosis with permanent incapacity and bad life quality.
So, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stars: as previously described, during the COVID-19 browser, many patients have suffered an extraordinary stress, since generally, have supported long periods in quarantine and extreme uncertainty and attended the death of neighbouring families and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychological treatment and long-term support to these patients in order to help them recover the stress and return to their normal life.
In accordance with the demographic studies carried out to the present, COVID-19 seems to have different epidemiological characteristics of the SARS.
Besides replication in lower respiratory paths, SARS-CoV-2 can be effectively replicated in the higher respiratory paths and causes slow symptoms or not causes symptoms in the early phase of infection, as happens with other coronavires that cause common fresh.
Thus patients infected in early phase or in incubation may produce a large number of virus during their daily activities, which is extremely difficult to control the epidemic.
However, it was considered that the transmission of SARS-CoV would happen when patients were seriously sick, while most of them would not happen at the early phase.
Finally, the current COVID-19 browser is much more serious and difficult to control than the SARS browser.
At this time there are great efforts in China, including the Wuhan closure of around the cities and the quarter of almost all the population with the hope of interrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures are generating a notable damage in the economy and other sectors of the country, the amount of new patients is declined, which indicates the dissolution of the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic prevision, the browser will be concluded for March and the starting stage shall take 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimists.
Paul Hunter, and al., said that COVID-19, which seems to be significantly more infected than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, and al., created a model to prevent epidemia's evolution and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could affect two thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was discovered both nazals and farmineges in patients who had been recovered and left hospital 2 weeks before, which indicates that recently identified virus could be converted to a similar cyclic episode like influenza.
However, promise signals in China have been seen due to decrease in the amount of new cases, which indicates that current strategies could be operated.
Originally, it was predicted that the ebola would cause to a million cases with average millions of deaths.
However, through a quarantine and a stretch island, the disease has been controlled.
It may be, as SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 is disabled infections and eventually extracted or becomes a less pathogic virus that co-exacts with humans.
A comparison of COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is followed (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmisable through the tower or the smooth, and may also through the direct contact with contaminated materials with virus.
The virus has also been detected in the chains, which plans a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of the cases were likely caused by infections in noocomes, including 17 patients with other previous diseases and 40 medical care providers.
Therefore, precaution should be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social, family, colleagues and, even, translated to patients or infected persons.
The first defense line that could be used to reduce infection risk is the use of masks; the use of chirurgic masks and masks with respirator N95 (section 1860) helps control the propagation of viruses.
The chirurgic masks implies that liquids of a potentially infected person are transmitted through the air or reached to the surfaces, from where other persons could be transmitted.
However, only N95 masks (number 1860) can be protected against inhalation of both small and 10-80 nm, and only 5% of the vires can perpetuate them completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both average about 85 nm.
Since particules can fall up to five appaled cherry masks, medical care providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (number 1860 series) and not cherrry masks.
Besides the masks, medical care providers should use isolation battles to measure to reduce contact with viruses.
Virus can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while using a N95 mask; it is possible that the virus had entered into his body through its inflated eyes.
Therefore, medical care providers should also use protectionists or transparent care while working with patients.
For the public generally affected or potentially affected areas, it is suggested that the population was laid hands with more infective jabons on the usual basis, try to stay home in a voluntary quarter and limit contact with people who can be infected.
Three pieces are considered to be a proper distance to keep people away from a patient.
These are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and avoid virus propagation.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus for the human world, his high homaology with SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused great warning in China for its experience with the SARS browser in 2003.
However, it was not only until 19 January 2020 that the Director of the Wuhan Coordination Centre was calmed by the citizens saying that the new virus had a low contagious and a limited reproduction capacity, and that there would be no problems to prevent and contain disease.
This message noticed the warning of the public, particularly at a time when the whole country was prepared for the Prime Federation, and the critical moment was disappeared to contain minimum disease in Wuhan.
China control agencies should learn from this hard selection and take decision-making improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more careful by making public advertisements, as each word imported for the citizens and may change their action or decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive information of clinics, rather than waiting for formal doctors or officials; (3) more restrictives to contain a possible epidemic at its early phase, rather than to try to calm the public; and (4) more regular in the implementation of adapted and effective images in order to improve public awareness about epithematic diseases and to try and improve the reaction system of society.
The COVID-19 browser caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus started at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, all China and about 50 countries have been distributed in the world at the time of this analysis.
Since virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similar events between COVID-19 and SARS symptoms, the COVID-19 browser has generated the sensation of SARS.
However, there are some notory differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects younger people than young and more women than women, and gravity and mortality are also larger in ages than young people.
SARS has more mortality than COVID-19 (10,91% against 1,44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even though they do not present symptoms, while patients with SARS generally do it when seriously sick, which generates a greater difficulty to contain COVID-19 in comparison with SARS.
This explains, partly, why SARS-CoV-2 has been very faster and generalized than SARS-CoV.
The regular ARN test for SARS-CoV-2 can be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, healed patients can give positive in the virus again.
These results increase drastically the risk that the virus is propained.
As soon as rapid progress in COVID-19 investigation, several important issues remain as follows:
Where did the SARS-CoV-2 go?
Although a 96% genetic homology between SARS-CoV-2 and two coronaviros similar to SARS is found, it is not yet possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 come from the wallets.
What animal was the middle kind that transmitted the virus of the original housed, we say, the murmurers, the humans?
Without knowledge of responses to number 1 and 2, you can't break the transmission effectively, and the browser can resurrect at any time.
Although the molecular model and biochemic tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is one of the ACE2, how exactly the virus enters into the cells of the respiratory paths and causes the later pathological changes?
Are the virus also one of the cells expressing ACE2 in other bodies?
Without clear answers to these questions, a fast and necessary diagnostic diagnostic cannot be achieved and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemy continue?
How does the virus evolute genetically while transmitted among humans?
Will it be converted to a global pandemia, it will be extracted as the SARS or will regularly resurrect as the gripe?
Although you can take some time, it is essential to seek answers to these questions and to many others.
Yet, consider what I mean, we have no more option to stop epidemic as soon as possible and to return to our normal life.
Benogenic sources of human cronvirus
Change and adaptation have stimulated the coevolution of coronavirus and their guests, including human beings, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, two human crowds had caused lower diseases, such as common disappearance.
The paintings of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS) and respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS) have invested the curve when discovered how destruction and mortal can be an infection by human coronars.
The rise of SARS-CoV-2 in Central China at the end of 2019 he put the coronavirus in the centre of attention and surprised us with high transmissibility and a reduced patogenicity compared to his brother, the SARS-CoV.
The infection by human coronavirus is a zoonosis and would be useful to know the songs of the human coronars.
Most human coronavires have their origin in the murcielagos, in which they are not patologists.
The intermediate reservation guests of some human coronavires are also known.
Identify animal hospitals have direct impacts in the prevention of human diseases.
Investigate interactions between coronavirus and guests in animals may also roll important information on human pathogenecy.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the existing knowledge of the seven crowds of humans, with an appreciation in the history of their discovery, as well as in their zoonotic origins and in the transmission between species.
We are notablely compared and contrasted the various human crowds from the perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current epidemic of cronvirus 2019 (COVID-19) disease is analyzed in this context.
Furthermore, the requirements for the changes of outcomes and the implications of virus evolution in the graveness of disease are highlighted.
The coronavirus belongs to the Coronaviridae family, which includes a positive ARN monocatenary group.
These viruses, which host the largest genomy, from 26 to 32 kilobases, among ARN viruss, were called "coronavirus" because of their morphology, through the crowds that are under a microscopion.
With regard to their structure, coronavirus have non-septed genoms that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contain two major open-reading frameworks (ORF1a and ORF1b), translated into polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab.
Poliproteins are still further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, named nsp1月16.
The remaining part of the genome contains ORF for structural proteins, including spics (S), bottle (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A series of specific accessory proteins of each line are also encoded by different lines of coronavir.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, the coronavirus are classified in four genders (aleroavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and detacoronavirus), including the gender of betacoronavirus contains the majority of human coronas and is subdivided in four lines (A, B, C and D).
The philogenetic evidence showed that murcielagos and royders are the source of genes of most altreronavirus and betacoronavirus, while the birds are the main reservation of the gammacoronavirus and detacoronavirus.
During thousands of years, coronavirus constantly crossed the barriers of the species, and some have surrounded as important human patologists.
Before the date, seven crowds of humans are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are altreronavirus.
The other five betacoronavirus are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, cronvirus of severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), coronavirus of the respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause lower symptoms, such as a common or diarrhoe.
The SARS-CoV, the MERS-CoV and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogen and cause serious infection of the lower respiratory paths in a relatively higher number of patients, with a higher probability to develop the adjusted respiratory syndrome (SDRA) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first chapel of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the naal segretion of patients with common fresh in the middle of 1960.
Since then, more knowledge was collected by HCoV-229E HCoV-OC43 studies, which cause self-limited symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS browser, it was a widely accepted concept that human infection generally is inofensive.
The SARS browser that occurred in 2003 is one of the most destroyers in the current history and infected more than 8,000 people, with a crucial loyalty of about 10%.
10 years later, the breath of respiratory syndrome of the Middle East (MERS) placed a persistent epidemic in the Arab peninsula with speradial propagation to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which later was named SARS-CoV-2, is the resultant agent of the epidemic on the cursing disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), which has been covered more than 3120 lives and has infected more than 91,000 people at 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been sounding and the world must be prepared for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemia near.
The seven human coronavires have a zoonotic origin in murcielagos, rats or home animals.
Several evidence lines support the evolutive source of all human cronvirus in the wallet, in which virus are well adapted and are not patologic, but present great genetic diversity.
COVID-19 epidemics have made huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Strengthening the synotic origins of human crowds provides a framework to understand the natural history, the impulsive force and the factors of restriction of the salt between species.
This could also lead or facilitate the search for intermediate and simplified animal hospitals of SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications in the prevention of propagation in the future.
In this analysis, we present a general description of the synonymic origins, the transmission between species and the pathogeney of human coronas.
In particular, we stress and analyse the common subject that human crowd viruss usually are not pathogènes in their natural reservation guests, but that pythogens will be returned after transmission between species to a new guest.
We also consider the tendency of evolution of human coronavirus, in which the increase in sudden transmission gains the decrease of patogenicity.
The evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 current browser is also analyzed in this context.
The coronavirus of animals has been known since the end of the 1930s.
Before the first time the B814 HCoV-229E naal segment of patients who had constrained a common fresh, different coronavirus had been isolated in different infected animals such as the dog, the mouse, the vacation, the skin, the pack and the dog.
In the last decades, seven human crowds have been identified.
A short resume of the history of the discovery of human cronological cronological cronological cronologists ( table 1) would be information and instruction.
The first HCoV-229E chapter was isolated from the respiratory paths of patients with infection of the higher respiratory paths in 1966 and later was adjusted to growing in cell lines WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E presented common refrigerator symptoms, such as head pain, smoothed, generally damage and warranty pain, with fiber and toxic in 10.12.20020% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the organic culture and the post-reached step in the brass of milk rats.
The clinical characteristics of infection by HCoV-OC43 seems to be similar to HCoV-229E caused by HCoV-29E, whose symptoms are identical to the infections by other pyrogens of respiratory paths, such as viruss of influenza A and rhyvirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed by the world and are predominantly transmitted during the winter station in temperature climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by a period of disease of around 2 weeks.
In accordance with a study with human volunteers, healthy persons infected with HCoV-229E developed a common milk feed.
Only some inmunocomputered patients presented a serious infection of the lower respiratory paths.
The SARS, also known as "atipsy neumony", has occurred the first pandemia caused by a well-documented human crowd in the history of humanity, and the ethological agent is the SARS-CoV, the third human crown that was discovered.
The first case of SARS was returned to the end of 2002 in the province of Guangdong, China.
The SARS epidemic had been the result of 8096 cases reported with 774 deaths and had been paid by many countries and continents.
Besides the superpropagators, it was calculated that each case could happen nearly two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the appearance of the viral load to the tenth day of disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV are initially present myalgie, head pain, fever, general and smoothy, followed by disnee, tos and respiratory difficulties as the later symptoms.
Linfopenia, changed hepatic function and high level of Quinana are common anormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Difficulated alveolar damage, the proliferation of epitelic cells and an increase in macrophates are also observed in patients with SARS.
Approximately 20-30% of patients later require intensive care and mechanical respiratory assistance.
Besides the lower respiratory paths, several organs, among them, gastrointestinal tube, heating and riñ, may also be affected in these serious cases, normally accompanied by a civilian torment, which might be mortal, especially in immunodeprimed patients.
The virus was the first time from the biopsypsy to open sky of a family of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then great efforts have been made to investigate human coronas.
HCV-NL63 has been identified from a seven-month child in the Netherlands at the end of 2004.
At first, it was determined that children were prevalent, older adults and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of coriness, conjuntivitis, fibre and bronquiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus of a nice sample taken by a child of eight months that would suffer neumony in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed by the world.
It was estimated that HCV-NL63 causes approximately 4,7% of common respiratory diseases, and its maximum impact happens at the beginning of summer, primary and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is connected to obstructive laringitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was an isolated by a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with neumony and acarquilitis in Hong Kong.
Besides the neumony and the bronquiolitis acquired in the community, HCoV-HKU1 was informed that asma exacerbations were linked.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found in the world and caused leak respiratory diseases.
These four human crowds acquired in the community have been well adapted to humans, and generally less to change highly pathogenal diseases, although there were accidents because of unknown causes, such as in a few of the case of a more virgulous HCV-NL63 subtype, which recently had been reported that grave infection of lower respiratory paths in China was caused.
In general, when these human crowds are acquire the capacity to be effectively transmitted and continued to humans, they also become less virulent or patologists.
MERS-CoV was the first time of a patient's pulmony of 60-year-old neumony developed in Saudi Arabia.
Although most of the cases confirmed in the middle East are originaries, cases imported with close contacts in several European and Tunisia have been registered.
Another secondary browser was produced in South Korea in 2015 with 186 cases confirmed.
MERS’s clinical manifestations are assembled to SARS, characterized by progressive neumony.
In difference with SARS, many patients with MERS have also developed an aggregate renal insufficience, which is only given to MERS between human cronvirus diseases.
More than 30% of patients present gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrea and vitamins.
On February 14, 2020, more than 2500 cases confirmed in the laboratory were registered, with a high least of 34.4 per cent, which turns to MERS-CoV into one of the most widespread viruss for humans.
Since the end of December 2019, conglomers were detected of patients with neumony in Wuhan, the province of Hubei, China, who were re-spectally associated to SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the infection of the lower respiratory paths caused by SARS-CoV-2 a emergency of international public health and also described COVID-19 disease.
On 3 March 2020, 90 053 cases were confirmed worldwide, with a crucial loyalty of 3,4 per cent.
It is notable that the readiness in Hubei, China is 4,2 per cent, while outside it is 1,2 per cent.
The SARS-CoV-2 causes serious respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which is presented as fiber, tos and disnea.
Diarrea has also been observed in some patients.
Newmony is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly evolute the respiratory syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar because of a high nucleoid sequence homology of 82%, they are categorised in different branches of philogenetic tree.
The SARS-CoV-2 apparently is less patologic, but more transmisible in comparison with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asintomic persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been informed, which could contribute to their rapid propagation throughout the world.
In comparing and contradicting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six cronvirus humans, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and the duration of human disease course are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 continues the general trend of the other six crowds of humans.
Secondly, the graveness of COVID-19 symptoms is between the SARS-CoV and the four human crowds acquired in the community (e.g. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCOV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, the infection by SARS-CoV-2 represents more frequently in human infections by cronvirus acquired in the community, which includes the presentation of non-specific or leve symptoms or, including, the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of COVID-19 serious cases is also observed as happens with SARS-CoV infection, although the relationship is a little smaller.
Thirdly, the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns both of human coronavirus acquired in the community as well as SARS-CoV.
On one side, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is at least equal to high as the human crowds acquired in the community.
On the other hand, you still check if the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was reduced after human pasts, as happens with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as well as other human coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
If the original transmission of SARS-CoV-2 fulfils an important role, such as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, it should still be solved in future studies.
A special review is also interested to assess whether SARS-CoV-2 could exhibition statistics, as is the case of human crowds acquired in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including their transmissibility, patogenicity and sustainable propagation after human pasts, will have influence in the final displacement of COVID-19.
The four crowds of humans acquired in the community caused slow symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
Since another perspective, it might also be true that humans have been well adapted to these four human crowns.
In other words, both of human crowds could be survive.
Human crowds that cause serious diseases in humans and human developments serious diseases have been eliminated.
For this purpose, human coronavirus must be replicated in humans in sufficient measure to allow adjustable changes against the hamper restriction factors.
In this sense, while more time continues the SARS-CoV-2 browser and how many more infected people, more will be the probability of being fully adapted to humans.
If it is well appropriate, your transmission in human would be difficult to detach through the quarent or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four crowds acquired in the community have moved in human populations and have caused common refrigerators in immunocompetants.
These virus do not need an animal reserve.
In contrast, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are not well adapted to humans and their human transmission is insufficient.
They need to keep and distribute in their zoonotic books and seek the opportunity to spread to human objectives that may be through one or more intermedia or more hospitals and simplifying.
The SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics as well as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and the four crowds of humans acquired in the community.
It is highly transmisable as human crowds acquired in the community, at least at the time.
However, it is more pyrogenous than human cronvirus in the community and less pathogical than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to see whether humans will be fully adapted and moved between humans without a hampered animal of reservation or intermedia.
Before analyzing the animal sources of human coronaviros, we will be useful to consider the definitions and characteristics of evolutive, natural, reserved, intermedia and simplified human coronaries.
An animal acts as an evolutive warming of a human coronavirus if he has a closely related ring that shares a high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and is not patogenic in this guest.
Likewise, a busy of reservation visits to a human crowd constantly and long-term crowd.
In both cases, guests are naturally infected and are natural guests of human corona or their parent virus.
Instead, if human coronavirus is introduced into the intermediate host before or almost at the same time of its introduction in humans, it is not well adapted to the new guest and will be pyrogenic.
The intermediate hospit can act as the synonymic source of human infection and complement the role of hosted to facilitate the allowance of virus to be transparently reflected and then transmitted to humans to facilitate human infection levels.
A human coronavirus can provoca infection in the housed terminal if it cannot support its transmission to the middle host.
In contrast, human coronavirus can also be adjusted to the middle guest and, even, generating long-term enemy.
In this case, the intermediate host is becomes a natural reservation guest.
The epidemiological data reperspectively showed that the initial case of SARS had been contacted with coat animals.
The following investigations on seroprevalence indicated that animal traders had a greater prevalence of IgG anti-SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
Fives of embarked palmes (Larvata Pagauma) and a dog on live animal markets were the first identified by virus like SARS-CoV, which are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more cases of SARS were registered after killing all market civenes.
However, it was informed that wild or non-exposed palms had more negatively been given in SARS-CoV, which suggests that the bulks of the palms in massed would only act as an intermedia pilar, but not as a natural reservation of SARS-CoV.
It is notable that 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have anti-SARS-CoV anticuerpos, they can not be rejected by the possibilities that several species of small mammiferous are also acting as an accelerator intermediate hospitals of SARS-CoV.
All of them seem to be terminal guests of the SARS-CoV.
The following searches of the natural animal housed of SARS-CoV have revealed a strendly related crowd of murcilagos, called CoV HKU3 of Rhinolophus associated with the SARS (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese herrad wallets.
These wallets are positive in anti-SARS-CoV anti-cuerpos and the genome sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
These and other murcileum coronavirus share a nercleotide sequence of 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
These studies have settled the basis of the new concept that the walls have hosted emergency pyrogens in humans.
Several coronavirus similar to SARS (SL-CoV) have also been identified in murcilelagos, but no one, except a WIV1 name, can be isolated as a live virus.
It is known that the human enzyme of angiotensina 2 (ACE2) is the recipient of SARS-CoV.
It was demonstrated that WIV1 obtained from a steel sample of steel uses the ACE2 of wallets, civeds and humans as recipients to enter the cells.
Summary, patients with convalent SARS dreams were able to neutralize WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the most closely relating to SARS-CoV in murcilees, which shares a 95% nercleatoid sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and that murcielagos are not the immediate reservation hosted by SARS-CoV.
According to the philosogenic analysis, the MERS-CoV is categorised in the same group as the CoV-HKU4 murciélago and CoV-HKU5.
The CoV-HKU4 of murcileago and MERS-CoV use the same receipter of the hospit, dipeptidil peptidase 4 (DPP4) for the entry of the virus.
The ARN Polimerase-dependent ARN MERS-CoV sequences are more close to their sides of betacoronavirus identified in Europe and Africa.
Until now, you can't be found a MERS-CoV living in wild wallets.
The MERS-CoV and its closest parent, the CoV-HKU25 muciel, share a nucleoid sequence homology of only 87%.
Finally, the wallet could not be the immediate host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that drugs are seropositive in neutralising anti-terms of the MERS-CoV, as well as camels originating from Middle East in several African countries.
A MERS-CoV vital virus found in humans was isolated from drug drug drugs, which still supports more than camels act as a good reservation hosts of MERS-CoV faith.
Furthermore, it should be emphasized that, in general, lower symptoms were observed, but a massive propagation of virus infected camels for investigations with MERS-CoV.
Infected camels disseminate viruss not only by respiratory way, but also by fecal-oral way, which is also the main way of propagation of muscle virus.
However, there are still questions, since many cases confirmed by MERS have not been contacted with camels before the appearance of the symptoms, which are reasonably attached to the transmission between human or unknown transmission routes that involve non-recognised animal species that are hosted by the MERS-CoV.
The SARS-CoV-2 shares a nucleoid homology of 96.2% with a cronvirus of murcielagos, RaTG13, aislate of Rhinolophus firms.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the divergence of sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large for a parental relationship.
Thus, the wallets could not be the immediate reservation guests of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are found in the future cronvirus of practically identical murmures.
Presumptively, the intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2 should be between the forest species that are sold and killed in the Huan marine market, with which many of the initial cases of COVID-19, which indicates likely animal transmission events to human.
A number of recent studies based on the metagenic sequence suggested that a group of small mamariferos in danger, known as pangolines (Manis Javanica), could also accommodate ancestral betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genoms of this new pangoline coronavirus share 85-92% with SARS-CoV-2.
However, RTG13 is equal to stretchly related, with a 90% identity at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
In two similar virus sublines, such as SARS-CoV-2 are grouped in the philogenetic tree, one of which shares a domination of the recipient (RBD) more similar to SARS-CoV-2, with an aminoid sequence of 97.4%.
In contrast marked, the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite a greater level of sequence homology throughout the genome.
A previous study in patient pangolines also reported the viral co-sponding in pulmon samples, which are also related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted various manual combination and healing methods to generate a partial genome sequence that included around 86.3% of the full Viral Genome.
We can't decline the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal guests of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is no evidence that it supports a direct origin in the SARS-CoV-2 pangolin because of the frequency of sequence between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronavirus related to the SARS-CoV-2.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even less than between SARS-CoV-2 and the betacoronavirus related to the SARS-CoV-2.
The evolutive path of SARS-CoV-2 in wallets, pangolines and other mammiferos must still be set.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in RBD between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, the betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, the SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest genom sequence homology.
It is extremely speculative that the high comparison level between RBD betacoronavirus pagolines related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 should be the average electivity-convergent evolution.
A contra-proposal defines a recombination between the betacoronavirus pagolines related to SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in the third species of silver animal.
As an impulsor force in evolution, the recombination is extended between the betacoronavirus.
There is still no conclusion on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly patologic human cronvirus, the zoonic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 was considered.
The philogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E could have been originated from the crocileum crowd, while parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in royors.
It was informed that an ARCoV.2-onavirus of the mountains Apalaches was identified in a three-color wallet in North America was a close relationship with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another crowd of murcilegos, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/9/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, even though it was understood of the camels as intermediate hospitals.
For more clearness, the knowledge that is available to the time of the animal origins of the known human coronaus is summarized in figure 1 and Table 2.
The philogenetic analysis has shown evidence of human transmission events between species in the history.
When HCOV-OC43 crossed between species to infect humans from winter animals in 1890, a respiratory infection pandemia was registered.
The transmission predecessors between species of HCoV-229E are not known so precisely.
The HCoV-229E was found alesterronavirus of steadily related to the HcoV-229E.
Among them is a alertronavirus of alpacas.
Various evidence lines support the transmission of the trafficking virus to humans directly.
First of all, in difference with alphas, humans could have contacted the murcilegues in a shared ecological neck.
Instead, people have close contact with the alpaces.
Secondly, the HCOV-229E alebraviros related to HcoV-229E are different and non-pathogenes in the walls, while the alfabet aviones caused a brown of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, the alevaronavirus of alpaces in silver animals has not been found.
Therefore, it cannot be declined to the possibility of acquire alertronavirus related to HCoV-229E.
In fact, murcielagos are the direct source of pathogen virus in humans, such as rabia virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Finally, it would not be too surprised that the wallets will transmit HCoV-229E to humans directly.
Alternatively, while murmuring alebraviros act as HCoV-229E genetic accent, the alpaces and drugs could act as intermediate hospitals transmitted to human viruses, in particular in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves an excellent example of transmission between species, murcile to drugs, and drug drugs.
The evolutive source of the MERS-CoV in the wallets, is discovered with its initial identification, and has also been supported by post-recovering findings.
It is obvious that the wallets contribute, with an acquired prosecution of virus species, to exchange genetic fragments between species and to transmission between species.
Longiveness, deeply populate colonies, close social interaction and great capacity to fly, are all the favourable conditions that become murmurers in the ideal virus propaguer.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV has been introduced into the drugs per decades.
It is well adapted to these chambers, who have passed to be a middle guest, to be a hamper of stability and natural reservation.
MERS-CoV causes very lower disease and maintains relatively lower change rates in these animals.
Their expert transmission to humans is an accident and humans continue to be a terminal host of MERS-CoV, as the transmission is unsubstantive.
In comparison with the role of chambers in the MERS-CoV transmission, the role of the pangolines, if it was, is different in the SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
In particular, pangoline betacoronavirus are highly pyrogenic in the pangolines.
It may be a terminal hospital of the betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, as well as the civetes in the case of SARS-CoV.
A number of opportunities for transmission between species of SARS-CoV-2 of human animals, should be confirmed or discharged in future studies.
First of all, murcilegos could be the reservation host of a virus related to SARS-CoV-2, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological nick with the wallets, through murmuring or carbon miniature.
Secondly, the pangolines could be one of the intermediate accelerators in which a virus with SARS-CoV-2 was recently introduced.
Humans against virus through the murder and the consumption of meat meat.
Many mammarifers, including domestic animals, may be potential to SARS-CoV-2.
A study of anticuerpos in domestic and silver animals is required.
Thirdly, as mentioned before, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 SA could have occurred in a third species that has been contacted both with wallets and pangolines.
The search for animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Besides the different types of animal bones, three main factors in viral terms also fulfill a important role in facilitating the crowds of species barriers.
First, its relatively high change rates in the ARN replication.
In comparison with other monocatenary viruss of ARN, the change rates estimated from coronavirus could be considered "moderated" to "altitudes", with a average replacement rate of ~10-4 per year, by site 2, according to the adaptation phase of coronavirus to new guests.
The coronavirus have an exorribonucle of reading control, whose elimination leads to extremely high change and attention, or, including, inviability.
Surely, it is known that the nucleotidic redesivir replication of coronavir by inhibition of this exorribonuclease and ARN-dependent polymerase.
Redesivir is one of the more proper agents anti-SARS-CoV-2 testers that have been tested in clinical tests.
However, the change rates of coronavirus are close to a million times higher than those of their guests.
Furthermore, the changing rate is high when coronavirus are not well adapted to the hospital.
In comparison with SARS-CoV, which has a high change rate, the SARS-CoV-2 change rate apparently is less, which suggests a higher level of adaptation to humans.
It is expected that another guest has already been adapted close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is also applicable to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to drugs.
In theory, it is impossible that genetic results make vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 rapidly affect their effectiveness.
Secondly, the ARN genome long of the coronavirus operates additional plastics in the change of genome for changes and recombination and thus increases the probability of coevolution between species, which is appropriate to appear new coronavirus when appropriate conditions are given.
This is supported by the unique opening frameworks and the functions of the encoded proteins towards the genome address.
Thirdly, the coronavirus change aleatorially and often plants during the replication of the ARN by a unique "copy-choice mechanism".
In an host acting as a mixture vehicle, the line change is often produced during the transscription of ARN of coronavirus.
ARN of full and subgenics highly homologics could be accompanied to generate new coronavires.
Natural recombination demonstration has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in a crowd of animals, such as the SL-CoV of mucielago and the CoV-HKU9 of mucikelelago.
Virus interaction relating to transmission
Besides the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receiver is another key factor that affects the transmission between species.
The recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed positive selection in kinds of transmission events.
Based on the comparative analysis between human and cived SARS-CoV human cepas, the SARS-CoV is believed to experiment rapid adaptation in various guests, particularly with changes in the S protein RBD.
In general, the RBD of Protein S of a coronavirus interacted with the cell receiver and is intensely elected by the response of the guest.
In the SARS-CoV, the RBD is located in the 318-510 embarrassed in the S1 flag, with the human ACE2 and its viral entrance correlators.
The SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize ACE2 receivers of various animals, including wallet, civet, mouse and card dog, which allows the transmission between virus species.
In fact, only 6 aminoacide residues were different from human virus and cived in RBD and 4 of them were found in the ground of a unit to the recipient for interaction with the ACE2 receiver.
The SARS-CoV cived has changes of K479N and S487T in its RBD, which could increase the provision of the speed protein interaction with the ACE2 recipient.
In other words, these two substitutions of aminoatous could be fundamental for the adaptation of virus to humans.
It should be emphasized that the SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell receiver with SARS-CoV.
A difference of 30% between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 protein unit means that human protein unit S could be changed with ACE2.
In fact, an e-chromicscopy study points out of 10-20 times more than this unit in comparison with human ACE2 and SARS-CoV protein.
It will also be interested to determine whether any other receptor may be necessary for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
The HCOV-NL63 is also one of the ACE2 but with a different part of the S.
There are many other human recipients of coronavirus, such as aminopeptidasa N in HCoV-229E and silical 9-O-acetylated HCoV-OC43.
It may also be responsible for the exit adaptation of these coronavires in humans, after transfer of species from their guests.
Besides the cell receptors, the result of the transfer between human cronvirus species is also determined by other factors of dependence and restriction of the hospital.
The divergence of these proteins of warmed between humans and the homes of natural rescue of human crowds, such as murmures, drugs and royalers, could be an obstacle to transmission between species.
Human coronavirus must be used by the factors of the hospital dependence and subvert the hamper restriction factors to ensure that the transmission between species is extinct.
In this regard, certain moleculars in this important virus interaction area must still be identified and characterised.
It may result in an objective genome-effective research of the dependence factors and restriction of the hausted for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR Technology.
Apparition of new human coronavirus: we go out of brain
The diversity of crocileums of murcileous crooks gives a number of opportunities for the appearance of new human crowds.
In this sense, the crocileums of murcilegues act as the genetic accent of human coronars.
Furthermore, rapid change and genetic recombination also encourage the evolution of human coronaries and represent two important steps of this process.
For example, acquiring or loss of new protein codecing genes have the potential to change Viral phenotypes drastically.
Among the accessible SARS-CoV proteins, ORF8 was considered to be important in the adaptation of humans, since the ORF8-based stroke virus was isolated with SARS-CoV, but it was determined that different ORF8 proteins were encoding.
A elimination of 29 nocleoids of SARS-CoV characteristics was found in cepas isolated at the start of human epidemics.
This elimination is divided to ORF8 in ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is believed that it is an adaptive change that promotes the change of hospitals.
Furthermore, SARS-CoV has possible recombinations with alfa lines and gammacoronavirus, in which a large number of smaller recombining regions has been identified in the ARN polymerase dependent on ARN.
It was also identified recombinations in nsp9, most of the nsp10 and parts of the nsp14.
In the same way, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV epidemic occurrences of recombination between different lines, which happened in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other human cronvirus, in which human coronars are combined with other cronvires of animals in their non-structural genes.
It should also be warned that the artistic selection can contribute to unwillful changes in viral genoms, which most likely results from liberation of viruss from executed selection pressures, for example, by the immune system of the guest.
One example of these effects is the loss of an ORF4 full length in the HCoV-229E prototype prototype cep, due to the elimination of two nocleoids.
Although a ORF4 intacted in the HCoV-229E HCK could be observed, the altreronavirus of alpaces presents a single nucleotide, which is a change of framework.
Finally, although not less important, the evolution of new human crowds is also inspired by the selection pressure in their hosts of reservation.
No symptoms were detected or only left symptoms were detected when murcilees were infected with coronavirus, which indicates mutual adaptation between coronavirus and murcilegos.
It seems that the walls are well adapted to the coronavirus anatomic and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activity of proinflamatory response in the wallets effectively reduced the plaology caused by coronavirus.
Furthermore, the activity of natural murder cells in the murcills is deleted because of the positive regulation of the inhibition of natural murder cells NKG2/CD94 and the lower level of expression of the molecules of class I of the greater Hitocompatibility complex.
Furthermore, the high level of reactive species of oxygen (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of the murcileagos could abolish the replication of coronavirus and affect the control of reading of the exorribonuclease, which brings the selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogen virus cepas when they are introduced into a new hamed.
These pyrogenic crowds could also be evolved by recombination, which would lead to acquiring new proteins or protein characteristics for adjusting the hamper.
There is therefore no casuality that three new human crowds have appeared in the last two decades.
The coronavires are not patologists or cause slow symptoms in their guests of reservation, such as walls and camels.
Energy replies without cause a strong immune response of the guest.
In this respect, the secrets of why there are an symptomic traders, and what causes serious infection cases.
The serious symptoms should be mainly the hyperactivation of immune response and the burden torment, whereas stronger the immunity response is, most seriously pulmonary damage is.
Instead, the immune response has been disconnected from the replication of coronavirus.
The same pollution strategy of immunity response could have benefits in anti-SARS-CoV-2 treatment.
The interferon response is particularly strong in the walls.
Therefore, the administration of type I interferon, at least at the early phase of human infection by SARS-CoV-2, should be profitable.
Furthermore, NLRP3 inflamasm in walls is defective.
According to this reason, the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflamasm with MCC950 could be useful in the COVID-19 treatment.
The appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 is still the general line that has brought to the appearance of the SARS-CoV and the MERS-CoV.
Although there has been a borrow betacoronavirus that shares a nercleotide homology of 95% with SARS-CoV, there is also a crowd of muscileums shared by a 96% homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been determined that the saRS-CoV markets and other animals are identical virus, there were no immediate intermediate hospitals of SARS-CoV-2.
Both of pangolines have been found notably Homologs to SARS-CoV-2, which indicates that the pangolines could act as one of the intermediate guests or that the pangoline betacoros could bring gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the questionnaires remain, there is no evidence that the SARS-CoV-2 is made by the man, whether it is deliberately or accidentally.
The coronavirus have recovered protagonism due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 browser.
The study of the coronavirus in murcile and other animals has deeply changed our perception of the importance of the zoonogenic origins and the animal reserves of human coronas in human transmission.
Vasta evidence showed that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 were originated in the wallets and were transferred to people through intermedia hospitals.
Since the infection by SARS-CoV was originated in the human and quota contact on the markets, closing the housed markets and killing the civeds that could have been effective to fraud the SARS epidemic.
Following this reason, the pangolines should be removed from the markets in order to prevent zoonotic transmission, taking into account the discovery of several betacoronavirus lines of pangolines closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, if and how the SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolines and other mammiferours remains to dilute in future investigations.
On the other hand, the MERS-CoV exists in drug drugs since a long time.
These camels are an important transport tool as well as a main source of meat, milk, cock and milk for the local population.
They are widely distributed by Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all chambers to control MERS, as was done in China with wild animal markets to prevent SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 propagation.
In order to prevent recurrent MERS brows, an integral approach should be taken to develop effective vaccines against the MERS-CoV camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are not able to remove these virus, new genotypes could appear that cause brotes.
A variety of synotic coronavirus, they are moved into salvation.
In particular, the crocileums of murcilelagues with zoonotic potential are very different.
There are great opportunities that these zoonotic crowds are enhanced and gathered together, which would lead to the appearance of new coronavires that are more transmisible or more mortal in the future.
The culture of salvage animals in some places in China should be left to reduce inevitable contact between human and animals.
Since the bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparation and response plan should be taken.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a long time.
Stay in their own natural reserves until the opportunity to spread.
Although the wallets have many characteristics that promote virus propagation, human contact opportunities with walls and other silver species can be minimized if it is educated to the population to disappear.
The continuing monitoring of mammiferos is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronavirus and their natural guests, which will be useful to prevent transmission of animals to future human and animal brotes.
To conclude, the most effective way of preventing viral zoonosis is that humans are absent from the ecological nicks of natural stocks of zoonotic virus.
There are still few pieces in the symptomic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
First of all, if the wallets transmit a SARS-CoV-2 angry virus to the pangolines, it will be interesting to analyse what circumstances the wallet and the pangolines could share the same ecological neck.
Secondly, if murmurers have a direct role in human transmission, it should be determined how humans enter into contact with the walls.
Thirdly, if a third mammiferous acts as the real intermediate jacket, it should be diluted as interacted with the various species, including human, wallets and pangolines.
Finally, since many mammarifers, including domestic animals, could be potential to SARS-CoV-2, should be carried out experimental monitoring and infection.
It is already a wallet, a pangolin or another mammiferous, it is expected that the SARS-CoV-2 or its parent virus that are almost identical in their natural guests in the future.
Follow-up investigations in this area will dilute the evolutive way of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with significant implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19.
The criteria for diagnostics of the "sospechostics" and "Cases confirmed" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a rapid advice directive for the diagnostic and treatment of infection by the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and included our experience and represented a good reference to combat this pandemia around the world.
However, the disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing on the basis of the results of current investigations and experience in clinic practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are still updated.
In this letter, we answered a comment on our directive and provide the most recent diagnostic criteria of "sospecified" and "Caso confirmed" in accordance with the latest guidelines for the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Trade of the COVID-19 (seventh edition) which published the National Health Committee of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused a browser, which is now officially known as coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named coronavirus 2 of serious respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO calmed COVID-19 as a pandemia.
In order to combat the infection by SARS-CoV-2, our team developed a speed advice directive which was published online at the Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
He took much attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our consciousness and knowledge are gradually increasing on the basis of the results of current research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are still updated.
For example, the Directions for the Diagnostic and Trade of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have been published a total of seven editions and some contexts have been significantly changed.
Now, our director has received a comment from Zhou and al., we have submitted a simple classification proposal on the basis of its clinical experience.
His work has added new tests for our directive and also represents a valuable reference for this pandemia around the world.
We support our important work and express our gratitude.
However, its work is also needed to update according to the latest directives for COVID-19 Diagnosis and Trade (seven version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the Seventh Edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspect case is necessary to combine any point of the characteristics of epidemiological priorities with two points of clinical demonstrations to make an explosive analysis, or three points of clinical manifestations should be fulfilled if there are no clear epidemiological priorities:
Epidemiological predecessors: (1) Return or residence previously in the city of Wuhan and the Aldeaine zones, or other communities in which COVID-19 cases have been informed in the last 14 days before the appointment of the symptoms; (2) infective cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) contact prematures with patients with fibre or respiratory symptoms of the city of Wuhan, or other communities that have been informed cases of COVID-19 in the last 14 days before the appointment of symptoms; (4) contact groups with cases confirmed (week 2 or other communities in which have been informed cases of COVID-19, in the last 14 days before the appointment of the symptoms; (for examples of the cases of cases, confirmed cases of cases (week ≥ 2 or sempty).
Clinical Manifestations: (1) Fieber or respiratory symptoms; (2) characteristics infection images by COVID-19; (3) Total white glools accounts showing a container of normal, disminued or reduced in the early start stage.
The diagnostic of an case confirmed should be based on a suspect case with some characteristics of pathogen tests or beingological as follows: (1) A real-time reaction test for the polymerase in positive positive time for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the sequence of the complete viral genom that shows high homogenicity to the recognised new coronavirs; (3) resulted positive for the specific IgM anticuerpo and the IgG anticuerpo against SARS-CoV-2 in a test; or a change of IgG specific anticuerpo against the SARS-CoV-2 negative, or increased the title ≥4 times in the rehabilitation phase.
We can see that the trial of polymerase reaction in real time to detect nuclear acid in blood samples or respiratory routes was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The detection of the patologists of blood samples was added to the fourth January 27, 2020 (8 February 2020) and then beingological tests were added to the seventh edition.
{NS}
Furthermore, there are more evidence that remind us that we need to have awareness with the asintomic and attic symptomic patients.
Therefore, the flood diagramm Zhou and al. must be updated, since they have classified the person without clinical symptoms, as well as "fare risk".
The pointing system should also be checked in other clinical studies and practices.
To conclude, we hope they have overcome more direct tests and we call them to readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of "sospecified Case" and "subspected Case", we recommend to search and fulfil the new guidelines of its countries of origin.
Our team will also update our appropriate directors to provide help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths because of COVID-19, most of one day
Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths yesterday because of COVID-19 in one day.
It's the major number of deaths in one day due to virus.
To yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Discrimination and Investment Control (IEDCR) reported that the amount of registered cases was 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases remaining in their homes.
A total of 17 deaths was registered.
At an online information meeting, the Director of the IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said that victims were four men and a woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were more than 60 years, two between 51 and 60 years and one between 41 and 50 years.
He also said that two of the victims were of Daca.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemia.
One hospital officer said to Anadolu Agency, a middle of local news, that one of the falsees was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who were attending in the Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On the Sabbath, on an online advertisement, the Minister of Transport by Travel and Bangladesh, Obaidul Quader, said that the public transport would be stopped for more time of the planned first, until the next sabbath.
This suspension of public transport was initially started on 26 March and was planned to end the Sabbath 4 April.
The transport of essential products, such as medical, fuel and food supplies, was still allowed.
The first registered cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, two men who returned from Italy and the woman of one of them were treated.
On 19 March, there were three since they were recovered.
More than a million infections by SARS-CoV-2 around the world
Thursday, the total amount of cases of infections by coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 override a million throughout the world, according to the University of Johns Hopkins.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.
The Hito was placed the same day that Malawi confirmed his first infections by coronavirus and Zambia had his first death related to the coronavirus.
North Korea confirmed, on Thursday, that he was one of the few countries without infection by coronavirus.
At yesterday, the World Health Organization informed 1 051 635 cases confirmed, including 79 332 cases in the fourth hours before 10:00 a.m., European Central hour (UTC-0800), of 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus were registered, linked to at least 5900 deaths.
CBS News informed the data of the University of Johns Hopkins that the mercole had more than 1000 deaths in the United States caused by coronavir infections.
In the world, the countries declared more close measures to prevent the propagation of disease.
The Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the Moscow hall, extended the circle of the city until 1 May.
At national level, President Vladimir Putin stated that the Russians would continue to pay their wages without going to work until 30 April.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national emergency status 15 days; the vote was adopted with 215 votes, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended the toques to stay in the sanctuary towns La Meca and Medina throughout the day; previously, the tube of stay was held between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m.
Tailand planned to implement a tower of stay between 10:00 and 4:00 a.m.
The Governor of Ohio, Mike DeWine, announced that the state had extended his order to stay at home until 1 May.
Overmerged in Australia low the hygienic paper limits by transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian Supermercadors Woolworths and Coles declined their hygienic shop limits to two and a transaction package in all overmights of the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also implemented the limit of a package.
These restrictions were published as messages in the boxes and on the Facebook pages of the chains.
According to this report, consumers were intimidating COVID-19 in case of people had to be self-employed.
The middle of Woolworths also limited hygienic paper purchases to deliver home to a requested package.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four packages by transaction applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March.
Coles, in his press report of 8 March, reported that, with the implementation of the restriction of four packages, "Muchs overmerged one of the product within a time of delivery," and said that the demand "neither had previous", while ALDI, in a Facebook publication, said he was "awaited".
The sales undertaken a fair increase in the past week, according to a Woolworths voter.
Costco supermercado in Canberra also limited the amount to two packages last week.
In order to improve more lacking, Coles requested larger packages to provide providers and increased the frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered additional existences, while ALDI had available for a special offer of the planned mercoles.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of Australian Retailers Association, said that minorists are trying to increase the existence, but the restrictions of the local advice on road deliveries are difficult.
Provision of increased production costs, in accordance with the providers are trying to satisfy the demand, and less offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after previous release of exists, some supermercadors cannot make the special offer of the Middle.
In a report in the news.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a minorist expert for the University of Queensland, said that the supermercied exists all nights.
He pointed out that the higiene paper is a German article, which has a lower amount of existence in numbers, and, when it is decreased, leave a wide empty space in the futures, which increases the sensation of escape.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea of [which] if it had a abundant amount of article in the springs, if products as hyginico and desinfective roles could [compact] and have great amounts, probably would the pych would be minimized, said Russell Zimmerman by ABC News.
The hygienic paper manufacturer who Gives to Crap said the past middle of the existences.
Kimberly-Clark, which manufactured the Hygiene paper Kleenex, and Solaris paper, which manufactured Sorbent, pointed out that they were working on 24 hours of the day, on the seventh days of the week, to maintain the delivery, according to the report in News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, informed that some owners offered free hygiene paper to the first licenseer in the substases in Melbourne, when less undertakings were performed because the buyers had time for the long week end of the worker's day.
The edition of NT news Thursday, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page card designed to cut and be used as a hygiene paper.
The supermercies in the principle have been shown reactions to impose restrictions according to an ABC Australian report of 3 March, which said that they had no plans to introduce restrictions in the purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products also have a lot of demand, among them, masks, desinfecting, sick products, liquid and harine.
In a similar way, outside Australia, the Sunday afternoon noted that the British supermerged online Occhio limited the purchases of the Hygiene paper Andres to two packages of 12 roles.
The World Health Organization states the COVID-19 pandemia
The Miércole, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemia's browser during COVID-19, the disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
Although the word "pandemia" only refers to the dimension of the propagation of a disease, not what dangers specific cases are, the WHO stressed the need to encourage Governments to take:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemia.
If the countries detect, trial, treat, identifi, and mobilize their inhabitants in the response, Tedros Adhanom GÜreyesus, General Director of the WHO.
We are very concerned, both by the alarming levels of propagation and gravity, as well as by the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Peace, an ex-director of the United States Control and Prevention Centres, the pandemia "not previous".
In statements issued by CNN in February, “although influenza, no other respiratory virus has been stressed from the appearance to the continuing global propagation”.
Gherreyesus expressed a similar view, and said, "We have never seen a pandemia caused by a coronavir."
"And we never had seen a pandemia that could be controlled at the same time," he added.
The new pandemia condition is active after the decision of the WHO in January of the statement of a emergency of international public health.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Alergys and Infections Infections of the United States, said, "in conclusion, it's going to begin."
To Thursday, Association Press informed at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4600 deaths.
The pandemia of coronavirus 2019–20 is a pandemia in the course of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19), caused by coronavirus 2 of the serious respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
The browser was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, declared an emergency of international health of international importance on 30 January 2020 and was recognized as pandemia on 11 March 2020.
At 10 April 2020, approximately 1,6 million cases of COVID-19 were reported in 210 countries and territories and about 97,000 deaths as a result.
364.000 people were recovered.
The loyalty rate for cases was 4 per cent in China, while at the world level, 13.04 per cent in Algeria and 0.08 per cent in New Zealand.
Frequent symptoms include fibers, toes and lack of air.
Complications may include neumony and respiratory syndrome.
The time from the exhibition to the appearance of the symptoms, usually, is about five days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomic and support treatment. Recommended preventive measures include the hands to be washing, covering the mouth when to touch, keeping distance of other people and control and self-determination of people who are infected.
The world authorities responded to the implementation of travel restrictions, quarents, towers, danger controls at the workplace and installations closures.
Pandemia proved a serious global socioeconomic change, postergation or cancelation of proportional, religious, political and cultural events, and the generalized lack of suppliers increased by the buys motivated by the pánico.
Schools and universities closed at national or local levels in 193 countries, which was about 99,4% of the world's student population.
It has been disseminated erroneous information on virus by Internet, and there were incidents of xenofobia and discrimination against Chinese persons, other people of sovereignty and appearance and southern Asian and other areas with significant virus cases.
Since the reduction of the travels and the circles of the pest industry, a reduction of the pollution of air and carbon emissions has resulted in reduction.
On 31 December 2019, the health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of the province of Hubei) informed a group of cases of unrecognised neumony, and at the beginning of January 2020 an investigation was initiated.
In most cases, the majority of the major market of Huanan's marine, therefore, was thought that the virus had a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caught the browser is known as SARS-CoV-2, a re-covered virus discovered closely relating to the cronvirus of the wallet, the crown of the pangolines and SARS-CoV. Afterwardly, he discovered that the first person that was known to show symptoms was weaked on 1 December 2019, and that person had no visible connections with the last group of the moved market.
The first group of cases reported in December 2019 was determined that two thirds had an link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, a not checked report from South China Morning Post suggested that, a case that was receiving on 17 November 2019, a person of 55 years of the province of Hubei could be the first. On 26 February 2020, the WHO informed that, as new cases, were declined in China, but immediately increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the amount of new cases outside China had been overcome, firstly, the amount of new cases in China.
There may be a significant amount of non-informed cases, especially among those with lower symptoms.
On 26 February, there were relatively few cases in young people, and those of 19 years and less represented 2,4% of the cases around the world. Patrick Vallance, the United Kingdom's main scientific adviser, said that 60% of the British population should be infected before it could be achieved an effective collective immunity.
The cases relate to the amount of persons subject to COVID-19 tests and obtained a positive result confirmed in accordance with the official protocols.
On 23 March, no country had been tested in more than 3 per cent of its population, and many countries had official policies to not perform evidence in people who only had lower symptoms, such as Italy, Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, in China until 23 January, a estimated amount of 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these non-registered infections were the source of infection of 79% of the registered cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March indicated that the amounts of infection in Italy significantly greater than the cases reported.
The initial estimates of the basic reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were from 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the United States ' s Control and Prevention Centres was determined that it could be 5,7.
Most people with COVID-19 are recovered.
For those who not, the time passed from the development of symptoms to death has been from 6 to 41 days, as the most frequent 14 days.
At 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths were granted to COVID-19.
In China, at 5 February, about 80 per cent of the deaths were more than 60 years, and 75 per cent had preexistent diseases, including cardiovascular and diabetes. Official records of death by COVID-19, generally refer to persons that had been positive in the COVID testing, according to official protocols.
The amount of real deaths due to COVID-19 is likely to be greater, as perhaps not included persons who have failed without testing, for example, in their homes, for elderly houses, etc.
Part data in Italy showed that the amount of additional deaths during the pandemia exceeded the official record of COVID deaths in a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A voter of the United States ' s Control and Prevention Centres (CDC) admitted: "We know that [the number of deaths stated] is a subestimation," a confirmed by the anecological subcontamination reports in the United States. This subestimation is frequent in the pandemias, such as in the H1N1 gripe pandemia of 2009. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.
The first death from China occurred on 1 February in Philippines, and the first death out of Asia occurred in France on 14 February.
On 28 February, outside China, more than ten deaths were registered in each of the countries of Iran, South and Italy.
On 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had been reported to death in all continents except the Antarctica. Generally, several indicators were used to quantify mortality.
These numbers varied according to the region and time, and have been affected by the number of tests, quality of health system, treatment options, time transferred from initial browser and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health. The proportion of deaths on cases reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of diagnostic cases in a given time interval.
According to the Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global proportion of deaths on cases is 6.0 per cent (97 039/1 617 204) at 10 April 2020.
The number would be gone according to the region.
In China, the estimates of the percentage of deaths on cases declined from 17.3 per cent (in those with the appearance of symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7 per cent (in the appearance of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include the letality rate per cases, reflecting the percentage of diagnosed persons that had diagnosed because of a disease, and the percentage of infected infected (diagnostic and non- Diagnosised) resulting from a disease.
These statistics do not have a determinate time and consider a specific population from infection to the resolution of the case.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Center for Evidence-Based Medicine of the University of Oxford considers that the lotality rate for pandemia infections in its total is 0.1 per cent to 0.39 per cent.
The higher estimation of this rango is consistent with the results of the first food tests for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analysed the impact of the tests in the estimations of the letality rate per cases.
WHO states that the pandemia can be controlled.
The skin and the final duration of the browser are incertained and can divorce according to the location.
Maciej Boni of the State University of Pennsylvania indicated: "The infected brotes, if they do not control, generally stabilize and then start to decrease when disease remains available without hospitals.
But, at this time, it is almost impossible to make some reasonable preview when it happens."
The chief medical adviser of the Government of China, Zhong Nanshan, signed that it could end in June, if it can be moved to all countries to continue WHO recommendation on the measures to stop virus propagation.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski, of the Higiene School and Tropical Medicinal of London, expressed that the SARS-CoV-2 will be moved, probably for one or two years."
According to the study of the Imperial College directed by Neil Ferguson, physical distance and other measures will be required " until there is a vaccine (although 18 months or more)."
William Schaffner of the University of Vanderbilt said, "I think it is little likely that this coronavirus, because it is so easily transmitted, disappeared in full" and "I think it might be to become a state disease, which reapercees all the years."
The virality of reaparition would depend on collective immunity and the dimension of change.
COVID-19 symptoms may be relatively non-specific and infected persons can be a syntomic.
The two most frequent symptoms are fiber (88%) and sec (68%).
The less frequent symptoms include fatigue, exput production in respiratory paths (flood), loss of the sense of oil, lack of air, muscular pain and articulate, warranty pain, head pain, slofry, viomies, heoptis, diarrea or chinois. WHO states that approximately one of each six persons is seriously sick and has difficult to respirate.
According to the United States ' s Control and Prevention Centres (CDC), emergency symptoms include difficulty to respirate, pressure or continuing pain in the skin, repenting confusion, difficulty to discover and blue in the face or lips; before demonstration of these symptoms, medical care is recommended immediately. The greater advance of disease can cause serious revolutionary syndrome, sevensis, septic shock and death.
Some infected persons may be asintomic, not present clinical symptoms, although the results of the test confirm the infection, therefore, the investigators advised to control and consider attentively those who have close contact with infected persons confirmed in order to reject the infection.
The Chinese estimates of the proportion of asintomic persons are of a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and appearance of symptoms) depends from one to 14 days; more frequently is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimation of the percentage of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of oil to principle was 30% and then reduced to 15%.
Some details are still determined about how disease is spread.
It is believed that the disease is mostly distributed during the close contact and through the small stages produced in the tower, storm or speaking; the close contact is considered a distance from 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
According to the studies, when not covering the mouth, the gains can move from 4,5 meters (15 feet) to 8,2 meters (27 feet).
Some have proposed that virus can also be transmitted through small gaps that remain in the air for more extended periods, which can be generated in the talking. They can also be produced respiratory needs during the excavation, even though the virus is generally not transmitted by the air.
The beasts can enter into the mouth or the nest of people who are closely or may be inhaled to the pulmones.
Some medical procedures, such as intuition and reanimation of the cardiopulmon (RCP), may cause the aerosolation of respiratory segments and therefore air propagation.
It can also be spread when one touchs a contaminated surface, including the hair, and then touchs the eyes, the narz or the mouth.
Although there is an concern that it can be transmitted through the heats, this risk is low.
The Government of China refused the possibility of the oral oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is the most contagious for the three first days after the appearance of symptoms, although the propagation may be possible before the symptoms and more advanced stages of disease.
People have obtained positive results in the tests of disease up to three days before the appearance of symptoms, which indicates that the transmission is possible before the development of significant symptoms.
There are only some reports of asintomic cases confirmed by the laboratory, but some countries have identified an asintomic transmission during contact race investigations.
The European Centre for Prevention and Control (ECDC) claims that, although it is not completely clear the easy to spread the disease, generally, a person infected to two or three. The virus is surviving hours per day in the surface.
Specificly, the virus was determined to be detectable for up to three days in plastic (polipropilene) and inoxidable axis 304, a carton day and up to four hours in copper.
This would, however, be according to humidity and temperature. It was obtained positive results in the tests of the COVID-19 mass and other animals.
There are no evidence that animals can transmit virus to human beings, although the British authorities recommend that hands should be washed after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that could have been touched by infected persons.
The coronavirus 2 of the severe respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was firstly identified three people with neumony related to the group of cases of respiratory diseases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 new virus are found in the coronavirus related to the nature. On the human body, the virus dies when you enter in contact with Japan, which disagrees its protective behaviour. SARS-CoV-2 is extremely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It's believed he's a zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus was genetically grouped with betacoronavirus, its subgener sarbecovirus (linea B) together with two cepas resulting from the murcileago.
At the entire genome level, 96% is identical to other mirror cronvirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there was only a difference in the aminoatics in some parts of the genome sequence between the virus of the pangolines and the human beings.
To date, the comparison of the complete genome indicated that the coronavirus of pangolines and SARS-CoV-2 shared, as a maximum, 92% of genetic material, which is not sufficient to demonstrate that the pangolines are the intermediary hospit.
Virus infection can be diagnosed provisionally on the basis of the symptoms, although, at last, it is confirmed by polymerase reaction with inverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR) infected segretions or by computed tomografia images.
According to a study carried out in Wuhan, compared with polymerasa polymerasa reaction with computared tomografie, the computared tomographie is much more sensitive than the polymerase reaction, even though less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images correspond to the process of other diseases and neumonies.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College recommends "not use computing tomografie as a method of detection or as a first line test to diagnosis COVID-19".
The WHO has published several ARN test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, first of them published on 17 January.
The test uses the polymerase reaction with inverse transcriptase in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test can be made in blood or respiratory samples.
The results are generally available within some hours or days.
In general, this test is performed with a nosofaringeo hisopo, although you can also use a hypopopopo for the garage. Some laboratory and companies are developing beingological tests that detect anticuerpos.
On April 6, 2020, no one of them demonstrated that it was sufficiently necessary to approve its generalized use.
In the U.S., a serial test developed by Cellex was adopted for emergency use by only certificated laboratory.
The characteristics in the images of radiographs and computer-tomographies (TC) of symptomic people include opacities in asiametric visious deployment and outstanding painting disappearances.
The Italian Radiology Society is composed of an international database on the results obtained in confirmed cases.
Following superposition with other infections such as adenovirus, the image diagnostic by non-confirmation by polymerase reaction has a limited specificity in the identification of COVID-19.
A broad study carried out in China compared the results of computerized tomographies with those of the polymerasa reaction in line and showed that, although the diagnostic by images is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, that suggests its consideration as a detection tool in the areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional convolutional networks were developed based on artificial intelligence to detect virus characteristics on images, both with radiographs and computer tomographies.
Strategys for preventing disease transmission includes maintaining a good personal hygiene, washing hands, avoid to touch the eyes, narrow or mouth with the hands without having washed them before, and smoothing or touching a disgusting space and throwing the nickel directly into a disappear container.
It is recommended that those who could already be infected use a chirurgic mask in public.
Many Governments have limited or disagreed all non-marginal travels from and towards countries and areas affected by browser are also recommended.
However, virus has reached the phase of Community propagation in many parts of the world.
This means that virus is spread within the communities, and some of the communities do not know where they are or how they have been infected. It is recommended that medical care providers should be brought to someone who could be infected take the standard precautions, contact precautions and use ocular protection. The race of contacts is an important method to determine the origin of infection and to prevent a greater transmission.
The use of the location data of mobile phones by Governments with this purpose has made concerns about privacy, and the International Amnesty and more than 100 organizations made a statement to require limits on this type of monitoring.
Various mobile applications for voluntary use have been implemented or proposed, and on April 7, 2020, more than one ten of expert groups were working in respect of privacy solutions, such as the use of Bluetooth to register neighbourhood to other cell phones.
The users then receive a message if they were close to contact with someone who made positive in the COVID-19 test. They are circulating erroneous ideas on how to prevent infection; for example, the nasal wash and the bucket goals are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
The laundry of hands is recommended to prevent the propagation of disease.
The CDC recommends that people have the hands often with water and Japan during at least twenty seconds, especially after bathroom or when they have visiblely sweet hands; before eating and after sounding nariz, torcher or stehorn.
This must be that, outside the human body, virus dies when entering into contact with Japan, which disintegrates its protector bush.
The CCDs also recommended to use a desinfective for alcohol-based hands with at least 60% of alcool in volume when there is no water and Japan.
WHO recommends people that they should not touch their eyes, nest or mouth with your hands without having washed them before.
The surfaces may be detained with several solutions (in a minute after exhibition to desinfecting in an inoxidable steel surface), including etanol to 62–71 %, isopropanol to 50–100 %, sodium hypothropolyte to 0,1%, hydrogen hydrogen proxid to 0.5% and yodal pot 0.2–7,5%.
Other solutions, such as Benzalcony chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that, if any case of COVID is suspected or confirmed in an installation, such as a office or guard, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, tactics, keys, remote controls and automatic falls that have been used by sick people.
Health organizations recommend that people cover the mouth and nest with the flexioned cotton or with a disgustic spazial to touch or to touch, and that immediately desire the spanish.
It is recommended that those who could be infected use the chergy masks, as the use of a mask can limit the volume and distance covered by the respiratory gaps that are dispersed in the talking, storming and touching.
WHO delivered instructions on when and how to use the masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a violog in the University of Leeds, "Using a mask can reduce trend [de] people to touch the face, which is an important source of infection without an appropriate hygiene."The use of masks in persons who are concerned that could have a disease.
WHO recommended the use of masks by healthy persons only if high risk, for example, those concerned with COVID-19, while it also recognizes that the use of masks can help people to avoid to touch the face.
Many countries have started to promote the use of masks by the public.
In the U.S., CDC recommended that the use of non- medicine masks produced with theft. China specifically recommended the use of unsearchable medical mass by healthy members of the public, particularly when they are in close contact (1 metres (3 pies) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends use a cherry mask to take public transport or to be in concurrent places.
Tailand health officers recommend people to produce theme masks in their houses and lay them on daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia prohibited public spaces without use of a mask or without covering nariz and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested that all people use a mask in public spaces to protect and protect others.
The Government of Austria requested the use of masks by all persons who enter into a supermercador.
Israel wished that all residents should use masks in public.
Taiwán, which has produced ten million masks daily since half March, requested the use of masks by train passengers and inter-urban buses.
Panamá implies the obligation of mask cards to go out to the free air, while it also recommends the manufacture of mass masks made in the house to which they can't buy them.
Masks were also used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distance (although known as physical distance) include measures to control infection designed to fraud the propagation of disease by minimizing close contact between people.
The methods include quarents, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadios, teatros and commercial centres.
People can implement social distance methods when they are staying in their homes, limited travels, avoid concurred zones, use forms of health that do not include contact and distant physically from other persons.
Many Governments now require or recommend social distance in regions affected by browser.
The maximum size of the meetings recommended by the Governments and health organizations of the United States was rapidly reduced by 250 people (if not known COVID-19 in a region) to 50 persons and then to 10 persons.
On 22 March 2020, Germany prohibited public meetings of more than two persons, and adults and sub-related diseases such as diabetes, heart diseases, respiratory diseases, hypertension and immunity systems have more risk of suffering serious diseases and complications, and CCDs recommend that they remain in their homes as well as possible in the areas of the community affected by the broke. At the end of March 2020, the WHO and other health institutions began to re-exchange the terms " social detention" by " physical detention", to assess that the objective is reducing physical contact while maintaining social connections, both virtually or distance.
The use of the term "social detention" has been repercussion that people should take a full social island rather than encourage them to keep contact with other persons through alternative means. Some authorities have published sexual health guidelines to use during the pandemia.
They include recommendations only to have sexual relations with a person with which it is convicted, which does not have virus or virus symptoms.
It was recommended that the self-advancement in the house of those who had been diagnosed COVID-19 and of those suspected have been infected.
The health agencies have published detailed instructions on the appropriate self-astalation. Many Governments have requested or recommended the autonomy of entire populations in the affected areas.
The instructions on more strict self-quarters were issued for those of high-risk groups.
Persons who could have been contacted with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with general transmission are recommended to make self-quarter for 14 days since the last possible exhibition.
Strategy to control a browser is containing or absorption and mixture.
Containment is carried out in the first stages of the browser and has the purpose of identifying and assigning infected persons, además of introducing other infection and vaccine control measures to avoid that disease is prevented to the rest of the population.
In the event that you can't control the propagation of disease, efforts are transferred to the measurement phase: measures are taken to break the propagation and mitigate their effects in the health and society system.
A combination of containing and missing measures may be taken at the same time.
The pressure requires more extreme measures to be able to reduce pandemia through the reduction of the basic reproduction number at least 1. Part to control the brown of an infective disease implicas to decrease the epidemic pico, which is known as planning the curve of the epidemic.
This reduces the risk that health services are paid and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
The non- farmaceutical interventions that can control the browser include personal preventive measures such as the hygiene of hands, the use of mass and self-quarters; Community measures aimed at physical detention, such as the closure of schools and the ceiling of mass competitive events; the Community commitment to promote acceptance and participation in these interventions; as well as environmental and cleanness measures; in China, more drastic measures were taken to contain the browser once their seriousness resulted clearly, for example, the implementation of catenes in all cities and the impairment of travel and streets.
Other countries also took a variety of measures aimed at limiting virus propagation.
South Korea carried out massive and 4 localized detection assessments and reported advertisements on the movement of infected persons.
Singapore provided financial support to the infected persons that decided to make quarantine and impose a lot of those who did not.
Taiwán increased the production of masks and sanctified the acumulation of medical suppliers. The simulations in British and the United States show that mixture (which reduces the propagation of epidemic but not detention) and the pressure (which turns the growth of the pandemia) have great challenges.
Optimistic measurement policy could reduce the maximum medical care demand in two third parties and deaths at half, but also generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems.
It may be preferable to be pressed, but it should be kept during the time that the virus is circulated in the human population (or until there is a vaccine available, if it is first) since otherwise the transmission is reactived quickly when the actions are flexibility.
The long-term intervention to remove pandemia involves social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral medicinal products adopted for COVID-19 but efforts to develop them, including testing of existing medicines.
Take free sale medicinal products for disappeared, drinking liquid and dischange can help aliment symptoms.
According to gravity, oxygenotherapie, intravenous liquids and respiratory assistance can be needed.

The Chino Communist Party (PCC) was released to several provincial administrators because of its manual of the efforts on the fourth in the Central China, a sign of disappearance with the response of the political system to browsing in these regions.
Some comments believe that this measure was taken to protect the Secretary-General of the Chinese Communist Party Xi Jinping from the public wrath by the crownvirus browser.
Some Chinese officials, for example, Zhao Lijian, deteriored an earlier recognition of the start of coronavirus browser in Wuhan, for inspiring theories on the origin of the COVID-19 in the U.S. or Italy.
The administration of Donald Trump of the EE.U. has been referring to the coronavirus like the "China" or the "virus of Wuhan", and has stated that the "Censure of China overwhelmed a virus that has now been converted into a global pandemia," which, at the same time, was mentioned by some criticals as a racism and "distrac[] of the fracase of its administration to contain disease".
The Daily Beast received a telegram of the United States Government to describe a strategic of communications with apparent origin in the National Security Council, and the strategy was quoted as "All over China".
It has been said to us that we have tried to transmit this message in any way possible, including press conferences and televisions. "Communications as policy, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have stated that China's efforts to send the countries concerned by virus are part of a propaganda to get global influence.
The representative of the European Union's external policy, Josep Borrell, warned that "There is a geopolitical component that includes an impact on propagandas and generosity policy."
Borrell also said: "China is engaged attractively on the message that, on the difference of the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner."
China also requested the United States to raise their sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while, according to the reports, he sent assistance to these two latest countries.
On 3 April, the United States sanctions blocked the donation of Jack Ma from 100 000 masks to Cuba.
The United States were also accused of dismissing aid for other countries to their own country.
There were discussions on masks between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
Furthermore, Turkey incarned hundreds of respirators intended in Spain.
At the beginning of March, the Italian Government criticised the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Italy, affected by the coronavirus.
Mauritius Massari, Italian embarrassador before the European Union, said that "Solo China answered bilaterally.
Of course, this is not a good sign of European solidarity."
On 22 March, after a call with the first Italian Minister Joseph Conte, the Russian President Vladimir Putin said that the Russian Army sent military doctors, special desinfection vehicles and other medical teams to Italy.
The Italian newspaper The Print mentioned anonymous “to high-level policy life” that claimed that 80% of Russian aid was “inutil or in use for Italy”.
The source accused Russia to impose a "geopolitical and diplomatic offence".
The President of Lombardia, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Maio, deemed the periodic reports and expressed thanks to them.
Russia also sent a carrier with medical assistance to the United States.
The shipping of Kremlin, Dmitry Peskov, said that "to provide assistance to the United States colleagues [Putin] believes that, when the US manufacturers of medical materials and equipment can also match if necessary."
The planned military year of OTAN "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic countries, the greatest OTAN war year from the end of the Fry War will be achieved to a reduced scale.
The Secretary-General for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, cried on the defence of 2020: "In the current crisis of public health, the life is not only of the United States troops and the different European countries that participate, but also of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate." The Iranian Government was very affected by the virus, with about two tens of members of the Parliament infected, including other 15 current and previous political figures.
On 14 March 2020, the President of Iran, Hassan Rouani, wrote a public letter to the leaders of the world to ask assistance, and said that his country was difficult to combat the lack because of the lack of access to international markets as a result of the sanctions of the United States against Iran. The print has emphasized the need for the United States to adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal medical care, universal child care, reimbursed family licence and higher levels of funds for public health.
Political Analysts had anticipated that they could negatively affect Donald Trump's selection opportunities in the presidency election of 2020. The diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea began because of the pandemia.
South Korea criticised the " ambiguous and passive four flights" in Japan, after Japan announced that any person from South Korea will remain in four weeks on sites designed by the Government.
The South Korean society in principle was polarized with regard to the response of Moon Jae-in before the crisis.
Many Koreans signed requests to require Moon's destitution because they considered a bad manager of the breast by the Government, or well to eligible their response.
Some commentaries expressed the concern that the Governments could allow the control of power.
In Hungary, his Parliament voted to allow the first Minister, Viktor Orbán, to go through a decree uncertainly, the Parliament and the elections and sanctions to those who have been considered that false information on the virus and the manager of the crisis were distributed by the Government.
The cronvirus browser of several cases of escape of delivery, as a result of the highest use of the world-wide equipment to combat paintings, buys implanted by the pánic and interruption of logistics and manufacturing operations.
The Administration of Foods and Medicinals of the United States has published advertisements concerning lack of medicines and medical equipment because of the greatest demand of consumers and the interruption of suppliers.
A number of localities were also presented by the pánic buys that have left the futures of essential products, such as food, hygienic paper and water embedded, which caused the lack of suppliers.
The technology sector, in particular, has been advertising the delays in electronic products.
According to the General Director of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom, the request for personal protection team has increased 100 times.
This demand generated an increase in the prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also caused four to six months in the delivery of medical articles.
He also caused a lack of personal protection teams throughout the world, and WHO warned that this would be dangerous to health workers.
In Australia, the pandemia provided a new opportunity to buy Dagou buyers from Australian products in China.
The activity has created a lack of shape for drinks in some supermercates and then was prohibited by the Australian Government. Despite the high prevalence of cases of COVID-19 in the north of Italy and the Wuhan region, and the following demand of food products, no of these areas have been affected by the lack of food.
China and Italy against illicit accumulation and trade of essential products have been outlined, and they have avoided a lack of food that has been advanced in Europe and North America.
The north of Italy, with its important agricultural production, has not had significant reduction, but prices could increase as representatives of the sector.
Food futures were only temporary, even in the Wuhan city, while Chinese government officials released the carriage reserves to ensure sufficient food of the population.
In Italy there are similar laws that require food producers to keep reservations for these emergency.
The damage in the world economy felt in China: According to a periodic report of 16 March, China ' s economy was very affected in the first two months of 2020 because of the Government ' s measures to detain virus propagation, and minorist sales fell to 20.5 per cent.
Since China is an important economic and manufacturing center, Viral Brett has been considered considerable threats for global economy.
Agathe Demaris of the Economist Intelligence Unit has pronounced that the markets will remain volatile until there is a clear image on potential consequences.
In January 2020, some analysis estimated that the economic consequences of the global growth epidemic could overcome the SARS flow of 2002–2004.
A estimation of a expert at the University of Washington in San Luis indicated an impact of more than $300 million in the world supply chains that could continue to two years.
According to the information, the Petrolio exporting countries (OPEC) was "reviewed" after a strong fall on the prices of the petroleum because of the lower demand of China.
On 24 February, global value markets caught a significant increase in the amount of COVID-19 cases outside China.
On 27 February, due to the growing concerns on the coronavirus browser, several burstal indexes in the U.S., including NASDAQ-100, published the S-P 500 and Dow Jones Industry Average's most proclaimed from 2008, was 1191 points, the largest falled in a day since the financial crisis of 2007-08.
The three indexes ended the week with lower than 10%.
On February 28, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed sovereign credit qualification in China, but had a negative perspective.
Actions fell again on the basis of the fears by the coronavirus, the most falled on 16 March.
Many believe that it is likely that there is an economic receipt.
The economicist Mohamed El-Erian enjoyed the timely emergency measures of states and central banks.
Central banks are faster than reacted to the 2008 financial colapsy.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors because of the prohibitions of traveling, the closure of public places including travel attacks and the recommendation of Governments to not travel to any part of the world.
Accordingly, many airlines have canceled flights because of the smaller demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British Flybe collapsed regional airline.
The impact in the sector of crossing enterprises has never been seen.
Various railway stations and terminals of transbords have also been closed.
The epidemic agreed with the Chunyun, a important time of travels related to the feasts of the New Chinese Year.
A number of events in which large populations were involved were canceled by national and regional governments, including the new Year festivities, while private enterprises also have also closed their tourism and attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many tourist events and attractions of the New Lunar Year have been closed to avoid massive concentrations, including the Prohibied city of Pekin and the traditional temples.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of China, the authorities extended the feast of New Year until 10 February and ordered most of the workplaces to not open until that date.
These regions represent 80 percent of PIB and 90 per cent of the export of the country.
Hong Kong highlighted its response level to the highest infected disease and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and canceled its New Year celebrations. The minorist sector was affected at the world level, with reductions in temporary care or closure hours.
The visits to minorists in Europe and Latin America diminished to 40 per cent.
The minorists of North America and the Middle East experienced a 50 to 60 per cent.
This has also resulted in a 33-43% fall in the peatonal trading to the trade centres in March compared to February.
The operators of the world's trade centres imposed additional measures, such as hygiene, to control the temperature of buyers and cancelation of events. According to the estimation of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, Pandemic reaction could leave between 14 and 22 million more in an extreme poverty situation in Latin America of those who would have remained in that situation without pandemia.
In January and February 2020, during the highest point of epidemic in Wuhan, approximately 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of the almost 300 million migrant rural workers in China remained varied in their homes in domestic or attracted in the province of Hubei. In March 2020, more than 10 million of the United States lost their employment and requested Government assistance.
The coronavirus browser could cost 47 million employees in the United States and 32 per cent of the unemployment rate, according to the estimates of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Luis. In India, the confidence in India has left tens of millions of indigenous migrants (and receive daily salaries). According to the Angus Reid Institute, 44 per cent of Canadian homes experienced some kind of unemployment.
During the second half of March, four million of French workers requested temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million of British workers requested a universal credit plan; average millions of enterprises in Germany have implemented short-term work spectrums undertaken by the Government, known as the Kurz Work, for their workers.
The German scheme of short-term work compensation has been adopted by France and British Britain.
The sectors of Scientist arts and cultural heritage have been deeply affected by the pandemia, which affected the operations of organizations and people, both employed and independent, around the world.
Cultural organizations and arts tried to play their mission (financed with public funds) to provide the community access to cultural heritage, maintain the security of their employees and the public and support artists when possible.
For March 2020, the museums, libraries, spectacular places and other cultural institutions had been closed without end, and their exhibitions, events and spectrums were canceled or postered.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent consequences and increased by a accelerated disease ritmo is the cancelation of religious services. Recent proportional events and other social events, such as music celebrations and concerts, technology conferences and modefiles.
The cinematographic industry also suffered interruptions. The Vatican announced the cancelation of the celebrations of Samana Santa in Rome, which have been placed during the last week of the Christian penitance period of the Cuaresma.
Many dioces have recommended that the elderly Christians remain in their homes instead of participating in my Sundays; some churches offered religious services through radio, transmission through Internet or television, while others offer spaces to pray from the car.
After the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and captains and with the Lage of San Pedro was empty from Christian perishes, other religious agencies also canceled their services and limited public concentrations in churches, mixtures, synagogues, temples and horrors.
The Ministry of Health of Iran announced the cancelation of the Friday pills in the areas affected by the breast and then closed the sanctuaries, while Saudi Arabia prohibited the entrance of foreign foreign foreigners and their residents to the holy places in the Meca and Medina.
The pandemia has caused the most significant change in the World Sport calendar from the Second World War.
Most of the important sports events were canceled or postergarned, among them, the Lega of Camperons of UEFA 2019–20, the First League 2019-20, the EEFA Euro 2020, the 2019–20 NBA time and the 2019–20 NHL.
The browser interrupted the Olympics 2020 plans, which were originally programming to begin at July; the Olympic International Committee announced that the event would be "reprogrammed for a date after 2020 but not after summer 2021." The casines and other game places around the world closed and the tours to postergar or canceled online.
This proved that many advocants refer to the Internet, many online airport sites reported significant increases in their new inscriptions rates. The entrepreneur industry also affected, several musical groups suspended or canceled concierous rounds.
Many large theaters, such as the Broadway, also suspended all the spectrum.
Some artists have studied ways to continue to produce and share their work through the Internet as an alternative to traditional spectacular life, such as competitive transmissions or the creation of "fesive" on the Internet to distribute, distribute or publicly their work.
In line, numerous media have been divided on coronavirus, since many recurring to humor and distraction in the middle of uncertainty.
Since the flow of COVID-19, an increase in prejudices, xenofobia and racism towards Chinese and East Asian people and people in Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
In many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asian and the Pacific region have been observed.
February reports (with most cases have still been limited to China) have documented racistic feelings in several groups around the world expressed that the Chineses were merely the virus or that they were receiving what they considered a fair reprehension.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in the earliest feelings.
Many residents in Wuhan and Hubei have informed discrimination on the basis of its regional origin.
Children and those in the areas affected by virus have received support, both on the Internet and outside this.
After the progress of the breast towards new countries where the situation is critical, the first Europe that experienced a serious cross of COVID-19, could also be subject to suspicions and xenophobia. The citizens of countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed requests for the prohibition of the income of Chineses to their countries in an effort to defend disease.
In Japan, the weekday #ChineseDontComeToJapan was trend in Twitter.
The Chineses, besides other Asian people in the United Kingdom and in the United States, have reported greater levels of racistic abuses, notably of aggression.
The President of the United States, Donald Trump, was critical to refer to the coronavirus like the "Chinavir", a term that many criticians considered racistic and anti-China.
Manifestists in Ukraine attacked buss transporting Ukrainian and foreign evacuations from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from the north-west of India, shared a border with China and studied in the main Indian cities, have suffered acous on the cronvirus browser.
The President of the State Unit of Bharatiya Janata in Western Bengala Dilip Ghosh, expressed that the Chineses had destroyed the nature and "Therefore God was sold from them."
The Chinese adviser in Calcuta then condemned the comments and said that they were "irrous". In China, they increased xenofobia and racism towards non-China residents as a result of the pandemia, and described foreigners as a "lander base" and intended for the "desh".
Many periodic with payment walls took them for parts or the total of their coverage of coronavirus.
Many scientific editors published scientific articles related to the available browser with open access.
Some scientists opted to share their results quickly in pressure servers such as bioRxiv.

The laboratory tests for respiratory disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) and the associated virus SARS-CoV-2 include methods that detect the presence of virus and those that detect anticuerpos produced in response to infection.
The virus presence in samples is confirmed through the polymerase reaction testing with inverse transcriptase, which detects the ARN of coronavirus.
This test is specific and is designed to detect only the ARN of SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm the very recent or active infections.
The anticuerpos detection (serology) can be used both for diagnostic and for the monitoring of the population.
The tests of anticuerpos show how many people have had the disease, including those who had too slow symptoms like to inform them or have been a syntomic.
Since the results of this test, a precise mortality rate of disease and collective immunity in the population can be determined.
Following limited tests, until March 2020, no country had confidence data on the prevalence of virus in its population.
On 23 March, no country had been tested to more than 3 per cent of its population, and there are large variations in the number of tests carried out in the different countries.
It is also likely that this variability is significantly affecting lestality rates for reported cases, which probably are very overest in some countries.
By polymerase reaction with inverse transcriptase in real time (RRT-PCR), the test can be made in respiratory samples obtained through several methods, including nasofarine hisopeds or exput samples.
The results, generally, are available within a period of hours to 2 days.
The test of polymerase reaction in line with inverse transcriptase performed with faríngeos hisopathes is only reliable in the first week of the disease.
Afterwards, virus can disappear in the garden, but it is still multiplied in pulmones.
In persons infected to which tests are performed in the second week, as alternative, the sample material can be obtained from the deep parts of the respiratory paths through a suction career, or may be used by the material issued to the tower (exput).
One of the first tests of polymerasa reaction in the chain was developed in Charity in January 2020, using the polymerasa reaction in line with inverse transcriptase in real time (rRT-PCR), and constituted the basis of the 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
On 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On 28 January 2020, the South Kogenebiotech company developed a kit of SARS-CoV-2 detection based on the clinical polymerase reaction (PowerChek Coronavirus).
Find the "E" gender shared by all the betacoronavirus and RdRp specific to the SARS-CoV-2. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companys in obtaining the emergency use of the National Medical Products Administration of China of a SaRS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the polymerase reaction. In the United States, the United States, the CCDC's Centres for Control and Prevention of Public Health (CPD) are distributing its dynamic panel of reaction in the Police Transcripts with real transcripts in real time for the new crovir 2019 (20-19-CnV).
One of each three genetic tests in the previous versions of test kits generated unconscious results because of defective reactive reactive, and a attack in the implementation of tests in the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, in medium, was satisfied by less than 100 samples every February 2020.
The confidence of the tests used by two components has not been defined until 28 February 2020, and only from then it was allowed that the State and local laboratory began testing.
The Administration of Foods and Meditations approved the test under emergency authorisation. The trade laboratory of the United States started testing at the beginning of March 2020.
On 5 March 2020, LabCorp announced the availability of COVID-19 tests based on polymerase reaction with inverse transcriptase.
The Quest Diagnostics similarly made tests for COVID-19 at national level.
It was not declared limits in the amount; the collection of species and processing should be fulfilled in accordance with the CCD requirements.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the Statistics for Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Medical Attention. On 12 March 2020, it was informed that May Clinic had developed a test to detect infection by COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics had received the approval of the FDA for a test that could be done in a large term of 3,5 hours, which allowed a machine to perform approximately 4128 tests during a period of 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, FDA expired an emergency authorisation for Abbott Laboratories for a test in the M2000 system of Abbott; FDA had previously sent similar authorisations for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Science.
On 21 March 2020, Cepity received the EFDA emergency authorisation for a test that extends approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has adopted a test that uses the isolation technology of nuclear acids instead of polymerasa reaction.
As this does not require a series of alternative temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results only five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
Currently, there are about 18 000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott provides the production to make 50 000 tests daily. In Taiwan, a test is developed using a monoclonal anticuerpo specifically to the protein of the nocleocápside (protein N) of the new coronavirus, with the hope that you can provide results within a period from 15 to 20 minutes as a fast test for influenza.
On March 2020, the revision of publications concluded that "torax radiographies have little diagnostic value at the first stages, while the results of the TC [computerized topic] can be acquired even before the appearance of symptoms.”
Specific characteristics in the TC include multiple bilateral visual opacities that are dissoluted with a perif, asimetric and later distribution.
Following the extension of disease, subpleural domain is developed, a pattern of emphasis and consolidation.
According to a study carried out in Wuhan, on the origin of the current pandemia, compared with polymerasa reaction in line with computarized tomographie, the computared tomographie is much more sensitive than the reaction in polymerase chain, even though less specific, and many of the characteristics in the images involved with other diseases and neumony processes.
Since March 2020, the American Radiology College recommends "no use computed tomographie as a method of detection or as a test of first line to diagnose COVID-19". Since March 2020, CDC recommends the polymerase reaction as initial review.
Part of the infection reaction of the immune system is the production of anticuerpos, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in persons approximately from 7 days after the appearance of symptoms, to determine immunity and monitoring of the population. It can be analyzed in central laboratory or by testing at the point of attention.
High performance systems in many clinical laboratorys can carry out these analysis, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For the analysis in central laboratory, there is generally only a perifere blood spectrum, although they can be used series of specimens to follow immunity response.
For tests at the point of attention, generally only a blood spectrum is obtained through a position on the hair.
Apart from the methods of polymerase reaction in line, a step of extraction is not needed before the analysis. On 26 March 2020, FDA appointed 29 entities that gave notice to the agency as corresponding and therefore can now distribute its tests of anticuerpos.
On April 7, 2020, only a test was approved by the FDA under an emergency authorisation. At the end of March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received the approval of Europe for their test kits that can detect anticuerpos IgG and IgA against the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is of a number of hundreds of samples within the hour period and therefore is much faster than the conventional reaction test in the viral polymerase.
The anticuerpos, usually, can be detected 14 days after the beginning of the infection. At the beginning of April, the United Kingdom discovered that no of the testing of anticuerpos that he bought was sufficiently good as to use them.
Hong Kong has created a program in which the suspected patients can stay in their homes, "the emergency department gives the patient a tube for specifics," the patient cares in the tube, sends it and receives a result for a little time. The British NHS announced that it is implementing a pilot program to analyse the cases suspected in their homes, which eliminates the risk that the patient is infected to others if he goes to hospital or the need to desinfect a ambulance if he is used. In the tests in the drive-through centres for the COVID-19 of suspect cases, a health professional has shown the appropriate precautions.
The drive-through centres helped South Korea to make some of the most fast and more expansive tests of any country. In Germany, the National Medicinal Association for Statistics Health Safety, said on 2 March, that he had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests in the ambulatory environment and that 10,700 people had been tested at the previous week.
Health insurance assesses the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the President of the Institute Robert Koch, Germany has a general capacity to make 160 000 tests per week.
On 19 March, tests were offered through the drive-through system in several large cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total amount of tests made in Germany was unknown because the positive results were only informed.
A first survey of laboratory revealed that, at the natural week of 12/2020, there were analyzed at least 483 295 samples, until including the week of 12/2020 and 33 491 samples (6.9%) resulted positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers of the Institute Technology and Hospital Rambam developed and tested a method to analyse 64 patients simultaneously, which consists to group the samples and only to make more analysis if the combined demonstration was made positive. On 5 February 2020, the BGI in Wuhan made an emergency laboratory laboratory of 2000 meters called "HuYan" (Hu-chian) (OOO, "Fer" or "Fye" in 10.
With the construction, which was monitored by the BGI founder, Wang Jian, and which had taken five days, the model showed that the cases in Hubei had been a 47 percent higher and that the cost for face was doubled without this ability for testing.
After Wuhan's laboratory, Huo-Yan was built in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Pekín and Shanghái in a total of 12 cities in China.
On March 4, 2020, the total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Multixised open source designs were implemented by origami, which allowed to assess up to 1122 patient samples using only 93 analysis. These balanced designs can be used in small laboratorys without need to use liquid manipulation robots.
In March, weakness and insufficient amounts of reactive have affected massive tests in the European Union and the United States.
This brought some authors to study sample preparation protocols that involve sampling 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release ARN genoms to make more tests. On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates now have made more tests of coronavirus detection per person than any other country, and he was encouraged to increase the level of tests for the majority of the population.
This was achieved by the combination of the drive-through capacity and the purchase of a massive production laboratory at the level of the population of Group 42 and BGI (which was based on its emergency laboratory detection laboratory in China).
In 14 days, the laboratory has ability to make tens of thousands of reaction tests in polymerase with inverse transcriptase daily and is the first world of this dimension that works outside China.
There were several forms of tests addressing different parts of the genetic profile of coronavirus in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula to produce kits sent to countries of lower income that had no resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the Protocol developed by the United States ' s Control and Prevention Centers had not been available until 28 January, which was retained the tests available in the United States and China and the United States had been problems with the reliability of test kitts at the end of the breast, and these countries and Australia could not provide sufficient kits to meet the request and recommendations of health experts on test tests.
On the other hand, experts say that the great availability of South Korea’s tests helped reduce the propagation of the new coronavirus.
The Government of South Korea has achieved its capacity to carry out tests, especially in the private sector laboratory, during several years.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization requested the increase of testing programmes as the best way to reduce the progress of COVID-19 pandemia. The high demand for tests due to the broad spread of virus has resulted in hundreds of thousands of tests in the U.S. private laboratorys, and the supplies of chemicals and reactions were exhausted.
In March 2020, China informed problems with the preciseness of its test kits.
In the United States, the CDC test kits had "defects"; the Government then eliminated the burocratic barriers that had avoided the realization of private tests. Spain bought test kits to the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd but received imprecitive results.
The company explained that the wrong results could be made to the wrong collection of samples or the wrong use of kits.
The Ministry of Spain said that it would remove the kits that have thrown wrong results and would replace them by a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. The 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic had bought a wrong result. Slovakia bought 1,2 million kits to China that were imprecisible.
The first Minister Matovič suggested that they would be thrown into Danubia. Kara, the Minister of Turkish Health, said that the test kits had sold to China a "good error" and not "poured them in use." The United Kingdom bought 3,5 million tests to China, but at the beginning of April 2020, announced that they would not serve.
The performance of tests complemented by the quarter of those who obtained positive results and the identification of persons with which had had been positively contacted in SARS-CoV-2 have occurred satisfactory results.
Researchers who work in the Italian city of Vò, the place where COVID-19 was the first death in Italy, performed two trials of tests throughout the population of around 3400 inhabitants, with a number of ten days of difference.
Approximately half of those who had obtained positive results had no symptoms, and all detected cases were set into quarantine.
With the restriction of the trips in the municipality, this has completely emitted new infections.
With the intensive stretch of contacts, the restrictions of the travel from the outside, the realization of tests and quarentine, the pandemia by coronavirus 2020 in Singapore was far lower than in other developed countries, but that did not apply extreme restrictions, such as the forced restaurants and minorist institutions.
Many events were canceled, and on March 28, Singapore began to recommend the residents who stay in their homes, but schools returned to open after the feast of 23 March.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemia with intensive contacts, the restrictions of the travels from the outside, the performance of tests and the fourth, but with less strict convergence, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, the countries who have performed more tests, regarding the amount of death, have less rates for many lower cases, probably because these countries have more capacity to detect people who only have lower symptoms or have no symptoms.
The WHO recommends that countries that have no capacity to perform testing and having national laboratory with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratory laboratorys to make confirmation tests.
From 16 reference laboratorys, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the "Positive as % of tests" column is influenced by the policy for the realization of tests in the country.
A country only performing evidence in hospitals will have a higher number of positives than % of evidence that a country that makes evidence in all citizens, although they are marked symptoms or no, the other matters are equal.
Hand washing, also known as hands hygiene, is the action to wake your hands with the purpose of removing sustainability, fat, microorganisms or other unwanted substances.
The washing of hands with Japan constantly in certain "Critical moons" during the day prevents the propagation of many diseases, for example, diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by fecal-oral path.
People may also be infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or common disappearance, for example, if the hands are not laid before touching the eyes, narrow or mouth (e.g. muscose membranes).
The five critical moments during the day in which it is important to wash the hands with Japan include: before and after the defectation, after cleaning the kid’s hair or changing the spanish, before eating a child, before eating and before and after preparing a meat or manipulating crude flesh, fish or meat.
If no water or Japan is available, hands can be cleaned with cereals. The World Health Organization recommends that the hands be wash:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after care of a sick person.
After changeing spanish or cleaning a child he used the bathroom.
After sounding the narz, toler or steornudar.
After touch animals, food for animals or disappearances.
Hand hygiene is related to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before administration of medicines or medical care may prevent or minimize the propagation of diseases.
The main medical purpose of the hand laundry is to eliminate pathogenos (bacterians, virus or other microorganisms that can cause diseases) and chemical substances that can cause damage or diseases.
This is particularly important for people who manipulate food or working in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
The washing of hands has many benefits for health, among them, to minimize the propagation of influenza, coronavirus and other infective diseases; to prevent infective causes of diarrea; to reduce respiratory infection;
and reducing child mortality rates in household parts.
A study carried out in 2013 showed that improvements in hand washing practices could generate small improvements in growth in less than five years.
In developing countries, child mortality rates related to respiratory and diarreic diseases can be reduced by the introduction of simple changes in the behaviour, such as the hands with Japan.
This simple action can reduce almost 50% the mortality rate for these diseases.
The interventions to foster hand washing may reduce diarrhea episodes in an approximately third party, and this is similar to providing potable water in lower income areas.
48% of the reductions in diarrhoea episodes can be related to the hands washing with Japan. The hands with Japan is the most effective and economic way to prevent diarrea and adverse respiratory infections, such as the automatic behaviour adopted in homes, schools and communities worldwide.
Newmony, an important respiratory disease, is the main cause of mortality in children less than five years, and the lives of an estimated amount of 1,8 million children per year are covered.
The diarree and the neumony together represents almost 3,5 million children’s deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, to transform hands milk with Japan before eating and after use of bathroom into a warmed housing can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce almost half deaths for diarrhoea and fourth parts of deaths by adverse respiratory infection.
Generally, hand washing is integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).
The hand washing also protects against impetion, transmitted through the direct physical contact.
A small perjudicial effect of the hand washing waste is that its frequent performance can cause damage because of the hair resemblance.
According to a Danish study carried out in 2012, the excessive waste of hands may cause a cut-infection that causes picazón and that the hair becomes slowly known as the eczema of hands or denmatitis, which is particularly frequent in health workers.
The washing of too frequent hands is also considered one of the symptoms of the complex obsestive transverse (TOC).
There are five critical moments during the day in which the washing of hands with Japan is important to reduce the oral-fecal transmission of diseases: after using bathroom (ornar, defeat), after cleaning the kid's chale (pain change), before eating a child, before eating and before/or to prepare a crude flesh or manipulate.
Another occasions in which a correct hand washing technique should be practiced to prevent transmission of diseases are included before and after treatment of a short or wound; after smoothing, to touch or sound nariz; after to touch animal disappears or to manipulate; and after thicking.
In many countries, there is a low washing rate with Japan.
A study on hand washing in 54 countries carried out in 2015 concluded that 38.7% of the families had been lowered with their hands with Japan. A study made in 2014 indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97 per cent; the United States was close to half of 77 per cent; and China had the lower rate of 23 per cent. Currently, there are several methodology for the change of behaviour, to increase the adoption of the jaboon to washing hands at the critical moments. The washing of the children ' s groups in the school in certain times is an opposition in developing countries to integrate the lower of children ' s hands in the behaviour.
The "Soft health care programme" implemented by the Department of Philippines Education is an example of an action to promote children's health and education.
Two times per year, besides washing hands with Japan every day, cut off daily dinners with flower, are the basis of this national programme.
It was also completely implemented in Indonesia.
The elimination of hair microorganisms improved by adding to jabon water or detergent.
The main action of jabons and detergents is to reduce barriers for solution and improve solution.
The only water is ineffective to clean the hair because fats and proteins, which are components of organic material, are not easily disappeared in water.
However, a reasonable water stream facilitate cleanness.
The solid jabon, due to its reutilisable nature, can contain bacteria acquired in the previous uses.
Some studies that analyzed the transfer of sanitary sanitary in Japan concluded that transfer was little likely, since the bacteria are accompanied with the smoke.
Even so, the CDC states that "you prefers the liquid japon with controls for dispensation that do not impose hands to use."
Antibacterian jabons have been intensely promoted for a public aware of health.
There are currently no evidence shown that use of desinfectants or anti-septics recommended to keep resistent organs with antibiotics according to the nature.
However, antibacterian jabons contain common anti-bacterian agents, such as triclosan, which has an extended list of resistent agencies.
Thus, even if anti-bacterian jabons do not keep the cepas resisting to antibiotics, they could not be as effective as it is promoted.
Besides the superfactor and protecting the hair, the former sophistics can contain acetic acid (acetic acid, acotic acid, lactic acid) as well as the regulator of pH, benzoic acid with antimicrobian activity and more aconditionants for pile (the true, lifemines, mental, vegetal) and vegetables). A exhaustive analysis of the School of Public Health of the University of Orgon indicates that common jabons are effective as the anti-batic jabons for the consumer contain tricloshan for preventing diseases and eliminating the batteries of the hands.
The nice water to wash your hands is not enough to remove the bacteries.
Batteries grow much faster to corporal temperature (37 °C).
However, ironic water is more effective than ironic water to eliminate natural oils that retain land and bacteria.
However, in contrast to popular credibility, scientific studies have shown that use of swimming water does not have any effect on the reduction of microbian load in the hands.
A desinfect for hands or anti-septics for hands is a non-water agent for the hygiene of the hands.
At the end of 1990 and the first part of the XXI century, the hygiene of the hands and alcohol to fresh (not known as a solution for alcohol-based hands to frozen, anti-septic solution for hands for flowing or desinfecting for hands) began to acquire popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or etanol formulated with a speeding agent as a carbon (atrium acrylic acid polium) in a gel, or a humecant as glicerin in a liquid, or spome for a easy use and to reduce alcohol resequency effect.
Add diluid hydrogen peroxide still increases antimicrobian activity. The desinfectors for hands containing 60 to 95% alcohol as at least remove the genes effectively.
Alcohol desinfectors to flow the bacteria, bacteria resistant to several medicines (SARM and ERV), tuberculosis and some virus (including HIV, herpes, VSR, rhyvirus, vaccination, influenza and hepatitis) and hongos.
The 99.97% of alcohol desinfectors, similar to 35-decible bacteria in the hands of 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 logaritmos) of bacteria in hands 1 minutes after application. The desinfectors for hands are more effective against the bacteria and less effective against some virus.
The desinfectors for alcohol hands are practically ineffective against norrovirus type virus (or Norwalk), the most frequent cause of containery gastrointeritis. It is necessary to use sufficient solution for anti-septic hands or alcohol for flowing, such as to humble or cover both hands.
The palm and the back of both hands, between the fingers and the fingers of all the fingers, are cut nearly 30 seconds until the leaked, the smoke or the yellow is followed.
The finger points should also be lowered well by putting them in both palms. The United States's Control and Prevention Centers recommend the washing of hands before the desinfectants for flowing hands, particularly when the hands are visiblely successful.
Increased use of these agents is based on their easy use and on the fast elimination of microorganisms; however, should not be used as replacement of the appropriate washing of hands unless water or jabone are disposed.
The frequency use of desinfectors for alcohol-based hands can research the hair, except if they are added emoliant or hyperatants for the hair to the formula.
The effect of alcohol sequence may be reduced or removed by adding lycerin or other emotional to the formula.
In clinical tests, the desinfectors for alcohol-based hands containing emolytes caused an irritation and sequence of hair considerably less than Jabons or antimicrobial detergenes.
Alergy thematitis by contact, urticary syndrome by contact or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additive solutions on the basis of alcohol-based solutions are very few often frequent.
The smallest trend to provoke irritating dematitis by contact resulted attractively compared to hands milk with water and Japan.
Despite their effectiveness, the without water agents do not eliminate the organic material from their hands, but they simply desinfect them.
For this reason, the desinfectors for hands are not as effective as water and Japan to prevent the propagation of many patologists, since patologists remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcool-handed desinfectors depends on large measure of ingredients and formula, moreover, historically, has been much less than alcohol and alcohol solutions.
Recently, the forms used by benzalconium cloruro have a continuing and acumulative anti-microbian activity after application, a difference of alcohol, which reduces effectively after the repeated use, probably because of the progressive reactions of the hair.
Many people in low income communities cannot buy Japan and use cereals or land change.
The cenizes or the earth can be more effective than the water alone, but less effective than Japan.
A concern is that, if the land or cenizes are contaminated with microorganisms, this may increase the propagation of diseases instead of reducing it.
Like Japan, the cenize is also a desinfective agent, as, in contact with water, forms an alcaline solution.
WHO recommended use cenize or swimming as a alternative to Japan when Japan is not available.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the United States ' s Control and Prevention Centres to prevent transmission of diseases include the following steps:
Mount your hands with flowing water or fresh.
The fluent water is recommended because the drives with water can be contaminated, while the water temperature appears does no difference.
Foot your hands to form smoke with a generous amount of jabon, including the backs of the hands, between the fingers and under the knees.
Japan takes the genes of the hair, and studies indicate that people are likely to washing hands when using Japan than when using water alone.
Stay for at least 20 seconds.
Rescue creating frequency, which helps to remove hair genes, and rest for more extended periods, eliminating more genes.
Shopping well with the flowing water.
Drop up in a press can again be polluted with your hands.
Smoke with a clean towel or leave the air.
Homed and mounted hands return to contaminate more easily. The parties that are forgotten with more often are dog, smoking, kitchen, areas between the fingers and under the dogs
Artist birds and disappeared wedding can accommodate microorganisms.
Frequently, it is recommended that the hands should be removed; the sewed hair can cause damage that can increase the risk of transmission of infection.
A number of economic options can be used to facilitate the lavage of hands when it is not available from flowing water or Japan, for example, to turn water from a collated bike or heat with appropriate or use of ceniza if necessary in developing countries. In the situations where there are limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions to maintain water, such as "carbon graffs" and other economic options.
A boxer griff is a simple technology that consists of using a sustained throat of a throat and a fited pill with the feet to see a small amount of water on the hands and a jabon on the bar.
The effective seed of the hands is an essential part of the hygiene process, but there is certain debates on the most effective form of seating in public baths.
Every time, more research shows that the paper tons are much more hygiene than the electric hands secators found in many baths.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, made a study, sponsored by the association of European Tissue paper tolls of European Tissue Symposium, to compare the levels of hygiene offered by paper tonnes, warm air scanners and more modern air secators.
After washing and washing hands with warm air secreasure, the total bacteria has increased average 194% in fingers and 254% in palms.
The average increase of the total bacteria amount of 42% in the thumbs and 15% in palms is sewn.
After washing and washing hands with a paper thumb, the total amount of bacteria reduced average 76% in the legs of the fingers and 77% in the palms. Scientists also performed tests to determine whether there was the possibility of translated pollution of other bath users and the bath environment as results of each type of seed method.
The air seater, which was swimming air from the speed unit, as stated by 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), has reached the microorganisms of the hands and the unit and, potentially, polluing other bathroom users and bathroom environment to a distance of up to 2 metres.
The use of a warm air sequer has propained the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters of distance of the sequor.
The papers did not show significant proliferation of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study carried out by TÜV Product and Environment, different hand-seed methods were evaluated.
The following changes in the bacteria record were observed after the hand-shake:
There are many secators of different hands, and the hands' scatters have compared to the seat with paper tubes.
washing your hands with desinfective toilettes for hands is an alternative during the trips when no water or Japan is not available.
The desinfector for alcohol-based hands must contain at least 60% alcohol.
The hands of the doctors' leaking was very obligation after Hungary Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for prevention of diseases in a hospital environment.
There are e-mail devices that provide comments to remember the members of the hospital staff that are laid hands when they forget.
A study tried to reduce infection rates with its use.
Doctor's hand washing is done at least 15 seconds, with a large amount of water and jabon or yellow to shape the smoke and restrict all the sides of the hands.
The hands must be restricted together by throwing the fingers.
If there are remaining under the feet, you can use a kit pocket to remove them.
Since genes can stay in the water in the hands, it is important to shoot them well and cut them with a clean towel.
After the seat, the card thumb should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This shows that the hands return to be polluted by these surfaces.
The purpose of manual washing in the medical care environment is to eliminate the pathogeneous microorganisms ("genes") and avoid transmitting them.
According to New England Journal of Medicine, the laundry of hands remains inacceptable levels in most of medical environments, where many doctors and hospitals usually are forgotten to washing hands before to touch patients and thus transmit microorganisms.
A study showed that the correct washing of hands and other simple procedures can reduce the infection rate of the blood tower related to cateer in 66%. The World Health Organization has published a table in which the standard hand washing is shown and the standard manual flowing in the medical care sectors.
The previous version of the guide hygiene of the organization can also be found on your website so that the public can make comments.
Whitby and others carried out a relevant review.
Trade devices can measure and verify the hygiene of the hands if the demonstration of the regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has "Five moments" for hand washing:
After exposition to blood or body leakages
Before an assembled work
Following patients. The adding of anti-septic chemicals in the Jabon (medicinal jabons) or "antibacterianos") will confid you the possibility of elimination to the hand washing agent.
This elimination may be needed before a cirugy or insides where the resistent organs are very frequently to antibiotics. To wake your hands before a cherry operation, you must tell you with a griff that can be opened and closed without touching it with the hands, a bit of clorhexidin or iodo for the washing, furnished tails to cut the hands after the lake, a steeriled cep to fresh up and another exeriled instrument to be cleaned under the ovens.
All joys must be removed.
This procedure needs to be washed by hands and advantages to the cotton, generally, during 2 to 6 minutes.
Not needed to be washed for a long time (10 minutes).
The water of the springs should be avoided to return to the hands.
After washing, the hands are shot with a smoothed shot and a chirurgic battle.
To reduce the propagation of genems, it is better to wake your hands or to use an anti-septic for hands before and after taking care of sick people.
In order to control the infections caused by stafilococos in hospitals, the greatest benefit of hand cleaning is at the first 20% of the milk and that very little additional benefits have been obtained when more than 35% of hand hygiene is increased.
The common lavade with Japan gives more than the triple of bacterian infections transmitted to food in comparison with anti-bacterian washing. In comparing hands with a alcohol solution with an anti-bacterian bacterian bacterian washing for a middle of 30 seconds in each case, it was noted that the flowed with red alcohol was 26% more the contamination of baktery than the Jabón.
However, water and Japan are more effective to reduce green virus A H1N1 and Clostridium's hands that desinfectors for alcohol-based hands. The interventions for improving the hygiene of hands in health care centres may include training to staff on hand lab, increase the availability of desinfecting for hands on alcohol and written recorders and oral to staff.
More needs to be investigated on what is the most effectiveness of these interventions in the different health care environments.
In developing countries, it is considered that Japan’s hand laundry is an economic and fundamental tool for a good health, including a good food.
However, the lack of a reliable water supply, Japan or installations to wash hands in houses, schools and workplaces, makes it a challenge to achieve universal hand washing conducts.
For example, in most of African rural areas, there are very few griefs to wash hands near public or private networks, although there are economic options to build hand washing stations.
However, low washing rates may also be the result of smoothed housings and not of the lack of Japan or water.
Promotion of hand washing with Japan may affect political decisions, increase awareness on the benefits of the hand washing and cause a change of behaviour in long-term population.
In order to operate effectively, it is necessary to monitor and assess.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, Community approaches are effective to increase hand washing in PRBM, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. A example of the promotion of hand washing in schools is the "Tree stars" approach of UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple and economic measures to ensure that students have been laid hands with Japan, among other hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are reached, schools can finally pass from one to three stars.
The construction of hand washing stations may be part of the promotion campaigns of the hand washing layer that is going forward to reduce child mortality and child mortality.
The World Day of Manos is another example of concertation campaign that is trying to achieve a change of behaviour. As a result of the coronavirus pandemia 2019-2020, UNICEF encouraged the creation of an emotic for hand washing.
A few studies have considered the overall rental of hand washing in developing countries relating to evitated AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting hand washing with Japan is significantly more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of human health milk was recognized at the first time at the middle of the XX century by two pioneers of the hand hygiene: Hungary Ignaz Semmelweis Hungary, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English, "fundor of modern disease".
In that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by olderly desagradable named mysms.
In 1980, the brown of food diseases and health care infections had been brought to the United States ' s Control and Prevention of Finances to promote more actively hand-hygiene hygiene as an important way of preventing infection propagation.
In 2009, the pornish grippe browser and COVID-19 pandemia in 2020 made more aware of the importance of washing hands with Japan to protect these infective diseases.
For example, in Germany, there were "profit techniques to wash hands" together with public bathrooms and bathrooms of offices and airports.
The sentence "laught hands" is a declaration to not want to be charged of something or share the complexity of something.
He has his origin in the Bible passover of Matteo, in which Poncio Pilate was laid the hands before the decision to crucifie Jesus Christ, but has become a greater word of use in some English communities.
In Macbeth of Shakespeare, Lady Macbeth began to wash his hands in a compulsory way in an attempt to clean an imaginative man, which represents his consciousness of guilty of the crimes he had committed and had brought his husband to do.
It has also been checked that after recalling or reflecting non-ethnical actions, people have to wake the hands of the most often than others and have to appreciate the elements for the washing of the hands.
Furthermore, those who have allowed to washing their hands after this reflection have less likely to be involved in other compensatory "to cleaning" actions, such as a voluntary.
Religious religions recommend the washing of hands with hygienic and symbolic purposes. The washing of hands, symbolic, with water, but without Japan, part of the rival hands in many religions, such as the baism, Hindusm, the Tevila and the yadaim netilat in the Jewishm, the lavator in Christianism and the green. Religies also recommend the lavade of hygienic hands, particularly after certain actions.
Industry, Jewishm and islam are obliged to wake the hands after going to bathroom.
And Indianis, Buddhism, Sishim, Judicism and Islam are obliged to wash their hands before and after every food.
Risk controls in the workplace before COVID-19
COVID-19 risk controls concern the implementation of hygiene and occupational hygiene methodology in risk controls for the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The appropriate risk controls in the workplace depending on the workplace and the workplace and are based on an assessment of the risks of exhibition sources, the gravity of disease in the community and the factors of the risk of workers that may be contrary to COVID-19.
According to the Security and Business Health Administration (OSHA) of the United States, work with smaller exhibition risk have a minimum working contact with public and working partners, which are assisting the prevention of basic infections, including hand washing, the recommendation of workers to stay at home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene standards and maintenance of a limpiece and desinfection of work environment.
Works with a middle exhibition include those in which frequent or close to persons who are not known or suspected having COVID-19, but that they may be infected by the Community transmission or by an international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, working environments with a great concentration of people and some minorest sales of large size.
Risk controls for this group, notwithstanding basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-effective air filters, protector coverages and individual protection equipment available in the case of a person with COVID-19.
OSHA believes that workers of health care and funeral services, exposed to persons who are known or suspected having COVID-19, have a high risk of exhibition, which increases to very high if they can generate aerosols in people who are knowing or suspected that they have COVID-19 or take samples or manipulate.
Adjusted risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as ventilation salts with negative pressure, and individual protection teams appropriate for work activities.
COVID-19 cards may have several consequences on the workplace.
Workers may lack to work for sickness, to be careful of others or for fear of the possible exhibition.
It may change trade patrons, both in respect of the goods are requested as well as of the means of purchase of these goods (such as buying in hours that they do not be swimming, through shipping services to home or by sale from the car).
Finally, articles from geographical areas affected severely by COVID-19 could be interrupted. A preparation and response plan can be used for infected diseases to orientate preventive measures.
Plans are addressing risk levels related to various work sites and work activities, including exhibition sources, risk factors from home and Community environments, and the risk factors of individual workers, such as the old or chronic medical operations.
They also describe the necessary controls for addressing these risks and containing plans for situations that can be surrounded as a result of brows.
The preparation and response to infected diseases may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of response to a browser are included to reduce transmission between staff members, to protect people who have more risks to suffer adverse health complications, to maintain commercial operations and to minimize adverse effects in other entities of their delivery chains.
The graveness of the disease in the community where the company affects measures to be taken.
The risk control jerarchy is a widely used framework on hygiene and occupational security to classify risk controls according to its effectiveness.
If COVID-19 risks can't be removed, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administratives and finally individual protection equipment.
Engineering controls involve the isolation of employees of dangers related to work without recurring to the behaviour of workers and can be the most rentable solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in policies or working procedures that require the employer or employer's action.
The individual protection teams are less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exhibitions.
All types of individual protection equipment must be selected in place of the risk for the worker, as appropriate (e.g. respirators), to be used appropriate and systematicly, to be frequently reviewed, to receive, to replace if necessary and to remove, to be cleaned and stored or disappeared in a correct way to not contaminate.
According to the Administration of Health and Business Security (OSHA) of the United States, work with smaller exhibition risk has a minimum working contact with public and workers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all working places include deep and fresh hand washing, the recommendation of workers to stay in the house if they are sick, the respiratory hygiene standards that include to cover the tower and the smoothing, the delivery of charming and containers for disappearing, the preparation for teletraffick or disappeared tours if necessary, the discharge to workers of foreign tools and equipment and the maintenance of a lempiece and desinfection of the worktor.
Identity and immediate isolation of persons who may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others on the workplace.
The Centres for Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that the employees who have an adverse respiratory disease symptoms remain in their homes until they have fiber, fiber characters and any other symptom during at least 24 hours without taking medicinal products to eliminate or disappear fibre symptoms; that the licensing policies for disease are flexible and authorize the employees to stay home to care for a sick family, and that those politics have been used.
According to the OSHA, the work with a middle exhibition are included those who require frequent or close to less than six feet (1.8 m) with persons who do not know or are suspected that COVID-19 have been undertaken, but that SARS-CoV-2 could have been connected because of the Community transmission of the time of the company around the location of the company, or because the person has recently made a international travel to a place with general transmission of COVID-19.
These include the workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, the growth of work with a great concentration of persons and some curricula of small-manian sales of great size. The engineering controls for this group and the higher risk groups include the installation of high-effective air filters, the increase of the ventilation rates, the establishment of physical barriers such as the protection covers of transparent plastic and the collection of a vendor for the service of attention for the customer can request from the automation. The administrative controls for this group and the higher risk groups include an estimated value of the petrol feed fees, the value of the petroleum and growing value of the petroleums of the petroleums, the value of the petroleums and the meaning values of the growing values of the petrover, the value of the value of the petrover and the growd value of the value of the value of the value of the values, and the growd value of the growd values of the value of the growd valued valued valued valued value of the valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued value, and the valued valued valued valued valued valued valued value, and valued valued valued values of the values of the valued valued valued valued valued valued valued value of the feast, and values of the values of the values of the feastd values, and valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued feastd valued value of the value of the valued valued value of the feat, and the valued value of the value of the values of the shared valued valued valued valued valued values of the feas of the value of the valued value of the valued valued values of the values of the valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued values of the valued valued valued valued values of the valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued and the valued valued valued valued valued and the valued and the values and valued valued valued valued valued valued valued value of the valued valued values of the value of the values of the values of the values of the valued and the valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued valued values, and the values,
Workers of this risk group should be used in rarely respirators.
If a person is sick in a aircraft, checks appropriate to protect workers and other passengers include separate the sick person from others to a distance of six feet, design a member of the tripulation to be added to the sick person and offer a mask to the sick person or ask the sick person to cover the mouth and nest with papers when he touchs or storms.
Cabin's tripulation should be used to be dismissible chergic guants to reach a patient or to touch corporal flowers or surfaces that may be contaminated and, perhaps, individual protection equipment if the patient has fiber, constant or difficult to respirate.
Guitars and other discharged articles must be disappeared in a bus for dangerous biological residues and polluted surfaces should be cleaned and desinfected afterward. In the case of trade navigation, such as crosss and other packagings that transport passengers, risk controls include the posture of the travel on disease, autoindication and notify immediately to the medical center on the boat if someone presents fibre or other symptoms when he is on boat.
The ideal is that medical control is done in the hamper of the isolated person. In the case of schools and child care centres, the CCDs recommend short-term closure to clean or desinfect if one infected person was in the school, independently of the Community transmission.
When the Community transmission is minimum or moderate, social distance strategies can be implemented, such as closing excursions, meetings and other massive meetings, such as physical or core education classs or foods in the dinner, increase the space between pupites, escape times of entry and exit, limiting visits that are not essential and use a separate place for the health room for children who have grippe symptoms.
When there are considerable transmissions in the local community, notwith the social detention strategies, it can be considered to extend the cancellation of classs. For the police forces carried out daily rotine activities, CDC believes that immediate health risk is lower.
The police officers should be recommended to enter into contact with persons who have a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis to continue the same pairs as the medical techniques of emergency, including the use of personal protection equipment.
If there is a close contact during a detention, the workers must clean and uninsufficient their work census and equipment with aerosol or cleaning aerosol or toallities before reuse and follow the standard operational procedure for the content and desire of the personal protection team and containing and washing of the roof.
OSHA believes that certain health and morgage workers are in high or high-related categories of exhibition.
Among the high-related risk work is found from the delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers that are exposed to patients with confirmed diagnostics or suspects of COVID-19.
These are made to work of very high exhibition risk if the workers are performing airsole generation procedures in patients with confirmed diagnostics or COVID-19 suspects or if they take samples or manipulate these patients.
Some aircraft generation procedures are intuition, tox induction procedures, broncoscopia, some detaine procedures and reviews or invasive taking of samples.
High Exposed Exposure Works include those in which the workers are involved in the preparation of COVID-19 cadverys or are suspected that they could be able to have it at the time of death; these are going to have a very high risk of exhibition if they are carried out. Additional engineering controls for those risk groups include isolation salary for patients with confirmed diagnostic or suspects of COVID-19, even when the aircraft generation procedures are performed.
Specialized ventilation with negative pressure may be appropriate in some medical careing and morbide environments.
The samples should be manipulated by taking biosequity level precautions. 3.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients who enter into a different expected salary should be divided in a position if they are suspected or not able to have COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protection teams, the OSHA recommends that the use of masks for those working to a distance of up to 6 feet of patients who have been contained or suspected that SARS-CoV-2 have been contained by aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, N95 respirators should be used with a mask of filtration adopted by NOSH or above in the context of an integral respiratory programme which will include medicine testing, training and medicine reviews.
Other types of mask can provide more protection and improve the comfort of the worker. OMS is not recommended the use of protector monos because COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one transmitted by corporal fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a chirurgic mask for patient classification staff.
For those who take respiratory demonstrations of patients with COVID-19, they provide care or transport them without implementing aerosol generation procedures, the WHO recommends the use of cherrgycry mask, fat or facial defender, batteries and guants.
If an aircraft generation procedure is performed, the chirurgy mask must be replaced by a respirator N95 or FFP2.
Since the delivery of personal protection equipment is insufficient, the WHO recommends that the need to be used by telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, the limitation of the access permission to the room of a patient with COVID-19 only those involved in their direct attention, the use of the same mask without restarting it while taking attention to several patients with the same diagnostic, the monitor and coordination of the chain of personal protection equipment and the use of mass by persons of synthematics.

ASUNTO: [Covid-19] Highlight the load and prepare for the future
FECHA/HORA DE ENVITY: 14 March 2020, 00:24 h, universally coordinated time
LICENCIA: CC0: No reserved rights
This month, we met in individual circumstances.
The epidemic of COVID-19 shows that our human interconnection at global level and the responsibilities we have one with another.
The challenges presented are not previous, but we know that our best response is radiated in the emphasis, cooperation and global construction of the Community, which are compliance with this organization.
The camera and the concern we have seen among all our partners in e-mail messages, calls and conversations is a great validity of how incredible people we have the chance of work.
I couldn't feel more grateful and pride that you all are my fellows.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation that he felt for our work.
I remembered how important this world can assemble Wikipedia at this time, and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available for all.
Your work makes it possible, whether it is possible, while maintaining the current sites, helping our partners receive their payment or maintain our communities.
The world needs information that Wikipedia provides today more than ever.
This is a moment in which we do not only what we do but the way we will have a deep effect in the world.
In view of the importance of this mission and its role in this, since this next week, we will make some important amendments to the way we work together.
Adjust our work and our chronograms
As mentioned previously Robyn, the C team gathered to talk about our approach and our chronogram for the next days and months.
In this conversation, we considered what we believed would be an appropriate response to what we endeavoured and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
We wanted to remove the stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to reduce the speed, it's okay.
For all staff, contractors and employees with contract:
Our daily job expectations will be from around 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week, until next advertisement.
We are not declared a feast; if you can work at a normal time, this would be great useful for the mission.
However, the world is an incredible place at present, and it has to be careful of his desired beings, to buy or go to the doctor, our priority is your welfare.
We're not taking the account of your hours.
If he's sick, don't work.
Although you don't have to do it, we're saying it.
There is no need to request the license for disease or free time; only report your manager and assist your team to revise calendars and cronograms to ensure that the key areas of work are covered.
(If you receive a positive diagnosis from COVID-19, advises Bryan from operations from T-C, so that T-C can help with support and ensure that the germen is so much of its situation).
People working for hour will receive the total payment.
As we said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and staff partners who work for time.
All will be paid on the basis of their normal hours working in normal circumstances.
This is also applied if he is sick and can't work.
If you want to work, it's our support.
Many people use the work as a way to cantalize their stresses with the world around us.
What we do can be incrediblely grateful, especially in these times.
Newly, it is your personal care.
What we ask is to communicate with your manager so that we can know what we can wait and correctly adapt us.
Some work are considered essential.
There are some things we have to continue to do.
The Technology Engineering teams, Human Resources Operations, Confidential and Security and Funds Research, among others, play a critical work that could require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess the current objectives and to modify our approach to support those essential for our mission.
There are sufficient tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we all will focus on the most essential projects.
Reducing speed today will not harm us tomorrow.
We don't plan "duplicate hours to put us on the day" when the pandemia ends.
It will not be expected to work for extra hours to meet time-limits that are not already realistic.
We agree that the circumstances have changed and will work in order to establish new objectives and terms when appropriate.
What's happening with the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adapt our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to customize the cronogram for the delivery of our Annual Planning of 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose a extension of our plan of 2019-2020, which provides more time to the budget, so that employees may be able to priorize critical work, personal care and desire care while we adjust to the needs of those who need or want to work with a reducted time during the next weeks.
This extension of our cronogram reduces the current loads of planning and pressure in all organizations.
We will submit our proposal before the Council on the week that comes and report to them the next steps to delegates and teams, at least, will be confirmed.
Thanks to the APP team for your leadership in this situation.
State, exhibition and cleanness of the office
Last week we learned that one of our partners of the San Francisco office could have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we accorded an anti-virus cleaning team to desinfect all the surfaces of the San Francisco Office.
An anti-virus solution of hospital use to desinfect all surfaces, besides the receipt and attractors that go to our pool.
The building has adopted its own career's provision, using products supporting the security of their employees.
We feel confident that the office will be well prepared to decide to come back.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members in the DC offices.
From the past week, our DC office moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the shoes shared with San Francisco.
As some of our partners in New York, we also talked about a location in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still present, but they can be remembered.
Some of our fellows are remotely working for the first time.
Our fellows who already worked away since the time they know that this modality requires an adaptation, so they provide the following suggestions:
Limits the duration of the meetings at intervals of one or two hours as maximum.
If more extended sessions are required, it considers how to seal them in the past of several days.
Defines clearly the meeting with a list of topics and send read materials with advance.
Adjusts the default use of video in terms, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate cooperation and connection.
It designs a leader to moderate each meeting, a person who controls questions in the chat and the list of prayers, and someone who helps take note (or take notes in collaborative manner).
Send an email message to technical support if you need a comfortable auriculars.
Use the reimbursement of goods for ffrigerators.
Use the channel #remotions in Slack to talk to your partners about the distributed work
The RR operating team is analyzing the paths on ergonomics based on web seminars to support the increase of the work distributed throughout the Foundation.
The last week we requested all beneficiaries of Community subsidies to cancel public events financed by Wikimedia, such as editatones, until the WHO declares the end of the pandemia.
We told you that we understood that our request for cancellation and other restrictions could not impose to the fulfilment of their part of the agreed activities for subvention and that there would be no sanctions to have such objectives.
This next week will be followed with additional steps in Vietnam and other Community and regional thematic conferences.
The general feeling of the community at global level seems to be, partly, tristely by interruption and partly by encouraging clarity and capacity to focus on their own communitys, both the Wikimedia and others.
Furthermore, CRT will work to establish a Meta-Wiki page in order to provide a space to the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Keep contact with COVID-19 matters
We will send you an invitation through their calendars for the next Thursday, 14:00 a.m., universally coordinated time/07:00 p.m., hour of Pacific, for a special staff meeting.
We will like this opportunity to share additional news, answer their questions and take time to connect each other.
We are together in this and we are available to help how we can.
While soon, you can continue to find the information of this e-mail message and all the essential information related to COVID-19 in the Wiki Office.
CRT will keep these updated pages and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with the staff living in countries which are currently affected in greater time.
If you have some questions on travels, events, an important workflow, any coverage problem or any thing with which you can need aid, don't doubt to notify CRT and work with them.
We are here to help provide support and function as a link when necessary.
If they have confidence or offences, send an email message to Bryan Judan, Director of International Operations of RR. HH.
No one of these changes should be considered a leave of our work and our obligations.
Instead of this, it is a recognition that our work and our obligations would probably have been adapted in a way that had not happened before.
These are the measures that we believe needed to support us one another in order to continue working, to give it to our movement the necessary support and to provide the service in which he trusts.
Our planned work will continue there for us when it gets the moment.
Now, it is time to support us mutually and to place for the important work that will come in the next weeks and, perhaps in the next months.
We need all of you so that it may be possible and therefore we need to be careful and to keep your families so that you can be found in the best possible state when the need is overcome.
Now, please, wake your hands, and don't touch your face!
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M and Tony S) and the rest of the Lederazgo team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M and Toby N).
The converter enzyme of angiotensine 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme that is attached to the external surface (cellar cells) of pulmone cells, arteries, heart, rinonnies and intestinines.
ECA2 is contrary to the activity of angiotensina converter enzyma (ECA) in relation to angiotensina II reducing the quantity of angiotensina (1-7) and increased angiotensina (1-7), which is to be a therapeutical dinana for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ECA2 also serves as a point of entry to cells for some coronavirus.
Human version of the encyme generally named HECA2.
The converter enzyme of angiotensina 2 is a metalenzima containing zinc and is located on the surface of endotelyl cells and other types.
ECA2 protein contains a N-terminal domination of peptidasa M2 and a renal C-terminal transporter domination of colectrine aminoatosis.
ECA2 is a unique membrane protein of type I, with its enzimically active dominion covered on the surface of pulmonary cells and other tissue cells.
The extraordinary dominio of the ECA2 is excessed from the trans-embranal domain by another known enzyme as crystal and, as a result, the soluble protein is released in the blood torrent and, at last, is excreted by the orine.
The ECA2 is presented in most organs: the ECA2 is mainly adhered to the cell membrane of the type II of pulmones, the entire intexis, the coming arterial and endo thermal cells and the lower muscle cells of the majority of the organs.
The expression of the ECA2 MARN is also found in the cerebral corte, the storm body, hypotalim and encephalic tronco.
The main role of the ECA2 is contrary to ECA.
The ECA excludes the hormone of angiotensina I and forms angiotensina II, which is a constraining vacuum.
At the first time, the ECA2 exhibits the aminoato carboxilo-terminal fenilalanin of angiotensina II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and the hydrolysis to form angiotensina vasodilatadora (1-7), (H-Asp-Arp-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-pro-OH).
ECA2 may also excluse several other punishments, including [des-Arg9]-browdiquinine, apipine, neurotensina, dinorfine A and greline.
The ECA2 also regulates the trafficking of neurth-aminoids carriers SLC6A19 and has been connected with Hartnup disease.
As transmitbranal protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronavirus, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus caused by SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus caused by COVID-19).
More specifically, the unit of the S1 SRS-CoV protein and SARS-CoV2 with the enzymatic dominio of the ECA2 on the surface of cells has a result of the endocytosis and the transfer of virus together with the enzyme to the endodomees found within the cells.
This ingredient process also requires the preparation of protein S by the protease TMPRSS2 of the hospital, the inhibition of which is currently investigated as possible therapy. This has conducted some hypotheses that the reduction of ECA2 levels in cells could help fighting infection.
However, various professional and regulatory partnerships have recommended continue inhibitable treatment of ECA and BRA standard.
A systematic methodistic review published on 11 July 2012 defined that “the use of ECA inhibitors was accompanied by a significant reduction of 34% of the neutrality risk compared to control cases”.
Furthermore, “the risk of neumony was also reduced in patients receiving treatment with ECA inhibitors and having a greater risk of neumony, particularly those with cerebrovascular and cardiac insecurity.
The use of ECA inhibitors was also associated with a reduction of neuromic mortality, although the results were not so strong for the general neutrality risk."
The recombining human (rhECA2) human (rhECA2) seems to be a new treatment for adhesive pulmonary lection and seems to improve pulmonary hemodimy and saturation of oxygen in lessons with adjacent respiratory syndrome stipulated by lipopolisacardes.
The average life of rhECA2 in human beings is approximately 10 hours and the starting of action is 30 minutes further than 24 hours (durance).
Several foundgs suggest that rhECA2 may be a prometector for those persons with intolerance to the classic inhibitors of the nina-angiotensina system (inhibitors) or in the diseases in which angiotensina II circulated. The infusion of rhECA2 was assessed in clinical tests for the treatment of aguous respiratory syndrome.
COVID-19 applications are software applications for mobile devices designed to help contact raster in response to the cronvirus pandemia of 2019-2020, i.e. the process to identify people ("contacts") that could have been contacted with a contacted person.
Various applications have been developed or proposed by official government support in certain territorys and jurisdictions.
A number of contact-related frameworks have been developed.
In particular, the systems based on the geographical location of users of the application have been made concern.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as the use of Bluetooth signals to register the neighbourhood of a user to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to add those applications directly based on your iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has implemented a application that allows citizens to verify whether they have been contacted with people with COVID-19.
It is already in use in more than 200 Chinese cities. In Singapur you are using a TraceTogether application.
The application was developed by a local TI community, it was launched as an open code application and will be led to the Government. In North Macedonia, StopKorona was launched, a application based on Bluetooth to strive the exposure to potentially contained persons and to provide rapid response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communication and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
On April 14, 2020, the application was at the expectation of the adoption of Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the Government informed that the implementation of contact rasters was found in a further stage of development and that it would be available for its implementation in the next weeks. It was planned to use a similar application in Ireland and France ("StopCovid").
Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the application of TraceTogether and the Blue Trace of Singapore. Russia plans to introduce a geoperimetrage application for patients living in Moscow and have received a COVID-19 diagnostic diagnosis, designed to ensure that they do not go out of their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of Cambridge Security Ingenieure, explicits several potential practical problems with applications, including false positives and possible efficiency if the adoption of the application is only limited to a small part of the population.
In response to the concerns of the proliferation of the "coonavirus" applications of false or damaginas, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add applications related to the coronavirus in its App Store to "oficial" organizations or confidence only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
The Privacy Defenders expressed concern about the consequences of massive monitoring through the application of the coronavirus and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created was unemployed with coronavirus pandemia once the threat was passed.
International Amnesty and more than 100 other organizations presented a communication to require limits to this type of monitoring.
The organizations established eight conditions for government projects:
monitoring should be "legal, necessary and proportional";
the expansion of the monitor and monitoring should have an extension clauses;
Data use should be limited to COVID-19 objectives;
They should protect security and anonymity and have a evidence of this protection;
digital supervision should avoid the exemption of discrimination and marginalization;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined in laws;
Protections against abuse should be implemented and established by citizens' rights to respond to such abuse;
All relevant stakeholders, including public health experts and marginalised groups, will be the significant participation of all ' relevant stakeholders'. The Chaos Computer Club (CCCC) and reporters Sin Fronteras (Reporting without Grenzen, RSF) also published control lists.
The plan proposed by Google/Appple is intended to address the problem of continuous monitoring by removing the raster mechanism of its operational systems when no longer needs.
In some countries, a race of the location based on networks was used instead of applications, which deleted the need to download application as well as the capacity to avoid race.
In Israel, the race based on networks was adopted.
The network solutions that have access to malicious location data present significant potential privacy problems.
However, it is not necessary that all systems with central servers have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created only for intercommunication (see the following section).
In South Korea, a system was used that is not based on a application to carry out the contact raster.
Instead of using a specific application, the system collected raster information from different sources, including mobile device raster data and transactions with credit cards, and combined them to generate warnings by text messages for potentially contained persons.
Besides using this information to advise possible contacts, the Government also made that the location information was available to the public, something that is allowed because of the changes of great access to the privacy laws of information after the MERS browser in that country.
This information is available for the public through various applications and websites. Some countries, including Germany, have considered use of centralized and privacy systems.
On April 6, 2020, the details have not yet been published.
It is a well established concept of contacts with privacy protection, with a large number of publiced investigations, at least to 2013. At April 7, 2020, more than ten of expert groups were working in respect of the privacy solutions, such as the use of low energy (BLE) to record the neighbourhood of a user to other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated efforts containing both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include the decentralized neighbourhood ratio to maintain privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCN, before known as contact numbers, CEN) and the contact protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact railway (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, personal identification data are never coming from the device and all the driver is on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacyd Group has developed SafePaths, a platform for the use of technicals protecting the private collection and use of location or intersection of roads to strike the propagation of COVID-19.
It is based on the research of the technical report "Apply out of control: how to maintain personal privacy during a epidemia" published in March 2020. Another similar efforts is the Safe Trace platform of Enigma MPC, a company that develops private technologies that was originally funded in the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow users to share delicted location and health data with other users and officials, without involved the privacy of these data.
On April 5, 2020, a number of groups linked to the same approach and with highly relevant protocols formed the World TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and allowing the global interoperability of races and warrant applications, a key aspect to achieve an enlarged adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Government of Singapore announced that the Blue Protocol was opened by its official government application.
On 10 April 2020, Apple and Google, the firms controlling iOS and Android mobile platforms announced an initiative for contact race, which would protect the privacy, which is based on the combination of low-energy Technology and the protection criteria.
The specifications of the main technologies used in the system were also published.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to implement three steps:
Implementation of tools for Governments to believe a rare application of official coronavirus protecting privacy
Integration of this functionality directly in iOS and Android. Google and Apple are planning to address the continued adoption and monitoring problems by distributing, firstly, the system through updates of the operational system and then removed them from the same way once the threat has passed.
(b' Reperfilement (although known as therapeutical suspension or change) is the rehabilitation of a family approved for the treatment of a disease that is not the for which it was originally developed.
This is online with the scientific research that currently seeks to develop secure and effective treatment for COVID-19.
Another research lines include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and convaincing plasma transfusion. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemical proteins, each of which has multiple links sites.
The analysis of these unit sites provides the reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective anti-virus factor against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important dynamic proteins of SARS-CoV-2, the similar protease is found in the similar protease to the papaine, the ARN polymerase directed by ARN, helicis, the protein S and the ADP ribosfatase.

The treatment has not been approved by the DAF clinical test process and is authorized only as an experimental treatment for urgent use in patients who are hospitalized, but they cannot receive treatment in clinical testing.
The CDCs said that "the use, the dose or the duration of hydroxicloroquine for profilexis or the treatment of SARS-CoV-2" is not yet established.
The doctors said that you use the format when "no other option".

A study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kalatra), a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir anti-vir anti-retrovir, concluded that "nee had been observed benefits".
The factors were designed to prevent HIV replication by joining the protease.
A research team at the Colorado University is trying to change the factors to find a compound that is one of the SARS-CoV-2 scientist community. In the scientific community, criticisms have been made on the allocation of resources to reproduction specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international test of Solidarity.
The redesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for the disease by Ebola virus and the infections by the Marburg virus. Afterward, Gilead Sciences discovered that the redesivir had anti-virus activities in vitro against multiple filovirus, neumovirus, paramixovirus and coronavirus.
A problem of anti-virus treatment is the development of resistence through changes that may result in a seriousr disease and transmission.
Some initial studies for studies suggest that redesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistence. A number of clinical studies are currently available, including two guests of Cleveland University; one for people with a moderate disease and another for those who have a seriousr disease.

b' A vaccine against COVID-19 is an hypothetic vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical tests, there are many attempts to develop this vaccine.
At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (OMS) said that he was not expecting a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus caused by disease at least 18 months.
In April, five possible vacuums were in security studies at phase I.

In April, the requirements for the ECPI development initiative for a vaccine are speed, manufacture capacity, implementation and global access.
In April, the CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technological platforms were investigated and developed at the beginning of 2020 to create effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Among the diamonds of the main platforms carried out in phase I, the following are:
Nucleic acid (ADN and ARN) (developter of phase I and possible vacuum: Moderna, MRNA-1273)
Victoria vector (developter of phase I and possible vacuum: CanSino Biologicals, Adenovirus Vector type 5)
According to CEPI scientists in April, 115 possible vaccines are at the initial stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, in accordance with the Millken Institute) and 37 others are declared, but with a few available information (for example, planning or development).
A test at phase I or II is carried out preliminary tests of security and immunogenicity, usually aleatorial, is controlled by placebo and is performed in several sites, as determined more precise and effective doses.
The tests in phase III may be involving more participating, including a control group, and assess the effectiveness of vaccine to prevent disease when controling the adverse effects that are produced with the best dose.
Of the 79 active development vacuums (confirmed at the beginning of April 2020), 74 were not yet in human assessment (see the "preklinic" investigation).
On 24 January 2020, the University of Queensland announced that he was investigating the potential of a vacuum with molecular sujection that would genetically change the live proteins to stimulate immunity reaction.

The possible vaccine based on ARNm BNT162 is currently in preclinic tests and it is expected that clinical tests start in April 2020.
In Italy, on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of preclinical tests in April 2020 and that human tests of the possible end vaccine could start on October.
In France, 19 March 2020, the Coalition for innovations in Epidémic Preparation (CEPI) announced a USD 4,9 million in an investigation partner of a vaccine against COVID-19, including the Pastor Institute, Themi Bioscience (Wena, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, which brings the total investment of the CEPI for the development of a vacuum against COVID-19 to USD 29 million.
The other partners of the CEPI for the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 are modern, Curevac, Inovio, Newvax, Hong Kong University, Oxford University and Queensland University.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officers announced that scientists started testing in six possible vaccine animals.
The Imperial Collery of London announced on 20 March 2020 that a ARN vaccin was developed with authorisation against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine was developed within the 14 days of the Chinese sequence.
At the end of March, the Canadian Government announced CAD 275 million research projects for 96 medical research projects to address COVID-19, which includes a large number of possible vaccines in Canadian companies and universities, such as Medidgo initiatives and Saskatchewan University.
More or less than at the same time, the Canadian Government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a vaccine against COVID-19 with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vacuums that could be used if another crown brown is produced.
On 2 April 2020, the researchers of the Medicine Faculty of the University of Pittsburgh announced the tests of PittCoVac, a possible vacuum against COVID-19 in rats and said that "the vaccines of the S1 subunitity of the SARS-CoV-2 SA have received powerful responses from the specific anti-hygenics (in rats) which were evident two weeks after the vaccination."
In Canada, on 16 April 2020, the Farmacetic University of Waterloo Faculty announced the design of a possible vaccin based on ADN as an likely pulverized nasal.
The DNA will be designed to replicate in the human bacteria and produce inocculte parts similar to virus, which can stimulate the immune system to produce anticuerpos against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the Government, the industrial sector and three United States universities gathered resources for access to IBM supercomputers, together with computers in Hewlett Packard cloud Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vacuums have non-specific effects.
This means that they can benefit beyond the disease prevealed.
Another test aleatorized in Australia seeks to register 4170 health workers.
The vaccines that are developed may not be secure or effective.
The initial investigations to assess the effectiveness of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressed by ECA2, other laboratory and non-human primates, make it clearly the need to contain bio-security measures of level 3 for the manipulation of live virus and international coordination in order to ensure standardized security procedures.
The vaccines against the SRAG and SROM have been tested in non-human animal models.
In 2020, there is no health or vaccine which protects the TRIG which has proved to be safe and effective in humans.
In accordance with research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and medicinal products for treating CEG was a priority for Governments and public health agencies worldwide.
When the SROM was generalized, it was believed that existing TRIG research could be a useful model to develop vaccines and treatments against infection by MERS-CoV.
In March 2020, a vaccine against SROM (based in ADN) completed the clinical tests in humans, other three were running, all of which are video vectors, two adenovial vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one of MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
The publications in the social means promoted a conspirative theory according to which the COVID-19 virus was known and was already a vaccine.
The patents quoted by various publications in social means refer to existing patents for genetic and vacuum sequences for other coronaviros cepas, such as the coronavirus of SRAG.
(b'The disease by coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectocentageous disease occurred by the coronavirus of severe respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fiber, tos and difficulty to respirate.
Other symptoms are fatigue, muscular pain, diarreae, warranty pain, oil loss and abdominal pain.
The time it passes between the exhibition and the starting of the symptoms is about five days, but it can vary between two and fourteen days.
Although most of the cases are slow symptoms, some are progressing in biomnemonia and multiorganic insufficient.
On 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases in 210 countries and territories were reported, with more than 153.000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been recovered. The virus is mostly distributed among people during the stretch contact, generally through the fats that are produced to to the tuber, to storm or to speak.
Although these gains are produced to exhalar, usually fall on the pool or surface, instead of being contagious in long distances.
People can also be contained by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, narness or mouth.
Virus can survive up to 72 hours.
It is more contagious during the first three days after the start of the symptoms, even though the propagation is also possible before the symptoms and in stages of disease. The standard method for the diagnostic is the reaction in chain of polymerase with inverse transnscription in real time (RT-PCR) of a nosfaringeo hisopade.
The use of masks is recommended for those suspects that have virus and their careers.
The recommendations on the use of masks for the general public are different. Some authorities recommend that it should not be used, others recommend that it should be used while others require their use.
There is currently no specific vaccine or anti-virus treatment against COVID-19.
The local transmission of disease has been registered in most of the WHO countries in the six regions.
Those who are infected by virus may be asintomic or have similar symptoms to those of the gripe, such as fiber, tos, fat and difficult to respirate.
The emergency symptoms include difficulty to respirate, pain or persistent pressure in the hair, confusion, difficulty to walk and face or blue lions. If these symptoms are present, it is recommended immediately to search medical attention.
It's less common to observe symptoms in the upper respiratory ways, such as smoke, narrow and warranty pain.
gastrointestinal symptoms have been identified in variable percentages.
Some cases in China were initially presented oppression on the hair and palpitation.
In some, disease progressed to neurmony, multi-organic and death insufficience.
This is named incubation period.
The COVID-19 incubation period is 5 to 6 days, but can vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5 per cent of those who have symptoms do it within 11.5 days of infection. According to the reports, not all infected are symptoms.
The role of these asintomic ports is not yet fully known; however, the preliminary evidence suggests that they can contribute to the dissemination of disease.
The percentage of infected persons not presenting symptoms is not known at the moment and is studied. The Core Control and Prevention Centres (KCDC) reported that 20% of the cases confirmed were followed asytomic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asintomic cases on 1 April. Of 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were an syntomic when tested.
Like the exemption and the salt may have large wine loads.
Speak in higher free voice than when talking to a normal volume.
A study in Singapore discovered that not cover the mouth to the toast can make the gatines traveling 4,5 meters (15 feet).
Although virus does not wish to be air transmission, the National Science Academy suggested that transmission through biological airlines is possible and explained that air collectors in the past outside the bedrooms of people were given positively to ARN video.
Some medical procedures, such as intuition and reanimation of the cardiopulmonary (RCP) may cause aerosolation of respiratory segments and therefore air transfers.
Although there are concerns about the possibility of propaining by the heets, risk is low. Virus is more interesting when people have symptoms; even though the propagation is possible before starting the symptoms, the risk is lower.
The European Centre for Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that a person is generally infected at two or three or more. The virus is survive hours or days on the surface.
Specificly, virus was detected for one day in the carton, up to three days in the plastic (polipropilene) and inoxidable steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in products with 99% copper.
However, this would be according to humbleness and temperature.
Japan and detergent are also effective if they are used in the right way. Japan's products degrade the protective lips of the virus and disable it, besides the removal of the hair and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as Benzalcony chloride and chlorhexidin glucanate (un desinfectant cherurgic), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, the salive demonstrations were taken in average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first show had the highest video load. In the case of the sixth patient, the highest video load was observed in the second test day.
The coronavirus of the severe respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new crowd of severe respiratory syndrome, which was firstly isolated by three people with nermony connected to a group of cases of respiratory disease in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 new virus are found in related coronavirus of nature.
Without human body, the home Japanese kills the virus, since it returns to its protecting bubble. The SARS-CoV-2 is extremely connected to the original SARS-CoV.
The pulmones are the most affected by COVID-19 organisms, because virus enters into anfitrion cells through angiotensina I type 2 (ECA2), which is more than in the pulmonary cells of type II of pulmones.
Virus uses a special superficial lycoprotein called "special" (special) to connect ECA2 and enter into the anfitrion cell.
In 12 per cent of hospitalized persons in Wuhan, China, a huge heart lection was identified, which is more frequently in serious disease.
The rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, because of the systhematic inflation response and the transtours of the immune system during the evolution of disease, but the appropriate lection of mycard may be related to the ECA2 recipients in the heart.
ECA2 receivers have a high expression in the heart and participate in their operation.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and thrombolie arrived (25%) in patients in the UCI with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to a prognostic fault. In the autopsis of people who failed by COVID-19, disfused disaster damage (DAD) and inflated inflation in the pulmones were detected.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism by epileal cells expressing ECA2 of the respiratory paths, the patients with COVID-19 serious symptoms have systémic hyperinflation symptoms.
In particular, the T-CSF secrets were noted with the recruitment of IL-6 secret monocytes and severe pulmonary patologie in patients with COVID-19 patients.
In autopsias, also infiltrated linfocics were informed.
WHO has published several test protocols to detect disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase reaction in line with inverse transnscription in real time (rRT-PCR).
The test is easy to do in samples of respiratory paths obtained by a nasfarinio hisopath; however, there can also be a proof of nasaal hisopeds or exputo.
In general, the results are available between a few hours or two days.
You can also use blood analysis, but two blood samples must be taken with two weeks of difference and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists achieved the isolation of the coronavirus cep and published the genetic sequence that the world’s laboratory could develop independently testing of polymerasa reaction chain (PCR) to detect virus infection.
On 4 April 2020, the tests of anticuerpos (which can detect active infections and if the person was infected in the past) were developed, but they were not widely used.
The experience in China with evidence showed that the preciseness is so much than 60 to 70%.
The FDA in the United States adopted immediately the first test of diagnostic diagnostics on 21 March 2020 to use it at the end of the month. The diagnostics patates published by the University of Wuhan would suggest methods to identify infringements based on clinical characteristics and the epidemiological risk.
In visual visious opacity with a perifec, asimetric and after-related multilowers are common in the initial stages of infection.
As an progressed disease may appear subpleural dominio, degraded pattern (seven lobby growing with a variety of heat) and consolidation.
A few data on microscopic lessons and the COVID-19 fisiopathology are available.
The main pathological results of the autopsias are the following:
Macroscopy: lamentation, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and pulmonary edema
Four types of gravity of Viric Neumony can be observed:
Leve neumony: pulmonary edema, hyperplasis of nermotics, attractively large neumocies, interstitive inflation with infiltration of linfocytes and green cells with multiple numcles
Seven neumony: disfused alveolar damage (DAD) with difused alveolar exuded.
DAD is caused by acous respiratory syndrome (SDRA) and serious hypoximy syndrome.
Guarantee Neumony: Exuded organizations in Advocal Café and Pomonary Interstitive Fibrosis
Sangre: disadvantaged intravascular coagulation (CID); leucoeritroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce infection opportunities include stay in the house, avoid locations with many people, washing hands with water and jabon frequently by at least 20 seconds, having a good respiratory hygiene and avoid to touch the eyes, nest or mouth without washing hands.
The CDC recommends to cover the mouth and narrow with a pool when to touch or storm and, if you don't have a spam, use the internal part of the cod.
A suitable hygiene of the hands is recommended after toast or storing.
The CDC recommended that the use of the tea tabulars in public places, one of the reasons is to limit transmission by asintomic persons. Social disarmament strategies seek to reduce contacts of infected persons with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travels and cancel public meetings.
It also indicates that persons must keep a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19. As it is not expected that there is a vaccine until 2021, as soon as it is, a key part to control COVID-19 is to try to prevent the epidemic pico, which is known as "planing curva".
The CDC also recommends to washing hands often with water and Japan at least 20 seconds, particularly after going to bathroom or when the hands are visiblely sweet, before eating and after sounding nariz, torch or smooth.
They also recommend the use of a desinfector for alcohol-based hands that have at least 60% alcohol, but only when there is no water and jabon available timely. For the areas where desinfectors for hands are not easy to achieve, the WHO gives two forms for local production.
In these formulations, antimicrobian activity results from etanol or isopropanol.
hydrogen proxy is used to help eliminate bacterian springs in alcohol; "not an active substance for the anti-sepsis of the hands".
The glycerol is added as humble.
Patients are given attention to support, which can include rehidratation, oxenotherapiece and treatment for other vital bodies affected.
The CDC recommends that those suspecting virus use a simple mask.
In order to address the problem of respiratory insufficiency, the benefits are still analyzed.
In order to improve immunity, a personal hygiene and a style of life and healthy food have been recommended.
Support treatments may be useful for those who have lower symptoms at the initial stage of infection. WHO and China National Health Commission have published recommendations for care of hospitalized persons with COVID-19.
Intensivists and neumologists in the U.S. have completed the recommendations of several agents in a free resource, IBCC.
In April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For the initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend compartamol (acetaminofeno), instead of ibuprofene.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in health care environments when aerosols can be generated, such as intuition or manual ventilation.
CCDs recommend health care professionals with COVID-19 to place patients in a air infection zone (AIIR) as well as using standard precautions, contact precautions and precautions to avoid air transmission. The CCDs stress the paths for the use of personal protection equipment (EPP) during the pandemia.
The recommended teams are EPP battle, mascarilla, drugs and medical guests. When they are available, the respirators are prefected in place of the masks.
The N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but FDA authorized its use through urgent use authorisation (EUA).
They are designed to protect particules which are in the air, such as the dust, but not guarantee the effectiveness against a specific biological agent that is not suspended in the indications of the product.
When there are no masks, the CDC recommends the use of protector careers or, as the last resource, case masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not sufficiently serious to require mechanical or alternative ventilation, but a percentage of the cases.
This type of respiratory support for hospitalized persons with respiratory insufficience related to COVIDA-19 has already been studied and has some evidence that intuition can be avoided with a high-flower canal or positive bipresión in respiratory paths.
It is still not known if one of these two gives the same benefit to people in critical state.
Some doctors prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technical limits the propagation of aerosol partails in comparison with high-funk naal canal. Several cases are most adults (the over 60 years and, in particular, the older 80 years).
Many developed countries do not have enough head beds in hospitals, which restricts the capacity of the health system to manage the immediate increase in serious cases of COVID-19 that require hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5 per cent was admitted to intensive care units, 2.3 per cent needed mechanical support for ventilation and 1.4 per cent.
In China, approximately 30% of hospitalized persons with COVID-19 are finally transferred to the UCI.
The mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a patient with COVID-19 presents adjacent respiratory syndrome (SDRA) and oxygenation is always more difficult.
Respirators need different ways of pressure control and PPTE to minimize oxygen supply, although the risk of pulmonary lesion related to the respirator and nemotorox.
Old respirators can not count with high PPTE.
Research on possible treatments started in January 2020 and several anti-virus factors are in clinical tests.
The remdesivir seems to be the most proof.
Although the development of new medicines can be reduced to 2021, several medicines that are already tested are approved for other uses or are in advanced tests.
Antiviral medicinal products may be tested in people with serious diseases.
The WHO recommends volunteers to participate in the tests of the effectiveness and security of possible treatments. The FDA provided temporary authorisation to the convalent plasma as experimental treatment in cases where the life of the person is serious and immediately.
The clinical studies needed to demonstrate whether it is safe and effective for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile application to led with the lack of disease.
Users must enter their name and identification number.
The application can detect the "stream contact" and therefore a potential infection risk through monitoring data.
Each user can also control the state of other three users.
If possible risk is, the application recommends not only self-conflict, but also warning local health officers. The analysis of the cell information analysis, facial recognition technology, the monitoring of mobile phones and artificial intelligence are used to strike infected persons and those who were in contact with South Korea, Taiwan and Singapur.
In March 2020, the Israeli Government allowed the security agencies to expand the data of the mobile phones of suspected people to have coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen the quarantine and protect those who can enter into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telecom shared the data resumed of the localization of the phones with the German Federal Government Office Robert Koch Institute in order to investigate and prevent virus propagation.
Russia has implemented the facial recognition technology to detect the incompliances of the quarantine.
The Regional Health Commissioner Giulio Gallera said that mobile phone operators had reported him that "in any way, 40 per cent of people are still moved."
The German Government conducted a weekend of 48 hours with more than 42,000 participants.
Furthermore, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global request for creative solutions against the propagation of coronavirus.
People can feel threatened by quarentine, travel restrictions and secondary effects of treatment or fear infection in themselves.
The BBC cited Rory O'Connor: "The growing social island, solity, health care, stress and economic problems are an perfect torment for mental health and well-being of people."
The disease can continue a lower evolution with few or without symptoms, so it will be seen to other diseases of the higher respiratory paths, such as the common heat.
Arrangement cases are usually recovered within the two weeks, while serious or critical cases can delay from three to six weeks to do so.
The female women can correct the risk of countervailing serious infection by the COVID-19 virus, in accordance with the data of other similar viruss, such as the SEG and SROM virus, but the COVID-19 data are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 can affect pulmones and cause neumony.
In cases of more seriousness, COVID-19 can rapidly progress the respiratory water syndrome (SDRA) that causes respiratory insufficience, septic chock and multiorganic insufficience.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include sevensis, changes of cardiac, renal and hepatic damage.
The change of coagulation, specifically the increase in protombine time, has been 6 per cent of the patients hospitalized with COVID-19; while the change of the renal function is observed at 4 per cent of this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with CODIV-19 have hepatic enzymes (aminotransferase).
According to the same report, the average time between the starting of symptoms and death was 10 days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the UCI, there was a half of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In a study of initial cases, the average time from the demonstration of the first symptoms to death was from 14 days, with a full interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study of China National Health Commission (NHC), the rate of mortality between men was 2.8 per cent and among women was 1.7 per cent.
Histopathological exams of postmortal samples of pulmones show an alveolar damage with cellulated fibromixoids in both pulmones.
Vitrical cycle changes were observed in the neumocies.
The image of the pulmones was assembled to the aggressive respiratory syndrome (SDRA).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by China National Health Commission, the heart damage resulted from high levels of troponin or cardiac.
According to the data of March of the United States, 89 per cent of hospitalized persons had a pre-exection. Availability of medical resources and socioeconomic aspects in a region may also affect mortality.
The estimates of the abuse of mortality were different from these regional differences, but also by methodological difficulties.
The insufficient receipt of loss cases can make the rate of mortality oversight.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of cases contracted in the past may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
The smokers had 1,4 times more opportunities to pade serious COVID-19 symptoms and approximately 2,4 times more opportunities to need intensive care or to fall in comparison with non-smoking.
The Hong Kong Hospitals Authority found a decrease of 20 to 30% of pulmonary capacity in some persons recovered from disease, and the images of pulmones suggest the impact of the bodies.
This may also cause intense care after recovery.
In March 2020, it was unknown if previous infections generated an effective long-term immunity in persons who were recovered from disease.
It seems that immunity is possible, based on the behaviour of other coronavirus, but there were cases recovered from COVID-19 that were later positive in coronavirus.
It is believed that these cases are a continuing infection and not a refect.
This virus is considered natural and animal origin through an interspective infection.
The real origin is not known, but, on December 2019, the proliferation of infection was almost complete to human transmission.
A study of the first 41 cases confirmed by COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, pointed out as the first date of the start of symptoms at 1 December 2019.
The WHO's official publications reported that the first symptom manifestation was on 8 December 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures were different by the region and in the time, as well as the volume of tests, the quality of the health system, the treatment options, the time passed from the initial browser and the characteristics of the population, such as age, sex and general health.
At the end of 2019, the WHO added the CIE-10 emergency disease codes U07.1 to deaths confirming infection laboratory by SARS-CoV-2 and U07.2 to deaths with clinical or epidemiological COVID-19 diagnostic diagnosis without confirming infection laboratory by SARS-CoV-2. The letality rate reflects the amount of deaths divided by the amount of diagnostic cases divided in a timely interval.
Based on the statistics of the University of Johns Hopkins, the global loyalty rate is 6.9% (153 822/2 240 191) at 17 April 2020.
Other measures include the rate of diagnosed patients (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed persons who die from a disease, and the letality rate infected persons, reflecting the percentage of infected persons (with or without diagnostic) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not dependent on time and continue to a specific population from infection to the resolution of cases.
Although not all infected persons produce anticuerpos, the presence of these may provide information about how many persons have been infected.
In the epicenter of the breast in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4600 people, 80 (1.7%) has already failed.
In Gangelt, the disease was propained during the carnaval festivals and affected younger people, and there was relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all the deaths of COVID-19 have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overflown.
In the Netherlands, approximately 3% of the population has anticuerpos, as defined by blood donors.
It was confirmed that 69 (0.004% of the population) died by COVID-19.
The impact of pandemia and mortality rates are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher among men in studies carried out in China and Italy.
The largest risk of men is for those who are in their 50, and the break between men and women is achic only for 90 years.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 in men and 1.7 in women.
The exact reasons for this sex difference are not known, but it could be to genetic and conductive factors.
Inmunological differences based on sex, the lower number of women who are flowing and the fact that youths have comarbied oppositions, such as hypertension, could have contributed to the highest rate of mortality in youth.
In Europe, 57% of infected persons were males and 72% of COVID-19 falls were males.
On April 2020, the United States Government does not strive sex information in the case of COVID-19 virus.
Research shows that biric diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and TRIG affect men and women differently.
An increased percentage of health workers, in particular the hospital staff, are women, and have more opportunities to exhibition to virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
The Chief of the WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to corona, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 at the date of the printing was discovered: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in conjunction with international recommendations of name to prevent sterilization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called coronavirus of severe respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the COVID-19-virus" in public communications.
It is common to use "coronavirus" to refer to both disease and virus.
During the initial browser in Wuhan, China, he was common to make reference to virus and disease as "coronavirus" and "coronavirus of Wuhan".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-nCov and respiratory water disease for 2019-nCoV as temporary names for virus and disease, in accordance with the indication of 2015, to not use locations in virus and diseases.
COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 official names were issued on 11 February 2020.
Since capacity limits in standard delivery chains, some digital producers are printing health material, such as nazal Hipoops and parts of respirators.
For example, when an Italian hospital had needed urgently the validity of a respirator, and the supplier could not deliver it at the required time, a local emergency company made inverse engineering and printed the 100 balances required during the night.
Following the initial browser of COVID-19, theories of conspiration, false information and desinformation on origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of disease which were quickly distributed by the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit virus to some other animals.
The study has not found evidence of wine replication in brass, patches and powders.
There are no medicinal products or vaccines adopted to treat disease.
Government organizations, academic groups and researchers in the sector are carried out international investigations on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization started the “Ensayo SOLIDARIDAD” to assess the therapeutical effects of the four existing anti-viritary components in terms of effectiveness.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are working actively possible vaccines.
The previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 uses the ECA2 recipient to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies have been investigated.
First, researchers are trying to develop a complete vaccine of virus.
The use of this virus, being inactive or dead, is aimed at generating a rapid immune response of human body to a new infection by the COVID-19 virus.
An second strategy, sub-unity vacuum, seeks to create a vacuum that sensibilizes the immune system to certain virus subunities.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this investigation focuses on the S protein that helps the virus to place in the Receptor ECA2.
A third strategy is the nucleical acid vacuum (DNA or ARN vessels, a new technique for creating vaccines).
The experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should be studied to determine their security and efficiency. On 16 March 2020, the first clinical test of a vaccine with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an inocutable copy of the virus code caused by the disease. It has been suggested that improvement based on anticuerpos is a potential challenge for the development of vaccines against SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
In April 2020, there are more than 300 active clinical studies.
Six tests were evaluated therapies already approved for paludism, including four hydroxicloroquine or cloroquina.
The anti-readed forms are the majority of Chinese research, including nine tests in phase III on remdesivir in several countries and should reports at the end of April.
In April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on vaccine and possible pharmatics against COVID-19 was carried out. A number of anti-virum medicinal products for COVID-19 treatment, including the following: remdesivir, chloridine and hydroxicloroquina, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/trionavir in combination with interferon-beta.
In March 2020, there is a tentative evidence on the effectiveness of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with the compasive use of remdesivir.
Clinical tests in phase III in the United States, China and Italy have been carried out. The cloroquin, which was previously used to treat paludism, was studied in China in February 2020.
However, there are requests for reviews for the investigation.
The health authorities of Korea and China recommend the use of cloroquin.
However, although the Wuhan Virology Institute recommends a daily dose of a gram, he notes that the double of that dose is very dangerous and could be ready.
On 28 March 2020, FDA provided an urgent use authorisation for hydroxicloroquine and chlorokine to discretion of patients treated with COVID-19. The 7th edition of Chinese patates also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
The previous data indicates that high ribavirin doses are required to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
It was recommended that more income studies of the Natazoxanid were done, after determined that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. The studies have shown that the initial cebad of the S protein that performs the trans-muneprotease of type 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for the entrance of SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with the Receptor ECA2.
The studies of chlorokine and hydroxicloroquine with or without azitromycine have important limits that demonstrate that the medical community takes these treatments without any further studies. The oseltamivir does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the COVID-19 treatment.
The release of civics can be a complication of the latest phases of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxicloroquina may have properties that prevent liberation of civics. The National Health Commission included tocizumab into the treatment packs after the completion of a small study.
It is found in a non-alidated national test in Italy after viewing positive results in persons with serious disease.
It is expected, in combination with a series of serial ferritin blood analysis to identify civil liberation, that is contrary to those effects, which believes are the cause of death of some infected persons.
The FDA adopted the antagonist of the receipt of interleukine-6 in recent cases for the treatment of the civil liberation syndrome resisting to the steroids caused by other cause, the treatment of T-CAR T in 2017.

The transmission of clean and concentrated anticuerpos has been investigated by the immune system of those who have been recovered from COVID-19 to those who need them as a passive immunization method without vaccine.
This strategy has been tried with the ERDG with non-concluding results.
Virus neutralization is the expected action mechanism by which passive treatment with anticuerpos can defend SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as cell cycloxicity dependent on anticuerpos or fagocitosis.
Other forms of passive treatment are developed with anticuerpos, for example, using manufactured monoclonal anticuerpos.
The production of convalent sugar, which consists of the liquid blood of recovered patients and contains specific anticuerpos against this virus, could be increased in order to achieve a faster distribution.
