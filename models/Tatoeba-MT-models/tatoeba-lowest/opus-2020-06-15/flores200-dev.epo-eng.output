This causes the rotation of the screen. If the skeets are clicked right, the screen turns on the right if the tickets are clicked on the left, the screen turns on the left.
In order to return to their previous energy level, they have to disappear the overflow energy they received from the light.
They do this by sending a miniature part of light named "foton".

The next image shows atoms to send photos. Of course, in reality photos are much less than those in the image.
