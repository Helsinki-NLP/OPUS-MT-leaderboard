Because the bottom of the climb is a little smoke when the climb is knocking on one side or on the other, and the egg that is in connection with the ice is cured.
This causes the rotation of the screen. If the skeets are clicked right, the screen turns on the right if the tickets are clicked on the left, the screen turns on the left.
In order to return to their previous energy level, they have to disappear the overflow energy they received from the light.
They do this by sending a miniature part of light named "foton".
Scientists call this process "stimulated radiation emission", because the atoms are stimulated by the light, which causes the emission of light photography, and the light is a kind of radiation.
The next image shows atoms to send photos. Of course, in reality photos are much less than those in the image.
Photos are even smaller than those of the atoms!
