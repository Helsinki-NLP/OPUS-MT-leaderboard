The Prague Borsa at the market closure has been a negative crowd.
After the morning crown, the Borsa of Prague resumed the losses.
Transactions of the ECB have reached almost half the current daily trade.
From the beginning of March, the Borsa of Prague took back from the crown of the day before it was almost 6%.
After this decline, there's a crown of actions in Wall Street.
Thus, by us, a reaction of the market is shown in the result of the vote of the Chamber of representatives in America, which refused to support the stabilization plan of the local financial sector.
Action Round in Asia
On Tuesday, the Asian Borse's actions lived a chromatic dramatic drammatic, although the indicators, however, during the day, have deleted a part of the losses.
The Hang Sing indice of the Hong Kong Borsa during the day was removed almost 4 per cent, but later also a part of the losses set up by 2.5 per cent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises, which follows the movement of Chinese actions to the Borsa of Hong Kong, was based on 3,8% while the markets were closed in Shangai.
The actions at Sydney's Borse lost more than 5%, but finally loss were at 4,3%.
The Thy-Wan Borsa, according to the local index, has declined from 3,6%.
"The planning of salvation action is incertain and it will affect financial markets throughout the world," noted the Chief of the Valute Office of Hong Kong Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite China, is only managed by financial policy, therefore without depending on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level.
The American lawyers, in accordance with the first Australian Kevin Rudd, should rapidly return to the dialogue and approve the proposal for financial support.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries have consequences.
Strategy of American actions
Monday, the American Parliament rejected the financial support plan for which 700 billion dollars should be paid (such as 12 kitchen corners).
The legislators have so ignored the call by President Bush to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would resolve the main causes of the financial crisis and help to stabilize the whole economy.
Monday American actions have lived a straight and the main indicators of action have registered the greatest crown from over a venty.
The Dow Jones index was based on almost 7% and a crown of such sizes was observed last time in 1987.
The index was already down before the vote, but it was seen that the design of law was not approved, it was in free fall.
The Congress concluded: US government can extend $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the American congress and the Government of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of economic support for the American financial system.
The vote will be at the beginning of the next week.
American legislation legislators have broken the glass in the dialogue on the approval of the Saving Plan in the form of economic aid for the American financial system for a total of $700 million (such as 12 coron cells).
But it's not yet out of it.
The representatives of the Congress must therefore define some details of the integration before publishing the final form of law and voters.
The financial support plan will be discussed on Monday on the Territory of the Representatives Chamber.
Sunday, he said this to the Reuters Agency, President of the Committee on Budget and Finance Services of the Barney Frank.
The Senate, according to some sources, may probably be voted on the plan before Monday.
The economists that will be announced by the adoption of the financial plan should be the first and fundamental psychological factor in order to monitor financial markets.
However, there will be a return to the reality because of the complexity of mechanisms with which, in practice, will reach market assistance.
Paulson: The Piano must be effective
"We made a great step forward."
"We have cleared our different views on the form of the presentation of the market stability package," said the Democratic Nancy Pelosi Agency.
According to the same , the final vote could still be Sunday.
The delegations of legislators joined the night between Saturday and Sunday with the Minister of American Finance Henry Paulson, to give definitive form to the Government's financial funds.
These funds should be used to buy from financial companies the non-Chlopocable goods, which brings seriously loss financial companies and risk the stability of the whole system.
"We are to complement the definitive agreement of the plan that will function and which must also be effective on the market."
"It's necessary to take further the resurrection plan, but I think we're there", said Paulson.
The Asian Trade Segnar
The global financial crisis is strong on the markets of actions that are breastly broken.
According to the Democratic Senator of Nevada Harry Reid, the legislators are trying to reach a definitive agreement to the Congress again before Sunday.
They want to calm the investors before the trade on the Asian financial markets, which are the first to influence the Lunch market in accordance with the Congress decision.
But now it is not definitely clear when the two American Congress Chambers will vote the law and even though negotiations can be arrested at the last time on some problems.
The legislators hope that it will be approved in the next days.
But the law will still be changed.
The total amount for the system support must be divided in two parties.
The first 350 billion dollars must be available as soon as he asked President George Bush.
But the Congress can block the remuneration of the remuneration in the case that the program does not exercise its function by blocking the following $100 billion and after the ends of 350.
Bush welcomed progress in negotiations.
Although the President can make the vessel on this decision, the Congress may, however, overtake its right of vessel.
Despite these changes, the basic thought of the programme has been kept, it is important to get the funds to buy passive hypothecs values, whose price is crouled because of hundreds of thousands of Americans who are not able to pay their hypotheses.
"We've made everything.
The Chamber of Representatives should be able to vote on the Sunday law and Senate on Monday," as the Senator said.
The progress in negotiations is also satisfied by the American Bush President.
His carrier Tony Fratto declared that Bush is satisfied with the positive and appreciation of the Sabato and appreciation "the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and to protect our economy."
Restriction of gold paracadutes
The President of the Bank Committee of Senate Christopher Dodd, the main portfolio, said that the lawyers have been agreed on the responsibility of the financial programme, the protection of contributions from loss, the closure of the budget of reductions, the fraction of the financial plan.
The new law should also be limited to the so-called gold paracepts for companies leaders who participate in the programme and create a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We worked very hard and have made a great step towards the agreement that will work and will be useful for the market and for all Americans," said Paulson.
The plan contains aid on the owners of households with payment problems.
The Government should negotiate the new rates of hypotheses that will buy with the aim of decrease the monthly expenditures for debtors and will allow them to hold their homes.
Marek: Psychology support
The proposed plan is, according to the main name of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its achievement will be very difficult.
"And why we don't know how and why the price will be bought the problems
This will be determined for how the losses will be divided between them and the financial sector," Marek said this week for the site iHNed.cz.
If the plan is approved now or at the beginning of the next week is not, according to Marek, so fundamental.
"Much more important, it is that the representatives of the Congress have a agreement on the support of this plan and that they have been baptized before it possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that is adopted is now the most important, " he stressed Marek.
Last blood dull: MP3 readers against cells
We will advise how to choose
While almost each cell can read MP3 files, no MP3 reader can call.
It's clear that it's better to buy only the phone.
Despite this, there are many reasons for which a self - reader is proceedings.
The choice depends on the use and needs of the future owner.
Perhaps you have learned a precious high quality rounds to listen to us the latest Turbulenc album.
First of all, these musical products are not like LP and from the qualitative point of view for this does not even exist a reason.
However, if on your square, hard-rock, jazz or blues are likely, a gentle tourist as at least you dream it.
Also works with the portable music, that is composed or simply in MP3 format.
There are also prices and quality categories.
For some, it may be inadequate to pay for a 8,000 corone reader, as well as a Pink Floyd fan may have differently disagreemented cables from 20 corners of the market.
Two extremes between those there's enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
To decide is the time of battery.
Some high quality music readers can do much more than just read the music, but what they don't do cells even for unfortunate.
There is no other current device as universal as the cell.
Besides the primary functions, call and send sms, you can read music and videos, register both and have a photo car, sometimes better and may also be able to navigate.
And if we take into account the smartphones and palms, you will also have a computer in miniature.
And ‘ a little wonder because no fresh can make the grill and no television can picture nothing.
The University of the cell also leads to disagreements.
More functions you used on the cell and before the display indicator will require the battery.
And read the music of a lot of energy consumption.
A few cells can read music for more than 12 hours, so much less.
In this sense the musical readers (soptically those simple) are much more efficient.
With regard to economic cells, you don't tell that they can continue for more than some hours.
If you still add us, from when, some calls , try to work for the security of another loader, this is also for the most costful devices.
But you don't have this problem with a MP3 reader, even worsts keep at least 9 hours with functionality continued with a recurrent.
Another problem resists when the music is downloaded in the cell.
Unfortunately only a limited part of devices available from the universal USB port and, mostly, all can be connected to the computer without a special software.
Of course, music can be registered directly on memory card, but only few memory readers are able to make it without adapting minicards that are not used in cell cells.
Readers, including some exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Just fill the device with the USB music from the computer.
Most cells and readers are created a multimedia library which is ordered according to the names of the interpretations, name of the album, kind or according to the classification of the user.
Some devices can only play the directory tree structure, such as the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can both do the things (river, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, intelligent phones with operational system).
Readers are easier to manage, cells can make more.
When you choose a special device, you are particularly interested in the battery resistance of the battery, memory capacity, quality and the type of audio output and clearly of the use facility.
If your music needs especially underground and if you listen to it all the days just shortly on the tram you're just a MP3 cell cellular.
This is now, clearly any cell.
You don't have to care too much of what forms the cell or the reader are recognized.
The MP3 readers support them all, the global majority of the music that you arrives will be exactly in this format.
In addition to this format of the most diffused, most of the devices supports the WMA music in the WMA format.
AAC is less available (format used by Apple company and its iPod).
The best cells also allow to buy music on-line.
It's easy to visit, through the mobile Internet, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This service could already be a valid subject to buy a cellular cell.
Unfortunately, the offer of operators is missed and it is usually limited, only at the time of radio.
The prices are not very low.
But generally it is expected that this type of music sale (which transmitted by GSM, Internet or without sons) will control the music industry in future.
Most people always take the cell behind.
Whoever wants to listen to some fruit in the cup while the MP3 reader remains forgeted at home.
However, it also depends on this, if you always take the coffee or at least auricular without son.
If not, you can use the integrated player that almost each cell, but only a small part of MP3 readers, you have.
Maybe the greatest benefit of cell cell cells will be the price for many.
The most economic costs normally less than 3000 corone.
For 3 and 4000 corone, you'll already buy a very worthy walkman.
However, you will normally be limited by “no entry for common coffees.
The best technological cell cells and the most equitable technical view and also with the capture of 3,5 mm for common coffees, costs up to 15,000 corone.
Instead, the benefit of readers is, above others, easy manageability.
The simplest none often more economic (see our choice) makes it really everyone to manage them.
The minimum of the functions, the similarity of managedness a time with the stereo or may the tournament, is obviously.
There is no danger of urge for the starting of the mobile Internet network and the consequence of a huge bullet for transmission of data.
Take a device
The most economic cells (e.g. Vodafonne 527) have a slot for memory memory cards (type M2, microSD etc.).
Also concerning the acquisition of the respective card, entered into 2 000 corners.
But take care
Basic models support only cards with maximum 2GB capacity.
Only those most costful are also doing it with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile and you want to buy a MP3 little costly valuable reader, you will take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
According to the capacity (max. 2 GB) you must not pay more than 1 100 corone.
If you're part of the most requested hearers, you'll preferably take specialized cell cellularies - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and service comfort so close to the same MP3 reader.
In this field, Sony Ericsson has made more route, which walkman cells have the same use scale as MP3 readers sold separately.
The MP3 readers of the above-specific walks ensure the same service and the same price category up to 4 000 coron, but with a greater memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery resistance (only 15 hours, in line up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will reach the Czech Republic since this year.
Maybe.
Maybe the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is sufficiently moor and our operators are practically offering all services such as their partners in Western Europe.
However, that lacks something – a virtual operator that obligations those traditional to lower the price.
Maybe he won't miss for a long time.
Because the Czech operators are the most loved in Europe, we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
To the end of the accounts, he also confirmed μTU, which noted that the price of the SMS is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the last steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming tariffs, a paradosis situation may be created - for some of the cell mobile operators, the SMS will cost less than foreign.
How can prices in the Czech Republic remain so high against Europe?
The answer is simple, lacking the competition that would really want to start the discovery .
Maybe it sounds absurd, even where we have three mobile and covered networks higher than 100 %.
In addition to mobile telephone operators, the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, also the Chief of the Czech Telecommunications Council, Pavel Dvoćák, which sometimes expressed that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It may be true that the traditional operator with his own network has no longer many opportunities. (The rest may now be difficult to find other frequencies.)
But there is still another opportunity - the virtual operator.
The income on the market of virtual operators has brought a significant decline of prices to which traditional operators should have reacted.
At the same time, before the arrival of schools such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile on the market, they renewed voices like us in Britain.
However, it has been shown that the place for operators of this kind is and that they can have really success.
For examples, we don't have to go far away.
In February this year we told you about the arrival of the virtual Mobilking operator in Poland.
In only half of the year, this operator has been able to buy more than 100 thousand clients and to become the largest local operator.
At the same time, the Penta Financial Group is in the Czech Republic between the other U:fon.
The benefit of virtual operators is the possibility of concentrate on a more concrete group.
In order to actually work it's enough, so many less clients than a traditional operator.
They are not back, i.e., relatively high costs for the creation, functioning and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators are usually lower costs, calls and SMS offers little pricely, which is often in balance with the biggest offer of services.
Thus, for example, Tesco Mobile in Gran Bretagne, it offers SMS that costs at least half than its concurrents.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland is shown, it may be a very good move, even the shot on a group-barsulament not even a little.
This operator points to that specifically on men.
"The real men choose Mobilking operator who loves him and you can trust" says David Seibertz CEO Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if we can also say a similar concept like in Poland.
The portrait of the print for Vodafone Miroslav ≥epický is concerned: "The Czech market is relatively small for an approximated approach, which is based on most virtual operators.
In addition to the point of view of services is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic, there are no possibilities to say the mobile network operators
But it seems likely to be sure that if there will never be an operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be the mobile.
"There are talking about the extension of this project of success, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic do not have many expectations.
The accession of Mobilking will be more than in the other countries of our area," he said in a phone dialogue for Mobile.cz Jana Studničková, the carrier of the printing of the Penta Pen.
This has thus confirmed indirectly that current operators in the Czech Republic are not very favourable to this thought.
On the other hand, they're trying to do everything because you don't believe any potential competitive.
Since a few times, it does not hide its own interest for the starting of a virtual operator, the Novea GTS group who would like to do so a different step to become a real concurrent of Telefónica O2 in the field of business customers.
"We have a great interest to offer our customers not only fixed services but also mobile telecommunication.
And before it's better that it's.
We have recurrently discussed on this opportunity with all the mobile carriers of the mobile network.
We are already able to progress in the negotiations with some of them", says the Port of the Pavel Kaidl Group.
So, maybe the best time is coming.
The non-official information indicates that the first virtual operator may have it over the end of the year.
But now around its creation there is an immense silence wall.
"We do not believe that in the Czech market there is space for the creation of a full-titled virtual operator.
The Czech market, on the difference of other markets, is very specific.
Until now no subject with a comprehensive and serious project has been addressed to us," he mentioned in his statement for Mobil.cz Vlastimil Mrsšeć of the printing section of Telefónica O2.
At the specificity of the Czech market, the other operators also required.
The carrier of the printing of T-Mobil Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the declaration O2: "For now we have not known any commercial and profitable projects for both, on which it is possible to continue to build."
And adds: "In the T-Mobil network a virtual operator will appear within the end of the year.
At this time, we had already had to have a concrete agreement on the table, as it could be considered to the 'orthous."
Vodafone focuses its attention rather than at reaching your requests of license 3G.
Add Miroslav ≤epický: "We are open to the negotiations of virtual operators and especially in the context of the allocation of expenditures and infrastructure.
Let us consider this, from the point of view of customers, the most producer.
The main Vodafone strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for mobile Internet."
The competent authorities - with compliant operators
The allocation of mobile telephone operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean an increase in competition, would lead to the decrease of prices and the reduction of the benefit.
Why then facilitate the extent of such concurrents?
Cross around the U:fon creation testify that when operators have a thing they know that they do the same.
Maybe the big pressure was pressed against ≥TU during the creation of U:fon to the T-Mobile company.
These testifying the public information on access from the web pages of 周TU.
But now you are:fon needs as a subject for which you do not accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová noted: "The environment of the competition of the mobile phone market has been little powerful, above all, with the entry of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
With regard to the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another concurrent would be on him and in particular on its high-developed services.
However, it is surprising that the entire disinteressed by the Czech regulators is undermined.
It is not only the “determination of the Czech Republic” that, unfortunately, has a difference in the United Kingdom and other developed countries, has no competence to engage in economic competition.
This is exclusively in the Economic Competition Office (UOHS).
However, this towards all the problem has taken its typical position.
"The entrance of the virtual carrier on the mobile phone market would be possible after the conclusion of the contract of the necessary infrastructure between mobile and virtual operators.
No such contract has been concluded until the offer of acquiring potentials probably was not sufficiently interested for traditional operators," stated Christian Chalupa, the section for external relations of UOHS, in response to our questionary.
A such a statement by the representatives of the operators may not be surprised.
In addition to the office which must defend the interest of consumers and, above all, take care of the fact that no one approve its position on the market is more than a delicate business.
Overall, when Christian Chalupa adds: "The outside where virtual operators are commonly working, we can note that their entry in the market has contributed to the abolition of prices for mobile phone services."
However, obviously, pressure on the correct functioning of the market environment and price decrease are not apparten to UOHS interests.
Really chocolate in the whole situation is the almost emotional armour of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether it is actually only a consequence, it is alone.
Like the identity of Benzin's price for all Benzinai is the fruit of the implication and the concorrency fight.
"The section has not found anti-comprehensive behaviour signs on this fact and has therefore no reason to intervene in any way.
No operator has a dominant position, therefore he does not have any more responsibilities for its market behaviour.
The necessary instruments for opening the mobile network market for virtual operators may also be missing the telecommunications regulator," said Kalupa in his statement.
The “interpretation of the dominant position on the market is one of many disputes .
Of course, there is an analysis of the significant markets developed by μTU, as the telecommunications are on the point of view of economic competition the only market.
In an such market, of course, no Tsk operator has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer another approach - for the creation of a virtual operator, it is always necessary for the emergency of the network.
And the mobile operator has a logically account – the monopolie of his network.
Therefore, for a certain portion, it must be dominant by force.
But even though we don't accept this argument, the UOHS should be a minimum allerged that three mobile operators are such a strangely similar way.
At the same time the lamentations by the interested (including the mentioned GTS Novera company) show that during negotiations with all operators are very similar obstacles.
Download the responsibilities to μTU in the telecommunications is a quite frequent truck with which UOHS is out of all the facing.
That's what we already met in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it has not been able to promote the extension of μTU rights on the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the update of the law on recently approved telecommunications, despite the fact that many experts were expected to improve the situation.
This is the fact that the representatives of UOHS must know more than well, but perhaps their interests are different.
You can do when no one looks
While we are unless we are able to function these pseudo-virtual operators, some of which are directed in the Czech networks.
It is companies that publish their list prices of mobile phone services which are only partially public.
It is usually the companys that are engaged in multilevel marketing.
So, for example, Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a series of others offer your mobile phone services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the supplied persons.
The magic is in fact that the company with respect to the operator is as a classical company client, which orders a large quantity of SIM card SIM.
As an important client then receives special price offers (and other).
The problem is that the commercial conditions of all mobile telephone operators have a similar prevention.
"If the cases discussed, of which we will be interested, it could be a violation of the contractual conditions and could focus on the conclusion of cooperation with this company," answered Martin Kemrová question.
However, it is too unrealisable that such activity has not arrived in the ears of the liabilities of mobile telephone operators.
Overall, in cases of the 3 mentioned companies, there may be thousands of customers.
No operator is defended at the same time from such an action.
For the activities of these companies, a non-individual benefit and at the same time - in the difference of the real virtual operators - are not damaged in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav íepický comments on possible problems: "The law allows such speculations, however only a transcursible percentage of customers use services of these companies.
They should also accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered on their name, so they cannot disappear in full of it as the customs clients of mobile phone operators "
But this should be a little stranger to the WETU.
Moreover, there will be another question for UOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes before a kind of action, why can they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that UOHS has sufficiently strong rights to smooth similar activities and if it does not want to be considered to explain the operators who do not have any idea of that and that their commercial conditions will vive it.
When we don't get more costs
As the text has already been said more times, the entrance of virtual operators on the mobile telephone market has brought a significant decline of prices for services.
At the same time, in all countries where the operators were born, traditional operators tried more or less to prevent their creation.
The items that were used were practically identical - the market too small, at the too satisfying limit, problems with quality of services etc.
But in these cases, the regulators to defend not mobile phone operators, but their customers.
Being with formal measures, both with non-formal pressure, then it came to the creation of the first virtual operator and others have come to him.
Unfortunately, the Chess regulatory organs start from one of the other to the other the case as a bottled patata.
For our experience, we can't escape the sense that it doesn't clear the skills in these cases is more than I use.
But let's not throw the ring.
If the retroscene information is right and the virtual operator will really appear soon as we are, the mobile phone market will be sent to move.
If one of the operators had accompanied the creation of a virtual mobile operator only differently UOHS could remain inappropriable to the rejection (discrimination) of the other concerned.
And we may stop calling higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech innoct has four new versions.
Select the best
Listen to the four new versions of the Czech National Year.
Sunday, the first Mirek Topolánek at the occasion of the Czech recognition Day has presented in a summer way the new registrations of the national "Kde housev m月j".
The new registration of the inno was made by the orchestra of the National Teatro under the direction of Jihai B月lohlavek.
There are four versions available – absolutely with the male or female voice, core pass and the structurel emission.
The song is under the direction of Kateina Kn月ínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the Inno reviews are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the iHNed.cz site you can listen to all and four versions.
The national song of the national cheques is one of the most beautiful inners.
For the first time he said to the radio "autunchý rozhlas" which has chosen appeal to sing the variants alone, the songs with the youngest representative voices, which are expressive and popular.
"To the beginning I tried to take care of both and also the core, they have the clear word, that the text is well understandable, that they are in armony" he reported.
Then the National Year will celebrate the next year on 175^ birthday.
The song "Kde housev m月j" was played for the first time in 1834 on the Stavovskéh's pool divad it in the original “Fedlovačka of Josef Andéán Tyl” which was accompanied by the music of František ◆kroupa.
He has bought the population, and people have spontaneously done it.
The first throat of the song after the foundation of the Cecoslavaquia in 1918 then became the natural part of the “National Nation”.
It remained one of the seven national symbols after the birth of the Czech Republic.
Like the "New" inno
Mercoledday MHD of Prague will also join you for the first time with an electronic teacher
Wednesday, 1 October 2008, it will be written in the history of the Prague Transport Story as the date in which the tram, tram and buss will go out the first passengers that will have an electronic text instead of the paper.
At this time if you can try it about 100 thousand people who possess their Opencard team.
The passengers can buy that from 30 and 90 days and annual (which will be from the first January 2009) and at the same time resume their card in the Infopoint and the Compagney of Transport and the stop of the Muzeum metros, Mádrai Holešovice, Andandrel, Roztyly, Letsy, Kobylisy, Rajská Zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
The cuts can already be bought from yesterday on the Internet page of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
The service has approved more than four hundred customers before the afternoon.
The color that will start using the Internet service can fully forget the sports in the metro stop where they had to do long files for card tickets.
The table is buying via the Internet and Opencard is renewed on one of the 12 filials of the municipal Library.
"In these places, passengers have a personal sportsport that will help those interested in the acquis on the Internet and will also register their credit card." He said the card of the project Martin Opatrný.
Besides that in the libraries it will be possible to load the e-mail tickets on Opencard in bankcomat and self-service that are installed to the metro entrance.
How are these banks?
They are red, sharing the obliterators of the tickets and passengers have already noted them at the stops of the Roztyly metro Rozty, Bud月jovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"Therefore there are five in all the city, but within the end of the year they should be pregnant," concluded Opatrný.
The board will be controlled instead of ‘authentic from the bank’.
The banking service that will work for tomorrow is very easy.
Just enter the Opencard script and pre-payment of the table, it will be loaded up.
Electronic thresholds belong tomorrow not only in the capital, but also in its surroundings.
This is in the urban lines of train and bus from number 300 to 499, that the inhabitants of the Central Bohemia's municipalities take to reach the capital.
"The additional trains in the comprehensive transport of Prague are the forced readers of the card checkers with which are checking the temporary and territorial validity," explained the Philip control mode of control by the Ropid organization, which sets the hours of the collective transport in Prague.
The urban buses have readers of the cards integrated in the “Autist’s case.
During the salon, it is therefore necessary not only show the magnetic card to the autist, but in the more need to support Opencard at the specified point next to the box.
Thus, the auctor is checking the validity of loaded cuts.
"If the passenger needs to verify the validity of the loaded cuts, there is nothing easier than asking the assistant this type of information," he added Drápal.
The passengers who take urban bus cars and will not remember when the validity of the board ends, can return to the self-service banks, where the tickets are loaded on the card.
What will be shown on the validity of their documents on the device screen.
The Southern Germans wanted a referendum from the United States
The Southern Germans in 1945 asked to include the United States.
This results from the letter contained in the scientific library of the South Bohemia.
If we can't be part of Germany or Australia, we want to live at least under the United States sponsory.
In 1945, the President of the United States has been addressed to this intention.
Moreover, this results from the letter preserved in a private archive today in the Southern Science Library Library.
The Germans of ≤eský Krumlov ask in the letter to the President of the Americas not allow the refund of the "string of ãumva" – occupied by Hitler under the Monaco Agreement – the Cecoslovacchia.
"We understand the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that the American units come to the German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," it is written in the letter signed with the words "The people who have the destination of Øumva with all the heart."
Since they say, the enhancement to Cecoslovaquia – knowing the National Czech character - gives the Southern Germans hope only to the brutality, the lack of regards, the ‘intelligence’, ‘oppression and slaveism’, the authors of the letter preve the American President to accept the protected on Inverseuva now and always.
"We can't believe that without the view of a fourth million inhabitants, you will recognize this territory as a foreign state to us, which affects and rapts the ethnic minorities and has not contributed to anything, exactly for nothing, to the rescue of the Allieds," is written in the letter.
The reason why authors can't sign it is the predominant fear of the seat of the "Czech oppressors".
If the President of the United States had to doubt the conviction of the Germans, it would be based on organizing a referendum on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or live under the padronship of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem ingenous with our knowledge of the history of the next war, some witnesses describe in a appropriate way the expectations of the Southern Germans.
Even though the Czech Germans had to bear at least that their reference would be treated from the republic, only a few of them would be accepted as a like.
Some expected that the United States and Britain were negotiating a kind of autonomy for the South Peoples.
Others believed that they would just stay in Cecoslovaquia.
This also confirms the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born to ◆eské Bud月jovice.
He was motived during the war as German Bud月jovice in the sea power of the Baltic Sea.
When at the end of the war was caught from the British and put in the prison field in Holšthow, the tens of other German Germans were going to find him in order to taught him.
"They believed that once you returned home, the cup would use him," said Kalupe.
No one of the German prisoners who lived in Cecoslovaquia pillar of the war, according to the fact that on the basis of Beneš declines would be moved from the Republic.
You don't think - you're gonna get it!
The emotional campaign will attack authors
The most costful action in the Czech history addressed to road safety.
This could also be defined by the emotional media campaign, which the Minister of Transport intends to get out of Wednesday.
The office of the Minister Aleš íebíček is expected that the leaders are expected that they have a dangerous behaviour on the flight.
The campaign of 150 million will appear in television, radio, movie, internet but also on volcanoes.
The authors should run from the fast and under the effect of the alcohol to the flight.
And remember him too to put the census before you go out.
You want to touch in awareness, especially youth, motorcyclists, pedones and not last professional leaders.
What'll look at the spots?
Overall, people's stories that will affect emotions.
And this also testifys the "sanguino" of the whole campaign:
You don't think - you're gonna get it!
The word "n't think" is written as a magic on the targa.
And in a kit of blood, there's the word "gain."
This must symbolize that a person can at a moment of disorder to pay with his own life.
The spots will "spaven" showers until 2010.
The Minister has been inspired by similar campaigns in the English countries, where images of the victims of accidents are commonly viewed.
It is so promised to abolish the number of incidents and dead on the Czech streets.
The spots were prepared by the Euro RSCG Agency.
Cart and base to guiders
" With the authors, the carota and bastone system works.
The card for them is, for example, when they pass with the red and so refreshing time.
The bastone is the risk of a lot or accident.
I need to remember the risk to leaders, "he says the psychologist of the Minister of Transport Martin Koćán of the Na Homolce hospital.
And therefore they want us of information campaigns in printing and mostly negative publicities, they believe the psychologist.
According to him, the pillars that demonstrate the risk authors are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel has been installed, it will probably soon be confounded with the environment, and the leaders will not give him any attention," warning Ko'án.
Olmert retained almost all the territories occupied in the change of peace.
Ehud Olmert, the first of the Israeli provisional government, expressed for the refund of practically all the territories occupied in 1967, which also the borders of Jordan, east Jerusalem and the heights of Golan, in change of peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
Thus he said in the dialogue that he published on Monday, the Jediot Achronot daily.
"We must come to an agreement with Palestinians, that means that it will be necessary to restore almost all areas (employed) if not exactly all," said Olmert to the daily.
"Their earth is a certain percentage of these territories, but the Palestinians will have to leave the same percentage (the Israeli zones), because there will not be peace, " he added.
He admitted that the eventual refund will also include Jerusalem is .
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem, and especially doesn't want the russ or swimming stages, as it has happened to one of my best friends, you'll have to relax at one side of Jerusalem," Olmert noted in the attraction to the two attaques of Juli in the city, during which some people have been killed and tens of slaughter people.
According to the first, it will be necessary to find "the special solution for the mountain of the temple, the holy and historical places," which are within the Old City. .
"Whoever wants to keep the Israeli sovereignty over the whole city shall include 270,000 Arabians.
This will not work," he also emphasized.
The race from Golan's height
Olmert has also been announced for Israel's removal from the heights of Golan, which is according to him, the impairable condition to conclude this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require a certain effort from Damascus.
"I don't propose the conclusion of peace with Syria only on the basis of golan residues," said he.
"The Syrians know what they need to refuse to get Golan's height.
They should reiterate the current report with the Iran; they must reiterate their report with the Hezbollah (moving of the Sciiti) ; they must reiterate the permanent support, which offered the Hamas terrorism (moving of the Skiites) from Al-Qaida (Terrorism Network) and Jihad (the Holy War) in Iraq," expressed the first.
Question after the incident: Are they illegal stewards in the bus?
The law does not recognize them, it cannot be walked on ‘ cars that takes long distance
In the context of the tragic incident near the Italian city of Padova of the Empman of the Student Agency Society has come out the question if stewards and passengers could move to the boat of the bus during the course.
"If we want to respect the laws severely and formally, the Steward activity is in conflict with the law of road movement," said the carrier of the Minister of Transport Karel Hanzelka.
The accident of the past week, with which life lost an hostess of 22 years, was caused by a truck that drew the street to the pullman.
The girl was unfortunately sitting at that moment at the “autist on the less secure place of the pullman, even though there were other two places.
But the bus can make an accident or blow briskly also at the time of distribution of caffe or daily.
Whether the bus is added or less than places on foot according to the movement book.
If passengers do not have to sit down.
Student Agency's cars have not fetched places, confirmed it at the update website.cz the Director of the Radim Jančura.
"We have evaluated this with the Minister and at the beginning he did not allow passenger movement on the bus.
After it was revoked and we agreed that passengers could use bathroom during the course if they have the place set up," he expressed its view point.
The law does not recognize the steward.
"There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of Steward – no law is involved in regulating this role."
However, there is no regulation prohibited by the transporter to carry out services.
The law of the road movement only recognizes the terms of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," adds less clearly to the Hanzelka portfolio.
Instead, the Director of the Road Movement Department of the Minister of Transport Josef Pokorný believes that the law is sufficiently worried about this problem.
Whether the bus has places on foot.
It's all about it," he says.
Categorizing the bus in the city where there are places on foot and the maximum limited speed, interrupted with feet with higher and higher speed, acting without feet with the maximum allowed speed and seats of safety ceiling.
Like in the air, the expert says.
The BESIP expert on Road Safety Jaroslav Hoćín does not find the fund problem in movement of stewards on the boat of the bus.
"In the course of a quiet core there are no many dangers, the situation can compare to air services.
Even there is safe when a turbulence comes, and the flight assistant can shoot his head."
"If the bus makes a crazy breathtake, obviously values the laws of the physical.
Likewise, like in the city bumman or on the tram.
The transporter must solve the security of stewards with an internal regulation, and also intends that the problem is not solved from the point of view of the law.
Jančura is ready to stop services.
Student Agency is the only direct transport that offers steward services.
This does not use about two hundreds.
Even after the accident, the director considers their dangerous wages.
"I will not have the feeling of considering Steward's profession as dangerous work, but I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and daily while they go out.
They would also diminish the expenditures," he says.
The director of Asian Alexej Litvin, which manages a line group in respect of Student Agenty, has motivated the “acknowledge of stewards on its means as an interest towards security.
"We have no hosts, we're already opposed to the beginning.
Before or then it will end with a mortal accident," he said less than one year fá Týden.cz.
It is a great tragedy.
In the incidence of the line for Napoli, a young hostess of the Plze, who worked for the company two years.
A Sloven's probably run out of the emergency course without using the arrow and locked the flood to the pullman road.
The leader of the zappman tried to avoid it with a brush hand, but he urged it with the front right.
Jančura refused the fact that the two places reserved at the rest of the stewarts were occupied.
"It's not possible to reserve these places in a long-term treatment, they're inaccessible."
The term is in mind to declare the “authentic of the train.
The Agency will not wait for the Court's sentence to pay the damage to the girl's family, but it is expected a financial compensation by the fault.
The revision of the law?
Not in view
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport for more than one year work, could provide the movement of stewarts on the boat of bus.
"They have not reached any concrete results.
They do not consider so the pullmans, more than the pointing system, the maximum speed on ‘autostrate and use of the cell during the guide’, says the expert Hocchione.
"The Minister of Transport does not consider the activity of stesperans as a great threat to the security of passengers," concluded the Havelka portfolio, that the security control of the bus security is the competence of the police and security officers.
Düsseldorf's hopes on Francoforte
There are no talks in the letter of the WestLB Director addressed to the home partners.
In the publication letter on Monday that could be "the center of the capital market of the financial group of cases" through the meeting of the Düsseldorf bank Institute with the Deka-Bank of Francoforte.
The West LB would start an "comprehensive block" with sustainable benefits in such a business.
Furthermore, such a unit could be a decisive spina for further links in the bank sector.
So it is read when a administrative advice in difficult times showing action capacity.
Because WestLB Affect is still under strong pressure.
Not only by the Commission of the EU, but also through the National Forum for Financial Monitoring Service, notifying time ago to the regional government of Renania Settentrional - Vestfalia that the time is in line with the search for a future solution.
From the links between Deka-Bank, that the same clients of the Reserve Casses are already known because of their investment funds, and WestLB is surely talking about a little bit, even by Francoforte.
At the end of August, Head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas reported on the presentation of the first half of the year that a fusion of the house on the way Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB has no sense.
Nevertheless, the Deca's Board's administration advice, which is carried out from regional banks and the consortions of the rescue cases, delegated the Board of Administration to bring together together with West LB on common contracts.
It could be the market negotiations or parts of them.
However, discussions have, as they say in business pioneer, just started.
Della Deka-Bank, with its 3000 fellow workers, is one of those containing more in the area of business in Francoforte, not the first time it is to consolidate the sector of the rescue cases.
In 2003, it appeared that Deka-Bank could be founded with the regional bank of Rhine-Palatinato and Helaba.
This association with three was nothing done.
The projects were published, the regional bank of Asia was contrary to the participation of Helaba.
The remaining two institutions have also been unable to reach an agreement.
The Regional Bank of Renania-Palatinato went to the Baden-Württemberg regional bank in Stoccarda.
Yet we always thought about a Deka-Bank fusion with regional banks.
Nevertheless at the end of the Günther Merl, President of the Helaba Governance Council, expressed him against projecting games to meet you with his house.
It seems that you believe the knowledge, that it is necessary to reach the various homes in the public sector.
Since the election of the Bavarian Parliament has been passed, the pressure may be checked with the Bavarian countrysbank with the Baden-Württemberg.
For Helaba, it is not all a good news.
If it increased pressure for other fusions, hand hands will mixe partners.
In the South now it would be the Juner partner, even though now it has overcome the financial crisis much better than houses in Monaco and Stoccarda.
The association of the Assia-Turnia Reserve Cass, who participates in the 85 percent of Helaba, made the chain at the meeting with WestLB.
It would only be NorthLB
These geo-strategie reasons are only one account.
On the other hand, there is a question as the various business models of the individual cases are combined.
In June Merl noted that the decision-making question, with which the future of regional banks would be guaranteed, would not yet be given a response by the association of German relief cases.
At the end, the West LB division could also come out, which, of course, is not desired.
So the letter of the Board of Administration expresses the desire to aspire in any case to a "General resolution".
It will be seen how the reunification of the individual parties will function with the Deka-Bank.
IL Second week of the birth festival is dedicated to Italians
For Elena is the first time for Luca is the third or the fourth.
This time Elena is present to the feast as a companion, and so says that everything is different.
After them at the 5l. bar of the Kaiser Mark stands a barbut mask and shows about 200 travellers which are the deep tonnes that can produce from the hair.
Elena before Luca's pocket and after a bathroom.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here at the parking of the bus next to the Porta New station, they take up this evening at 23.45 four flights with destination Monaco, Festa del Birra" , which is at 6:30.
Three roads are mainly reserved to the Italians, in one other only Brazilians.
In a parking area, South Americans are crying with the bandage in hand, already celebrated during the night.
It's so romantic, says Marco, that's not something for the Italians.
Mark that brings a long captap with false skin sheets and a pair of eyes with silver skills belong to the bus.
Since five years they go to Ottoberfest, this year is 3 tours.
The night end, day at the feast, returns at 22:30.
Maybe it would think only inutil expenditures, says Marco.
The cost of 45 euro includes the journey, the welcome of the brindisy with the bourgeo Kaiser, made in accordance with the Bavarian reality standards, the cash disease and the German guide – Marco has frequented a German course in Francofort.
And so at night the bus go to the Brenner.
There's still no drink.
To colps the silence falls in the bus, the travelers are sleeping.
Better so, they'll still need their forces.
They stop in Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other Italian bus on the carrier A9 before Monaco are a short stop.
When, as provided, the Marco group reaches 6,30 to the parking near the Ethiois, there are already about 50 bus from all Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco explains for the last time the attack program.
First: put the yellow chamber.
On it to the left, "Oktberfest" is written about the Internet address of the Marco travel office: "Concersiveando.it".
Second: "When the doors of the bevery teacher opens, it means run!", Marco on the first morning.
"Corre!" Shift and busy the places on the back of the tent.
"No before, let's lock, and not all the yellow drinks sitting on the same boards, divided in the attractive space!"
The lip costs 8,25 euros, urge Marco.
And don't forget to lay down.
"Show the security service, we're doing well!
But let the places lay down, and they will be cut off."
Third: "With even at 22.30 points we'll meet us again here!
Yeah, it's gone for the feast.
On the road, one attacks as follows the yellow drinks to the trees, the road cards and even an advertising card of a large Bavarian pool game.
You want to be ready to fight the recitation.
It's the second week of the feast, known as "the week of the Italians".
The data are not available, it is about 50 million, which go to cross the Alpis and invade tensions, that 10% of the visitors will be subject to Italy.
Monaco's police is strengthened with 7 Italian officials of the High Aid, the Italian volunteers support the Bavarian red crown, which makes statistics on nationalities, where Italians are on the first place with 200 medical healths before English (only 60 medical cures) and Austrians (cf. 80).
Overall loved by Italians is the thendone of the Hofbräuäuhaus.
1. Insoon notes for creditors of Hypo Real Estate
The German banking system is relatively stability, confirmed the Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück last week.
It is good that the political has used the word "relative" and has also agreed, that the German bank sector has not been avoided by critical developments.
Because the crisis started the end of the week.
The Immobiliary Financing Director Hypo Real Estate, noted in the DAX, receives a thousands of German banks consortio in order to protect themselves from the turbulents on the market.
An expert person of the situation said to Reuters on Monday, the support credits would be reached up to 35 billion euros.
The Hypo Real Estate must only pay interests for the requested side.
The money comes from the private banks and the public.
The loss of Depfa business are on the basis.
The State funder in accordance with a daily article has been refined in a short term – which is not more possible because of the challenges on the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank reserves were decreased from 95 per cent to 2.37 million euros, including the quota of the own capital was decreased from 1.6 to 1.45.
The proper income and financial benefits had falled at 0 compared to the past year, the uses of increased demands and certain actions as the liquidation of credit allocations were lower than 70% of EUR 5 mln.
Only by higher income income from the refund of subordinated compensation costs which are both from the restructuring of the former Depfa Group and the reimbursement of interests according to the unique text of the tax laws and the management of business for undertakings, the negative benefit was sufficiently moderated by about 16%.
The former public financier after privatization in 1990 was lost in the speculation with commercial real estate credits, which were transferred to the Air Bank.
Since the income in the statistical financing was too low, the Depfa has begun more in infrastructure projects and in the financing of common projects of private and state investors ( PPP) and has been diversified internationally.
The Hypo Real Estate now must immortalize the value of the alphabet, which will have an essential effect on the benefits and loss of the group.
The fact is that the divisions have been deleted.
In 2007, 2/3 were reduced.
The Hypo Real Estate after Depfa is an important funder of the State and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on the refinancement of the market between banks in comparison with other institutions, because it does not have a trust of customers.
Because of the US Investment Bank, Lehman Brothers has two weeks ago the grant of credit grants between banks is largely disappeared because banks recognize liquidity.
The Hypo Real Estate yearly needs for a part of the Depfa credit card – approximately 50 mld. – shortly the means of refinance.
According to the notice of Hypo Real State, the financial need for the group was covered by the credit for a certain period and the company protected by the influence of the international monetary markets for the most unemployed.
Other sources feel, thanks to the money refinance is guaranteed until the end of 2009.
The Chairman of HRE Georg Funke, on the contrary, said that the HRE Group will not need shortly the monetary markets.
The Federal Bank and the National Entity for Financial Monitoring Service (BaFin) are based on the fact that HRE Group is still secured.
This is hopeful for bank creditors and creditors.
In view of the dynamic and incompatibility of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
The funding may not be fully used.
But the contrary is not to exclude.
After Sunday evening the bank as she learned it was to miss, the current saving couldn't calm the souls.
The 75 per cent of the euro's 75 per cent on 3,30 per cent.
They're pretty good about the cores of each other.
While the previous level debts are almost innovative, the cors of the postergate credits are cut off.
Colpists are mostly the mutual partners of the Württemberg-Hypo-Hypo's decline over 2009.
Earlier Della HRE seemed to be an alternative speculative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the bank crisis and the institution, which, by the resuming of the Depfa, be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the central, governments and less damaged banks are still ready, it can be counted on a deterioration of annualities within the term.
Or anybody hopes that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But concerning the detailed information due to parliamental statistics, the probability almost certain has become a fair hope.
It will, above all, believe the investors at a long-term time notes with the decision if they are divided from their commitments.
The short-term investors may conclude the losses for future payments of the compensatory rate on more values.
Sylvana and the Bento-Box secrets
When Sylvana Hiltrop, 16 years old, the first day of school should be presented to Taiwana Highschool, girls start to hurry: German is totally "kawaii"!
What do you mean?
Sylvana already knows the word from Mangas-nel new exchange logs in Japan.
The first day of school in Japan
Like they were emotioned.
I also had a feet to go to school.
Tokyo's margins to Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes with train to get to Highschool.
I had to find her alone, and I wasn't lost.
The beginning of the first time of lessons, it seems not to be fixed as well as us in Bassa Sassonia.
The schools come out of 8 and then, until 8,40 starts a short colleague with professor, the so-called "Home room".
But before he started the lection, he touched me to present me.
I'm not about the kind who speaks volunteers before people, in addition to a class of 40 schools
Since I had no school uniform, I was laid a old mom's hospiting, together with a blue clothes and black kitchen.
This is how I was seen in front of the cattedrah and I tried to proclaim goodly: "Sayonara Wo She Sylvana..."-- I'm called Sylvana, I'm coming from Germany and a feast between a week.
At that time, I was very glad that I had already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls of the class have bottled, renewed and made signs and then heard the word "Kawaiii".
I already knew her from my Mangas.
Applies to the essential lessic of Japanese girls to survive and means "cain, sweet".
And then I'm moving fast to my place.
The girl near me smoke, for her was a honour to sit down at a exchange unit.
The rest of the lection hour was quietly, but when he played the gong, I was assigned in the real sense of the word.
Everything talked to disordinately and renewed and followed me with questions, then it's really difficult to understand the Japanese English.
All have opened their Bento in the Pause.
My breathing mother also made me the Panerin for the Lunch- is different from the German pants.
I had shot with species, salsicines, insalate of cetrial and woods, fruit and kind of infringines with flesh and tofu..
I don't even know what I eat exactly in Japan.
Things seem strange and have a completely new smoke.
That's, that's really good.
Perhaps out of the cups mixed under the sale, brrr!
The Bento are not only the dinner in Japanese schools.
It happens sometimes that a girl gives a Blessed by himself, prepared sufficiently artistically, with hope then to make the boy's knowledge during the recovery.
I read it in my fuckets, Manga.
I'm very surprised if you can find it.
"Why exactly the Japanese?" They asked my friends when I told, that I'd be going for a year to school in Japan.
I always said,
"Why I'm angry."
Finally, I'm playing the Mangas for years.
And to better understand smoke and culture containing, first or then I started learning a little Japanese language.
I was completely convinced to come once.
I'm also driving tradition, use and costumes.
There's a lot here.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and last trends - from the opposite part: severe, discipline and traditional.
Since all is well organized, I never heard lost, even though Tokyo is the largest city I never saw in my life."
1. Rates also have feelings
A rat or a disappearing flights when they feel dangerous.
Neurologian scientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced: even many animals have feelings.
4. But how could it be checked if, when they walk in our same way, have our same feelings?
On the "Edge" newspaper for some years are published articles of scientists.
6. SPIEGEL IN a series of replys selected to the question: "What do you think that it is true, without able to try it?"
I think the animals have feelings or other conscience states, without me or someone else have been able to try it, because we can't even try that other people have a conscience.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
9. We are referring to other species and asking awareness or generally about conscience, we enter into a impratic territory, because the reference base is not combined.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things that do other animals. This ends to be dead, escape or attack.
People are in a similar way, since some scientists understand that there is a paragonable feeling.
I don't believe that.
Two aspects of the brain structure makes us difficult to transmit our feeling to the animals.
On one side, the side front court is often linked with human consciousness, the associated circuits (as for its direct comparison to the short memory and the executive and control functions).
In the man, this wide area is much more developed than in other principles and it seems that among other creatures it is completely missing.
For at least in those aspects of our consciousness depending on the pre-frontal court, including knowledge, who are, and the ability to plan and decide, the foundation of the presumption that man is different even from the other princes.
Another dramatic speciality should be presented in the way of speaking about man: because a major part of life is linked to the language, often it is said that it is linked to conscience.
In this case, the animals could be excluded.
Although the consciousness does not depend on the language, it would affect it so that the knowledge of the animal, as it was done, is certainly different from the circumstances of our conscience.
This is why it is difficult to discover how conscience can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjected thing, in analyzing it through its experience because of the special hardware, their research will make us great problems.
Most of the interpretations refer to the content of awareness experience, but there is another aspect of the conscience to which science would be easier to have access.
It could be analyzed the processes of the conscience of animals without their contents, and in the short-term memory of the principles, in particular the example of the exhibition.
So for this principle, that Christf Koch and Francis Crick follow, they've gone first to the neural conscious relations that caused mechanisms: both may be identical but not necessarily.
In an interesting way, this principle also demonstrates the value of the pre-frontal shorting for the implementation of the view.
What do you mean for feelings?
I impede to the fact that an emotional system as the fear is active in one of its conscious brain activities.
What we indicate as "paura" is therefore the mental state in which we find when the activity of the system of defence placed in the brain (or of its consequences, such as the reactions of the body) takes the memory of work.
Thus, feelings are closely connected to the regions of the cortex, which characterize the primates and in particular the human being.
With the parliamentary nature, we are creating sustainable flowers of feeling, because we can be able to distinguish and catagorize the situations, to describe it to the others.
As regards this Antonio Damascus, for example, believes that the feelings result from the primary activities of the body’s sensations of the body and the cephale paleo, likely to Jack Pankseep, which has however been concentrated more on the paleoofal.
Because this network during human evolution has not been very changed, this could absolutely become part of the feelings outside the species.
At purely theory level I can't do it, but I think it is incredible.
Pankseep brings arguments on the fact that what for rates and humans seems to be as fear, probably you're aware so with the senses in both cases: but how can you be checked if the races and human beings prove the same thing when they are acting in a similar way?
A disappearing in case of danger escapes as though he felt fear?
At my eyes, the simple behaviour sovereignty can not demonstrate any life-life suspicion.
And so the neural confront continues to be helped: races and humans have similar paleoences, the disappearings even a brain.
But the paleoencefalo is responsible for feelings?
And when you could show it for human beings, how would it be like to show it on the races?
I think the rates and other mammiferies may be addicting the insects (which knows?), they have feelings.
But I didn't know how to show him.
And because their feelings are fundamentally different from our (of the time that human conscience is based on specific circuits and languages), I prefer to study the emotional behaviour rather than the emotional senses of rates.
In any case, there are progress at neural level, in contrast to the same procedure on rates and men.
As I don't search tongue and conscience in rates, so I don't do it on their emotions, I don't know even if I'm there.
This may be my mind, but I prefer to make steps forward, rather than to continue to fight against a wall.
I'm for a practical emotional appeal.
The President of the UEFA Platin: re-environment for Poland and Ukraine
The first vice Iwan Wasjunik said that the preparatory will be shortly placed under the direct responsibility of the President and of the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the Uefa decision to Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europe with Poland," said Wasjunik
"But this is not an ambulance for our country.
The work is just started and there's still much to do in both countries"
Both home padrones are split into the building barrier for or reconstruction of stages, streets, hotels and airports.
The number of stages to grant Europe will eventually be reduced by eight to six.
"We can't lose another time.
We must now work with the maximum speed," said the President of the Ukrainian Gregorij Surkis Association.
"The UEFA will make us eye constantly."
A more radical step was made in Poland.
Following many scandals, the direction of the Polynish PZPN association was underprised by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent manager Robert Zawlocki.
The Commission joined the request of the Minister of Sport Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
The PZPN would continue to be "the serious danger that the PZPN is not able to operate in accordance with the rules," said Drzewiecki to the PAP Polar Information Agency.
"In a letter we assured the President of the UEFA Michel Platin that the preparation to EM 2012 will not suffer it."

Dennis Quaid shot is unresolved
He wanted to promote a new movie, in interview, he talked about the private and now he grew with the ex: the star of Hollywood Meg Ryan declared his former Dennis Quaid.
He's shot of rabbits and riddles.
The Roses war for the former Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid female couple: seven years after their separation the two actors of Hollywood are now discussing the other with a bad litiage in the public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the U.S. American magazine last week for the first time she expressed on the reasons of marriage failure: "Dennis has been infedeled, and that was very painful."
The portion of traditions you would come to know it only after separation.
The opportunity for the "spoglier of the soul" was the work with the print of Ryan for his new "The Women" film – tells the history of an adultery.
The reaction of Dennis Quaid to her to be publicly declared adult husband was clearly deployed: it would be "audited," said the 50th quarter to "New York Daily News", that "Meg for the most recent time repeats and renews the history of our report".
It would also be "reployable" that to Jack, the son of the seat that they had together, again "see they were publicly remembered pain and sovereignty, which means a separation for each child."
While the Ryan lives from the separation by himself, Quaid is again married and shortly becomes genels father.
And therefore his judges are closed with the arrow: "My life in any case will go forward.
I think I'm lucky to have a wonderful family to which everything goes for the best."
Care prices for air bikes and trees
In the first half of 2008, flights and breakfasts in Europe were more economic than the previous year.
In Germany, the flights would be addictive to 50% more economics.
Flights and breakfasts in the hotel are become more convenient - this is the result of a study of the financial provider and American Express.
The company analyzed its data of the first half of 2008 bookings and after an increase in prices in the first quarter, he noted a clear warm in the second quarter.
After the prices on the hotel market have been increased for years, accommodations in many places have already been calculated for prices.
From January to March the prices in 41 of the 48 European cities still under review in average about 6.9 compared to 2007
However, from April to June, prices were already 3,6% lower than the previous year.
The most apparent trend would be in Paris and Rome, where the travelers had to pay 30 to 37% in less than one year before.
American Express sees as a reason for this the weak quota of the dollar, which would lead to a "Calant wants to travel from American tourists"
Financing centres such as Francoforte and London would be touched by the arrival of the prices of the hotels in a stronger way of industrial centres such as Hannover, Colonia or Stavanger
In the northern city, the prices of hotels with an increase in 26.3% are directed in Europe
Even in terms of flight prices the trend in the first quarter is still on:
The Economy Class’s passengers had to be paid in average 7,1% compared to 2007, would be added to 29.2% more card flights.
Since April to June, the prices of the Economy air tickets have been calculated in average of 12.5% in comparison with the previous quarter, in the first class and in the Business, the price changes have been greater.
In Germany prices are more strong than in other European countries:
The prices were of 11.9% in January to March, in the second quarter were 23.6 %.
With regard to the internal German flights according to the study, prices have been designed.
The price crowd motivation would be on one side the economic growth in low, explaining the company.
The request in many segments of the airway market has been discovered.
On the other hand, it would be through the open heavens agreement, which liberate air traffic between Uses and Europe, an increased pressure of competition.
The critical situation would be the suppression of non-inventions to Airlines, as well as the high number of airline companies and in the first half of 2008 would have declared a failure – only in Europe it was treated by 24 airlines.
HSV fights Gladbach for 1 to 0
With a simple goal and methods, the Amburg SV becomes headquarters.
Bosnia Luhukay is still not able to find a group of 11 working.
Here Christffer Klein worse the ground of luck for the national Marko Marin player.
The Gladbach player entered first late and failed with a track on the street
His message was formulated with accuracy, and passed on the lips in a convincing manner.
He knew that he had absolutely reason.
"We need the second goal," he called Hermann Rieger in the corridor of Amburg's neighborhood.
It wasn't a huge success in the catalogues, the game Pause was finished, and most of them sat again in his place.
Rieger was almost 3 decades of HSV physics, enjoying a more larger estimate of certain old players.
And so his curtain also found listening in the high spheres.

His order must have sounded like: Here is the second goal!
The change of position has not occurred.
"Today there's not all good to see," he allowed Marcell Jansen later.
Also Bastian Reinhardt would have "related more".
For the 1 to zero, those of Amburg have to thank the head knee that was going to sign Mchar Petric (11) and the fact that many players hadn't been able to hurt with Amburg's weaknesses.
"It was a sporca victory," called Martin Jol.
The Amburg SV will be held on Monday 121 years.
The spectators have already celebrated before, on the afternoon of the Sabbath day, if themselves, the sky spring on the area and the class of lighting on the video screen, which reads their sports society as before the class.
It'll be a complete year without true feast.
"We're able to put everything right," said Marcell Jansen.
It has the presentation, that the provisional certificate for the table is more indicative of the incredibleness of the sample than of the domination of its HSV.
The team with its new arrivals later – Neves and Silva Neves, the defender of the Petric door as Jansen suffered to the FC Bayern – it found slowly himself, but it has not yet been able to light.
"We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling," relation with force Jol.

The dark material affects space sond flight
Since years a mystery phenomenon creates perpless between scientists: the dark material affects the speed of space songs during the so-called Swing-by manual.
The experts say that the general theory of Albert Einsteins’ relations could not be all exact.
The Ulysses spacial sond flighted through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the fuel tubations that are hurry now on her death for congelation.
A mystery phenomenon creating skills for years – theanomalia of the Swing-by
Swing-by is a flood flight of space sonds, with which they get added silence/spinta/coscillation in the gravitative field of a heavenly body, for example of the Earth.
So the songs can rescue very fuel.
The euro-American search sonde Cassini-Huygens has used this physical medicine as well as the sun sond Ulysses.
What the students are surprised for years: races do not belong to all as we would look at the gravity law.
There are also irregolarity in the speed.
The songs become faster or slower.
Until the physics couldn't explain this effect.
On the year, the Swing-by's Namili was overwhelmed.
Some experts fear that the general theory of Albert Einstein’s relations, which describes the material attraction force with a curvation of space, may not be all exact.
The American Stephen Adler of the Institute For Advanced Study of Princeton believes firmly as before Einstein was not wrong, and try to explain the Swing-by nomal of the Swing-by through the likely dark material that the astronoms mentioned in the cosm.
"Anomily responsibilizable may be the dark material that might also be very close to the Earth," writes.
The existence of the dark material studies in the space are only known for about 10 years.
From her apparently there is an attraction force, whose effect is on the other heavenly bodys.
Instead, it's all invisible, that's not sending or reflecting any sort electromagnetic radiation, particularly applies any visible light.
According to the calculations of scientists, it is at least a good fifth of the entire cosm mass.
The tourists who are taken in Egypt are free.
After 10 days in the hand of their followers, the tourists taken in Egypt would be again free, as the minister of Italian foreigners confirmed.
The slaughters from the Sudan asked several million euros of rescue.
In a spectrum before release 6 seminars have been killed.
In the south of Egypt, five Germans were taken.
The rescue treaties are already running.
The Germans are always in the middle of the seminars.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
The European tourists in Sahara are certainly free.
This refers to the Egyptian TV, Al-Arabia's emitted car and the Italian media.
The Minister of Foreigns Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the chronic of the Italian TV emitted Sky TG 24: "Our concittads and other hosts have been released
We are considering their health status," said Frattini.
The five Germans, 5 Italians and a rum, as well as their eight Egyptian fellowships would be well healthful and secure, has reported the Egyptian TV.
The 19 components of a shipment in the wilderness have already been found in Cairo travel.
There are still little clear the backscores of a campaign which has come before the release of the hosts, so the railers after the indications of a Egyptian public security agent would have been prepared for the conclusion of the disappearance before the Swedish army had killed as surprised 6 of them.

The German Ambassador to Cairo refused a position for the report .
The abuses of the patriarch "ported to the suicide"
Years of abuses by the patriarch have brought a woman to kill himself, he declared a court.
Michael Trerise, 57 years old, from Stethians, Cornovaglioa, was in prison for six years after admitting eight cases of sexual aggression.
The Court of Truro Crown Court recognized that he regularly mounted his daughter Stephanie Randle, when she had between the five and the seven years.
Trerise wrote in a note of confession: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle was killed in Mutley, Plymouth, April 1st, 2007, at the age of 34.
When he was a girl and lived in Coventry, Trerise mounted and blessed her before he had sex, while her mother was out to work in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in Otton years, and returned to live in Cornovaglia.
Her daughter came to Plymouth.
But the short recognized that Mrs. Randle, who had expensed a long time as a voluntary to the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses that had caused her.
In 2006, the Public Minister Ramsey Quaife said to the court that the friends of Mrs Randle, who was a beautiful superfist and civilist, was "emotionally dead," and that had "laid with life."
In April 2007 his true father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in his apartment in Plymouth.
You think it was killed with a plastic bottle.
Mr. Randle strengthened the patriarch of her daughter, which wrote a letter of confession that ended: "I bonded and blessed her."
"I didn't molest it sexually.
I feel responsible for his death."
The Judge Christpher Elwen said to Trerise, "You're a extremely strange feticist, and for his victim must be terrible, especially when he was only seven years.
"This wonderful saga ends with the victim who takes life.
Another harder is the fact that if he had not done it, it would have been difficult that the facts would have ended before the court."
It notes the effects that the father and the mother of Stephanie described have had their daughter in these years.
"And it was clearly likely that she was a promised and happy young success."
The official that has lost the data will be punished.
The official of the Cabinet Office, which left the top Secret Documents on a train in June, must be accused by the Office of Secrets Act, has learned BBC.
The man was translated by the Ministry of Defence when he left on the train for Waterloo two highly classified documents.
The documents came to BBC before they were delivered to the police.
It is less delicate of the accused under this law and there is nothing to suggest a criminal attempt.
The correspondant of the BBC Frank Gardner's defense said that the movement would come as a surprise to many of the administration.
"They were thinking that this was being treated inside Mod and the Gabinet Office," said .
The interested, which can't be appointed, is to be accused under section 8.1 of the Act, the clausule concerning the safeguard of the information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the office should be accused by the metropolitan police because of the highly sensitive nature of its work.
The loss documents contained evaluations on Al-Qaeda and the capacity of Iraq security forces.
He was informed about Monday's decision and was taken away from his house and brought into a hidden place.
Building society addresses the account of B–B
The English construction companies could address a account of more than 80,000 EUR after the rescue of the Bradford & Bingley bank.
The Govern has given 14 billion sterlines to protect the positions of Bradford & Bingley rescueers.
The interest on that payment will be paid by all companies that take the money of the consumers, including 59 construction companies.
The Director-General of Building Society Association (BSA) Adrian Coles said it is "irritory" that companies and their members must pay.
The payment of 14 billion sterline sterlines will eventually be refunded when the friends of Bradford & Bingley will be redeemed.
However, the interest that will fall in time will be paid every year to 700 financial companies who are deprived, but the interest that will fall in time will be added every year to 700 financial companies accepting depositions.
The financial Services Competence Scheme confirmed the BBC that 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It's irritant that those institutions who have been conducted in a sense manner are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions who have been very less smart.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay for a percentage to the debtors he had, and that the companies among them had to pay for 18 per cent of the cost.
The Tesor is estimated that the loan interest will amount to 450 million sterlines in 2009.
This means that companies will need to find 81 million sterlines to pay for the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, Director-General of the Construction Society Association, said BBC that it is wrong.
"It is a noise that those institutions who have been conducted in a reasonable way in the market in the reservoir of houses are now called to pay part of the account of those institutions who have been very less prudent."
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation started in 1945.
"We must consider all the aspects in the next weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what might be a significant account," said Mr Cole.
The interest was in 2009 covering seven months from the end of September of this year at the end of March.
In 2010, the interest of a whole year will be needed, and this might be almost two times higher.
Since construction companys are unaccepted organizations, their members shall end to pay the account through higher rates or lower interest rates on the costs of refund.
The milk goes out of 5 penny to the litro

Notice to the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh
A court of Bangladesh rejected a request for the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which means that you might be arrested when you return to the country.
His lawyers said that the court refused to grant it a caution for 50 million tax (729.700 dollars) to a businessman when he was a member of the parliament.
The case is one of the many crimes of corruption.
The political rivale for a long time by Sheikh Hasina, Khaleda Zia, was released at the beginning of the month.
The return to Bangladesh of Sheikh Hasina is planned for the next weeks but his party Awami League, Awami League, asked the temporary Government of the country supported by military diagrams before the total freedom.
The corresponding persons say that while you went to the outside for medicines on the word, it is not clear according to the terms of its release, if you can stay in liberty when you return to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say that it will be called to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
"The high core has rejected the request for retention for Sheikh Hasina by bringing that you can't have the precaution seeing that it is already outside the word for medical care," said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will submit a call against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs a caution to return to the country from the foreign to prepare the elections of December.
You are expected to return home from Sheikh Hasina after October 17, he said a senior leader of the game Awami League.
She was detained last year after the military government had taken the power, but was released in June to go to the foreign to receive medical care.
Sia Sheikh Hasina that Khaleda Zia refuses all the accuses against their own.
Paired for Afghan Anti-Poly campaign
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are lacking the recent immunization campaign because of related violence with Talibans, the United Nations says.
The United Nations has now brought a vaccination programme in six provinces last week.
But it is said that children cannot reach the parties of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for security reasons.
A United Nations portfolio said that this happens, despite the promises of Talibans that would not be attacked or obliged to thousands of staff that were carrying vaccination.
BSkyB lost legal battle with ITV
BSkyB has lost its legal battle with the Commission's decision of the Competition to obligate the company to reduce its participation in the ITV revaluation station.
A BSkyB was said by the Court of Appeal to cut its actions in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the Commission said that BSkyB's participation was obliging the competition and allowed an injust impact on ITV.
BSkyB bought the participation in an agreement that actually blocked NTL, now called Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading reported that the BSkyB participation purchase at the ITV seminar was deeply concerned about the independence of ITV, so that the Commission had undertaken an investigation.
Head of Virgin, Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom Regular, opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that it was forbidden to reduce its ITV stage was unreasonable and a disproportionate remuneration – especially as BSkyB said it would overcome its vote rights.
New investigation on the case of the State Prosecutor
The United States General Governor appointed a Special Public Minister to consider the license of nine American lawyers in 2006.
The operation shall be when a report on the case by the General Inspector of the Critical Justice Division on the Actions of Administrative Officers.
The report was critical to the White House, the legislators and the former manager Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was made out of fear that the suppliers were removed for political reasons.
The Special Public Minister Nora Dannehy will now invest if the officials investigated during the investigation have lied to the investigators in the attempt of harmony of justice.
"Serious accused concerning potential criminal behaviour has not been completely investigated or appreciated," said the Glenn Fine inspection in its report.
The allocation of a special public minister with the power to convey witnesses to witness was one of the main recommendations.
The debate started when new American leaders were removed from their positions from the Department of Justice in December 2006.
At that time, the department said that lawyers were licensed for expensive performances.
But later he stated that the licensing lawyers were not more assessed by many other colleagues, bringing many observers to conclude that the license was motivated by the policy.
Some of the prosecutors were involved in the judicial action against the republic members of the High Profile Congress, while others refused to investigate the fault injury of the damage of democratic electors.
The American prosecutors are investigating and bringing cases in the courts under the government.
They may be licensed at any time, but they cannot be licensed for political reasons.
The Head of the Division of Justice, General Provider Alberto Gonzales, found in the storm for licenses, and finally raised his position.
A number of other officials of the Division of Justices were licensed.
(The report of Mr Gonzales was very critical in respect of the role of Mr. Gonzales in the case, saying that the primary responsibilities in the licenses, which had declined its role of leader and was extraordinary disappeared during the process.
Other officials, including the former senior assistant of Bush Karl Rove, were criticed to not cooperate with investigations.
The Eptica of Meat Loaf will be held
The rock star Meat Loaf is to be honored to the Q Awards for its innomined Bath Out Of Hell episcop.
The song, who will take its special gold prize to the cerimonia of the next week in London, said to be "honorated" to gain the recognition.
The song, which remains nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the Hit Hit Track of the Album of 1977 of Meat Loaf.
The Coldplay will lead the appointments for the premiums of this year, being in the list of nominations in four categories.
Paul Rees, Chief of the Q magazine, said, "There are some songs who translate things as time and kind, and Bat Out Of Hell is without sure one of them."
The song, composed of Jim Steinman, requested a strong vocal that was provided by Meat Loaf.
He opened with a structural section that was almost two minutes.
The song was made as a single in UK in 1979 and reached the fifteenth place.
But the album of Meat Loaf Bat Out Of Hell remained almost nine years in classic and came to sell more than 40 million copies in the world.
Meat Loaf - true name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including an action for an irregular heart battery in 2003 after he led on the pale.
In 2007, it was locked to remove the concerts.
Emerge later that he had a shot on a voice cord.
Occupate town streets, often forget and may soon in sale
New York City has thousands of arrivals, bulevard, streets and other ways, some famous, other wonderfully useful.
But even many veterinary taxists and residents for a long time are difficult to give the position of Extra Place, for more because they never heard it.
The small road is in the East Village and goes north from the First Strategy – without doing the Second Strategy – between Bowery and the Second Avenue.
Further than 30 feet of width and 120 of length, it approves more to a Polvery glass than to an active traffic.
There are no road signs.
It's virtually impossible to see it on a normal attack.
The road must, however, have an ammirator.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of recent luxury buildings built on the Prime Strade.
You want to open Extra Place and create a cleaner step for shops and buses that should open in new buildings.
Other ammirators include closers for a long time that say they were slaughtered by the street simply because it was one of the latest remainings of the past cousin.
But the service of conservation and development of the city, which has the control of the roads, is not interested in keeping it.
During a meeting of the Committee for the use of the Community Committee of the Environmental Agency, some representatives of the City Avalon Bay have set a proposal for the real estate company to buy the roads.
But the Committee prefers that the road remains in the hands of the city, and has asked a new plan to present the next month, said Susan Stetzer, the Director of the Community Council 3.
"There is a very little space left to the property of the city, and we want the city to continue to possess Extra Place," said he.
"They could be the proposals to system it and fix it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay has many months ago announced that he wanted to open the small road and install places to sit down, including some to use for a coffee to which the real estate company hopes to enjoy space.
The idea that Avalon Bay bought the road was made public for the first time at the meeting of this month.
Michele of Milly, a Avalon Bay portrait, said that although the company wants to use the road, it doesn't necessarily mean that it wants to possess it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this depressed vial and transform it into a public unity," he said, adding that the city has suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a Press Reservation Port of Allower, said that it was indeed desired to sell the road and noted that the purpose of the Agency was to develop the property instead of manageing it.
In comparison to its most colorful neighbour, Bowery, Extra Place left a story read.
Some believe that he took the name in 1802, when a large agricultural company, possessed by Philip Minthorne, was divided between his numbers of children and the street of land was not called.
The door on the back of CBGB, the punk rock monument closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the road may be better known as the set for the image of the Ramones album "Rock to Russia."
"The ground was wonderful," said Danny Fields, the manager of the Ramones, who made the photo in November 1976.
"It was an immunity fashion, clothes of clothes and pieces of bottles, poster, sheets, heart."
Some residents, including some bloggers that write "gentification" of East Village, were opposed to the idea of sale Extra Place, bringing that the piece of public property, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others lodged Extra Place as a rareness – a fram of towns almost for nothing changed that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The book of the lamentation: One looks a little nostalgic to the city by the exitation road"), published part of a Discurse of the city's history that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is an horror violin without exit, also a day buya and demittered doors of swimming swimming pool and windows with shocks, with old weeks who run around the low funds."
With a few exceptions, the road seemed almost the same than one last evening.
A rat walked actively by the back of the road near a door that leaded within the CBGB, which is now the site of a aristocratic clothes.
The walls were graphiced and a white bird bottle of 22 times close to a group of daily fresh fresh.
A few pasts said they were rarely thinking about Extra Place, but they suggest that he would need to be a little defended.
Mr Fields, by its hand, said that some people are thinking of the road's attraction in its current state.
"The best years of my life," he said, "There were in black, spots and disgusting places."
Aware debate: arising in England
At this point of educational look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Yezumi discussed the position of candidates on aware education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member in California studies and the senior Director of Educational Studies at the Picific Research Institute Institute for Public Policy, is the co-autor of the book "No good like thinking: because the media class needs to choose a school."
Really trace Spanish electoren is a complicated business.
Barack Obama's educational projects are an important example.
Mr Obama's campaign notes that, "African Americans and Latin students have significantly less likely to display the white students, "the one that is true.
In order to combat these difficulties in reaching the objectives, the Obama's education plan specifically supports, among other things, "aware transitional education" for English students.
However, the question for Obama is whether its commitment to the understanding of education, which involves teaching in different languages from English, is not taking into account its interest in learning differences.
Let's, for example, take Sixth Street Prep, an elementary school in the East of Los Angeles.
Students of school are for Spanish majority and lower income.
More than one third of the students, many of which have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among four years of age, a survey 100 percent of students made higher level test in the 2008 Mathematic status review.
Another surprised 93% of the four-year-olds have made the expert level test on the art-di-lingution-inglese art.
This incredible result has been reached using a different ingredient by Mr Obama.
Sixth Street focuses the bank and the exercise, constant assessment of the skills and an attraction of the type "no excuses".
Furthermore, and it is here that Mr Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of the Sixth Street, the opstructive approximation of the school for English students is "full allion".
The use of English is almost exclusive of the English in the context of education.
Ms. Mikels, who opposes the knowledge education, said to me, "We had a fantastic success with a student just coming from Mexico and if you were entered into class 12 months after you wouldn't be able to identify what it was."
"Funciona," she noticed, "for us work."
Obama took a school to model like Sixth Street Prep to replica it in other Spanish schools and English students?
The results reached from the school are very easy to respond to this question, but education policy in its same party (National Education Associations is a long-date supporter) and its continuous support to understanding is preventing Mr. Obama's response.
While it is agreed that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the subject banal when he said that people should stop worried about the law "solo-ingles."
Indeed, he said, "You're sure that your children are able to speak Spanish."
If Obama really wants to close these lacks of consequence, it should be carefully considering educational models that operate rather than to disappear them or to minimize them.
The oil is freshly calm and renewed economic fear
Oil prices have been slowly reduced on Monday because of concerns that even the US salvation plan for financial markets may not be able to renew the economy.
The futures of the greenhouse have falled from 7 percent to 99.80 dollars to the boat of New York in the morning's operations.
The prices lost more than 20 dollars to barley since Monday.
In the last two weeks, the first material markets have been dismissed from the Wall Street financial situation, and by a few potent uraniums in the Mexico Golf.
After reaching a little of $145,26 to the bar in June, prices were cut up to almost 90 dollars to the barley at the beginning of this month, before the resuming again, on the background of a three-minute uncertainty in the financial markets.
Ansia affected the investors from Monday also after the Congress leaders said that they had reached an agreement in the end of the week about the Saving Plan, the largest of the history.
The news was dark by frequent concerns that the financial crisis was far from the past.
In the last episode of the progressive fusion Citigroup will buy the bank operations of Wachovia Corporation, said the government on Monday.
At the same time, Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments have partially nationalized the European financial conglomerated Fortis.
Barclays Capital Analists said that the breathing negotiations in the end of the week had brought to a salvation agreement " seeming to have failed to live the market feelings.
While the worse economic situation is, it is expected that the demand of materials, including oil, will be calmed.
"The perspective for global equity, interest rates and change rates has become uncertain," they wrote in a note to the investors' analysis of the German Bank.
"We believe the first materials will not be able to flee from the container.
From a perspective of materials, our most pressing concern is until the American virus will spend globally and in specific to China. "
Bank Analysts declined their expectations for the next year, while home oil consumption due to the ratio of economic growth, reducing the oil price and gas rate of approximately 20 per cent of 2009.
The explosion in the second submits a team record.
After having expensed more time than anyone with the Jets' uniform in the last eight and more stagions, the defence Shaun Ellis thought he had seen everything.
Then he looked at the course of the second fourth Sunday, when the Jets turned a game without points in a revolution.
"Now see something like this," said Eliss.
The second began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had cut the grindle of the threatened clouds that surrounded them with a fick game.
Then the quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12-year-to-scale touch, providing the perfect signal for a afternoon in which their growing synthesis made a huge step forward.
Favre found Coles for two others in the fourth, including one when a cornerback is falled and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first time.
"I'm not out of my road," said Favre of all the pasts coming to Coles.
He's a fantastic player.
Our communication was great, although people can think."
While Farvre and Coles were making pretty games, the defense had severely touched the quarterback of the Cardinals Kurt Warner.
The Darrelle Revis corner has interfered a vagant lance and has relaxed it for 32 jars in a touchdown.
Eric Smith security planned another step and interacted it.
The linebacker David Bowens has a warner smoke.
The last turnover, Bowens powerful smoke, could be the most important.
The Cardinals were gone for that ball owner, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets took the ball with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely calculated a meter from 20 jars, for a benefit from 34 to 0.
It was more than Jets have never been given in a fourth.
When it was asked to describe peace, the coach of the Jets Eric Mangini said, "The second or the third?"
When it was told him both - the Jets gave 21 points without answer to the third - Mangini, he said, "I can tell you that I like much more than the second fourth than the third."
There were a lot of points in a small late time."
Gierslassie overthrows his record of the world
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia has revealed because many believe the best marathon of ever, breaking its world's same record to the Sunday Berlin marathon and becomes the first person to run a road of 26.2 miles under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a well-pleasing winter on the road in 2:03:59, Gebrselassie sent in frantuous for 27 seconds his previous point of 2:03:26, last year in Berlin.
During 35 years, Gebrselassie takes the 26th record of the world of such unbalanced carrier that produced a global campionate or a world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie has run the olympic marathon of Pechino, which may be too slow, in backspeaking - that the pollution of the air would worse its asma problems.
Indeed, he decided to run to Berlin.
In conditions almost perfect - swimmed and 48 degrees to start, 55 degrees to arrival - Gebrselassie winned Sunday with a average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds for miles.
Once half foundists such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya were going to long distance, the marathon record has falled more than two minutes in the past, since Ronaldo from Costa from Brazil arrived to Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After the Sunday winner, Gebrselassie told the reporter that two weeks ago he had cramps in the pops and left a week of earnings.
Of course, the rest left her fresh, not frozen.
"I'm so happy," said Gebrselassie to reporters.
"All was perfect.
I started a week ago, and I had any doubts today, but finally everything was fine."
It was a little criticised - especially in Kenya, the eastern African rivale of Ethiopia - for excessively orchrowed his races, generally avoiding many of the best marathony stars of the world, containing the apripitist as if it was a half-ground race, and puting the records of the world over the sense of competition.
But these criticisms are rarely reduced to the size of the skills of Gebrselassie as marathon.
With the step falled by four Sunday kinnians, Gebrselassie reached the average point of road at 1:02:04.
Two kinnian corridors, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, have held the competition of Gebrselassie after the apripitists have been shot.
A few more than three miles from arrival, Gebrselassie has made a final tax to separate himself from Kwambai, which has ended according to 2:05:36, improving its best personal time than almost 5 minutes.
Kamathi has arrived third in 2:07:48.
In the female race, Irina Mikitenko, born Kazakistan, which is now German city, has completed a significant year winning in 2:19:19, the seventh faster time than ever.
Paula Radcliffe of the Great Britain holds the record of the world of 2:15:25.
Last summer, Mikitenko, 36 years old, was a surprising Maratona in London in 2:24:14.
You've lost Pechino games with what it's described as a bad incident, but he's cured to win in Berlin, making his best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon that has happened.
You have run a race done well the calculations, allowing a quarter of Ethiopia and Kenian went out with a great distance, turning them around 18 miles and half.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia has arrived second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya ended third time at 2:25:01.
In a city apart, orgoglio and processes of a black life
Slaughter in the East Theme Park on the soberns of Orland, a few miles from the brightness, from the voice, from the end, where the warm city where the orgoglio and the complications of the afro-American experience are entering into life.
Eatonville, the first city of the black entered into the country and the birth house of Zora Neale Hurston, is not so simple as it described in 1935: "The city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good births, abondance of gueva, two schools and no prison."
Now it's a pilgriming place.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the year old Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect to Hurston, the most famous writer of Harlem Renaissance.
However, in many ways, the city which has described - and that makes the tourists closer to the tourists, including the Florida's tourist guide of the Federal Writers' Depression - remains a place part.
It's so independent, worthy and private as it was in the thirty years, when Hurston wrote that the rural necks in Florida often resisted to share their thoughts with the white man, which "with so little of us, he doesn't know what it's lost."
Even now, in a year in which a black President, Senator Barack Obama, was called for an opening talk on the race, many who remain different from the view of the outsighter.
"We're very falling on how our story's been told," said Hortense Jones, 59 years, a resident of all life and a member of the oldest church of the city.
"It must be right."
Eatonville was long-defined as a trionfo parade and difficulty.
It is a story of black capture model that a community of almost 2.400 where the poverty rate is two times the national average.
It is a literary center, but also an example to the shadow of the slaughters of the southern rural culture - sometimes disappeared, sometimes preferred - born from the American slaughter.
Not surely, the residents here are to be and protected.
And the concern for the imagination of Eatonville started really with Zora, which all here called Hurston.
She presented the world to his birth city through true books, riches of dialetto, like "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida's guide transformed the city, just outside the Red 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten center of Florida in a black history scenario and human drama
Basse as a grace both in life and in the letter, Hurston brought the readers into the shop owned from the first seat of Eatonville, Joe Clarke, then get to more private areas.
"Food from the way to the left," she wrote, "the modern public school, marroned with the white refinements, with its well-bearing gardens, with which Howard Miller was always bad, thinking that he could just read and write."
She also mentioned the new husband of the widowship Dash and wrote that Lee Glenn "vend drinking of all the types and whatever is fit to passing rooms."
So in a few hundreds of words, Hurston has connected Eatonville with self-govern, but also with analfabetism, second girls and sex.
Of course this was not Fodor.
In fact, it was not a retirement that they were all appreciated.
"When he said as it was," said Ela Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's girls that Hurston immortalizes the men who sing big songs concerning their beauty.
Add: "A some people don't like."
Hurston is still remembered here as a living excentric that often returned from his family transferred to Jacksonville, Flat.
Augustus Franklin, 77-year-old, it is remembered that when Hurston pitched into the city, he was hot without warning in a Chevrolt trionfard, smoking and puting pantalons into a city that also today enjoys the dignity of the warming.
Many inhabitants were disappeared, says Mr. Franklin, while others undermined.
"The people were always very happy to see Zora," said Mr. Franklin.
But, added, Dondorlands on his throne on the back side by supervising the Sabelia lake, where Hurston was very likely baptized, "He never remained long."
When Hurston died in 1960, he was poor and his books were gone out of printing.
I'm on the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although it was a star of the letter, a Contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman in Barnard College in 20 years, she was buried in a tomb without a tomb in Fort Pierce, Fla.
In Eatonville, there were no great memorative cerimonians, and no great conference.
"I don't believe they understood their contribution to the world or his left to all," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a Hurston's biographie published in 2003.
A change has occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County's officers wanted to place a five-way autostraint through the city to reserve Kennedy Boulevard, the main road at two courses.
Orlando's extension has already shot La Interstate 4 through the Western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still resuming from a difficult period of his history.
In addition to other things, forced integration had been ended with respect to the iilian isolation of the community
In the fivety-year-old, the fight on racial messure brought the hate on the door of the community's house.
"In that period, a group of white boys came and threw rings and things to those who sat on one side," said Mr. Franklin.
"We actually had a girl who stayed killed once.
They got a coffee from a car."
In a letter from 1955 to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made the Supreme Court a request for forced integration, defining its decision in Brown against the school office "a blame rather than a honor for my race."
The residents now say that the disegregation of schools, although they have been positived under some aspects, delude the cohesion of Eatonville and put the confidence of his young people.
"The Black Children were inhabited to be abroad - I remember this - you broke your teacher at the morning, crashed your teacher at night," said N. Y. Nathiri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and the executive Director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a group no-profit.
This time, he added, until teachers and students were not coming from the same place.
"You did not cut your white teacher because your white teacher...-- I mean, there's a cultural division there," said Mrs Nathiri.
Civil rights, in any way, helped and create space for many other Neale Hurstons - black writer, actor and artist who overlooked prejudices, as did, with pleasant safety and lines as: "How some can deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I can't understand."
In 1975, the writer Alice Walker started a long way for the tomb without Hurston's tomb and began fighting for the resurrection of his reputation.
Five years later, a biografic complaint on the Hurston of Robert E. Hemenway hit the books scenes, bringing it back into the American canon.
The project of the autostraße came right while her most famous daughter had worked again the lights of the ribalt.
And this time the old neighbors of Hurston saw it as a salvator.
The community started designing a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could destroy the state with his self-stake.
Millennium fans came to an inaugural event two years later, and every January, many return to memory.
Many years later, it turned back from his project on the road.
"The five cores of the resurrect autostrate, have brought what would be the high speed, a real orgogly for the city," said Mrs Nathiri.
Mrs. Boyd puts her easier way: "The time I saved Eatonville."
The winning on the autostrate project helped change the imagination that the city has itself.
Those from outside town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began to come to church here in 1993, began to appear a long number, and the residents began to revaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the historical record in 1998.
A new library to a single plan (known as Hurston, obviously) opened in 2006 on a Kennedy Boulevard recovered and rejected Kennedy.
Today, Eatonville remains an anamy of Florida: just six miles from the centre of Orlando, can give the feeling of a secondary road under the exit rain, small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1800s.
(It's 90% black percent today.)
External ones who are coming to search for the history of Eatonville, for his meaning, are still treated with custody.
A requested permission is requested for most of the interviews, some things - like the older walls on the church of Eatonville, painted by a white man, which makes see men in the fields - they do not have the permission to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, such as Mrs. Jones, a grassock teacher, with a weak weakness for the bright red, still fears that their island community comes frankly.
However, as far as the Hurston festival has expanded, it is also emerging a high level of citizens.
Youth, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston to see his entire race: beautiful, problems and everything, neither better, nor worse and fiery, creative, great worker, shame and confused as other ethnic groups in America.
It is a certain civil term that can be heard in Mr. Franklin's voice of the army, Edwin Harvey, 18 years, which is proposed to return to Eatonville after the college to work in the local government or the Department of Police, which might need help.
And even those who are younger, such as Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11 years old by Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Much people, if they've just entered here, they'll think, 'Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others',' said Alondra Kenon after the ship after the last Sunday.
"But if you're really closed and take a moment to look at the story, it's really a gracious city."
Here in New York we're all talking about financing.
On the surface, nothing has been changed.
If the tourists in Manhattan had been far from the journal bankers and the ends of the TV screens of Times Square, they would not be able to stand in the eye of the cycle.
It would never be sure that the Veter offices, on their tests, the bankers and the fund hedge managers would live in New York every day the worst "botto day in office" from the 1929 crown.
Factors shot metal carts for the the through martyrs, transporting moffin vessels for collating meetings.
The Latin-American throw the feet between the condominiums, such as human mulls, 50 and steady road roads on their backs.
The employees are still waiting for their morning baths at the food cards on the martyrs, and it is still impossible to take a yellow tax between 16 and 19 of a workday.
It seemed not that there was a true crisis, until, with all the disappearance of destruction and tristeness, I decided to open a new book of rescue afternoon.
Even though I planned the fancy so she had involved the breakfast afternoon to my daughter of the JP Morgan Chase, an approximately wind was already waiting for the flat.
Not in front of the Castle sports, to reset money or to make depositories, but before the customer service sport, where old customers ordinate seals books, the tourists ask directions for the great Macy magazine and new customers find accounts.
Many of those who were before me, I would then learn from Starr, my "truggles of confidence" for my same reason.
On the contrary, they have already taken the residues from the smallest banks from which the pendolars do, such as those from New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Iceland.
They have taken the money from such thrift detainees (a little as a construction company), credit co-operations and types of citizen rescue banks whose filias only operate within one state and say to treat customers as families.
In the past 15 of these banks are deceived.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion inactive, was submitted to the controlled administration, and, while the newyorkes were guided home for the end of the week, a Friday, another bank, Wachovia, with the debt of $440 billion, was the search for a buyer who saved it.
The employees and acts that were before me, imposed for another colleague, were moved their money to a bank hired as a secure port, the bank who is asking more privileges to Wall Street.
Common newspapers in the last weeks have become competent.
An woman to my supermarket Chinese confidence, speaking to the phone, was refered to Lehman Brothers, the bank who was deceived, and her eheated director Dick Fuld in all family, as if you're laying by a pig colleague.
And Lyn, the portineia in uniform, almost 50 tons of my condominium, has changed the subject in respect of our normal discussions on Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my expenditure.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "I have all my rescue in market funds!
I changed, I don't get any risk."
We're profanated musulmans while Austria turns right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left of the austrian right ala of the Liberty Party and Philp Dewinter of the Belgian Right Party Vlaams Belang, take part in a manifestation to submit the "Citty against Islamization" in Anversa on 17 January 2008.
They bring types of signs those road representatives with a red line that passes in the middle.
Police has infringed the right extremists to profane a museum cimiter in Austria, the same week that the political parties of the extreme right have gained much to the national elections.
More than 90 tombs were seriously damaged to the Traun cemetery, near Linz, in some hours between Friday night and this morning, where the police believes that it was an organised action.
The offenders have moved with the Jewish spray like the David's place above some tombs, but the detectives believe it might be an attempt to mask the extremist motivations conducted by a hate of Muslim immigrants.
It is not clear if the incident is bound in some way to the elections.
A portrait of the local islamic community said that they were "basedly disappeared" from the news of profanation, which came to the end of the Ramadan, a month of religious determination for musulmans.
Austria in the middle of time has been seen in a spiritual search journey following his right work in the yesterday parliamentary elections.
The two extreme right parties who took almost 30 percent of the votes, the Southern Freedom and the Alliance for the future of Austria have made a campaign with anti-immigration and some of their slogans have been defined by the xenofobia criticians.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the Chief of the Liberty Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, made a campaign against vessels and burka and expressed his opposition to foods that are undertaken as connected to Islam.
At the end of Vienna, he spoke of a "European fratellation" to prevent the growth of Islam.
The parties seem to be engaged in the construction of furniture and miners, bringing that political symbols of a continued islamization of Austria and Europe.
Success and analysis made immediately after the elections, which set the extreme right as the stronger political block of the nation, indicated that the change was brought in predominantly by young electors who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Foreign journey to Gary Glitter.
In Gary Glitter, the glass star of the rock guilty of sexual abuse on minors was prohibited to travel in France and Spain from the court.
The judges imposed the prohibition of six months in Glitter after he informed the authorities who had checked him to want to go to Spain through France.
The foreign journey prohibition was granted to the Kent police last Thursday after he provided the judges the test of previous arrests of Glitter for sexual abuse against minors.
Glitter, true name Paul Gadi, was not present at the prevailing of Ashford in Kent but was represented by the lawyers of Corker Binning.
A Court Service Service Portuguese said: "Just 25 September at the prevailing of Ashford, the Kent police submitted a request to prevent the journey from Mr. Paul Gadd in France and Spain until 25 March.
"Paul Gadd wasn't present by person."
Glitter, 64 years old, had informed the authorities to fly to the foreign journey as it was required by the registration of condemnations for sexual offences.
He must give news to the authorities if you want to travel for more than three days.
He is also requested to give the police a prevision of seven days on its planned start date.
The lack of notification to the authority may lead to a sentence to five years of prison.
The Kent police said not to want to discuss the individual cases or the possible movement of Glitter in the country.
A City police carrier said: "The city police will do all the necessary to protect children in this country or foreign.
"Of our point of view, it is easier to control someone who remains in the United Kingdom because we have complete systems to manage every potential risk more effectively.
"Protect the residents of Kent is the main concern of the city police and we work attentively to monitor the behaviour of the condemnation for sex cases registered in the country to minimize any possible risk for public.
Hitter returned to the United Kingdom last month after 27 months in a vietnamite prison for abuse of two girls of 10 and 11 years.
When Glitter came to Bangkok where he had to boil on a flight for London.
But he said to feel sick and refused to fly to London.
The Dutch authorities would not pass through the passenger control and finally took a flight for Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities did not allow him to enter and return to Bangkok where the Thai police and the immigration officers continued to return to England.
At the end he came to Heathrow terminal 3 on 22 August and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the pressure of Uxbridge, in west of London, since Scotland Yard had successfully asked for a order to insert it in the register of the condemned for sexual abuse.
Glitter was previously incarcerated in the United Kingdom in 1999 to possess images of hurts on children.
A source of the Ministry of the Internal Minister said that Jacqui Smith, the secretariat of the Internal Secretariat, felt a warm and happy that Glitter had been stopped from the journey in France and Spain.
"Foto the teacher away from the scene to extract the character" Günther Bauer, photo
No cups nor flights nor dressed before.
Only the absence of the great masters of the flamenco, spoiled from the concentration which characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
To the other, the person.
Two inseparable factors, except in the private, in those distances from the public, when the intimity of a manager, the depth of a red look or the expressivity of the hands are natural because they do not have to go to scene.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alone theatrality of some skills to cantors, ballings and climbs on the pool with the less known sides of these masters.
With this goal, the photo offers a original flamenco iconic, collecting it from various visual corners.
The exhibition, including in the Flamenco photography programme, reflects the international importance of this ballo every day, always greater", explains the artist and explains that in "Flamenco-People" could also be treated by common people, but seeing the photos, the observer is not the type of artists, interpretations or executives on the scene.
These people retracted "on the road" are "artists in a way to transmit passion, tristeness, joy when they are in scene ... and to catch the public.
In order to collect the personality of these largers, it is not necessary to retain them in scene,
Because their personalities and characters are inside.
What I was interested was creating an immense atmosphere that allowed me to catch with the photography's personalities of the great flower."
With the passion for the "Cante de la Minas festival", Bauer started a long path in 1997 to retain sounds, chitarists or ballers using a photo car on the street.
They are recruited that, because of the type of machine and material, they remember classic photography.
The application of various styles is broken with the traditional principles of the image, which conferring to the photo modernity, according to a idea that reflects the concessing of the own flamenco of Bauer: "A music with very traditional roots that is developed and is able to surprise every day."
Not the ballery, the song or the sounding in himself, but the personality of the artist, his character, is able to buy the public with his art.
The search for a meeting with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way to feel and be, and have been the constant of this work, in exhibition in these days at the El Fotomata Gallery.
Famose artists like Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, are in this selection of about seventy-three artists.
The project has become a kind of anthology of flamenco, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the pensions exhibited at the time of the display.
The passion for retreats brought Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Retails of Veterano atlets" ("SportARTProject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photo appreciates "I love retreat people, know them and can pass through for a moment in their life, both this is a long or short moment.
I think it's the hardest in the photograph.
To meet you or meet people, persons that sometimes don't even know or give you just a few minutes to shoot the photo.
Besides these circumstances, like a photograph, I always seek to clarify my ideas."
The collection of recruitments of the contemporary flamenco, named "Flamenco-people" is entitled at the Gallery El Fotomata, at the 20th of the Mata, parallel to the Alameda de Hercules, and will be opened to the public until October 16.
Vargas Llosa believes that the romantic you write is a "sack"
It is ambitious in places that still don't know and the question of unknown arguments: although this, Mario Vargas Llosa is taken with a new project to which he works, a romanis whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish national who has lived 20 years in Congo and has crossed the Amazzonia.
From always favoured for the Nobel Prime for the Lettering, the writer confessed yesterday at the occasion of the Hay Festival of Segovia, that the project of which you are occupied today is "a sugar" and that "all indicates that I should not write it."
"If I had a good sense, I wouldn't write it, but I will do it likely and hope to end it as before," he concluded his intervention to the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days he saw passing for the city of the Acquisition a hundreds of writers, stories, journalists and thousands of people.
The author of "The city and the dogs" was, like by pronostic, the figure of spectrum to the third edition of the word festival.
Vargas Llosa, who gained the Price of Hay Festival to be the most voted writer by participants – a former edition of the book "Our mutual friend" of Dickens, has filled the places of the theatre John Bravo.
The writer was presented by Félix Romeo, the writer was found in front of a public to which it was flighted the time when the Peruvian, with a wonderful memory and with large doses of humism, renewed as a nakque in it the letter vocation, resulting from "aventure of read" and "leving more than what I live"; as written in "modally disciplined" to pray to "manance of inspiration", with an intense documentation work, redaction and continually reeffection; as Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and as "the images of the memory" are the foundation on which his stories are placed.
The Spanish-American Romani recognized that " there is no way" to measure and know whether the books can change the life of people, "but I refuse to believe that the letter is a pure maintenance, an emotional experience," said Vargas Llosa, understood that, in contrast, "has effects" and that "he has the most anti-conformist people." For this, he invited the writers to "not stop the freshness" and "subsist the responsibility" of his vocation.
The time is obstaining the Festival of Pozoblanco, taking him from the roads
The festival of the flowers that had to be sugged of the day of Pozoblanco Festival was suspended yesterday morning, after the tours selected for corrigers were checked that the conditions of the floor of the planet were not appropriate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Closen Bohorquez, Paul Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to stop the celebration of the course.
Industry have been accompanied against this Festival by impeding to celebrate two days on three.
Saturday, the rain prevented the conduct of the second turt rain.
In the cards, Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and John Bautista, who had to fight a tower of Castilblanco.
Therefore, the Festival had regularly performed on Friday.
In this occasion, Daniel Luke was trionfare, drawing three ears and coming out to trionfo, after turning with shot and extinct.
The same afternoon Alejandro Talavante has finally brought its two flowers of greeting health and an ear, allowed more than the public for the course itself.
The worst among all was El Juli, passing from the area of Los Beos without glory and without penalty.
With the second tower, after a tremendous mule, the fish of the public has been gained.
A furgone with two miles of Haihish over the place of blocking in Alva
It's less than ten in the morning.
Officers take the top of the two employees of a furgone instead of stoping their flight.
The agents have intimated the top of the two employees of a furgone instead of stoping the flight.
Their loader, more than two tons of hahish, is a good reason to not stop.
The officers, after having followed them, are able to arrest one of the two employees, a man of about 28 years, identified as A. A. J., as reported in the communication of the Department of the Internal Government.
The arrested person is accused of drug trafficking and falseization of public documents.
The incident occurred when some of the road officers of Alva were conducting a control of transport on the N-1, in the point where this overrides the common circumscription of Armiñón.
They triggered to stop an inspection furgon when the leader, translating the orders, accelerated brushly and passed over the place of block.
The agents have been followed until the vehicle, after a few kilometres, stopped on the roadboard and its two busy have been dataed to flee in a forest area.
The officers of the Hertzaintza were therefore able to arrest one of the flights and to follow 2.178 kilometers of hashish that carried and acted once inspected the furgone, a Iveco Daily.
The hashish paints, which were in the back of the vehicle, were later placed under police career for a extended investigation and the recognition of weight.
Furthermore, since the officials agreed that the matricule was "duplicated" because he did not correspond to that reported in the documentation of the furgone, the warrant was also imputed in the sentence of falseification of public documents.
The Ertzaintza is continuing investigations to arrest the second suspected person, which has been able to flee as it said, and to determine the provenance of drugs.
The arrest A. A. J., of 28 years, was led to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and to be available to the judge in the next hours.
Heather Locklear actor for guidance under the medicinal effect
Actor Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the Melrose Place Popular series, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for guidance under the effect of medicines.

"Sangre of May," the Episode of Garci
Inspirating to the National Episodios of Benito Pérez Galdós, Jose Luis Garci represents the famous direction of Spanish to French, which is the most ambitious film of his film, with almost 15 million euros.
With this film, the government has tried to "display the tower of persons and at the same time the social analysis" which has always been enthusied in the work of the famous romance, has explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevar would be head of a wide range of interpretations.
The Sangre of May, along more than two hours and half, deployed this Friday in the cinema sales, to become a TV ministry over four hours on TeleMadrid.
Great Ammirator of the Head of Galdós, Jose Luis Garci subsistes that he had made with this round " a dream of his childhood," and believes to give thanks to Esperanza Aguirre, who had commissioned him three years before he turned a memoratory film for the second center of 2 May. The government accepted that the history of lows on the Episodios National Episode.
The 15 million budgeted throughout the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a single opportunity for the recovery of the scenegraphy and the appropriate costs to retain a "a stormed spanish, which deployed the choice of the leader to fight and the fact that the fight for the independence brought to the people a great delay in the development under the Kingdom of Ferdinando VII" has noted Garci.
However, the government has not received funding for those of Alatrists or Los fantasmas de Goya - more than double than Sangre de May, so it was not possible to run some scene provided by the scene that he had signed together in Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost all its carrier.
This, for the Register of Volver to start, has influenced the practice of its abitive work, put it in scene with the actors, with which often uses to try to turn together to those who don't get part of the cast, because it considers "huiliant," considering that "the part of the government's work is in the terms of theatre and movie to know what happens in the field where it works."
Many of the interpretations, part of which are entering in the castle of Sangre de May, proceedings before his car, such as Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Canded to Oscar for four times - winning one - Garci believes that no of the three candidates to represent Spain at the Hollywood Academy - his Sangre of May, you're French baller tables and, the last chosen Czech rounds - they don't represent the youngest generation of Spanish film "when should be known instead."
From this film Garci is not waiting for a premium.
"In the beginning you believe to work for posters, then you understand that you only work for prosperity, and at a certain point you'll just run a film in more," Garci explains after more than 30 years of carrier.
Isabel Bayon discovers the Sivian existence of the Tortola Valencia
A sivilian ballery makes love to another ballery likewise in Siville.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catholic father (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusa mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), born in the area of Triana, and three years old to the family in London.
It was a free dance ballery and a specialist in Eastern dances.
He conducted a pregnant life and was a pioneer of the female emancipation, of Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
It was buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corte which prevented women to move freely.
The lives of this woman, which confronted a revolution in the dance and ethnic framework in Europe between the two wars, has always been awaited by Isabel Bayon.
"I would like to work with Pepa Gamboa and you propose this person. I'll seem incredible."
He supports the ballery: "We don't try to tell his whole life, but to gather the spirit.
The titles of his disasters suggested me some basic elements of the flower.
So, "the danse of the mariposa" suggested me a guilty, or "the dance of the serpent" some tanks.
Her dance was sensitive, and it was told me that my ballery way also comes into this exhibit," explains.
The set in scene provides two exceptional contributions: the one of Miguel Poveda, which will sing again Isabel in one of its shows, as faces "The open door"; and the one of the Matilde Coral teacher, who was exceptionally wanting to work with the one who was his alive.
"Matilde interprets adult Tortola, the personality of the motherhood.
I'm happy because he accepted to work in my work and I feel very honorable."
The enlightenment also includes the musical and chitarists, such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the song of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga and Moi di Morón; the stripes of El Pajaro, as well as the violation of Rafa La Viola and the cooperation of a a actor, Juanfran Juárez " which interpretates the eternal role of those artists who have been lived in everything, and they have always had many spasmants."
The work is also presented in some forms of the life of this woman who is in long places, in particular for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then the whole Europe, because he was alive to London.
"I wanted to remember her, because I think it's one of the women who have had a huge inflation in a given historical period, and now no one remembers it and less thinks of his operation as something of value" supports the Bayon.
The show will begin today, at 20:30 p.m. at the Lope de Vega theatre.
With the publication of the "General of a married poet", the Trinity is also closed
The presentation of the first edition of the "Journal of a Poeta Recensed" at the Church of Saint Stephen (New York), where John Ramón Jiménez sposed Zenobia in March 1916, enters into the activities planned by the Assessant to the Culturation of the Day of Andalucia to celebrate the "Treinnium of Zenobia and John Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to memorize the fifty-seventh anniversary of the appointment of the Nobel Price for the letter and the death of both.
So, the "Treinnium of Zenobia and John Ramon" concluded with the rehabilitation of this work, with the International Congress that has been held in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel Museum and with the extraordinary show "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel Light Chopo", which was inaugurated the last May and, after touching the various provinceses of England, will come to New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
Furthermore, the Assessant to the Culture of the Day of Andalucia has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "General of a Poeta Recensed" by Peter Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso to continue the spread of the figure and the work of one of the higher places.
America likes less than Paul Newman
"After God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of these."
The sentence is the actor Sally Field, which worked with him in "Ausence of Malicia" and gives the idea of the impotence of the American cinema, and of all America, in front of the consequent idea that Newman went away.
Yet he costed him much to give him a Oscar.
And since 2007 he was in pension.
And he also knew that he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very hard slaughter for all.
"After what a proof is going over any expression, and now I have lost a great friend," cried Robert Redford, "My life and my country could be better thanks to his existence."
Nobody was afraid to result ridiculous or to explore.
And he died a father of the movie and heritage at a particularly dark moment, for the fear of terrorists and markets, with the self-sensitive of the American people on the earth, with the desperate search for new motivations to feel worthy.
When the times are so difficult, men so without power and remain well people to encouraging, they don't need to be Luis Ceruda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he had the ideal platoic of beauty and truth.
It was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and the defender of losses and wins, from the foundation for the fight against drugs created in honor of the firstborn of overdose to the creation of the mark of household and biological food.
Everyone gives a country to which it is much costed to go beyond a suspicional culture.
The gun of warming went over Hollywood, without healing nor nationality nor passports.
The last James Bond, the English Daniel Craig, noted that a man wasn't died, has ended a time.
Another English, Sam Mendes, government premised with Oscar, said that working with Newman has made nothing less than his carrier's appliance.
The bad guy came from Australia, Russell Crowe, was angry to define Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He left an example of high-level for us all," he stated George Clooney, perhaps one of the few who tried to live today, as Paul Newman did: maintaining highly the need of recreation and having a serious and distance private life to the cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in the media Thursday today.
However, some test and Paul Newman are a good example for these.
He had divorced once but stayed married for fifty years with Joanne Woodward, whereby he was faithful, without surely lacking his opportunities to be him.
"Why's I going to eat out of Hamburger, if I have a steak?" she just shot.
In the sky, he joins the orgour that his daughters are also his friendships, what is not so common in America.
"On all the big he interpreted, no one was so fiery as the devoted husband, lovely father, they are not arrested and embraced Philantropo," they say.
The imperfect core of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that before or then the Olimpiads will go to Madrid and, after the attempt failed for 2012, this might happen in 2016.
But I'm asking, are we ready?
If we follow the example of the yesterday corse example, you say no!
They called the "perfective curse", but I think it was greatly worse than he had assisted.
A cut of disappointments, which if afterwards had been taken into consideration in the evaluation and I was to expose it, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let's go in order and start from the beginning.
The disappointments were started with the retreat of the dorsale, which was supposed that he went before.
It seemed not a wrong idea, but if they move you to go, that is to get everything (including the chip to avoid the codes during the garden).
Of course not.
You should only go to take the dorsale (softness preview, go only for this) and (to the relative coda), surprise! they had just shots of skin 'S' (second disappointment, because I need a XL cup).
In what world do we live?
It's the crime of the crisis if they decided to buy only small mass, made with less tissue and then less costs?
Of course, things of this kind are inedictions compared to the same day of the corsa.
Besides to go very fast to take the chip, the waiting cod was about 15 minutes and, for more, you had to lay the tub.
The waiting is long more than 35 minutes, what is incomprehensible for a course to waiting for more than 11,000 people.
So, as it was predictable, the core started that we had not yet laid down the sauna, although, once you succeed in the company, the recovery became worse.
Furthermore, the rain threatened the expectation of more than 40 minutes, to which attempts were reached to the popular rebellion and reached to the state.
For at least 500 people tomorrow, we will certainly have the polymonists, and some, as I am, will not even happen in the correct order class because of the chip that, I guess I will not register the arrival correctly.
In the future, if they will ask me about the perfect core, this will not enter into my thoughts.
So I think we'll continue to dream a good olympic city.
Microsoft searches Receptionist (varial)
At the MIT conference on emergency technologies, Microsoft presented a new system of recognition of the image and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, in order to perform some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or in the case of Microsoft, a shipped service to spend up in the campus of society) by assisting the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and an recognition system of forms and faces, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people are in a room, who are - even remember their position in the company - and to listen and understand the key words in a conversation with them.
It may also be able to group the presents in conversation groups.
In the video, for example, the receiptist describes a third person, but it understands that it does not be the group with which he speaks and that he is not an employer of the company.
The question is whether it is there to visit someone and tell her that it will be in a short time.
All without a blue screen.
Printing.
But this, of course, is the future.
Now the company has better concentrate on how, for example, on the next version of its operational Windows system.
This week he spoke of a strategy change in Microsoft.
Windows 7 will be easier and won't have a lot of associative programs.
Steve Ballmer discovered that, if the computers had been made of the essential and less loading of commercial spaces, they would go five times more faster – hey! Steve, it'll be "the less".
All of the discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continued added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The direction change is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is always lost more importance, and with it the software.
When Google started Chrome on the network, I was one of those who supported theory that was the first step of Google to compete with Windows.
Many are accurately emphasized that a browser is not an operational system.
The operational system will always be needed because it is an impresionable element to ensure that Hardware and Communist Software.
Take the same function of your wife or your husband when you have something to tell her sister.
That's true.
It will never disappear, but it may be necessary to think about the "mortal" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relating.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People are always less attention to the operational system, and more on the web browser.
You take the computer only for launching Explorer or Firefox - or Chrome – and we are daily over time by navigating in a remote environment than in windows.
What are the half of the application of the operational system needed?
Mean is more.
And Windows 7 must be less, much less than Vista.
Measuring, less sovereignty, less complex.
A Microsoft is interesting to integrate your online services so that they become a valid alternative to Google.
They have a disagreement needed, actually, and I report here a small example.
I disappeared the photograph in this post in one of the recreation places for Microsoft's employees in Redmond at the beginning of this month.
On the bibit machine a card allows them to use your search tool - "Your search. Our future".
In 2006, an independent study arrived in the conclusion that 66% of the employees of Microsoft uses Google to carry out a network search.
Last week, the rest, has been confirmed the delay in the development of the new Windows Mobile 7.
It will not be put on the market in the first months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, unless it is not directed in 2010.
Microsoft will surely start together Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7.
The cell phone, after all, is always becomes a computer more.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is crucial.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Paul Picasso brought her to the Costa Azzurra, Leonardo di Caprio resumed in 'Diamant of blood' of Edward Zwick, as well as Al Pacino n'The Padrin' of Francis Ford Coppola over the typical form of the muscle parish.
And if we try to listen the star appearances, we can renew the image of the forehead with the appreciated buffs that leaving the weights in the walking environment.
It is, in substance, of human magic type, with the mixture of coton, attracted and without manners.
It's the 'tank', as it calls the English, even though, Belgian Fabuleux Marcel looks above all.
The "Marcel" excellent than others for the high quality of the cotton, for its unisex plate, for its different voice and for the small Belgian band (apportable) that the most emblemmatic models of the magicet bear as details on the neck.
The "Marcel" excellently respects others for the high quality of the coton, for its unisex plate, for its different voice and for the small Belgian band (appenably recognisable), that the models of the most emblemmatic magics bear as details on the neighbour.
And attention, because the production of this Belgian does not only concern the famous "tank".
Also gets tips for the college, swimming boxer, cash boxer cards, cotton screens, mariner mass, baby-dolls, mini short...
Individual enterprises thought to be comfortable.
And it's a sin to use them as an immense biancheria.
I'm too well.
"I want to be a young mom, the candidate doesn't worry about me."
The great suspicion with the sister has not prevented her to develop their own personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, Cruz sisters have taken very seriously their new activities in the field of mode.
For Monica, they're much more than beautiful girls and celebrity who provide their name.
It was in Paris for the promotion that the Mango sign has made from his new seat, except the presentation of the most important princes than the Spanish fashioned house.
Calm and fearful, buying you quickly.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came to submit the new collection we idead my sister Penelope and I for the autunno-night season of Mango, except to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the "Mango Fashion Awards" and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentino.
We say, a very intense day, but at the same time, emotional.
From what are the elements of your new collection for Mango in this fourth work station for the Spanish house?
It's my sister who likes the cinema of the 50s' age 60, from here we're getting different inspirations.
Then, I like to lose me in the city and watch how to see women's vessels, as they combine and mixe their clothes.
Ballera, a acter and stilist, you're a very sweet woman, right?
I believe yes, even though at the end, it affects and there are many elements in common.
To me, until the little, they liked clothes; I wanted to go to my grandfather's house to fruit in the arms of my tea and to see his clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than go to the game park.
Then, once ballery, I've always made much attention to his clothes.
You know that the whales like to have a own style to go to lection and wise, to look at the speed and feel well.
And in the role of the actrice, when they give you the watch is the time you really meet the person.
So, all goes together, yes, with much respect for styles and professionals.
Not a long time ago, you've been 30 years old, you've got in crises?
But no.
I'm never feeling better, I like the idea of 30 years.
I find that women are mature and have a good experience to assess life by doing less mistakes.
Biological hours don't fear me.
I did the things I wanted from little, and this gave me much luck inside.
So you think to become mother, or not?
Of course, I know I'll be mother because I'm asking the same body and I also want to be a young mom, that I don't want to lose it.
As the candidate, I don't worry too much.
What I will do will give much luck to my son and educate it with very love.
With regard to the film, you're expected to escape in the various sales some films around the last year.
Just like that, and I'm much wanting to escape.
As a woman who comes from the theatre, I'm very inquiry and worried, I'd like all right and clearly, but it can't always be so.
I want to escape "the last hour" and "In the search for the tomb of Christ."
Let's see if they'll like you
A few days ago, you depressed the trail with Naomi Campbell, right?
Well, don't say that.
It's not that I've been on her as a model.
Simplely Naomi Campbell, which I know for a long time, called me to go to London to participate in a well-being film for his "Dan for a better world" and the apartments we chosen – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango - were sent to the assemblies to collect funds for this Naomi NGO.
People don't know this side of Naomi.
They say so many things about you, that I know her from a long date I can confirm you that they are not so real.
Furthermore, I find this good part in which you're involved.
He asked me to film for a noble cause, but if he asked me to make the plan, I would likewise do it.
If you're to help women from the third world, you can't go back.
Alcohol leaders must install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs requires that leaders with three administrative sanctions for overseas of alcohol in the blood, install the system which prevents the drivers of the vehicle in the state of cupity or if it is not in the device.
The measure was announced in the past June and already included in the annual report of the State General Procedure, which will be undertaken by a pilot project for a year.
The goal of this project is the reintegration of the leader, since this should frequent a road rehabilitation course.
In addition to the Strategic Safety Procedure, they will participate in the General Directorate of Trafficking (DGT) and the Technology Institute for Automobile Security (FITSA).
According to the statistics, between 30% and 75% of the cars reported more than one time for feasibility drivers then return to drive the car.
The alcohol would avoid it because it is a system linked to the vehicle which measures the alcohol rate in the inspired air and prevents the movement of the car if the leader is not sophisticated, or when a higher concentration of alcohol is identified than that allowed.
The cost is more than 1000 euros and would be loaded by the sanitation.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that the vehicles munited of such devices allowed to reduce up to 65% of the crimes committed during the first year of introduction.
And in Spain he calculates that he could save life of 115 people per year.
The measure is limited to the administrative sanctions for two reasons: to harm these behaviour before criminal crimes.
And to facilitate development, since legal reform can be carried out in regular ways, and, uncertainly, the necessary reform for the criminal procedure would require organic law.
However, the device is not yet available on the Spanish market in certain commercial solutions, even though it has already been entered into experimental ways in some industrial and public vehicles.
Tomorrow, the Deputy Congress will vote an initiative from the PSOE that is proposed to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico and without "peep-toes"
In the British point of view, at 17.40, the Spanish aircraft in which the Asturi principles were traveling in the presidency at the Benito Juárez Airport of Mexico.
The sun was overcoming, but the races still pressed to use the hand as a visa to see the real couple get out of the air.
At the foot of the playing, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
Some time before I asked a taxist, on the road, if he knew that the Spanish principles were to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Oh, very good, so you can't go to the airport to load people at that time... you're out of here or...
No, not sir, she's Spanish, but she lived here for a couple of years.
- Oh, very good...
The Mexicon print is very well known who are the principles of the Asturies and the importance of the journey.
Many are those who are waiting for the harassment of the airport slaughters and the military cordon combined by 27 marine soldiers who offer honor health.
The principle seems a surprise, clothed in the sea blue, and you, the princess, clothing to the wind, very sore, does not use its "peep-toes," may have told her that in Mexico's city was threatening bad time.
They make the photos a surprise and a short stop before passing into the room where the official commission is waiting for them.
Besides the door of the hotel where they stay, one of the four largers of the city, waits for them a hot spirit reporter of the mexican TV.
The best price offered by the mode
Probably there is no place in the world to present a model premium, which does not Paris and probably there is no more skillful and well-being in Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote international promotion of new talents in the mode.
Offers a price of $300,000.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, looked at his designs in Mango's beach number 54 of Boulevard Haussmann in Paris and almost mourned from the emotion.
Furthermore, it is the second store of this magazine in Europe and is just 1 335 meters of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, joined with the desire to please the Valentino stiptist who presided the jury of the agreement, began with a slight dinner at the Opera Garnier of Paris.
With the neighborhood of the most expensive televisions of Chagal, the presidency table prepared by Mango was still more spectcolate.
Nati, with the disgusting heart and with a powerful need, because of the recent death of his brother, has put a home and some ELAH complements to take the building and the arm of the son Luis - a boy of almost two meters of height - he joined Valentino to the presidency of the dinner.
Andik, owner and lord of Mango, has made the honors of the house and horses which has been finished, together with the Rotchil Barone, without shot, because they both had tried them to two ladys.
Monica Cruz, who has managed the store in pantalons and camicia – designed by his hand – was transformed for dinner, putting a long black clothes and emotioned during the night passed with Goya Toledo within the work, when they showed us the room for ballots, and she, remembering other times, had a bar and a "growder".
The Inés Saster hasn't stopped for the past in the palace places, but had shown us before his son's photos on the cell.
On the next day, we welcomed the presence of Olivier Martinez – another girl who moved in move - and John Travolta, who came to the intercontinental Hotel of Paris, with his lonzoles, his asylums and had been secured in front, that there were no pleasure in his room.
Stay under the stared sky of Paris.
Oh, there's life.
1001, the antistress number
There are no 1,000 but 1.000 and a way to forget the cootic and crazy life daily.
And as if it wasn't enough, all are collected in a book that will bring the relax in books on 30 September.
Sweetheart is almost a punishment when he scatters every morning at 7:00, but it's still worse to imagine to be involved in the floodm detained from modern life.
The office is called tension and the bad scene computer.
Stress is the badness of the XXI century.
However, there are no one and even two methods for combating daily education and the fact that we can get out of the world of work.
No, this number adds to nothing more and nothing less than 1001.
Besides the yoga positions, the classic mass or the "spa", Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of his book, all a "menu" options on measurement for hot and time for each one.
The anti-stress work is titled "1001 ways to release" and his quiet will reach books thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK editor.
If someone thinks it can't be acquired in ambitions such as the employment or in personal relations, this "manual" can be convicted.
Furthermore, it suggests alternative solutions, as to stay in contact with nature, or 100% of natural contributions to relation.
If the adrenalina is no longer in your coming to find the balance of the body and the stress has become a problem, it is the time to sit on the dinner, spread the mind and concentrate on reading.
Spring in the dream
Some kids speaking during the night.
I don't tell those who are watching very depressed to tell us something that happened to them the previous day, but those children who talk to stay sleeping.
The first time it happens, at least it takes a fear, but in fact it is not much important.
This is a kind of dream-defined dream.
It is shown with certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Surely, most of you told you that you were talking in the dream.
This phenomenon can be examined in very sporadial way (one in life, for example, related to a high febbre episode) or with a greater regularity ( every day, once a week, once in a month ...), the day after the child does not remember anything.
There is no one reason that can explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes there are episodes related to other dreaming troubles such as incontinents, nightpairs, night-term storms (fare the pipe at bed), or the sonnabulism, but it is not necessarily so.
As already mentioned in front, it can be related to stages of very high febbers, stress situations or surrounding.
In any case, it is a phenomenon still little studied.
The intensity with which it seems extremely variable.
It may happen that the person speaks with a very quiet voice tonn, with disappointed words, almost in a sussurrection or that happens to the contrary (only, cry, long talks ...).
In cases where the event is particularly intense, it would have to observe the child and eventually consult a specialist to check if there are some issues that are generating an ambiguous state as a foster to the situation.
We have said that this is a good alternative, therefore, there is no treatment unless it is related to other dream troubles that can be treated (e.g. if insonance or stress situation).
What you can do is, however, to take into account a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
To try not to get out of extremely the child before you go to sleep.
Propose quiet games and avoid programs or television series that arise fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for which it is fatic to be released, you can use technical relief to help them buy a certain internal calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more calm.
Once the songs were used to try to keep quiet.
Remember that they're inaccessible for the child and that the next day will not remember anything of what happened.
Used boards
Don't wake up.

You won't get nothing because it's sleeping and so you don't know to organize your thoughts.
Furthermore, you are able to hear what he says but not to see what he's dreaming to say, so we need to give much attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions to which they could bear.

Illhaeusers... Finally
Illhaeusern finally found the road of savings in the house after a long period of fruit.
Without playing a formable game, the Giallo-neri created the larger number of network opportunities, transforming one in the gap's winner.
The ritm was not very supported during this meeting in which the attackers expressed a fatica.
After a first attempt of the captain of the team of Kauffmann who shot the seven with a far off, the Illhaeusern began to have the best and one after another caused the defense of Dannemarie, Funderflick from far away, then Hirn high, Romein of point and still Diebold.
Dannemarie answered with a lock at the center of the field, left only Riahi's shot in an attract point.
The start of the second time was decisive with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporal for Danemarie, and immediately after the first Marais network for Illhaeusern, well placed, took a ball rejected on a first trial of Diebold (53).
But the Illhaeusern canonary won't appreciate his long happiness and will be extracted a duty of minutes after the left of his team companys in lower number.
But the Danemarie will not be able to approve it and won't cause great problems to the 11th of the Illhaeusern, notwithstanding the defence, except in the last few minutes of game when, after a Roombolese action, the ball flowed the past.

The movement moved towards the gates of the Atlantic Coast and Manica, such as Sables d'Olonne, in Venezuela, where fishermen remained at the mole, or in Havre, where a battle wind prevented the movement of trade boats.
The fishermen of La Tourballe and Croisic, at the Atlantic Loira, have interrupted the block of the total donges notice.

"I know that it will continue" because "the fishermen will not throw" and "I don't intend to spoil themselves to Paris", for example, Liliane Cariou, President of the Lorient Fish Committee.
Training fishermen, who do not pay oil prices, now pay approximately 50 cents at litro, but are estimated that the delivery of a boat is reached only with a gas oil lower than 0.30 euros.

Obama with advantage at the first televisional double
After the first debate on Friday between the two candidates in the White House, there was a second to know who between John McCain and Barack Obama was the winner.
Without any surprise, the general villages of the republic and democratic campaign have declared the victory respect of the TV dule, following a third of the American families.
The David Gergen poliologus believes that the performance of John McCain, although merely, was not enough brilliant to allow him to cut in the songs to five weeks from the presidency.
The Gallup Institute, which shows that the democratic has had the best.
A current sounding conducted by CbsNews on an independent elector campaign, noted that 39% of them believes Obama the winner, while 25% scores to McCain.
A good delivery by his list partner Joe Biden, waiting for the first and only debate with the Sarah Palin rival, should confirm the benefit of Obama on Thursday.
"Subvaluing it would be a mistake.
He has a good intuition, but he warned Bill Clinton this weekend.
McCain settlement has never stopped promoting its insufficient experience in external policy, stressing the adversary 'intensity' concerning the arguments addressed during the first face.
"The Senator Obama doesn't seem to understand that." He often declared to many repressions.
"I don't believe that Senator Obama has experience and the skills necessary to become President," he assured.
What from yesterday is a continuous beer for the republic television campaign.
Obama, from his song, emphasized as his election would represent a new future.
Without divorce, it has been demonstrated conscious and necessary.
He has proceededings to the right decisions and the intention of restore the picture of the United States on the global scene.
"McCain has never understood, against Obama," he reiterated, this weekend, a democratic spot, reproveing the republic of having not taken the necessary measures to face the financial crisis on the American people.
During the nine minutes of discussion, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, she declared yesterday Obama, before 200,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a battle rain, for a electoral meeting.

The two candidates have expressed the requests focused on the financial rescue plan of 700 billion dollars (470 billion euros) adopted yesterday the Congress and extremely impotent.
In Minsk, "Do you have a friend noticed that there were elections?"
Young and opposers demonstrated Sunday evening in the main pioneer of the Belarus capital to condemn the results of the legislation.
Some hundreds of whiteruss were gathered on Sunday after the closure of the electoral seats in the Central Piace of Minsk to protest against the fraudulent character of legislation.
While they were still waiting for the results, many young people came to demonstrate the power of President Alexandere Loukachenko: "the detator, dimissions".
Some are confessing that they have not even voted: "What for?" They will do what they will, of my vote," says a boy.
They don't believe that the regime which has made a beautiful figure before the external observers in order to re-entail dialogue with the European Union is ready to undertake a democratic process.
The sanctions, including the prohibition of 40 whitelors and the congelation of goods, may be removed if these elections were considered legitimately by the observers.
It wasn't, according to the opposition.
"We have been disappeared from the electoral committees and our observers couldn't participate in the voting spouse," was regretted Jouri Potemkine, bringing the Union of the Democratic Forces, an ethogeneous commitment of twelve parties.
"It is a fair change, emphasized by Alexandere Milinkevitch, former candidate of the opposition to the Presidents of 2006 and the pro-European movement headquarters, because the importer is who contains the cards and in this case is the excursion.
If Members of the opposition enter into the Parliament, it is because they have been appointed, and not elected.
But their entry in parliament can be a televisional space, regional meetings and law proposals."
The opposition therefore has the need to enter into political game because "he needs to start dialogue with the European Union.
Since our economy, which is severely in debt with Russia, enters into crises, and we do not make any reform, we're going to become a Russian protective.
Now we want to be independent.".
The opposition is that “the security organization and cooperation in Europe which has followed the electoral process recognizes the validity of the scrutiny.
Sublines that the participation quotes appear too high, and that the generalization of the vote in advance (26% of the electors in Minsk) has given the way to every type of manipulation.
"Do you have noted a friend that there were elections? Ask the social-democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the two last political prisoners released this year in August.
There was no one in the electoral scenes.
And there will be at least five Members of the opposition to Parliament, the most agreed to the power."
The night silence falls on October's pizza.
In television, President Luukachenko and members of the Central Electoral Committee are satisfied with their success.
Congress - The blood is safe again
The Hema-Québec celebrated yesterday the tenth anniversary of his foundation, and his President, the Dott.sa FrancineDecary, had all the reasons to rejoice, because Hema-Québec became one of the most safe and effective providers in the world.
And mostly, it has recovered the confidence of the public, seriously expensed from the scandal of infected blood in 1980 to 1990.
As we know, the national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Russian Cross Transfusion Service were infected by the virus of the acquired immunodeficiency (HIV) and the C eptate in 1980.
Besides such drama and protests of the population, the Government of Canada conducted a public investigation in February 1994, directed by the Judge Horace Krever, which aimed at lighting the circumstances they brought to such tragedy and to disseminate the recommendations to prevent reproportion of such disaster.
While the judge Krever was late to steal a report, some provinces had made a committee with the aim of ideaing a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, this mandate was carried out by the Genelineau Committee.
Following the reports of Gélineau and Krever, two providers were created in Canada: Hema-Québec to provide the Quebec and the Canadian blood Society (Canadian blood Scotia) for all the other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Hema-Québec started his own activities, when 38% of the people declared to grow still trust in the donations system in Québec, remembers the Dott.ssa Decary.
The situation was deadly.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of sanitary premiums and field research in the next years, we have recovered the public confidence before it explains that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of the Québec population had confidence in the Hema-Québec.
The Dott.ssa Decary is however convinced that "the trust is something extremely fraud."
Since its creation, on 28 September 1998, the Ema-Québec has applied the precaution principle.
At the same time, he assisted in Europe many cases of the human variant of the paça museum, a new manifestation of the Creutzfeldt-Jakob morbo, tells collares that are on the presidency since 1998, the year of the foundation.
"And we didn't know absolutely if that disease could be transmitted through infective blood.
It is therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, as if there are any doubts and could be a serious disease, in this case the Creutzfeldt-Jakob morbo that is demonstrated with a degeneration of the brain that is inevitable to death, they take exclusive measures.
In April 1999, the blood of those who had passed over a month to the United Kingdom since 1980 was rejected.
Now, some years ago, it was shown that this disease is transmitted through infective blood.
This episode has shown us so that he had the sense of applying the principle of precaution."
In 1999, a much more efficient Technical for the identification of HIV: the tests of the Nuclear Acido (TAN) which allow directly to recognize the presence of virus and not the anti-corps against the same, but the tests used until then.
The TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, or from the time that the person has paid the disease to which the first virus can be identified in the blood thanks to our technicians, it explains the specialist.
It was possible to reduce that period at a period lower than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and therefore not to identify them is so significantly reduced.
These improvements allowed considerablely to reduce the risk of anti-AIDS with blood transfusion.
Today, a person on 12 million uses the risk of receiving infected blood from the HIV virus.
"In other words, this means that it will be necessary to distribute 12 million blood campaigns before someone is infected by the HIV virus.
The Ema-Québec distributes each year between 400 000 and 500 000 sanitary campaigns, we will want more than 24 years before a case of HIV transfusion.
I think today you can feel quiet in receive or prescribed blood transfusion to recover health, says the Chief of the Hema-Québec direction.
"Our challenge for the next decade consists of maintaining the safety of our products.
You don't know what patogen is going to emerge in the system.
Not later a year ago, he appeared on the Reunion Island, the Chikungunya virus that, as the virus of the West Nilo, is transmitted into blood from an insecto.
It must be constantly vibrant," continued Dott.la Decary before stressing that the Hema-Québec has also to provide sufficient resources.
"The needs are increased because the old population.
As aggressive cure against aggressive cancer, patients are often needed to provide red globes or plastics.
The anticipation of the population also has consequences on the number of donors which are only 3% of the inhabitants of Quebec acceptable as donors."
All healthy persons who have done 18 years and response to the admissibility criteria, however, can give blood every 56 days or six times a year.
In average, 14 per cent of those who are offered as donors are not accepted because AIDS or malaria are killed, for example, and if they have traveled into a country where it is dispersed, they will be rejected for a period of equal to one year.
"In this 3% we can maintain an inventory capable of answering the hospital needs.
The cases of penuria are very rare.
But we need to renew the members of this donor group hands that they are old and they can no longer make donations.
Now it is difficult to convince people to give blood, but especially to keep them and to encourage them to become regular donors.
Today, life is so ruptic that is differently a hour to give blood," says the desolation of Francine Decary.
With an annual budget of 297 million dollars, the Ema-Québec distributes not only bloody campaigns, but also human tissue, such as oxen traps, ocular cards and skins that are almost used exclusively for serious uses.
These texts are analyzed, transformed and congeled before they are deposited at the Ema-Québec, which manages the only public bank of the Ombelical Cordon blood in Québec.
In the umbelical cordon, which once considered a biomedic lack, a abundant blood of staminal cells that can serve to curate serious diseases such as leukemia.
"We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the introduction in the bank of our thousand cordon blood campaigns and prevey for over a thousand every year.
The Dottt.ella Decary, which describes this practice of preliferation of cordon blood as very popular.
"Muchs moms are desperate that you couldn't have access", because the Ema-Québec has no needed means to propose this comprehensive and costful program in all the Québec hospitals.
Calcio - The Semi-final Imput
The Imput Montréal is qualified for the semi-final of the eliminators of series A, winning 3-1 against Seattle's Soners, yesterday, during a second decision-making part of the end quarters at the Saputo Stadium.
The campsite Antonio Ribeiro has given the decision-making goal to 90'.
After a first time without goal of both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino gave the following networks for the Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
Let's remember that at the first game of the west-to-side Friday, the Imput had a 2-1 smoke to the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, in the holiday of Seattle.

Saturday in Minnesota, the Thundler took a first 3-1 in the backing game winning 4-3, but whitecaps will take part in the semi-final.
The Imput must address the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed in the day.
In short - Decisive Network of Kovalev
Canadiens and his asses are ready to restart the season.
The three format by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and André Kostitsyn has encouraged the offensive game phase by winning 3-2 against Panthers, Florida, last night at the Center Bell.
Costitsyn, the star of the first meeting, gave a goal, made two steps, and collected a past for the rescue, in the fourth of the Hab's preparatory games.
Decisively, the only Kovalev network signed.
"I'm not yet ready, noticed the Russian.
I need another game to hear my gun."
"He tried to punish the first period, he noted Guy Carbonneau.
But I think she'd appreciate the out of the game.
There was a beautiful birth."
Northern Charter
The Prime Minister does not exclude the beginning of the elections before the end of the year.
The General Council of the Free Party, John Charest, held yesterday in Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new Minister of Health, Yves Bolduc, (left), tried to choose himself at the occasion of the partial elections today.
"Alarm the borders of our last North border," this is the long term ambition of John Charest, presented yesterday to Levis, through instruments of the strong visual impact, at the occasion of the Council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
After him, during his talk, the projetion of a kind of "Mulino on images".
On three masks, they founded negative spectrums of hydroeletric diamonds, mineral constructions, Quebec pictures with "Google Maps", cartine, etc.
Great means like in full electoral campaign.
During the printing conference, the first minister refused to exclude the start of the autonom elections, even though he noted that it was very involved.
The "North Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" which the first Minister claims to have for Quebec, a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on the handwork, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with the Institution.
Often nominated in the recent discussions of the First Minister, the opening of the North-South Territory to the 49th parallel -- was never subject to a presentation.
However, the first minister has been limited to explain why the north would be a "good of the large potential", but has not been declared on the temperatures or investment quotas, as he did not explain what the precise priorities will be in the achievement of future projects.
Moreover, it has been limited to report what is due to a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but especially the mining sector, which, following the growth of the emergency countries and the restructuring of public infrastructures, has experienced different improvements.
According to the list styled by Charest, the north contains "nikal, zinc, rain, platin, gold, silver, iron, titan, and even diamonds".
This large territory, the double of France, is here, is Quebec.
It is not only here, but it is insufficient in us," he insisted, as to want to make a half of national funder.
The foundations of Quebec are radiated in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold fever in Abitibi, national engineering, the Baia of James.
"Speat to us, it's our future," he added, after a theatrical suspension to view the cardinal immunity at his backs.
The North, 70% of the Quebec territory, including a part of the Labrator which the Quebec has always revealed, expressed the first minister during the printing conference.
"It is traditionally maintained by all governments.
There is a line of confidence on which it does not see any agreement for a long time and, when the opportunity is present, I will resume that position in the name of the Government," said.
On the other hand, in view of climate changes, we must re-evaluate the north," he stated by speaking of the Northern Western transition, which will be open for all year because of the disappearance of glass.
In this new geopolitical context, the first minister estimated that the territory is a debt.”
And the inhabitants of the place, the Prime Nations and the Inuit?
The first minister stated that the Quebec Government would be very careful in this regard and that the project would go to meet their interests, especially youths.
Two former ministers from different parties, Peter Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (ex-deputy of the PQ d'Ungava), have already given the journey to the consultation of a thirty community.
An interministery Committee presided by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Trade and Natural Risorses) is engaged in an important load of work.
The Prime Minister does not exclude a great meeting," not necessarily a summit, but a moment in which "the common visions will be provided"
North Development would remain on the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be " concerted, ordered and repair the environment," he promised.
John Charest described this "project" as a continuity with those of the first free ministers who have before it.
"After the freedoms that have before us, we know that we are different to transform the challenges in new opportunities of growth and development."
This was then one of the recurrent topics of the week end, which started on Friday with a great cocktail on honor of the 50th anniversary of the arrival of John Lesage head of the party.
One of the adopted resolutions proposed to rebate the Central Beauharnois in Diga Adélard-Godbout.
"To Godbout, the Creator of Hydro-Québec, at Lesage that nationalized the hydroelectricity in Bourassa, the Creator of the Baia James, our game has always heard for the future," said John Charest.
During the printing conference, it is called for another reference, conservator this time, the "Strade towards the North" by John Diefenbaker, first minister from 1957 to 1963.
In view of the project on the hydroelectricity diagram of Eastmain1a-Ruper, Charest stated that it would be planned for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I hear we'll do it," he confessed his militarys, making feeling applause.
In fact, the first Minister, who said in April, would not have been elected in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, has failed to start a self-reclaim, what could happen in accordance with the law.
It is certainly very engaged, particularly in a mission of the Federal Council in China and in the Quebec-New York summit.
The General Council of the week end has provided the free chapter a platform of national resolutions, particularly of the "Constitutional Aspirations" which are linked as oil: the PLQ is particularly recognizing the "specification of Quebec" in the Constitution.
It also hopes that the Quebec named the Council's members of the radiodividuation and Canadian telecommunications and that these last have a view to decisions taken in Quebec.
With regard to the opposition, the abolition of the North Piano has been sectically accompanied.
The leader of the PQ, Pauline Marois, repulsed the North Development Policy of Quebec launched by the Landry Government in 2001.
According to you, the free government in 2003 would not respect the application.
If it had been done, we would have progressed today" commented the Marose by the candidate of Jean-Talon (scrutiny arrived today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ stated that the North Plan was adopted by the Government.
"What we assure is that all this will not be simply overcome as a spectrum," commented the Leader Sebastien Proulx, Mario Dumont's substitute, at the same time from the holidays.
Letter - A Dishonorated country
It was Vic Toews, former ministry of the "Justity" (Ironia of the kind) of Harper, to allow himself to state, last summer, that Louise Boy was a "sound" for Canada.
In this way to encourage a woman who has fighted inadequately for justice, and that is the honour of all our appreciation says it so much about the environment of the first minister, both on the same Stephen Harper.
Here we are on the basis of a government that is the only one, among all the western countries that have not repatriated a citizen who has been detained in the Guantanamo concentration field.
A government who has nothing to consider Omar Khadr was a simple adolescent at the time when the facts have been paid.
The only government who, although has signed the Geneva Convention, refuses his own word and leaves a child-sold in inhuman terms.
The only one who trusts in a paradise of justice to establish the offence of the accused.
We remember, on a basis of information, that UNICEF, International Amnesty and the Canadian lawyers, in particular, call for the repatriation of Omar Khadraffin, where it could be submitted to a regular process in Canada.
It is opened the same government that closes the eyes of torture: it is very little interesting that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, perhaps after many years of suspicious surprises.
It is not yet aware of it, but we are assisting an unseen erosion of our rights, freedom and democracy, saying that Harper doesn't stop watching and sounding so stumbling on his lips.
Here we arrive at the time that there is no more moral: you can mistray, torture, impose arbitraryly a Canadian citizen according to the discretion of a ruler until today (and see what will happen after 14 October...).
Many electorists believe that a party which preachs the Virtual, the Customer of the Law and the Ordine represents the salvation: they do not see that this government has rejected what is the reputation and dignity of our country.
She's right here ashamed, Mr. Toews, in reply to all this, and nowhere else.
Free opinion - The orwellian talk of the Barrick Gold
In the edition of 17 September, Le Devoir published a letter by Mr Patrick J. Garver, Vice-President of the Canadian ministry company Barrick Gold.
Following an orwelliana logic, the last states that the world's greatest aurifary company has a trip for dissemination by six million authors against three authors and a small team editionary house, intended to start a "a transparent public debate".
If it is true that the judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth they judge, above all in the case of a trial for dissemination, but the law.
Without any surprise, this sustainable difference is fully hidden by Garver.
Since for the Barrick Gold, the best way to lead a public debate would be to the destruction of any person to support a contrary position to it.
It is little interesting that the outcome of the process, the writers and the book Canada Black will have to pay a cospicuous amount of money to organize their defence and fight, to decisively learn, against a military of lawyers funded by practically without the foundation of the ministry company.
On the other hand, the tactic is often to destroy the agreement in order to impose a consensual regulation which imposes the opposition beyond fear any bones to be spoken again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it is on the basis of the public opinion that it should have presented the vision of the facts.
In contrast to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, the debates are generally conducted with the exchange of opinions and not with manganilo.
It would therefore be sufficient that the company opened its books, documents, and established a true and own debate through daily, media, publications and financing of independent research teams that could be able to make light on the matter.
But Barrick Gold doesn't seem to have too much trust in the public opinion and reject the requests and letters to support the Black Canada authors.
Maybe Garver could explain how to ask a public debate " when his disappointment for the same public is clear?
In the world of the Vice-President, it seems that this word indicates exclusively the lawyers paid and not the whole of the Canadians; this is a very close vision of the concept.
In a democracy system, even denigrators have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold doesn't understand – or he doesn't want to understand – is that the public who supports the authors and editors of Canada Black does first because he rejects the brutal means adopted by the ministry company.
This public is ready to listen to Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civil opinion trade, and not on the acceptance of what many thinks like a kind of imbavation (reaching the "populated debate", the Barrick Gold just gave the authors of the Black of Canada a last intimidating them to suspend the use of that word...)
Besides the superreal discussion of Garver, the querela expires from Barrack Gold is an attack directly on the freedom of university research and the persecution of the truth, essential in every democratic society.
It refuses in block the right to quote authentic sources and the debate on facts and interpretations, which represent the same basis of intellectual work.
If in a country such as Canada is unable to study and discuss the world's finest arguments, many of the desires, who will do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could follow the scientific standards as the Black Canada authors.
He's right to replicate.
From long time, the university environment, on which we are part, is able to manage debates and disagreements and solve conflicts.
The extractive measures of Barrick Gold clearly show that it does not find a transparent debate.
This is going to be disappeared from the university world, as it is the same public debate in Canada, and it is now that governments take measures to limit the abuse desires.
Operation - Savings for Wall Street – Dialogue between republic and democratic
The Bush Administration and the Heads of the Congress, representatives of the republic and democratic screening, are finally coming to an agreement on the greatest health-finance plan after the Great Depression of the 30s.
The new version of the plan of 700 billion dollars, which is intended to make a bit to the financial crisis that is important for months on Wall Street, must still be ratified by the two Congress rooms.
It provides in particular: verifications on its effectiveness made by the leaders elected, new mechanisms guaranteeing the reimbursement of public money, new provisions to contain the number of loan houses for lack of payments, as well as a inspection law on reimbursements payments payed to the leaders of protected enterprises.
The American Secretariat to the Tesor, Henry Paulson, the President of the Chamber of the representatives, Nancy Pelosi and the representative republic at the Treatment table, Senator Judd Gregg, announced the good news after midnight, yesterday, at the end of a long treaty marathon two days.
"We have achieved great progress in view of an effective market agreement," said the representative of the Bush Administration, Henry Paulson.
"Each decision has been taken in such a way to protect the economy and the American people from the current crisis in Wall Street."
"It's the crucial point: if we hadn't acted in this way, we would have reversed the daily life of the Americans," said the republic Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the treaties was marked by concerns regarding the impact of a new failure on investors.
The agreed time limit was corresponding to the opening of the markets this morning.
In addition to the treaty, two candidates to the American Presidency have been highly favourable to the agreement, without to avoid expressing its inconsistent in front of the adoption of extreme solutions.
The Democratic Senator Barack Obama is the pleasant to add certain provisions to the agreement, particularly what will allow the owners to maintain their own home and the incentive to the reimbursements intended to leaders of undertakings covered by the State.
"When the contributions are requested to take extraordinary measures because of the independence of others, there is nothing to be happy.
But these measures are necessary," he commented on the American TV screen.
Another channel was interviewed to know if he will vote for the plan, his republic adversary, John McCain, answered: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope that."
"When I read, it's something that we all have to enjoy and let us go forward."
The option of a non-intervention is simply inaccessible", said.
The plan of 700 billion is intended to recover the money of dubbious credit contributions, risk activities and inventory of the American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crises due to the purpose of an ongoing bottle which first brought to the crown of hypothecary credits (mutui) and then extract other different forms of credit procurement (PCAA) and focus on the combustion of liquidity and the removal of banks and financial institutions.
It was a group of republics in charge to send the first project of an agreement last week.
It seems to be gone out of that blind vial since the democrates accepted that the active "toxic" of some companies in difficulties is only protected by the government instead of acquired.
In order to meet all the Congress, there was a provision that, if the Government should face losses during the five years in which it would be due to this programme, it could impose new rates in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan provides the expenditure of a first amount of 250 billion to which the President may add 100 billion if it is necessary.
The expenditure of 350 billion should be ratified by a further vote of the Congress.
In turn to its aid, Washington will receive participation rates in protected enterprises that will have the divisions in the case of profit and that will be able to return when water is calmed.
In accordance with the plan set out, the federal government will have the possibility of reimbursement procedures concerning real estates and to establish limits to reimbursement and starting indents to the leaders of the enterprises concerned.
From today, the architects of the plan would like to submit him to the vote of the Chamber of Representatives, and to the vote of the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all efforts, it is not yet sure that it's given the free way to their plan.
In fact yesterday, there have been different votes against the project, both at the revolution and democratic screening.
"Otherwise, Washington does not feel," said he referring to his electors the republic Scott Garrett, a member of the Camera's Finance Committee.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yeah, there are solutions.
But it is not likely to approve the contributions.
Leader of a small group to the Congress above called "the cocks of the scepters", the democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation in different ways, but it reaches the same conclusion.
"Five hundred leaders of economic professors, including three Nobel Premis, have written us to say: "We ask the Congress to not bring the conclusions undertaken and to consider with attention the way to take" said yesterday.
At the same time, in Europe, it was once again assisted to the evidence of the global nature of crisis.
After an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the Part Nationalization of the Fortis Banking Group for 11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French BNP Paribas had known that it would notice the acquis of its concurrent, in full delay after the loss of EUR 2 billion (2.9 billion) for the crisis of real estates to risk in the United States.
Fortis has 85,000 employees and is part of the 20 larger banks in Europe and the ten largest insuranceers.
"It is not the lost money, he stated yesterday the Dutch Minister of Finance, Wouter Bos.
Instead, the right of vote in bank matters are affected.
It's certainly something that the owners and families appreciate now that time is announced incertain."
During this period, on the other side of Manica, the British government seems to nationalize another budget bank for financial crisis.
According to the English printing, the government would be charged by the whole of the loans currently carried out at the Bradford and Bringley Bank, which exceeds 41 billion (75.5 billion) of an inmobiliary payment.
The spanish Santander bank has known yesterday that you will buy successors and customer accounts from the British Bank.
From the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank after Northern Rock to submit a nationalization process by the English government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a detained icon
The beauty of the eye was for a long time his ass in the hand, for others his weak point.
Was he released from the narcistic spectrum, the American actor from the immalizer sorrow?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and the appearing talent would drive him out of that round of powerfully dedicated to the truths and his holy monsters.
But what costs!
Paul Newman, lost Friday, in the age of 83, in his part of the Connecticut, after a cancer to the pomone, remains one of the latest icons of the American film of the recent years.
Brando's monumental melo, to whom he assembled and was a kind of rival on the screen, more careful in his game, certainly more fraud, but also he led the freedom and development of dramatic convictions.
The mixed couples often bore magic children.
He was born in Ooio in 1925, from German father and Hungary mother.
From these European roots, one of the glorious views of the American dream will be born.
A humble, last quality mark.
Since it was recognized in all a reinforced country of the safe man, of the Pacific war war, fiery in the fight, which at the beginning of the 50s he studied drammatic art in Yale, then frequently the Actor Studio in New York, before triangling to theatre, television and fast at the film.
The same military man for civil rights was also the automobile pilot, which was classified according to 24 hours of Mans in 1979, as well as the sex symbol, although part of a couple of models from 1958 with the Attorney Joanne Woodward attorney.
If you go with him the shadows of a reserved star, discretated, engaged, allergic to the scandals of the show-business, which will never be able to fully see the mystery.
A honest man, in the most noble sense of the term.
This weekend, Paul Newman's disappearance was a heart tuff, while his great people have the black screen of memories.
Another half century of American film in full transformation is reproposed through its interpretations.
Butch Cassidy(1969) and that boy is not able to want the focosa wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in La gatta on the teat that was customed by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we remember it in the couples of the sensable Mr. Bridge (1990), arrested by a marriage that did not keep the promise.
So many other Paul Newman were going to the story.
The Rocky Grazian, defendant, tormented, violent, unemployable in Lassú someone loves me, from Robert Wise, a role designed to James Dean after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
This lifeful symptom in Stangata, Oscar as best film in 1973.
The color of the money of Martin Scorsese is the only 9 appointments in 1987.
That face through the years was her.
He's still.
The times shot through his path.
The young people know it mostly for the Slap Shot-colpe film, George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, a bucket team on a little orthodox glass team.
His fans found it in 1994 in Mr Hula Hoop, the brothers of Coen.
The scene was closed with a last role of the Irish Mafia Mafia in 2003.
At the difference of the most legend levels of the film who soon left the mixture, Newman will remain long in the sales, declared Hollywood in all its skills, festivals and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, French cinemaster, defined it, with a point of Ironia, "a vital challenge to the surprise," judged his performances.
Professional wasn't always a beauty Paul Newman game, with which the wheels seemed to fall as a man off the sky.
However, he often prefered the role of the enlarged to the young actor: neurrotic persons, disappeared or disappeared, of which he expressed sbling and refusal with his perfect treaties.
As a government, Newman revealed the uncertainty of his true, puddle sensitivity.
The first time of Jennifer, in 1968 (based on the Romance of the Canadese Margaret Laurence), with the wife Joanne Woodward in the protagonist role, had a female retract in melanconia.
He, who lost the son Scott for an overdose, dedicated him in 1984 the Harry and Son film, discreet and triste films.
Among the innumerable disappearances in Newman, his great friend and old army friend Robert Redford (who had been receiving together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) said with infinite tristeness" His presence made my life and this best country."
Generity and love for life, two large characteristics of the lost actor.
On the other hand of a legend carrier, a great military for civil rights, ecology, independent film, a contestor of the Hollywood derivative.
We've seen his face to look on oil bottles, salts, biscuits and other foods, in order to judge her a bad choice of sweet, although she was born as gig.
However, income of those sales were designed to its Children's Fund for Infant In difficulties.
Newman, instead of acting on his half, chosen to take business until the end.
He left his five daughters a letter that he said" Always and until the end, your father was incredible recognizing his good star.
It was a privilege."
And other privilege was for us to follow the path of a so clean and generous American artist.
They are the model, so, and much more.
What has been produced in the manufacture of supples & social factories?
In a little while, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal process against János Zu adjudication and partners will be discussed.
Political man and its partners are accused of reiterated trade faults committed within a association to defence which caused considerable damage, and other faults, including falseification of documents.
According to the Procura, the money received from concord bands was used for private purposes and often certificated the performance of the activities by false facts.
The state and municipal money, in total 65 million flowers, is completed partly in the cases of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly in the tables of some people.
According to the method, noted by the applicant authorities, they have taken the money received from agreement bands based on factors for non-existed operations and the associations have never fulfilled the obligations made.
According to the most accused act, it was false.
In order to do it, the factory blocks were purchased on the market of Józsefváros, the circumstances have been manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of whom you say to eject the factors, it was established during the hills between the hills above the Balaton, where János Zurag had sent Istvan Lados.
According to the confession of this, he had to choose pensions and restaurants.
It asked for consumers, on the model of these then, the facts have been prepared to incorporate the agreement bands, among others, to those of the Ministry of Youth and the Sport, the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs and the Budapest Commonwealth.
Most of these are the work of István Lados and Andrai ◆ri which, according to our information, has developed particularly the needed relations to obtain funding.
One of the elections of Lados's "vice studies" was a birth.
According to the two shipments carried out by Zuhelp and partners in 2003, the reservoir place was held for a group of 90 people from the Society Pont Egyptesület.
But so many people, as said the restaurant, would not enter together together.
Likewise, the factory emitted in the spring of 2002 to Jobb Jövërt Foundation, after name Egypt, to Harmadin Evezredért, spot of formal and content errors.
A pension of Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people couldn't stay at us, however, 130 guests were present.
But the complaints of the full fashion factors have expressed when they reported the Pigal Kft., also this is booking, where accountability - according to the information issued by the judicial authorities - did not even contain the documents on behalf of Jobb Jövërt and Hoppá.
Gyz月 Farcas, the company's administrator, declared hvg.hu that when he was summoned and showed him the facts, he immediately understood that it was false documents.
"Our name and the Iva of our company were in a wrong point."
She added: Besides the formal reasons, he didn't even return the fact that, according to the performance, there were hundred people, when they totally have 11 rooms and there are no so many bedrooms.
At the same time, it was a restaurant and their restaurant is no longer functioning.
The complementary officers have not been concerned to inform that Budapest's travel agencies from their choice, organize only foreign travels, so they have deeply indicated the fact that payment in accounts in travels in Hungary, which did not agree with the practice of emissions of the company.
Furthermore, as shown during the investigation, it also included Iraq, while the travel activities to countries outside the European Union was absent Iva.
In addition, the amount of Eva was wrong on four documents issued by Hotel Rev Plenpp Kft. For the foundation of Jobb Jöv月ért, in fact on services offered by the company should apply to Iva to 15% and not 25% as indicated on the facts, also the hotel's employees had only been printed, while the manufactured factory was written by hand.
Furthermore, the "emitteners" have destroyed other factors, in the case of a report, they have indicated the activities carried out by the transport of goods on road, as it has been known by the Procurement Procurement, activities which were not carried out by the company originally for investment advice.
Furthermore, for formal disadvantages - cause not compliance format, false title - was discovered that the factors emitted for Egypt in Harmadik Evezредt Alapítvány, of XXI. Culturallis Egyptesület and Biztos Pont are false.
The same occurred in the case of the Ravenna Bt. or the Sports Camp of Kofehertó, whose representatives refused to have emitted the facts concerned.
The falsificators did not even give attention to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyiregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) had prepared a group of Fiatal Városert Egyptesület, exactly for this, the curator of the liquidation of the product, according to our information, refused to have emitted him that faction.
They have emitted factors as well
Another group of factory emisors is consisting of those who were understood to be equipped with fitness.
The Esély Budapestert Alapítvány has issued a factory on the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Sijú Szozialisták for the Egypt Foundation to Harmadik Evezredért of almost 4 million flowers.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the imputants, according to the accused act, injured the Director of Collab Kft. to eject fitness.
It also cooperated together with Zuhelp and partners with the Biogate Kft in liquidation, which in 2003 provided factors for a value of approximately 5 million flowers to the foundation Jobb Jöviert Alapitvány, the Association Atlasz Egyptesület and the Association Vörösfeny月 Egyptesület, which there was no real economic activity.
Even money movement, because the prepared factors were then disappeared, but the associations were forgotten to draw this appearance in their documents.
In the next group of these grants are those that are binding with the imputed.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized to the director-General of Delta Trió Kft, with a seat in Budapest but not repersible there, which is occupied of fuel and car trade.
This has issued several factors in October, November and December 2005 on sale of information media for a value of approximately 18 million flowers.
According to the data of the investigation Cash Investment Kft. from Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 has bought these factors.
The Director-General of this report was a ruin which between 2002 and 2005 Ivan Kubatov would include the documents concerned.
As we know, during the survey, Kubatov recognized that he had released factors on behalf of the company to the Atlasz, Hopá and Egyptians in Harmadik Evezredért Alapitvány and the counter value was taken by him.
On the request of Ivan Kubatov, Roman murders founded the Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, there was no one of the assumptions, because they had not received a job according to the amount.
However, the enterprises have returned useful because, on request of the lawyer Zsolt Szente, a editor of companies funding documents, on behalf of these companies have been issued to the associations related to Zuhelp: the Atlasz and Y-Generati.
On behalf of the company Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov has released 15 factors for a total value of 14.2 million flowers.
The practice believes that Kubatov has affected 10% of the amounts indicated on fats, and Iva.
The man also used the Sci-Beri Bt. for emitting fitnesss, manufactured for the concord band of Biztos Pont.
Y-Generéled and Szövetség in Modern Magyarországetet in January 2006 presented a band for the public use of the Socialist Party, Tancs Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also gained 500,000 flowers, but the sums were not used for the purposes indicated in the band.
As soon as it didn't come to galla, they presented to the TMA five performances received from Works Team Kft.
These factors were found during the survey of Arpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Public Education.
In the hearing, a part of the employees, as they already have done, will probably refer to the changing of the production of the fats.
Although the most interesting thing could be if the interested number one, János Zuhelp, would decide to cut the vessel on all.
His confession hasn't been very detailed and even though she has promised more times to talk about everything in extreme way, he has not yet done it.
I should see whether it is in his interest, may also say that socialists have taken agreements with Zusi, which - instead of an estimation of 50 million flowers, a large part of the damage - would have been prepared to make the explosive hair.
It could also be offended that his requests for the allegation of his prison terms, i.e. the concession of home arrests, have not been found until an examination.
While the trade unemployment authors and greater damage can freely pass through or at least wait at the end of the proceeding against them, what is not granted to him.
The psychology of the super litigator: Why do you pay more money?
The purchasers are supposed to pay more, to overcome the money.
Neurological and economic researchers in the University of New York have been able to discover the neuro-economic bases of this well-known and apparently irrational.
According to their study appeared on the Science magazine, men do not want to stay back in a jail as an eBay stock, so they are also available to pay a higher price.
The research has tried to throw the nervous scheme of this "partite" at the level of the nervous system through these experimental experiences.
A group of volunteers played the lobby, the other group of players participated in an asshole while the functional magnetic rejoicing method (FMRI) examined the active areas of the brain of participating in the experience.
In both games the participants could win money, but in the acta game, where the substance element is to lift more than another, the body stretched under the cerebral cortek is intensely in function when you lose the game.
This cerebral area, above all other functions, plays a role in the "autogradation" mechanism of the nervous system.
So, according to the researchers, the relevance of the price is explained with the scanning of the vessel reaction of the strike body.
In order to support their theory, the economics of the Research Group have conducted a financial investigation.
In this survey, three groups have been forced against a partner in different circumstances.
The control group reported how the real value of the product concerned was and they made their point.
To another group above this, they promised that in the case of winning they will receive another $15.
Instead, the third group would receive $15 before the stock, but the members of the group would lose the money in case of loss of the asset.
The difference between the two groups was that for one of them was underlined the victory and the other was lost.
Taking into account the neurological hypothesis, members of the group playing "for loss" were ready to make higher points of the control group or "venant".
"These results are not allowed from any of the previous economic theories.
Indeed, this has explained the relaxable phenomenon with the joy of winning and avoiding the risk.
Only the methods of creation of the neurological image have helped solve the contradiction between the two theories, so that we're coming to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, professor of the Economy of the University of New York.
Epatite: When do you tell your doctor?
Six half billion people in the world suffer chronic hepatitis B or C, in Hungary, among the first causes of death are mentioned chronic hepatic diseases.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis diseases is a hundred thousand, of these are only 7000 cured: the reason is that many patients do not know that they are contained.
The hepatitis definition is the collective name of contagious hepatic diseases caused by various virus.
There are many summits between symptoms, typical are the epidemic and iterazity, but their patogenic agents and diseases differ each other.
Epiatite viruses are divided in two main forms of the Patogen agent: Epathite A and E through food channel (e.g. infective water and food), epidemite B, C, D and other blood viruss and organic liquids (sperma, vaginal losses, salt).
For those travelers it is useful to be vaccined against virus A and B, the C does not exist.
The symptoms of the epitite A include two-third weeks after the consumption of infective food, accompanied by general malice, weakness, addominal and nause pain.
After they form the jailettes on the hair and the white of the eyes, I made them become clear and the dark urin, the wheel comes within two-third weeks.
One million people die every year in the world for epothete B, the most serious variation of disease, which causes tumors to feed and hepatic cirros.
The main reason is, according to the estimates, that only one person on ten receives a pharmacological treatment.
The epite C may also have very serious consequences: if it is not healed, can cause hepatic and tumor cirros to the feed.
Most infected people do not know that they have patogenic agents have destroyed hepatic cells, in many cases the first symptoms after 20-30 years.
So it is very important for the prevention and effectiveness of regular medical analysis.
This disease is much more often than three groups: who had blood transfusion before 1991, toxicdependents and tatutes.
In the world today, the number of people infected by the chronic epothetic virus C is 200 million.
Since a review of routine laboratory is also revealed by the illness of the penalty relating to family doctor when it is noted any unknown symptom of origin.
At the time recognized disease is curable, virus can be removed from the body, so stops the infective power and can be preved by the formation of tumors.
On 30 September, it is the worldday of the epotite, organized for the first time in 2004 by the world of diseases.
The goal is to call attention to the viral chronic epothetics, the cause of its development and the precoce recognition of disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the result of a recent investigation, religious faith works as a species of analgetic that has made more sustainable death of Catholic martyrs.
The scientists of the University of Oxford have performed an interesting experience, considering how faith in God affects the feeling of pain, reported the British Telegraph.
A electrhock on 12 Catholic believers and other attractive attractions was carried out, while all observed a pic that reflected Mary's female.
On the basis of the results, Catholic believers were able to reject the great part of the pain.
Thanks to the experiencing technology of the human brain was discovered that the catholics were able to active the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first of a series of research in which the accidents also take part in scientists, philosophys and theologists of the University.
The test has been done exactly so: a tool that ejects downloads and passs the electroshock has been connected to the left hand of the experiment object.
The researchers asked the participants to concentrate on two tips, the female Mary's spy in the XVII century from Sassoferrato and the Dame with the hermlin of Leonardo from Vinci dipined in the XV century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the female Mary originated a kind of religious status between the believers, while the framework of Leonard was chosen because he was not too different from others and they thinked that it was quiet.
The experts have passed average hours before MRI scanner, and in this season 20 electrhocks in four consequence series, while they watched or looked at religious or others.
The Catholics reported that the vision of the marriage Mary made them feel "series", as if anyone would take care" of them and "we were calmed and they were lost from peace."
Looking on the religious topic image, 12% in less pain than when they had the work of Leonardo before him.
The psychologist Miguel Faria, who took himself to the test, believes that a similar result can be reached with any image from the strong effect of the athletes, however, needs to find the adapted image.
"We need to look for an image on which they felt very positive feelings, like a mother or a father," he said the psychological.
The Anglicano Tom Wright Eve welcomed the result of the search.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it can change our personality." - He added Wright.
After the opposite results, it remains only if the question is presented to believers is the character of a madonna of Leonardo or another painter of such calibra, which might have the effect on the control of pain?
The vision of a virgin Maria of quality would have better results?
You're what you say about yourself.
On the tenth full year, Google can say to be found so much in the tables of people as in heaven above their tests; know where they have passed the holidays, which ambulatory frequently and what he interests.
This, however, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the directors of the dict, is not yet enough.
Instead, what is about the skicks that do a paragon with the orwellian incubo, they do not see the substance of the web 2.0.
Recently Eric Schmidt declared the Financing Times that Google's main goal is to collect the number of more personal data of their own users and that is necessary to take attention to the original goal of Google founders that was: "We enter all the information in the world!".
According to the Director of Google interviewed the report, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning to manage all the information.
On the question what will happen within five years, Schmidt answered: if Google would like to answer questions as "What am I doing tomorrow?" or "What would the work suitable for me?", but the software do not know respond to simply questions because they don't know enough users.
Not all internated persons are aware that their Internet search is registered exactly the words searched, from which IP addresses are searched, and on which pages the interests are stopped after the search.
By personalized Search starting two years ago, users can record their browsing history, they may concern what they searched and clicked, then they will go forward results on very better measure; on this logic is based on recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our declarated and registered preferences.
What happens if my data are used against me if they look at what I care? - The users concerned about Google's data monopol.
In most of the cases the contradictions of the internal persons are caused by fear tested for the size of the potential power represented by the present , and not for the sense of the fault, for the fear of the punishment, for the desire of freedom or adjudication to power.
However, a fact is confirmed and that all the expressions searched are not only registered but in motivated cases can also be provided to third parties, in such jurisdictions, there is nothing to defend personal rights of internal.
The most explicit example of this in recent times has been the coordinated action against the pedofils of Brazil, in which Google introduced the Brazilian government information that made the identification of pedofils from the Google community.
Instead, international concerns for personal rights have resolved in May when the report - agreed with the electronic legal association EFF - has proved successfully the truth in the court against the FBI: nevertheless then you can go to Google with any point of the constitution to provide any information requested by the FBI secretly.
(In the same time, the Federal Government has successfully encountered approximately 50,000 website addresses and thousand search expressions obtained in terms of the confirmation of the Child Protection Act adopted years before, but it has not been able to get the lists of individual users and the whole list of web pages and key words rising for two months.)
So Google's judgment is rather contraditary: those who fear to provide their personal data to Google because they believe that so will be intacted their immense challenge and private life starting to use their services and have to be reproached by the multinationals that look for the conservative image.
At the same time, the American geek culture and the proliferation of appssionates, actives and computer users shared in many countries see the future generation of the great disasters, the "cool corporation", otherwise of their rival, the Microsoft is liquided as a competitor of the world because of Windows, for both of them fighting for the same objective.
This may happen because Google, on the difference of Microsoft, does not ask his users a identification code, does not ask money for your services, the source code always updated and the software package is much more accessible, young and cool of the official software coloss practice.
But it may also happen because geeks see exactly the problem between personal and Internet rights, which involves exactly one of the key words that are more often repeated in the last years, the web 2.0.
The web 2.0 does not speak otherwise than the collaboration, to leave intentionally traces behind us and to use the communication channels to our disposition and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: show us.
A young medium can create profiles in more community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can connect you with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists your musical guests, all these can insert them into systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, you can also write blogs that are automatically appreciated by its recent photographs on Flickr or Picasa.
So we read many examples from which it is clear that the girl, when seeing the series of photos issued in the morning from the common round of friends, it is easy to know with those who have passed the night his boy or a question can license a person who has written a sincere opinion on the top of the company: one thing is safe, the concept of private life now has been fully revealed.
He who lives an on-line life makes a way to show himself and so we can formulate the fundamental threshold that is hidden behind the behaviour of young people.
Instead, who wants to hide something or just wants to avoid Google's monopolio can do it (e.g. with Scroogle using Google searching system but that at the same time does not leave voluntary traces).
There are no few those who are not registered from proposed on community pages so that they can not be found, Google's online applications, the processing of tests to the management of images and the collection of news, you can replace other non-related server parks and that do not comply with our best profile until now.
Public opinion is not even waiting for a secret time when Google will get out of the arts.
Currently, the company with its 156 billion dollars of value is more than IBM (140 billion dollars), the hotel (124 billion dollars) or the Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), the AdWords/AdSense public spaces threat the introductions of public agencies, the recording services cause large famines not only to Microsoft but also to numerous software developments.
However, critical observatory observers were found by all this: for example, the company's top has completely rejected the protest of employers after raid the right of the company's business asylum, has considered too costfully the repeated restoration to enjoy daily employees, but this has reduced the fact that in 2006 Google has given the Chief to the Chinese government and in the sense of their agreement, this will filter all the results that cause the good goat and the interests of the Chinese regime.
An internal regulation of the present seems to be not to publish a new service in advance but only when it is useful, a thing is sure that the preventive problems of the next months and years will move the world in a point: while some think that the project of scanning and books and revised books and Google will take proportions of those that will soon be found before the Supreme Court of America, others have fear of the health system, defects in this we can create our health profile with our references, medicals and problems.
The fact that Google is built by a genetic database can provide good material to the next generation of fantastic writers, the book Scroogled of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with orwellian agents, in which a man with Google's data can be drawn up in a slightly way.
Two minors helped the double murder of Uzd to destroy the traces
The police asked two minors concerning the dual murder of Uzd, suspected with the foundty that he had helped to destroy the crime traces, and he stated on march the Port of the Police of the Costure of the Borsod Region.
The young people have recognized their complaints, now they are accused of favour.
Two young girls, according to MTI information, are defended freely.
The favorite is punishable to 5 years of conclusion.
The suspicion of the double murder of Ozd, a man of 23 years from the place, Sunday was detentioned.
It's suspected of pre-medied pre-misemily murdered at the purpose of lucro.
The investigation resulted in that the young ventrine had a great debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect wouldn't want to raise the debt, for this mercury reason he took his creditor with a liar in a song of Ozd where he killed him and the daughter of 9 years.
According to the MTI information, the young man was prepared to commit crime, a signal is the fact that he made murder with a hidden arm on the place.
The police is being examined by the arm and the circumstances of the use involving a expert.
The Borsa of Varsavia offered a offer for the purchase of the Borsa of Prague
The Varsavia Borsa values offered 200 million euros, approximately 5 billion Czech coron, for the acquisition of 100% of the list of actions in Prague.
Ludwik Sobolewski, President of the Borsa of Varsavia, confirmed the advanced offer from the pools, despite the cups, had previously excluded the Varsavia Borsa as possible purchaser of the Prague Borsa.
The reason of exclusion is that the Borsa of Varsavia is of the state.
The 99% of the actions are in hand to the pool state which is intended to sell more than 60% of its titles.
The Czech financial daily E15 states that the offer of the polars represents the highest figure to the Borsa of Prague.
According to the Czech printing, they have offered the Borsa of Vienna, the Nasdaq Transatlantic Borsa, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Borsa and the German Borsa.
Peter Koblic, Director of the Borsa Value of Prague, declared last week that the Borsa of Varsavia would be the worse owner and didn't exclud that this could lead in the future to the closure of the Prague Borsa.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Borsa in 5-10 billion corone.
According to the Agreement of Actions, approximately 90% of the holders would be sold.
The most owner of the Borsa of Prague is the Patria Finance with a quote of almost 25%, followed by the Bank ◆eská Spioitelna by 14.7% and the Tiger Holding Four S.r.l. by 13.5%
Economic crisis from the view of European journals
The main European newspapers in their martday comments dedicated to the international economic crisis have already spoken of "one on 11 September".
The global financial disaster has been made thanks to the American President - the accused of the Republic - which was not able to complement its party behind a law deprived in all speed, which is the goal to return to a desperate situation.
Besides a second Pearl Harbour, as the superfinancier of Warren Buffett said, would be more accurately talking about a second on 11 September.
Also a part of Madrid's printing can see the scrutiny cap in Washington.
According to the World, the lack of American political leading has thrown the global economy on the baraster orange.
The risk of the American financial system is increasingly more and more and more and more. This will suffer the whole world later.
The Bush Plan was not perfect, but in the congress vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political means for crisis management.
World economy is understood in air, even when it is running the greater transformation of capitalism history.
It is no longer possible to translate the threat - reach the Ginevra's day displayer.
Some States today can still offer a rescue chamber to the barculated financial institutions and the money of the contributions can be saved from the failure.
However, if any more banks are crolling as in a dominant effect, then there will be no longer enough financial means or new immediate solutions.
In long term, the Member States of the European Union should overcome their national egoism and concentrate the control of the financial markets.
On Monday, unlimited financial institutions have obtained more than 100 billion euros - remembering the Viennas The Standard, which always seems to be more real of the concerns that also the European contributions, such as the Americans, will have to put their own portfolio to the crisis.
The EU has not so much worried about the crisis that has overcome the old continent as a tsunami.
The "salvators" should not immediately disappear the 100 billions of euros, but it would be better if it would be necessary to touch the money of contributions to prevent larger damage.
The intelligent car follows the flight of the heat
What could be the best method to develop anticolization technologies if not seem to the sensors of the obstacles that are in nature?
For example, the pillars.
In the surprise project presented to the CEATEC in Japan, the Calabrons gave the initial strategic spectrum to the engineers Nissan on how to build the next generation of anti-trategic systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the BR23C biometic robot, an early robotized mini-rolled mini-motor of the owners, with the final purpose of creating a system in order to scann all collections.
The skins are a very personal space that is really very close to our protective scene - has explained the Kazuhiro Doi exhibition, director of the PR and research and development sector.
Important is the role of the view of the ape, capable of a visual of 300 degrees in each direction.
The engineers have touched the telemetric idea to copy the function of the view of the aper.
The BR23C recognizes the obstacles to two metres of distance within a race of 180 degrees, calculates the distance and sends a sign to the microprocessor immediately transforming it into a command to avoid the collection.
In a section of second, the robot has the ocean and then, following the aper movements, change immediately directing the routes of the necessary measure to avoid the accident.
This evitation manual, in a different way from the current system, is conducted in a way of the entire institution.
"If it wasn't so the robot car could not react rapidly to avoid collections" - explain Toshiyuki Andoh, Director of the Laboratory Mobility and the robot project.
It must react in a sense and immediate way because this technology corresponds to the damageable and inner path of the protective shopping, within which the collection is currently considered inevitable.
All the process must reflect what a pit is doing to avoid the other pics.
This process should be followed in an eye batter.
But at the difference of the pillars the deviation cannot go to the high or lower or diagonal, it can only be bidimensional and in the direction of the rocks sterility.
In that way the infinite opportunities to be available to scanning the other pillars, the robot, as an available opportunity, can steal on himself, accelerate and filled.
BR23C is foodd by battery to litio polymers, more read and higher density of energy, which means that their duration is higher than the litio irons.
According to Andoh, it is important that the intensity of the intelligent reaction, not the processing of data or even less the ability of impressing them.
This robot must develop some inputs in a few seconds and react.
You don't need to remember them and react with intuitive logic based on previous manual data, so use only a few tens of Kb's memory.
There is no need of gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards the development of a technology for immediate avoiding collections, which, before Nissan, will be installed within 10 years later on series vehicles.
Additional opportunities for application may be represented by the unification of the GPS satellite navigation system that prevents the obstacles present on the road leads to destination.
They also found the name to the costful child
The written version of the Economic Rescue Law by $700 billion for the acquisition of funds, to apply in more parts.
In the first step the half of the sum is expensed.
In the new proceeding agreements to midnight of sabbath day, according to the hour of the East Coast, the leaders of the Congress decided the rescue plan of $700 billion after a debate that had been held for days - she reported the Reuters.
We have made a series of steps forward - said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Chamber's Democratic Chamber of American Representatives, as it was left only to put the agreement on paper.
Both candidates to the presidency, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise of the plan.
The Minister of Tesoro Henry Paulson, speaking about the result of the compromise, said: The program will work and will be effective, but there is still much to do. According to Pelosi, it is not the rescue of Wall Street but the investment of the economic carrier.
The written version of the plan was published before the opening of Asian markets at 8 after the hour of Washington (the 2nd Monday after the hour of Central Europe), but did not have great growth of bottles.
Monday, the Chamber of Representatives will vote for first the draft defined economic stability law for 2008 concerning the programme, after he will touch the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke on Saturday with Pelosi, then welcomed the news of the agreement.
We are satisfied about the progress reached by the night and we appreciate the efforts of the two parties to stabilize our financial markets and to defend the economy - said Tony Fratto Portable of the White House.
The programme, however, differs from the original proposal of Bush administration, which was intended that 700 billion dollars would be paid for the acquisition of tariffs with funded credits.
Now as the first step will be paid to the maximum average of the amount of $700 billion, 250 billion immediately after the vote of the Congress, with these, the Minister of Tesoro will buy tits with credits provided in the backs, the type of the remaining 100 billion dollars will decide.
A special colleague will control the programme to which the President of the Federal Reserve also takes part.
The cost of the other half of 700 billion depends on a new decree of the Congress.
In accordance with the law, the Minister of Tesor can apply a combined tactic: you can buy credits, hypotheses and tits with hypotheses and other types of credits " developed".
The purchase can come through this and directly - have announced the department's responsible.
The legal standard makes it possible to take part in a programme of insurance where the Minister of Tesoro guarantees the means that cause concerns, for which companies will pay an appropriate price to the likely damage.
Henrz Paulson said: the law gives the necessary means that 700 billion dollars comes for the urgent needs of the American monetary system, which is treated by the purchase of wrong financial means, or their insurance or to avoid the risk of a great financial institution.
We will make all the steps necessary to find us ready to introduce the law soon signed - he added.
The bank directors in crises and at the expectation of the State aid believe that the government will limit their well-determined outcome, just as gold paracadutes.
The limits of payments will only be in some cases, too, depend on the basis of the ministry of the Tesor's assistance.
The restriction means that if the ministry buys in the terms of an asset, it shall impose a supervisor on the gold paid, if they do not send the decayed bank director.
At the time of the acquisied credits, the Government will be aggressively interfered in order to ensure that the funds of directors are not expensed.
This will be added that the existing contracts in the gold parade will not change, the limitation is valid only for news to focus the participation to the programme.
This is the first case in the American history of the entry into force of a legal restriction concerning the reimbursement of the Administrators - commented the measure of the Democratic Barney Frank President of the Committee responsible for the Financial Services of the Chamber of Representatives.
Furthermore, it has the right to accept a share of the banks participating in the programme by reducing the risk of contributions, as at the end, they can also gain us if the economy and together with it will be saved.
The proposal of law includes that in the next five years the President must submit to the Congress a proposal which provides as a refund to the contributions of the losses from the financial sector.
Of course, both parties have been those who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what the American citizens asked us, not to defend the dollar of the contributions, has declared the republic of California Darrell Issa.
His democratic colleague of Ohio Mary Captur believes that the measures have been taken by the same that are responsible for the Wall Street crow.

Reference of printing in the German world
The right pool is intact, only within the pool the electors have become the most car conscious - that is the Spigel's weakness resulting from the CSU in Baviera.
Haider's game is ready to control Austria to prevent rock coalition.
The speed (spiegel.de)
Franz Walter, in the Internet edition of the German magazine, in the article Baviera's revolution divorces his parents the causes of the CSU's drammatic disaster.
According to the Politologic notice, the CSU erosion has already started a lot before the triste Beckstein-Huber pair entered in load.
The Christians have re-employed the Baviera for decades and now these modern citizens are away from them.
The change of time is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as well as Angela Merker.
The challenge was not a great surprise for the CSU, but on Sunday, a process was completed that exactly 10 years ago was made: it was completed the indiscutable egeon of a party party.
Jam 10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU was pregnant to 47.7%, for the first time under the 50% threshold.
This has been repeated three years ago to the Federal Day elections in 2005 in the period mentioned by Stoiber.
This cause is the modernization carried out in a consequence in the region, which divorces parents.
Sociologies have pronounced it for 40 years ago, but they did not have much time. However, secularizing, results of education, the insecurity of the East and Northern Germans in the development of the Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on the faithfulness of the electors to the CSU.
Modernization is equal to increased opportunities and political consequences are demonstrated.
The right pool is intact, only within the pool the electors have become the most car conscious, critical, obstinct.
It is also surprised that in the last weeks the CSU has been disappeared from the CSU by the classic groups: the freedoms of professionals, artists, diplomats and laureates.
Here CSU support is lower than 40%.
The press (depresse.com)
"Who with whom?" In the article "Presidents of the parties are blocked in coalition issues" the confused internal political situation created by the elections.
The SPE intends to address the EVP.
The EVP prohibites the SPE's intervention in its internal business.
The BZOU is open to treaty in all directions, the Greeks still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections were made, now turning around coalition; in the discussion transmitted by the public, the leaders of the parties have just seen the cards.
Werner Faymann President of the SPOU confirmed voler to treat the EVP.
The SPOU wishes to demonstrate that the cooperation between the two parties is possible in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left this question if you can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, current President of the EVP, as vice-chair.
As stated, the Schüssel-Molterer course has been rejected in any case.
The repair of this direction is not considered.
Molterer did well respond to the red offers.
As said, cooperation will certainly not be successful if Faymann is trying to enter into the EVP's internal business.
If the party chooses the opposition or income in the coalition is still an open thing in the party, the questions must be discussed in any case within the EVP.
Jörg Haider Leader of the BZOU repeated to be open in all directions.
"To prevent rose coalition, we are ready to take us the responsibility of governance," said Haider.
Járóka: I must split the vicious cycle of poverty and segregation
Today in Paris, the European Summit for Paris Opportunities has started this year by France with the Presidency of the European Union.
Livia Járóka, Deputy of Fidesz of the European Popular Party, in the addressed message to the complaint as a chief rapporteur of the Congress, requested the attention on school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation that affects the Roman children and the most seriously obstance for their claim.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Commissioner Fladimír XXXpidla responsible for employment, social affairs and opportunities have opened the conference at the maximum level.
There were governments, European social partners and representatives of the greater civilian organizations and rights defence in the framework of equal opportunities.
Járóka, according to the printing office of the Parliamentary Group Fidesz PE, recalled, in addition to discrimination in the meetings, that the Romans are extracted from the labour market first because of their low schools.
"The majority of young Rome has no mid-level study title and as a consequence of the elementary learning of bad quality only an ironic number of them can reach a higher education title."
Járóka also stressed, as human rights, the key role of education in the valuation of human rights.
Investment in the education of Roman children can mean the strengthening of the economy of the European Union's Member States.
According to the Deputy, it is necessary to make them aware in the most wide range between the Rome and the non-Roms.
For the first time the school starts a Roman, the more of its opportunities to become a producer of the labour market; through the payment rates for income and consumers contribute to the national budget.
"The right of European citizenship of Rome must ensure their right to quality education and to eliminate low-level and secret schools" - stressed Livia Járóka.
According to the Deputy, the European Union's objectives and action are needed to accelerate school disregion processes and therefore it is fundamentally important to respect the existing and projected anti-discriminatory directives.
"The visional environment of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be interrupted, it must be given to the children of Rome the opportunities granted from democratic space so that they can contribute to the full title of the future of Europe."
In the sign of the "European Year of Paris Options" to ensure for all, the European Summit for Paris's organizational opportunities is the meeting of Berlin's past year to ensure a unique forum to promote anti-discrimination objectives and equal opportunities set at the State and European level.
CSU: piece for a transitional period
At the end of October, the kind of the Huber-Beckstein cop will be decided.
Although the bad electoral weakness have not yet falled the tests, the CSU's vertebraries has been at the moment restarted the discussion of personal issues.
The Chairman of the Erwin Huber party and the Regional Governor Günther Beckstein remains on his own place, the question is until the time of peace.
In the form of a 17% vote dismissed catastrophe, the extraordinary congress of the party in the last October end will be decided.
Two very critical politicians have been able to know in any case that they are not attacked with all the forces at the seat.
They have so attempted to enhance the rebels of the parliamentary group and of the basis that one day after the "tsunami bavarian" has provided the personal consequences for the loss of absolute majority.
5 years ago, under the guidance of Edmund Stoiber then to the culture of his carrier, the Christian-Society Union receives 60.7%, but now after the state fault against Stoiber are 43.4%.
The CSU for 46 years was "absolut monastery" in Baviera, giving 18 per cent of the German GDP.
Nevertheless, the conservators in the southern region always contain the fundamental importance of the Hungarian economy, in the future will be coalized in any way.
What is the first sign of the reorganisation within the party, the Federal Chairman and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considering the possible heritage of Huber, gets a place in the Research Group that will begin negotiations with the liberals of the FDP and the Free Electricities Exposed Right values for an eventual government coalition in Monaco of Baviera.
For a strange scene of destination in the list of the Free Electors entered into the legislation that Gabriel Pauli, the attraction against Stoiber was used as an opportunity to be attacked by the Huber-Beckstein cop and then betrayed without regard to the woman of the great ambitions.
CSU's leaders now focus all their forces to stabilize in some way Beckstein.
The former regional and former regional governance of the CSU has defined on 28 September the most bitter day of his political transport.
Monday Huber has issued some statements to the faithful to the CSU, according to which the brother party would pay more support.
Another CSU politicians have interpreted the weakness as a warning to CDU and Angela Merkel.
The Merkel will not be canceled after the Federal Day elections set for September 2009, if the CSU has not been released with common forces, which has been a determinant role in the 2005 national victory.
According to the Merkel, which does not hide the delusion of the river, the CSU's ground loss will not be negatively reflected on the large coalition of Berlin.
What is certainly about: the CSU will not be easy to manage, but the crises of social democratics are still hard.
SPD reached its lower result from 1946 in Baviera by 18.6%.
Lukashenko Option: 110-0
A representative of the opposition is even entered into the Belarus Parliament after the Sunday elections.
According to Russian observers, it is the sign of the goodness and stability secured in the country directed by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Security Organization and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) instead of explaining the books made in the terms of votes.
The OSCE, who sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 persons of a country of 10 million inhabitants is an opposition for more than one decade, before the elections of yesterday, the opposition collected under the name of the United Democratic Forces (ODS) was hoped to be serious that Lukashenko, with the fourth presidency mandate renewed for the constitutional amendment to the elections of 2006, in circumstances discussed, some seats in the Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has thus responded to an evaluated pre-auditor.
Following the opposition expectations, Belarus, always more economicly dependent from Russia, who asked a credit to reduce the importation of Russian natural gas and agreed to give Russians the greenhouse gases in possession of Beltransgaz, intended to improve the EU's report with which Lukashenko and other high rango politicians could not enter into the bielorust politics considered antidemocratic situation.
It was referring to a detention that the OSCE, by assessing the electoral campaign, has made an increase on positive and not on lacking, such as the prohibition to be presented for a third of the candidates of the opposition.
However, the rapid report of OSCE also criticised the campaign, during which the candidates of the opposition could not appear on the printing, and in particular that the opposition was not intended to be presented to the account of votes.
Despite this opposition, it is possible to improve the political climate: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also prepared for a small comparison with Moscow and continued to deny the recognition of the South Ocean and Abkhazia from Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a federal state, considers independent the two countries for a month.
We have made two steps forward and one back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and EU has been started - has declared to our Aleksandr Milinkevich newspaper.
According to the Presidential candidate of the 2006 elections opposition, it is amazing that, however, it remains that "the power had feared to enter a only opponent in a Parliament without weight."
The opposition does not provide protest actions for results, but rather try to bring the electors the message of the need for economic reforms.
Of course we have many problems, we need to print the newspapers of the opposition in Russia, for the distribution of the local authorities, but I also see that more people support the change, even among the elders - said Milinkevich's referring to the fact that even the most helped census, that the pensions, considered the appropriate regime of Lukashenko, which considers the main result of the creation of social security.
On the basis of the debt of the country and the increase of economic deficit is only a matter of time to dissolution of social security "and it remembers grave silence" - Milinkevich believes.
On the contrary to the opposition policy, Russian observers have judged democratic elections.
Sergej Lebedev President of the Community of Independent States declared the Russian printing agencies RIA Novoti: "The men believe not in words but in fact," so the lack of opposition is not other than the evidence of the maturity of the Belarus electors.
Brunetta: "Then now collating before the work"
It has never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were rounding doors for entrance and exit of employees.
But since this day you take this new measure against the shots, against those who are timing and then go to drink a coffee to the bar at work time.
The news of anti-fashion have been submitted today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary-General of the Council Presidency, Mauro Mass.
"The leading doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more pre-presentations and more services" specifics the Minister.
"Now a new stage of responsibilities and transparency is opened.
This is reformism, "we still emphasized Brunetta.
With Palazzo Chigi is completed the installation in all the palaces of the Council Presidency.
For Masse "the selection of the round doors is also important from the symbolic point of view."
There were no resistance from employees, ensure the Secretary-General: "The process was shared by the workers and it was the cooperation of all."
Instead, there is no more collapse in work time; no more coffee and corn.
The word of Brunetta, which suggests, sweet, "A beautiful captain at 7:00 is a holy hand."
During a conference at the Top School of Public Administration
The Minister then notes that "in three months the allocations for disease of public employees have reduced 50 per cent, i.e. 60 000 people in more than a year."
And adds that it is necessary to make more efficient the Public Administration
Italian, "local dynamics - explain the ministry - in the last 8-10 years have been doubled with respect to the private sector and well above the inflation rates".
So, thousands of public employees have been joined to comply with the rules of the Brunetta Decree by added to the claim provided by the Codacons.
"When the Minister of Public Function is going to leave numbers today about the minor assensistics for disease - writes the association of consumers - the people of the operosis fashioners is continually growing.
For thousands in Italy are the employees of the public's correct and productive administration who have been assembled to declare war to the illegal standards contained in the decree."
In particular, the exclusion of additional economic treaties for the disease depending on the damage; the extension of the frequencies of reperibility of the patient worker, within which the control visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions required by the Minister.
Work implications, Napolitan: "Creative prevention"
Every day, in Italy, there are 2 500 incidents on work, they die 3 people and 27 remain invalid.
For 2007, the Inail data have confirmed that white dead were about 1.200.
Trust that they testify the gravity of a phenomenon that remains one of the main causes of death and causes almost doubts of murderers.
To call for the attention of institutions, social forces and means of information on this drammatic issue today, the Animil celebrates in all the provinces of Italy on the 58th National Day for the victims of work incidents established in October on the second Sunday.
"The concerns of the data diffused from Anmil and the same chronic tranche of these days confirm as important as the matter of prevention on work", said the President of the Republic of Giorgio Napolitan, in the message sent to the President of Anmil, the National Association of Employment, Peter Mercandelli.
The Head of the State expresses its “Vive appreciation for the constant commitment to prevent workplaces, the protection of unfortunate workers, the assistance of victim families and the sensitivity of public opinion”.
"Of course, a "base" indigenous, sincerely shared, in front of tragedy, which, for their size, highlight the critical of the media and the involvement of the public opinion, but the daily reality is almost dramatic, even reprehensible in their dynamic."
Napolitan does not hide that "There is also a problem of resources: it is decisive to invest in training and information.
Particularly significantly assesse the number of school initiatives for a directly higher conscience by young people who are engaged in the work world.
It is important to keep the attention of the phenomenon, not to defend the alarm of its social gravity, to apply and improve legislative rules.
The President of the Chamber Gianfranco Fini said: "Come the phenomenon of the white dead is a absolute social intervention, which offends the conscience of each of us and puts all the institutions a decision to make you urgently end."
"The data on the hardness of the work seems to report a ready movement, but it does not take that the number of white dead are indeed impressive," said the President of Animil Peter Mercandelli.
"We don't want, in fact, that this "string to the lower" is being translated in less attention, because it's exactly when the attention is focused on the tragedy.
"We believe that at general level there is still too little to counter the phenomenon of disappointments, and the contrast can be performed through a lot of actions.
I'm necessary, at our judgment - he emphasized Mercandelli - greater controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and that from the world of school."
"Against another effort - he added - in terms of communication and awareness of public opinion.
But, above all, it requires a more responsibilities of employees against a phenomenon that represents social emergency."
Mercandelli then declared "the progressive deterioration of the indennial protection levels planned for the victims of work" and the "respective assistanceist to which the system is spended in the last years."
"The goal is therefore to restore the insurance guarantee to the worker - he added - because the kind of persons who are urged should not depend on spontaneisms or the illustration of times provided by the legislator."
Mp3 readers under accused, put the hearing to risk
Listen high volume music for a long time period using portable music devices like Mp3 readers can cause permanent lections of the hearing.
It is how it refers to the European Commission, that in a communication distributed to Brussels, the opinion of the scientific Committee on emergency and recent health risks, which is published today.
"Over this scientific opinion - it is read in the notice - it states that the 5-10% of those who, for a period of five years, hear music with mobile music devices daily for more than one hour in the day, holding high volume device risks a permanent loss of audio capacity".
"I'm concerned about the fact that such a number of youths that are used with frequently portable music devices and mobile cells at high acoustic levels can uncertainly damage their hearing in unparable way," says Meglena Kuneva.
"The scientific repercussions - follow the responsibility you - emerges a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
Whatever more contains, we need to make consumers awareness and make these information on public dominion.
We also need to review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, so that they are fully effective and have a step with the new technology."
Brussels requested the independent scientific Committee to consider the problem, seeing the large use of portable music devices and the increase of the number of young people expressed to their voice.
"The scientists - concluded you - confirm that there is a reason for concern, and the European Commission will now examine together the Member States and the stakeholders whose measures could eventually be taken to protect children and adolescents from the exposure to the sound from driving music devices and end-off devices."
Today, there is already a European security standard that limits the sound level of the portable musical devices, but they increase concerns as the audio damage that can result from an exhibition to such sound sources.
It can be limited to many of these damage recurred to solutions such as reduction of levels and the duration of noise exhibition.
In its opinion, the Ue Committee presents that the users of portable music devices if they listen to high volume (more than 89 decibel) music for the sun 5 hours per week over the current limits on the maximum allowed to work.
The color that listen to music in these conditions for more extended periods risk a permanent loss of audio capacity after a period of 5 years.
This would be 5-10% of the users of these devices, and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the U.S..
Roman, Germany gives the Commission for the future of the capital
Today it begins, in March, the sums will shoot in June.
This is the calendar set by the Campaign for the work of the "Commission for the future of Rome Capitale", which has been settled this morning in his new seat behind the Terme of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the 49 other components of the Commission will take the guidance lines for Rome.
Once the batters in March, the Journ and the Joint Council will appreciate analyze and projects, so that the strategic Plan for Rome will be able to submit to June with the "official" of the Campdoglioo and its colleague Gianni German plan.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and has been represented all the political, social and cultural ideas - which has to emphasise Germany - must provide proposals for the development of Rome, which remaining the Joint and the Joint Council, then will be advised.
There is no survey of rules but only the desire to have a place to prepare a great project for Rome.
In March, it will end its work and then it will be disappeared, because this experience must have a necessary time limit.
In June - announces the staff - we will present the strategic plan using the work made by the Commission for the future of Rome Capitale".
To those who accuses the Commission of Inutility, since his opinions will not be binding, the German replies: "All depends on the work that will be able to make the Commission and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be, as well as in France with the Commission Attali and as I am sure in Rome, it will be essential.
Politics are too often angry on the management of the daily and the emergency that are often missed.
We, on the contrary, want to watch more long and far more, in a deepest perspective, working with seriousness to the development of Rome and its future."
Furthermore, the soldier of Rome has to point out that "This Commission is neither an unnecessary entity nor a carross: it is absolutely free, it will not cost an euro to the Roman citizens and will serve to reason and involve the best intelligence that the Capital expresses".
For Germany, in fact, "I should have a strategic reference design, not closed or immovable, to allow our city to make an authentic level, which he completely needed, thinking with a unique spirit in his future."
A future that, specifically the soldier of Rome, "not will be limited to the only current common limits but will look well beyond" not only in the opinion of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capitale but "and in view of the role that Rome can and has to do as the Head of Europe and the Mediterranean."
Obama? The first anti-American president.
He wrote a American politic notice that we have to pass for independently: "Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, which with its decisions the U.S. economy, and had reports (such as it is today also from private citizens) with the Islam's enemy."
Increases the attacks against Obama right while the date of the elections is closed.
He wrote a Lady of Miami on a web: "This person is full of ambitions.
Obama has a huge face to fall: believes he will win the highest load of a nation who had in all two governments and five black senators!".
In fact, they are not much talking; they are clearly racial attaques and do not respond to the question of the electors: will it be a good President? So there are pumps; they say all that Obama will win and with a good distance.
In this case, there are some who speaks with the heart but not with the brain.
A new newspaper of Mississippi, in the south of the United States, wrote a editor: once in the cabin to vote, we know who will give his vote to the American patriot.
There is a side of the staten mentality covered until the last.
"Speak what you want, then we'll think we're gonna put the crocetta on Obama or McCain."
There's people who swear, if you have to win Obama, we'll go away from America.
That's never defended before now, that seems pretty certainly to the success of the black candidate.
Nevertheless, despite all these reasons, the army winning for democratics is George Bush.
They asked to 1500 people: What were the errors made by Bush during his mandate? The 89 percent answered: Iraq.
Change America.
In Vietnam this nation lost $50 million soldiers and was ordered home to calm in the seat.
In Iraq, there are 400 soldiers who lost life and Americans were not forced to do valies.
However, Iraq for most was the weak point of Bush's weakness.
Whoever takes George W will have a great job to do.
Use, the economic trail is also feeling about journalists: in the dailys is time of cups. And many cause the fault on the Internet, "assassin" of the printed paper.
Five hundred American journalists were interplyed by the PEW Research Centre on the status of their mental profession and control in terms of future.
Of course, the journalists today are almost all bad about their future.
However, newspapers did not openly state that they feel less worried about credibility.
They don't feel isolated as once.
The problem for statistical journalists is the money, the money.
The 2008's crisis for these journalists is a destructed economic model crisis.
Furthermore, the tables made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to assemble daily, is a huge problem.
It is a problem that will be resolved, according to the interviewed journalists, if you don't want the traditional journalism as the great public is, it is very renewed.
A clear but comprehensive evilism today perishes the staten journalist today.
You are on ten newspapers and senior executives are convinced that the newspaper at national level is following a wrong path.
In the local field, the executive group is 65%.
Printed against transmission.
It's not difficult for journalists to see where the web goes.
The greatest editorial houses appear a lot on the internet, for many views like the "assassin" of the printed paper.
The "economic pressure" reporting journalists has increased up to 79%.
The 500 interviewed journalists have allowed them to abolish the technology in the hope that "does something good" for their journalism.
The largest spot today in the American journalism is among those who lead the newsrooms - i.e. directors - and reporters who work for them.
The 56% of executives at the national level is safe that their reporters share their values, while at local level the percentage is 23 per cent.
For some of this, he has to do with the "security of the work".
Executors who think of losing employment within three years are 47% at national level.
For reporters staff is 30 per cent.
The "safe work" at staff level (of our editors, ndr) in America is always on the order of the day.
Only 13% of the journalists work with a contract.
In a great nation like Us, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, revised, radio, TV and Internet, the employers often offer what they want and becomes a question of "take it or leave it", take or leave.
The directors receive almost always large wages, while the designer can also gain $10 million over the month, except the pension and payment of insurance.
For feast, then the reason is complicated: to days after the first year, to the third to reach 15 days after a certain number of years.
But the American journalists, for their admission, are often "ammalan" during the year.
It's all the climate question.
UNIPOL: TRIBUNAL ROMA, COPPOLA RESTA A GROTTAFERRATA
The Chairman of the Second Penal Section of the Court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, decided to reject the existence of the Immobiliarist Danilo Coppola who asked to move from his city, Grottaferate, to a living in the city of Rome.
Coppola is added for bankroat in the context of the Unipol-Bnl counterparty.
During the process at its loading last week, he has obtained the download of the household transformed in the obligation of residence to Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the Immobiliarist could pass through the city of province to a living in the capital.
However, according to the Court of Justice, these movements (and which has given the opposite pm) would allow him to influence its society and access the evidence they accuse it.
The elections in danger
The phenomenon has already been shown a few days ago with the vote of the Chamber of the Representatives against the Saving Plan of 700 billion dollars of the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and it is, more interested to punish Wall Street than to save the economy.
The New York Times of the Year will be confirmed by informing us that the current crisis is running the Revolutionary Party, always more divided between its old soul East Coast, moderate, favourable to the federal institutions and the Community business, and its new soul, instead, conservator, hostile to "Quels of Washington" and the world of financing, particularly in the Central and South States.
The soul, for the appeal, which was pre-emptively alive with the vote I said at the beginning.
However, it is only an example of the changes, the large changes, which the current economic earthquake may be presumed or already leaves: not only in the United States but in all the West and perhaps only here.
It is in use that the crisis in Europe seems to operate by accelerators of incubation in the new climate and finally light.
The first of these phenomenas is the re-totalization, the extraordinary revolution of the dual category of State-Sovranity relating to a kind of renationalization of the economy.
In fact, the crisis is critical of bank-financies, which are, yes, related to the foreign, but first of all they see involved in a wide range of budgets of people and families living in a single country in one State.
That is immediately creating a political problem for those who govern it: and how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and families that, among others, are also elected.
The crisis seems economicly globally, but politically is almost exclusively national.
The political innernationalism seems essentially out of the game or does not have much to say: the lighting test is given by the European Union which divides as usually between the various interests and between the various States strategies cannot decide any common policy line.
And this is the government of each individual State that everyone is waiting for interventions, saving and restart plans, new rules, and especially for the removal of funds: since it comes to the streets, only the States who possess economic resources, the mass of financial resources in order to try to resume things in the sixth.
They also have the necessary means and legitimacy to use them: two resources of incomprehensible value, in certain circumstances where no market is certainly, and no international organization can never disappear in a similar measure.
This new approach that the crisis puts on the national element is of the rest in perfect synthesis with the importance of increasingly greater than the recent developments of the economy have to contribute to a very closely linked factor to this element: territoriality.
Paradosely, when we were convinced to be now entered into the Kingdom of the Network, the technology always more sustained, the immateria, while we were convinced that the globalized financing was now intended to dominate the world, we came to you from a step that our future would be to make accounts growing in measure with those little immature things that are water, collections, oil.
Everything that, looking a little, can certainly be transferred from a place to the other of the earth, but they are absolutely linked to a surrounded space, to a territory.
As you can be sovereign, you certainly have more cards than those who are not, who have the difficulty to live in a place without collected, without oil and without water.
I am coming to the second news that takes a fracture.
Who says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and then Leadership.
In this regard, economic crisis seems to produce two convergent fenomenes.
On the one hand, the comprehensiveness of the objective need for author leading, the request of someone who can take the situation into hand.
On the other hand, a discreet on the existing leadership, economic species, discovered so inadequate and full of shadow areas.
And together something more deep and certainly worried about: a discreet, a disappearance, an image of inadequateness, a sense of loans, which aims to involve the whole leading class in a growing number of countries in the West.
It seems to be always more way, in wide areas of the population, the conviction that before their actions are the same ideas of the social elections so far, their way to feel and be, their culture in the total accession of the term, having done their own time and even more stranger to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership, insommately, a recovered but ownership of delegation of the leading classes and traditional political acts, which is shown in the "revolutional" electoral" or in a sudden process of collective humors of these recent and recent times, the conservative asylum in Austria-Baviera at the crow of the Labour Consensants in British, the refusal of American congresses against Bush (or perhaps also the right of Italy has something to do).
It is the impression that traditional elections, their parties, their programmes, but also their restraints, their journals, their intelligents, their formats to someone, make it more fair to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not today being formed in the deep streets of the West society and that economic crisis renews, increases, potentially delayed.
Besides all this, it would be explicitly expensive.
But keep your eyes open, certainly, it's not for nothing.
It's overlap to walk on the walls
To roll gravity laws thanks to a super collapse and in future walk on walls like Spiderman.
It is the goal of several American research centres, and now a team of four institutions has been very close to us.
With an adjection of only 2,5 square centimeters the studies have been able to keep a body of 100 kilograms on a vertical wall.
LO STUDIO – The American Science magazine published the discovery of some researchers of the University of Dayton, of Akron, of Georgia Institute of Technology and of the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material found by the team of students is an evolution of the existing ones that use a particular carbon structure called carbon nanotubies.
“The principle of the collea can be imagined as a series of tubes systemed as a pile of spaghetti”, explains Zhong Lin Wang of Georgia Institute of Atlanta Technology.
Scientists were inspired to geeks samples, covered by skin microscopics that can ensure an perfect attraction to the animal.
The tests conducted on different materials, such as viso, Teflon and Vetrate paper, showed that the new adesivo is ten times more powerful of the samples of these reels and at the same time"s easy from the wall", explains Liming Dai, researcher of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Dayton.
CAMMINAR SUI MURI? -" This material could be useful as transitional addictive" Add Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on walls like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers think a very less sweet use as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubies are warm and current electric drivers.
Other applications may be related to the airspace engineering.
For the moment, nothing overwhelmed.
The ALTRA RICERCA – also the University of Berkeley in California is dedicated to the search for a new adhesion.
In a article on the magazine of the American Chemical Society, Californians studiers presented an appropriate format of microfibre as hairs that self-equipped from powders during the movement on a surface to keep a perfect accession.
Fashion: Never cooking sugar fruits
Attention to pompem shot, to smoke and mela.
These drinks, especially consumed in suits because distant and rich of vitamin, if they are currently assembled to some health-related medicinal products, it changes an ambition by improving or reducing it according to cases the effectiveness with serious consequences for health.
To reiterate the risks of fruit sugars as well as fresh associations with some medicines David Bailey, professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, that from the 236th National Meeting of American Chemical Society at Philadelphia launching a new warning: enough a pomphom pomp, arch and mela to reduce the assuring of some health medicinals, cancel the benefits and make the risk of the health of patients.
The pump fucking was already ended in accused because he was responsible to increase up to the toxic levels of the effects of some anti-arritmic, antibiotic, amateur, anti-staminic and neurological medicines.
FARMACI A RISCHIO - The same Italian pharmaceutical agency gave news in a information bulletin two years ago driving doctors and patients to do not undervaluate the danger resulting from this mix and to take care of what it is drinked in the case they assemble medicines such as the Diazepam or Metadone.
NON SOLO POMPELMO - According to experts, the shoes and the milk contain substances that inhibit medicines.
I play the list of active principles affected by pompam and other sucks.
The call of Michele Carruba, Director of the Department of Pharmacology of the University of Milano Statistics: "These discovery in general are reported to the various international and national farmers agencies that may have to change the information of the pharmaceutical notes.
So you always read the illustrate sheets of medicines that are assuming and if there is something that is not clear, don't make us impress, but ask clarifications to the doctor or the pharmacist" has stressed the expert to Ansa Agency.
The Nobel of Economy to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Price for Economy was granted to the American Paul Krugman for its studies on trade models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55 years old, is a Neokeysian who teaches the University of Princeton and is a well-known editorial of New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most criticisms of the economic and external policies of Bush administration.
A few months after the attitudes of September 2001, in the days in which Enron had failed, Krugman was planned in a published editor on New York Times that the second event would be more determined than the first, in terms of consequences on the history of the United States.
A prevision that he left not a little polemic and that for years it came back to the economicist, but now it has been revealed.
"I'm surprised and even a little deployed for the speed with the memory of offenders such as the Enron or Worldcom collapse was disappeared from public attention," Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the Executive Committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a "economist of great value" but also an aggressive spread with a aggressive style, particularly critical against the expenditures of liberty of Bush's administration.
Open Office, here is the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft package"
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source of personal productivity that is intended to reach more useful, from the house to the office, from the professionals to the public administration, as free alternative to the most known Microsoft Office.
After a year of work by voluntary developers, with which SUN Microsystem monitors, the new Open Office is shown to the great public with different newspapers: the welcome screen and the revised and less spare interface, they are added more sustainable as the national compatibility for the operational Apple Mac OS X and support for the new ODF format (Open Document Format) 1.2, the last ISO standard version.
Postal attention also to interoperability with the Office of 2007, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.doque, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific functionality of some modules such as that allows you to reduce the sizes of the CSV presentations, for example, to send them via electronic post, or the possibility to import files PDF in the graphical processing module, maintaining the original appearance of the page.
Always on this front you can create "PDF hybrid documents", which gather the typical graph of the Adobe format with the elements of a calculation sheet or text developer.
Cooperation is an element that has received different improvements within the application: in the calculation sheet, it is possible to intervene to more hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the text process processing, to each cooperator is given a color in comments for a better recognition in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some functionality of OpenOffice on the web (on the cloud, the cloud), and in the next weeks they should give the final result.
The version in Italian is downloadable to http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English that was found on Friday.
Besides as for Windows and Mac OS, the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
Your request may also be sent to home or to work the CD of installation.
And if the theme of free may be a train for the distribution in the houses, it is exactly in business that Open Office is attempting the largest summit, and it is already able to do on various projects carried out in public administration and schools.
And they are not even lacking the realities that offer an ideal training, advice and assistance for small and medium-sized companies, which could open business perspectives.
Open Office composes five main modules: Writer, for Word's corrective videoscription; Calc, is the calculation sheet that aims to replace Excel; Print, for powerpoint presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows to work on the database; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
Objective for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that we're at almost 3 million and 600 million, with the outcome of the new version, it's likely that it can also be overcome.
Also Kohl is positive to be the fourth case of doping
New case of positiveness to the last Tour of France: it is the austriaco Bernhard Kohl, the team Gerolsteiner, the third classified and winner of the best scaller mile.
To report the news is the site of the Daily Team.
The 26th Kohl is the fourth positive corridor to Cera, the third generation epoca, after the Italian Riccardo Richado and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, even those of Gerolsteiner.
The analysis on Kohl’s blood campaigns include the last weeks from Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry laboratories.
If the counter-analyses will confere positiveness in Cera, the austriaco will lose the third place to the Tour and go to meet two years of canonical skill.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positiveness to the third generation Epoca is the chief of the French Antidoping Agency, Peter Bordry, who has known the Association Press to have reported the positiveness to the Austrian authorities.
The 26th australiano pitched on the end podio on the spanish sides of the Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also adding the square to the best scaller.
IMMIGRATIVE: NEW YORK TIMS TO THE CHIEDE, the ITALIA is RAZZZISTA?
Italy has only been transformed in a privileged destination for immigrants.
This is transforming Belize into a nation of racists? It's how much you ask in a long article New York Times who dedicated a long article to the debate on racism the question in Italy by starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guiber originary of Burkina I killed the last month in Milano to have broken a biscotti chain.
This case demonstrates what the Nyt defines the "North Paradose", the Northern regions are at the same time when "more integration and more job" registers but also the "level anti-immigrant feelings of the country and the highest support for the North Lega".
To confirm the growing tension between Italian and immigrates, the Nyt also cited the in alliance episodes of Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Volturno.
Not only.
The new legislation developed by the Lega which strikes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of the clandests is a paradigma of climate change in Italy.
Tendency emphasized both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitan with the Benedetto XVI to Quirinale asked that the State and the Church work together to explore racism."
Students victims of coal-friendly up to 900 euros for a room
The market for university affairs does not know critical.
According to the last investigation of Sunia, the carriage office can cost a single room up to 900 euros in Milano, 700 in Florence, 650 to Napoli, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken very serious characters at the point to exclude all young people from the right to study for the overall costs that the families of origin should support - explains the responsibility of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand by students has so deformed the market to enhance an increased process for residents."
In the majority of the cases, the apartment offers then contain a series of violations: free, unregistered contracts, without canon limits, linked sub-fits.
For Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed that, through the revision of the tax imposed, prices may be calmed.
Looking at the detail of the investigation, we can see that in Milano, for a bed room in the Brianza area, it is about 450 euros; for a single room is at least 650 (New band) at a average value of 800 (Lambiate Zone, Udine and Fiera) at a maximum of 900 (in Vittoria area).
In Firenze a bedroom in average 350/400 euros, a room around 700 euros.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in neighbouring areas at the University, approximately 250/280 euros for a bed room in a double, from 370 to 500 for a single.
In Rome near the centres (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna) there are about 600 euros for a single room, 450 for a bed room in a double.
Only lowerly lower values (550 euros for single camera) in neighbouring areas to the other Universitys (Ostense and Cinety).
Only if it is moved in dangerous areas: 300 euros for a bed and 450 a single in the Pressetine area, Center and similar.
In Napoli, for a bedroom is 300/450 euros, for a room is expanded from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Political, Vomero and Colli Amminai.
A Bari for a bedroom is 250/350 euros, at least 350 for one.
In smaller cities, prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have more weight in the city economy.
In the cities in which the phenomenon of extra-Community students is more frequently registered, such as Peruvia, an anonymous further: the increase of approximately 25/30% of the canon requested for foreign students with respect to the Italians.
Old cinema Paradise Add, towns cancel the historic sales
History cinematic sales are closed for multiplexs.
"A city without cinematic sale is a blind city, it's like an eye without eyes."
The image offered by the Government José Tornator photograph with effectiveness what happens in the large Italian city centres but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinema, with the birth of the great multinationals and the consequence of death for consent of monosals in the central areas of the city, is one of those events that are inadequate and inconveniable but also all the characteristics of a true and cultural crime.
To disappear, they are often stories and memory carriers," it is as if he had come less than one friend, a knowing with whom we shared a piece of road and many emotions”, notes the government of New Cinema Paradiso, the film that 20 years has dealt to Tornator the Price Oscar and the Great Prime of the jury of Cannes, and that told the poesia of a province room and the nostalgie for a way to live the film lost forever.
The numbers provided by Anec, the main association of the experts, are clear: In the last five years, the batters of 316 traditional type types were closed, and to pay the greatest shot are the sales in the main cities: 10 less than in Florence, 9 in Milano, Napoli, Bologna and Rome, 6 in less in Torin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the most vulnerable regions, the Emilia-Romagna has 82 persian films, followed by Toscana (44) and Lombardia (41).
And by demonstration that the first responsibility of their disappearance is the adventure of the multix, these are the three Italian regions who have made record the largest number of new multi-sized films: 195 records in more in Lombardia in the past five years, 81 both in Toscana and in Emilia-Romagna.
“The Italian year has been developed irracionally” Paul Protti, President of Anec, notes. It is useful that new structures should be built, but it would be necessary to ensure the survival of those already existing, because when a close city room is not all its participants are ready to move to multix.
For not to mention the lack of the fund fund for the experts: the State's advanced debt is approximately 10 million euros.
It is ashamed, from the ethical and moral view that the Govern does not respect the existing laws.
In order to support the sector would serve between 16 and 18 million euros a year."
Interesting the case of Bologna, the first Italian city, which, worried about the closure, decided to run to bankers with the signing of a Comune and Anec protocol, the first of this type in Italy, to protect and promote monosale films both in the historical and in danger.
There are measures for fiscal performance in favour of public managers and benefits in terms of mobility: the spectators can enter in the limited traffic area and will have special rates for the soil and some parkings.
“I am a initiative that I like” notes Joseph Tornator, and I hope that other cities follow the example of Bologna by putting other measures.
However, it is certain that, in order to combat multix disproportion, traditional salts must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the public is more required today.
The defense of the traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important for me: the closement of the Supercinema of Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the scientist who convicted me to do "New Paradiso Paradiso" to which I thought for 10 years.
I live in Rome from 25 years, and when I passed before the Rialto or the National Quirinal of Peace now closed, where I lived many shared emotions, not to see the cards renewed from the powder around me on the other side."
Relations between political and dragon arrested Headquarters of Joia Tauro
"The Joia Tauro soldier was available to uniformize the elections of the Community for the Piromalli's interests."
They are worried of the consequences that the judges of the Vice-Premier of Calabria relate to the Head and the vice-in-session of Joia Tauro Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the duty of Rosarno Carlo Martelli, arrested for outer concording in Mafia association.
In hands also Joacchino Piromalli, the oldman between the clan and the public administrations, and his lawyer, a member of the boss, has already been condemned for the association for the defence of massive stamp, condemned to estimate 10 million euros.
"In contrary to any legal and moral standard, as well as of a good sense," the leaders wrote, the two local administrations expressed the will to pay advice to the Piromalli lawyer.
"It would be so granted to the cosca - write the judges - to officially enter into the municipalities by enhance the possibilities, already ingenies, control and address of the public administration."
The President of the Regional Chamber Agazio Loiero does not hide that "collusions between the local and the disease organized there are many" in its region: "There are areas where the mafiosa intensity is stronger than in others, where the collection is almost inevitable.
But there are many local politicians that resist the pressure of the garden, heroes who keep clean."
The arrests of today follow the last July with which the police announced that he had detained the Piromalli cosk.
From the end of April, the Joia Tauro Communities Council was disappeared but already in 1991, and always for predominant condictions between organised crime and local administration, local politicians were suspended from the initiative to manage the Community.
Day From Torrione, ancient of the Udc at the time of disappearance, was elected by a central coalition coalition after the ballling of May 2006.
He cried to the scandal when the Prefectation ordered the extension of the Common Council.
He called for the Vice-President of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him to have architected everything for a political question, but the judges, in the order of signed arrest, explain that the Piromalli cosk has been addicted to ask the change of the A3 project.
The environmental interactions in respect of Dal Torrione, writeing the pms, are emerging "the availability to marry the needs of an undertaking, representing a larger group in the neighbourings of the Pyromalli, uniforming the elections of the public administration to the cosca interests".
When energy is born from the waves now down the large field
It is an ended bedroom, which takes over 70% of the planet surface, and now they discover it with the great global energy companies.
Once, roads, mars are the new renewable sources on which they have put the eyes, and now they are trying to put the hands, collapsed as the Chevron.
The possibility of recovering energy from marine movements has been studied for hundreds of years and in 70, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, the research was increased.
When the oil price was calmed around 1980, the idea of enjoying marine energy was sent on the side, but now the environmental situations and the new increase in oil damage to the sector.
The World Energy Council (WEC) of London estimated in 2007 that 15 per cent of the global electricity need could be covered by marine engine installations.
This quantity would be the double of that currently produced by nuclear centres.
And there would be the crowds and the sea.
It's on the attack.
The first undertaking on marine energy was Enersis, which set up an agreement in 2005 to build an installation in the North Portugal.
When the integration was announced, it seemed a revolutionary step.
In two years of distance on marine energy, there are always more and among these companys voted from ever to traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying the oceanic energy technologies - has declared the portrait of a company connected to the state oil coloss at the Wall Street Journal economic daily - and is evaluating the opportunity to cooperate with us."
The cooperation concerned concerns the relevance of a authorisation by the State Energy Committee, necessary to launch a project for the use of marine energy in Alaska.
It is not a little sign, especially if you consider that exactly in Alaska the Use continues to extract oil and recently the President Bush has started a plan for new triples.
Besides the Chevron, there are the Verdant Power Inc. of New York and the Ocean Power of New Jersey to pass through the road of energy that comes from the sea and invested sums, as not note in the details, shows the observators a surrounding interest.
Technology to put.
The experts speak of a technology still to the albores, even because marine energy does not flee to all suspicions on environmental impact.
For now, installations such as the portugus or some in Scozia are small and they don't seem to create large problems at the ecosystem.
In order to produce long-scale energy, however, technology must be used with a greater environmental impact.
And the elections are different: the Ocean Power, for example, uses a wood system linked between them.
The thickness of the waves, which moves the woods on and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure from potones and cilindrors within the galleggians.
The pressure runs a turbine that eats a generator at its time.
Electricity is commanded to riva through submarine cubes.
For now, there are four installations of this type on projecting, waiting for only federal approval and part of energy could serve for military installation.
The Verdant Power, however, has already produced energy for a commercial centre and a parking using six submarine tournaments in the East River of New York.
The water movement when the sea is around the turbines, creating a rotational movement that eats a generator.
The Verdant said he has a long list of customers, waiting for the necessary authorisations to use energy.
After the onde, the sea.
A particular interest, speaking to the Institute for Electic Energy Research, is now due to the sea potential.
Although it is an intermitted phenomenon, the sea is more predictable than the wind, the sun or the waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is exactly on the marine energy that have been as New York, Maine and Alaska, together with others who are on the costs, have already invested 7 million and average in 2008 and invested up to 35 million in 2009.
