What will she do to the Czech Social Democrats in Prague, nor the "conditri"?
The new Major Council Councils from the Numbers of the SSDs will clearly need to overcome some speechbars to understand their old colleagues from the ODS in the Prager Council and in the city relation.
The new Council's new Council has sometimes "acknowledged", as they managed the notary scene, which has entered in the last years, in which the present coalition partners in Prague were in the ruder.
The coded word chain, which was introduced into the lacked medie of the Supreme Minister Pavel Bém by the Prager Political Elite, is some of the most famous actors, situations and Causae.
Surprisingly, the new races in terms of these new definitions were shown in the darks.
That's what they say at least.
"Who's the flight place?"
"I don't know."
"I'm more a reluding in the Prager policy," answered Lukáš Kakukuý, the new Councilr for Cultural, at the test of the Pattery Worschat.
But also the Council's Master Karel B nețțaezina - a political veteran - reacted similarly.
For example, the word "Golfloch".
"This is the only expression of those you're present to me here I go and use again."
"In other case, I don't hold a lot of slang."
The ODS elected the edition six decisions, especially those that were not known by the Prager Magistrat in this year.
The social democrates should define the meanings "Voldemort", "Best Prager Golfloch", "in the Condits", "Stiering"," "Verrat of the Main city" and "Back".
Three Prager Councillors agreed to the test that the fourth - Antonine winner, the future head of the Prague Schools - the first talked about his participation in the conversation, but then did not even leave the audience.
The Fifth Council Master, Peter Dolínek, retained the test from the front.
"I am worried about these things and how the citizens of Democrats are interviewed against each other, I don't appeal to this."
"To me, it's important how we understand within our programs," he interviewed.
As it was said, Lukáš Kakukuý had not seen in the above-mentioned scene that the influential undertaking and friend of the ex-Oberanger Beem, Roman Janoušek is the talk.
The meaning "Voldemort" says Kauky is nothing, and the only reason he was correct in the test, "the greatest Prager Golfloch".
"It's the tunnel Blanca," said Kakukuyu, added to security but still going to: "But this I know better from the newspaper."
And it's amazing, "I'll probably have to appoint a speech course."
The "Golfloch" is then not only the "Matador Karel Bćezina" but also the Council's Head for Environmental Questions Lukáš Plachý is identified as Tunnel Blanca.
However, both social democrates are also aware of what is the Voldem position and Lukáš Plachý is aware of where this figur is to find, and that is what it means "good the conditation."
"I think that means to go into any practical gastronomic operation," Plachý is quite closely close to the Council solution, if you know that it is about the seat of Janoušeks.
In accordance with B ה'Zeina's line, he asserted that these notices have been taken out of the newspaper rather than that word record would be own.
Notifying the testing operators, it seems that there is no similar slang income among the social democrates.
"I also asked my colleagues, but obviously there is no such thing in us."
"We call us on the name, go and we also use corezels or spectrums," says the President of the Prague 周SSD Petr Hulínský - of his particips Salopp "Hulda".
"In the school I was called Båíza (Birke), but I don't know whether my colleagues are calling me so, "Karel B月ezina asked us his names.
The newspaper Deník updaten.cz has tried the name and see where he works.
The Council of Vienna is a friend of the "Opa" or less friendly of the "Alte", representative Miroslav Poche, who has taken attention to the elections by machinery at the Party's sponsorship, is called by some colleagues "Igráček" (because Czech Lego).
nicknames are the only one to allow the social democrates in the internal language use.
Hulínský should not be likely when you call him "Hulda", but Deník Updaten.cz registered another nickname of the President.
His Spitzname "Doctor of the Gummiknüpup reality" has been able to make Petr Hulínský his title Doctor juris at the Bratislaver Police Academy.
The Government wants to join the Foundation of Hexen and gave a browser
Women who are disappeared in Burkina Faso to Hexen are generally shown some common social characteristics.
They are more than the older generation, they find no job - for example, from health reasons, they are simple and have no children.
If one of these women is "while" to the hexe, it is strengly isolated so that it cannot be dangerous to the rest of the village.
"The men are rightly affected by this shit."
"And young and healthy women remains this, as they are in a special home in the work and children," a Western Author describes the situation in the capital of the West African State Burkina Faso in a special home for more than one hundred women who have been exempt from their communities.
The Governing Government has now decided to prevent this abnormal social measure.
And for this reason he gave a brochure that should bind the "hexen persecution".
But the thing has a hair.
"Other than 70 percent of all adults in Burkina Faso can't read", the newspaper "the Stard" to the dilemma of the written declaration.
The Hexerei is also going and governed in other African countries.
In Ghana, nearby Burkina Faso, the 27-year-old Ammy Hemmahová was requested by three women and two men to death - they moved them with petroleum and shot them easily.
About this case, the BBC server also reported.
However, the thresholds stated that the matter was only a collapse of unfortunate circumstances.
According to its version, oil is disappeared which will be used to ritual saubles.
And indeed, after the group tried to get "a bad spirit" out of the woman.
The isolation of "Hexen" supports people here without any attention to their education.
"The standard" was a 42-year-old undertaking of Burkina Faso: "Fresserence of human souls are previously like today," he said.
While the government in Burkina Faso is at least trying to enhance the Hexenjagd, the Gambian President has regularly cooperated in the past year of the President.
"President John Jammeh dismissed a monstery hexenjagd after his death, because this believingly part of their deaths and now would be attempt to kill the presidents themselves by black magic."
"That he called for shamaine from the nearest Guinea helping the police officers, soldiers and the corporate garden of the Chairman, who were elected without election for women and men from the Gambian villages and brought to the farm of the President in Kanilai," Amnesty International reported the Amnesty International Organization.
On the farm, the enchanted people were encouraged to drink a waste of plants with oluzinogenic effect, but also caused damage and nitrogen problems.
Two of the corrupted people did not survive the farm stay.
First, due to international pressure, the prisoners were released to approximately thousands of prisoners.
A middle of Bakala: he's surrounding in the oven - still pays higher meat
An elderly subscribed man just leaves the client centre of the company RPG Byty of the "Kohlebarons" Zènek Bakala, the greatest private owner of food in Tsjé.
Under the arm, a mappe with three new meat contracts: for the own and apartments of his daughters and his son, who has just improved a wheel.
All three were enlarged in the threshold. "Deregulation" exactly increased the meat.
Instead of 3 500 krones month measurement, the son in the next year will ask for a 2-room review with kitchen of the second category 4100 krones.
"And there are not even warm water in the apartment and heats in a simple coffee," he warms with the finger on the new meat contract of the son, to which he has a full signature.
"But what-- I signed," he said half-three and resigned half.
BytyOKD.cz, which described the new meat conditions as "incorrect and unmoral", urges the meaters to not just sign the new treaties and to wait until 7 December in recalling a guidance against such treaties.
But the man only wins.
"You say that, the other," he makes a dark face.
The region of Ostrava is so on the great "Deregulation Labour".
After the new year, this deregulation is the most food living in Tsjish, whose average is not paid in market prices until now.
Update.cz therefore decided to visit this "Labor" personally.
The RPG area in Havićov is one of the four in the Ostrava region and has been broken in this Sunday at 9:00 in this Sunday.
Like the door, the Bodyguards are at a security officer and a call device.
"More 2011", a special taste ground on the touch screen.
Shortly closed, and the device already splits a number board.
We have disappeared the "157" number and have already paid them on the big screen on the cover of the warning space.
A half second later you're on the line.
Something later, an elderly couple takes the warespace to ask after the hot, but the fall in the warroom is not obviously applicable to the new meal.
Most people are here to solve the usual problems - repairs, insurance situations and similarities.
From mid November, flowers in the region of Ostrava are buying with the new medium-sized contracts the most of the total of the 44,000 apartments of the portfolio of the RPG in the brigade.
The RPG Byty suggests them a average increase of approximately 15 to 38 percent.
The special shelter for the new meal in the client centre has been opened since 18 November.
"The action takes something over a week, which means that is just the beginning," the dames answered after the slaughter after a moment of hurry when the "Client" is a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former mountain workers are a brisk topic.
For the elections, the Vice-President Lubomír Zaoralek had taken this issue very laughly, no wonder that the newspapers today are full of it.
"20 years, I want a new football from them."
"Nothing to do. WC-Brille could change it," the man mentioned in.
Until now, the employees are attached to the rentner on the scene to convince whether they get the promised measurement that RPG promises to them when they are signing the special burden timely.
In the events of an enlarged February meteo to half, the other mixtures should be signed by the new Measury Treaty until 15 December.
To now, it is "deregulation scene" in Havićov but everything else, as overlayed by questions.
"Over the 360 clients were just about 40 to 50 million in 2011," the chief people assessed.
RPG offers both on its websites, as well as the change tables of individual food agreements where it is necessary.
However, if the middle parties are not on the new currency, they will be determined by an independent court.
"It must be no drug, but it is to understand the only possible and fully legal action," RPG said on his websites.
"No one goes to the court," said one of the employers of RPG Byty and a man on the road before the client centre, at least gives her right part.
"I have 13.000 (Krones) rewards, I'm left 5.000 for food, where I should take the money for a court road," he says.
Then the office will be uncertain.
"You can see."
"Herr Zaoralek tells them about the media, they must not sign, and so people are still waiting," she says.
The regulated currency ends the most part of Tsjishians to New Year 2011 and RPG Byty as a result of the middle of economic needs.
"The existing height of food is not enough to maintain the housing fund," said Pavel Climeš, Director of the apartment portfolio of the RPG Byty Society and - just the criticised defence of the apartment fund is considered by the Headquarter of the main reason for the Middle Research.
During RPG in the years between 2005 and 2010, four billion could invest in the apartments, in the four years from 2011 to 2014, it must be 5,2 billion.
On the great formal LCD display at the discovery towards the polar shapes in the warrant area of Havićov, you always visit a few red lighting information.
"The average increase in 2011 is 15% and less than 31 200 apartments, which is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"Every means that at least 7,50 CZK per square meters and month", it is to read on the LCD.
Only 400 apartments from the portfolio of RPG increased by 38 percent.
"In these cases, RPG has an increase in extremely lower food price of 19.66 CZK per square meter", said.
During 2600 apartments, the feet remains at the same height in the next year.
RPG Byty promises that the deregulation does not be widely high, but in terms of four and eight years.
What more - the company has another commitment: all income from the middle increase (see graph) wants to back into the apartments, especially in warming parks - in new windows and in warming.
But, in priority, these people should come to those who sign the Middle Research Agreements.
The architects saw a - to the office also belongs to a child garden
The office of Avriopoint in Brno is the new seat of the company Arch.Design.
But whoever would wait here for a ministry garden, with all the things that is about: iron furniture walls, creative mobels, a lot of player and even a ministry playplace on the outdoor asse.
These children gardens are available for the workers of Arch.Design for last year.
The projecting and architecturbüro Arch.Design, from which the projecting and architecturburo, is a whole series of furniture buildings, resulted from the first designs for the new Ariopoint building with the royalities for his company-Minikinder gardens.
In terms of view, because most of its 90 employees (inside) are at the baby's old age and the company, the projecters and architects are as soon as possible to return to their workplace.
With the opportunity to work closely, the children's garden has a further bonus that the Arch.Describes its employees in the concept of their social program.
The construction and architectines are so easier to bring their employment and children care under a hair.
The ministry garden is a original idea of the employees (inside) by Arch.Design and with the support of the management support for them, the European Union and the Ministry of Work and Social for its project.
The operational ministry garden is financed by the operational programme of human resources and employment policy from the European Social Fund and the State Budget of the Czech Republic.
Thanks to this funding (Subs of 2, 8 million CZK) the necessary institutions and equipment could be provided and provided for the period of 2 years for qualified staff and operation for the period of 2 years.
After the outcome of funds (2 years) the company is required to continue the ministry garden on their own costs for more than three years.
The preparation of this project was an annual year, with the Economy Rating Society, providing work in the processing of application.
Children are fully qualified - a hospital and a child garden teaching teachers, children can visit their gardens without anti-limitation, although most of them are aged over three years.
And when it is about a ministry garden, only five children may be present at the same time, however, change the day on several children alone.
Child garden is flexible to the need of parents who have children of all employees in relation to the use of children's garden - without regard to the companyhierarchie and their own position.
However, while it is individual education and training, the maintenance of the mink garden is comparable to the framework programme of education.
Children are not only playing here, in particular they are commanded a excellent teaching - from basic knowledge to the education, but also from English.
The classroom is not only with player and creative games but also equipped with a computer available to children.
What more - the presence of small children in the company leads to a friendly and positive company migration.
Parents can always look at the children, and so strike the struggle when the children are disappeared from a far away child garden.
The parents therefore use their work time productive.
There is no wonder that natural and loyal employees relations are also made here.
Arch.Design introduced the Czech companies that offer significant benefits to new employees who are friendly and strengthen their personal marketing through such programmes.
A kitchen house is still 100 years old. Look at Gaudi's interest
The teeth focuses on like the back of a prehistoric clamp, the beachs like the weakings of a dinosaurior and the Balcony are shot fishermen.
This is the Casa Batlló of the Catalan Architect Antonio Gaudi in Barcelona.
From the inhabitants, the house with its organizational forms received the name "Knochenhaus".
Organic shapes, wild colours, the ingether use of stones, balls and museums that remembered fassades and generally wide lines, all these are typical characteristics for the youth style of Antonio Gaudi.
The fassade of the house plays with traumatic lines, firm colors and textures remembering nature and life.
First of all, it is noted that all of geodies, rhythms, and injury order is controlled.
In the night, the whole fassade is still plastic, dramatic and special lighting increased the glass of the colours.
The same shining lines and dispute shapes also control the internal of the house.
Annually formed wood copys the window frames, landscapes, the doors boards, even gucks and leathers.
The house Batlló in the quarter of Eixample, at the living ships Passeig de Grácia No 43, was designed by the reconstruction of a house from the 1877 architect Emilio Sala Cortese.
The reconstruction took two years in recruitment and was completed in 1906.
The investor, the pleasant industrial Josep Batlló, was originally on the removal of the old and the construction of a complete new building, but finally decided the idea of Gaudís to build an unnecessary and more reward.
The Casa Batll renovated Antoni Gaudí, however, not alone.
He worked together with Josep Mary Jujol architect.
The decoration for the representative apartment of the reality owner and the use of Mosaken at the Fassade was his idea.
However, many other pictures and artists worked on the creation of the Fassade.
The common work for the Casa Batlló was the beginning of a fruitful cooperation of Jujola and Gaudí.
So Jujol also participated in the construction of Gaudís house Casa Milá in the park Güell, in which Antoni Gaudí also belongs to other works.
Soon after his celebration, the house of the inhabitants of his organic forms arrived by the name of the "Knochenhaus".
Others again called the special window opening mechanism because of the "which house".
Moreover, it is said that the sword of the holy garden, the patron of Catalonien.
But also other imagehauery elements symbolize hidden religious motivation.
Gaudí designed the house for the timely unique central heating system with solving canals and typical campaigns.
Something weird is already moving its 45-groad disappearance.
When his creatures ignored Gaudí consequences all the timely construction provisions and no way left it.
For the beginning of building, he introduced the appropriate building authorisation from the city but the information made by him about the planned reconstruction was so valuable that two years later, the city retained by the result that they requested aid.
Among other things, the Council’s Governors argue that the construction and its arrows were even in the public steel.
However, there was no longer, in contrast - only 15 days after the request of the city quarter in this regard, Josep Batlló made a request for the approval of the two highest Stockworks of the house, and it was immediately distributed to him.
The owner himself entered the lower periods.
In the Galerie, on the 2th floor, a society room was located, in the third floor the bedrooms and private rooms of the apartment.
The earth was paid to a Jewish affair.
The whole sixth-style buildings move a trip up to the depth grass.
The basic elements of the transformation have been removed all right winkels and just lines and replaced by throwing walls.
Gaudí also worked with a modern concept for the mutual connection of rooms.
The social part can be completely linked by opening the room gates, and so a greater society could not be able to comply with confidence conversations on certain intimity.
The house received through the construction of Gaudís, outside a new fassade, a right un normal teeth and two other Stockworks.
Impressive is also the Gaudís game with the light and the blue and white glassed chapels that is clothed inside court and the light chambers.
The game of these two colours provides all days of the house a maximum level of light.
In addition, he slighted the principle to use that white reflects better the light than dark colours that absorb the sun in opposite.
The Casa Batlló house, which was taken in 2005 to the Unsco list of the Unsco, can today be visited every man.
In the first Stock, the most pleasant and fair apartment of the public is available.
The households only decided to this step in the year, and that was the 150st day of the famous Creator.
When you found that this is a rightly improving business, the observations are included, so it is also laid down on further common and the housing areas, including the defence.
However, the price for the survey of the building is not a patent style, it is 16.50 euros, students, rentners, groups and owners of tourist exhibition.
This amount exceeds access prices to other Gaudí buses in the city.
Whoever wants to know the real atmosphere of the house with his dragons tour should try to close friendship with one of the households and visit him at home.
The right matrats and the right bedroom? Women have other desires than men
Not the greatest countermees, but the quality of the lie surface - so matratze and roses make the good bed.
However, these must be harmonized to be justified by the desires of the concredible user.
In the choice, many things are playing a role - weight, size, health status and not last of the sex of the slaughter.
It is also important to the interior in which matratze and roses have been understood.
Typical example?
In a weekend in which it is not regularly connected, the latex masters are not well appropriate because they need a lot more long to be "warm".
Furthermore, they are more difficult than the usual polyuretan matrates.
And, they should have been regularly recognized.
In fact, if they don't have enough disappearance cancers in the corner and still stand on a fixed plate, it is not exclusive that it is under its shot.
Of course, the election also plays a role in what is usual.
Whoever was a longer time in the foreign where very high matrates are usually with Weaktory, will be difficult to a low matratze with hard surface.
"When all Eishockey players who came back from the NHL have said they couldn't sleep right here."
"For their disappeared schools, farms and guests they need just a story of Visco-Scaum (Memory Foam - a formal memory-Polymer).
"These I also recommend people who lead to drug diseases under the destruction of the nervous system so they can receive the "informations" from the skins and the hair," says Sylva Hadamcciková, specializing on the polar mumbel.
That's why I've been careful of many Eishockey players for years but also of other customers, these matrates with Visco Scaum (Memory Foam).
"Today this is no problem, because such materials are offered by the manufacturer, the Italian Magniflex company or the Tshirt producer Tropico."
And you do not have to be a famous Eishockey player, to appreciate the benefits of the Visco Scaum.
This wonder is really easy.
The lookup optimizes its hair and shape according to the absorbed warm, otherwise he said that he has the right of the warm body.
Nowhere it presses, in the night you don't go around like after a serious fight.
You just sleep a lot better.
The viskolastic view also offers protection from Dekubitus (Wundbrand).
In the selection of the matrix size, the size of the body should still be adjusted to the length of the footsounds, i.e. approximately 21 to 34 cm.
Man as a woman who are in the 180 cm large need a 210 to 220 cm long bed.
Each of the chargers should be available at least 90 cm width, so as 180 cm.
In individual beds, for example, at Singles, 120 to 140 cm are placed.
The comfort is half and also for some visitors.
On the other hand, the following provisions for the ideal bed width: "When you are on the back, it should still be enough for the easy arms," Rät Ing. Helena Prokopová, the teenager of the Polsters and the space exchange, which has been the problem of healthy sleep and the ergonomie of Mubels, and is also proposing this subject on schools.
In a double bed, everyone needs a own rock and his own matratze, but adapts to the purchase, so that the matrates are also high.
Otherwise, nothing remains else other than mounting the rocks in different heights and it is not possible for each subject.
Lookmateriates should be at least 14 cm high, matrates with federal cell 15 cm, which are at least three centimeters on the form and the phenomenon.
"To the hand or to the place, the Feders may not stop any case," warned Helena Prokopová.
Each matratze requires a special rock type.
Full-shaped beds with matrats and accommodation such as adult seams have nothing to search in the bedroom.
These matrixes do not lie, and the reference can't wear what's going and gone today.
And when one night we lose between 0,2 to 0.75 l sweet, it is clear that the matratze after five to seven years will be slowly to a huge (and sweet seven).
For this reason, special advertisers who promise a lifetime of up to 25 years, even life-time guarantees.
Every thing she has even and but.
And this is why a practical Council of the guests: at the matrates of 120 or 140 cm width, you should not have the hygiene of the hygienes of the weakable, disappearable beachs, but it is recommended to use a matratic scanner that can easily disappear and beat.
Even today, though the matrasets are manufactured with a ransom board, so you will receive two halfs after opening (which important for the washing process and the washing machine size!), the manipulation with larger matrates, especially on the same, often includes the unlike fight between David and Goliath.
Did they have a fixed plate in bed instead of a rock?
Get out of it!
Or at least for a bed for unleavened guests and one night.
They should also look like the plates with the leathers (without they are no dry) and matrates with federal clothes and 15 cm minimize height with so-called cups and feinpolsters.
Polyurethan matrates are not containing such a container.
For non-numberable latex and cokos roses of 14-18 Federal bars (Lamelles), the latex or sandwich matrixs are appropriate (e.g. also combinations of latex and cokos), it is always paying reds with a larger number of lattones, such as 28 and more federal bars, with Lordose support in the lenner area and the possibility to regulate the lat-horns.
On calculable lame roses, there are no matrates with federal cell, since they do not respond to the ergonomic constitution.
In addition to the setting of the Federal Bars, special flexible school modules are also prescribed.
This aims at a special functioning of the Federal Bars that allows the printing of the Federal Bars, or even so degrading that they can allow the point of injury of the pillar.
On behalf of men with wide schools, a important thing.
There are even matrix producers that have started use in "herren matrix" means for school areas.
The girls are also thinking - they are able to be able to make these grounds in the pool.
For the most powerful customers, the point-lastic flood systems (Lattoflex) or rocks with pointelastic contact pads with such multitorsion feeding.
The pressure is divided in several points, which reduces the spining.
But - if you use the right matratze and the right rock a bad (so large and full) heads, most benefits are lost again.
There is also a false rules: the head should help the head, his skins should only be rich until the schoolers so that they can relax the shot muscles.
Ideal therefore appears a 50 x 60 cm large skills, for example, how it likes the scandinavier.
In the page area, the heads (along with the school loading zone in the rock or the weather zone) should be compared to the level of the skull.
Something of our modern matrats have been shared with the others (with hou filled) storms.
Modern producers always use of natural materials or at least of their attractions.
Also at Matraten, the new "Bio" word is "Bio".
It is used to produce polyurethanic oils in the steel, for example, rizinus and soja oil.
Soja is probably used by all known producers.
"Bio's name in Matraten, which consists of its corners of natural origins in nature," says Peter Vašíček by the company Tropico Plus.
Natural materials are also used in the manufacture of matracetics - one of the first was Aloe Vera.
However, it can also be added to microscopes that are widespread during the sleep of fresh forest or milk.
There is also a difference between man and woman.
During the men a "cool" plant extract is used from a cheese tablet to enhance the warmness and can cut the body, the beachs for women have "wärmed" effect.
Extras from red paprikaschotes plung the blood cycle, which is the worst sex when sleeping, so it is quietly calm.
And today's the favorites?
Matrates from Kaltschaum (a larger gates with destroyed cell structure and is therefore more active than trade polyuretan and much more flexible).
By combination of the various steafs (heat) of calf shoes and viscos clothes, more demon matrates that know exactly where heads, hairs and feeds are found.
However, for a high quality matratze you have 7,000 krons and more.
However, health materials are usually charged with less value tax, since they are used as medical aid.
As the first Tsjish company, Gumotex has been granted this benefit.
Seeing the matratze and the rock is not so easy.
Go and again there are special offers of producers and feeders that offer two matrates to price of one.
So the brand offers the Matratze Duofreeze with reference to the Visco-Shaum Memory for 11.990 CZK.
The second gets free of it.
It was the material temperature which introduced the sane of the viscoselastics with open cell structure and high density nearly cosmic time.
No wonder, but they have been developed for NASA, because the astronautes are enormous overlays at the start.
The temperature is wearing in warming, in a hot mile it renews himself again.
So it is perfect to the human body and divides optimumly the pressure of the body.
Therefore, it is not only ideal to prevent pressure, but generally increase the comfort of sleep.
Viskoelastic materials are used not only in matrates but also in other health products, such as in special footballs that should provide the feeds and equipment easy.
Inland manufacturers, for example, use the Eucatherm C, Twinsaver or similar products.
Anyway more parents want people supervisory devices to control the kids
The fear of their own children grows, and so they are always encouraging parents to monitor them by GPS.
The system, which was found originally for the designation of cars, can also be good for people, what would also be helpful in such cases, as in the unlawful desires of the nine years of Anička Janatková.
The device is currently so large as a cigarette chain but soon it should not be greater than a armbander.
Many people have turned the case of the destroyed anicleka in fear and fear and thus keep them on means and ways of view to protect their children better.
Also for the price of an intimidation of its privates.
"We are trying to all to say that there is no way about herum pioneers, but to reduce the probability that it comes to the tragedy," Peter Pilin leads from the company Macro, one of the providers of GPS management devices on the Czech market.
"I add that, in the case of the use of such devices, it may be possible, for example, if you put someone into the cup without that he knows, but we had no such case until now."
"Much as the customers are actually buying it from security," Pilin added.
The child should always know what the purpose is to serve and how to use it in the emergency.
However, the children psychology Dana Bočková shows that a child is not able to take such a thing, it simply gets it.
"And very small children show large creativity if it is about to lose some things in a way if they don't want to be controled."
"The telephones started with great expectations, but they will easily turn away as these new monitoring devices," says Mrs Bočková.
It is also contrary to whether such a institution is actually helping an attack.
"With planned findings, the Kidnapper is practically controlled if the child has any electronic with which it could be done."
"Today, it's the mobile."
"If such monitoring devices were starting more wide use, they would also seek them because their sale would be safely involved by massive advertising."
"In these cases, the police licensees are always a step", says the psychology.
However, it assess that similar devices can be able to be through helpful use of a pidophile.
According to the Society RC Monitoring Services as well as for the car and for persons, the existence of the device can also be helped when it is immediately disappeared after the attack.
"The device can be established so that it is reported to certain interactions."
"Although it was immediately disappeared, at least the last position of the person concerned is available."
"It is even an integrated relaxing measurement, which means if you're absent and moved without movement, the device immediately sends a warning under the position," said Mr. ◆ech.
Its view could also provide smart mobile phones with navigation, and only play a special software.
The problem of the current location devices is that it is either about devices in the wooder sizes, such as attachers or smaller mobiles.
It's always like this risk that you lose it.
According to the Macro Weil, Mr Pilin is therefore tested in the present devices that appear as normal digital tubes.
"There is the advantage that the eventual must not be recognized that it is a supervision or location device.
"Ow he knows that after a certain time, what the police gives a time-by-case," he adds.
The same technology is always used in which the development goes - to arm countries or attachers.
So to combine the location function using the GPS system (when the Navi in the car) and the function of a mobile cell that reports the current position.
The army has so many decades that you could develop twice, but you can keep only two years
The Czech Army has bought 445 kilometres of cottons and has been added with particles.
In the previous year, the Ministry of Defence had delivered 224 kilometres to the armour.
It is very exciting to know that the war forces have earned for 225 years.
The problem is only the sustainability of the darks - two, but at least four years.
The army bought the twinsmans from the Acting Society STV Group, as well as for Latin 40 million krones.
In his complaint for the sale of this huge amount, the General Box MF DNES answered, the soldiers would use the 60 kilometres of twice annually.
According to the research of Armeeepy-Technicals, MF DNAS said that the whole army has to resolve a most intensive pyrotechnical training - from all the generals and officials of the army Commander until the Secretariats and Putzfrau.
Defence Minister Alexander Vandra and Arme General Vlastimil Picek did not exclude.
Only so the significant use of sixty kilometres has been justified in half of the year.
In other words, this length corresponds to 25,000 detonations.
But this would also be rich for more than ten years.
However, if the old rules of experts apply that every new professional soldiers are completely reached by two meters of twice, then the army have created a comprehensive Council for those 225 years, under the view of the increased need of pionier and specialities.
As soon as soldiers of the rapid usebridge, by the ministry of the Defence of Vandra, had almost no grounds for handy arms, so they have been limited to the lack of resources because of the missing resources.
To worry from the sub-hot.
"We don't even enter why they buy such ungodliness from us."
But this is finally their decision, they will already know what they need."
"For us, the army is a good customer that we want to meet as a handier," said the distribution manager of the STV Group Jan Dčcký.
Jan Pejšek, the speaker of the Ministry of Defence, founded the purchase of hundred kilometres of twice, which the army had been invented at least ten years with this "Munition".
However, Jan Dčcký by the STV Group said only about a four-year-old use period of shocks and police and army-syrotechnics only for two years.
"There perfect campaigns are also possible for the four years mentioned," says one of them, but who wants to remain unfair to be a soldier not considered the criteria of the army.
After the end of the time of use, every munition must be discovered strictly whether it is still reliable and not the life of the soldiers.
However, these tests are not obsolete, but are costing another money.
Another argument of the Ministry of Defence is the quantity of the 445 kilometres of twice.
"They costed us sixty percent less than the last year delivery of 244 kilometres," shared us, speakers Pejšek, the position of the vendors of the Ministry of Defence.
Only comparison: The annual use of pyrotechnics of the police, the Munition from the Second World War or the Soviet Soviet Soviet Silver, over a few years over.
And the police always provides only the amounts of this munition that it can consume before the end of the time of use.
The safety of the pyrotechnics is also due to the possibility of flexibility to buy more modern and therefore open to reliable damages.
The Ministry of Defence has unfortunately huge problems at the license of ten thousand tonnes Munition from the Warschauer Treaty, which prepared two hundreds of the Czechoslovakian People's Arms on their field to Rhein.
According to the Pyrotechnicians, MF DNAS, the Tsychian war forces in a few years hoped the same problem in the liquidation of hundreds of kilometres old shots, which she has bought today so well.
Today, the contacts I have gained thanks to the competition
The serial location in the competition "Cleinonders of the year" helped Lukáš Pytloon to sell the Franchise of his hotel.
The winner of the past year's competition "Clein operator of the year" was Lukáš Pytloun from Liberec.
The story of his success focuses on a film center.
Lukáš Pytloun has been loved.
First in the outside, he was known that it was missing in Freeec in good overseas opportunities for good prices.
It was an building house with five apartments.
You think that he was a high school student at the sixth seminar, that was certainly a curiosing charge.
"The timely price quality relations hurt me and I tried to take something to do", says Lukáš Pytloun.
The first reconstructed apartment, he allowed foreign workers.
He immediately invested into the house, which then built step for steps to pension with 54 beds.
In only seven years enterprising activities in Liberec four pensions, opening two skilled restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of over 300 beds of all accommodation categories.
The most comfortable of them was the "Pytloun Design Hotel".
In that year there was another classic hotel.
"We have signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tisé that we sold our Franchise concept and have already reported other interests at the Pytloun Hotels' Franchise", says the company number one of the past year.
"Green part of this licensing sale of hotels had just recognized the victory in the competition "Amployer of the year", Mr. Pytloon added.
The victory has made him greater awareness, so popularity in Liberec and Surrounding.
"The people recognized me on the street, often they grateled me at night, and I have to say that it was right," he remembers.
I really recommend all those who want to create something to participate in this competition.
You don't need to win equally, every viewing is good.
He says he'd benefit from the contacts and competences to which otherwise it wouldn't come.
"In some people I have affected the competition, I have maintained regular business relations to this day."
The peace of his success is also put on every one of his employees.
And there he's the seventy.
"I notice more loyalty and privilege that they are part of something that will be shared to the general recognition."
I really see this not only as a personal success, but that is the result of the good work of all of us."
"My name is just in the pretext," Lukáš Pytloun said.
My followers want a year more quiet when we had it in Farmet
The seed-uphory was rapidly solved from the consequences of the crisis.
Thanks to his goal, Farmet has the worst back.
The price for the first race of Vodafone competition company in the past year took Karel ◆árský, the company owner of Farmet.
The jury at the same time appreciated the efforts he made out of the small tool construction in ◆eská Skalice a company from the ground, which makes hundreds of millions of changes.
"I can say that this objection is not only myself, but also all my employees, and has strengthened our self-consciousness in the fight with competition," says the previous year's memory.
At the beginning of Farmet's company story, the efforts to make something useful.
And when then the State had made his father Karel 周árský as a competence for the ownership of which the Communists offered a small workshop to the carrier, he left his carrier in the company where he had been employed, and founded with a few cameras of his father's father's own company for the production of plastic waists.
Soon later they began to concentrate on plant oil pressures.
In 18 years, they have increased the largest automatically producer throughout the Mediterranean.
But only through the success in the competition mentioned and its medialization, it is also in the consciousness of the non-competence.
"Nothing only that our customers accept the Farmet now clearly intense, even our foreign partners began to work with a company who has the greatest success in their country to add greater value," says Karel ◆árský.
However, the past year Farmet was not only in the sign of the vigeeuphory.
The clarification was made from the economic results of the company in 2008 and one part of 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for sale of tool construction products.
The crises that were still less than the citizens, but especially the enterprises reached their high point - many companies were forced to put their investment projects and to reduce the purchase of new institutions and technologies.
"With of course, we couldn't have disappeared this situation."
"The changes have returned to 40 percent, we had to reduce the production and even to delimitation," says Karel 周árský
A viable enterprise should also be taken with such unpopular measures.
However, it was expected to get the situation in the grif and keep the company in the black numbers, even with less profits than before the crisis.
In one of the companies, it was not intended to take part in the investments in research and development.
"We built a centre of research and education, and we improve our presentation on international currencies and increased main prices in domestic exhibitions," says ◆árský.
It is all that we have overcome the crisis.
The circumstances are growing again and also the number of new employees.
"The new winner I want much joy at the vineyard - but in quiet atmosphere," makes Karel ◆árský.
A question of views covered by non-individual regulations
The question of the "absurance of the year" is the fourth part of the undertaking law law.
Some unsinnial rules have already been made to create out of the world.
For the doubtful winner of the next year's consideration question "Assurance of the year", the obligation to create documents on the authorities available online.
Thus decided more than a third of not over four thousand undertakings.
The social insurance manager requested a paper out of the trade register, even if the officer could have called him by two mouse climates.
The question of the opinion is now changed.
"The Tskchy's social insurance management will not require any exemptions from the trade register in the future," the speaker of the RESSSZ Jana Bura月ová has added.
The meaning and purpose of the view of "absolute of the year" is to take all regulations and rules under the luxury to comply with the undertakings in Tsishchych and to resume the unrealised rules.
This is already a fourth part of an undertaking law, which is organised by Tsh. Economic (HN) and enjoys growth in the public.
In the past year, three thousand people were involved in the vote, this year had been four thousand.
There are no wonders because there are still a lot of legal obligations that serve the only and only to avoid business activity.
"What is about the number of revenue tax forms, we take a previous race into the world", notes Karel Havlíček by the agreement of small and medium-sized enterprises and operators of the Czech Republic.
The simplification of undertakings is the final goal of all governments in the last years.
However, in comparison to the world, the situation in Tsjish has not been provided.
According to the World Bank, Tschech in relation to the conditions of the company, 74. Rang introduces a worse place in comparison to the previous year.
The survival of competition was first called in the year and each year plays the same scenario every year.
Each man can report from April to the editing of the competition end of September, administrative and Brazilic unsins from April to the end of September.
To registrate the www.firmaroku.ccz. then the site is looking for seven candidates for the "Antiprisis" and allows the public on the www.firmaroku.ccz/absurada and www.ihned.cz to vote.
It's the disappearance that most votes receive.
In this year, more than one hundred are reported, exactly said, 105 without fair rules and rules.
The tips are not only by undertakings, but also by professionals and journalists.
In the named "Finalists" of the competition, for example, the provisions that the maintenance vehicles for cars and swimming roads have to be paid or that companies with twenty employees, two offices and two toilettes have to provide every two years.
The directory of this year 'Sept' is published on the sides of the competition.
The vocation of competition every beginning November on the Prager Wenzels place is part of a prison to participate regularly in political and public life personalities.
In this year, for example, Eva Svobodová, the Director of the Contracting Party of Small or Mediterranean Companies and Trade of the Republic, and the President of the Czech Chamber, on the point of the competition with the party.
"When the State runs the enterprises between the knocks, it can't give a real economic disappearance, so it is my goal to put up at least thirty-year paragraphs, which are still unnecessary to the undertakings today," said Martin Kocourek, Minister of Industry and Trade.
The efforts to create unsinnial rules from the world shows effect.
In 2007, most of the undertakings had the obligation to notify the operator on the place of its special operational site three days before the intention to run with an exhibition to an exhibition or Kirmes.
This obligation was increased by the power of a novel of the producer law.
The obligation to receive the second largest number of votes in 2007 - the obligation to report to the employee of employees' employees at the end to 30 days - was deleted by the law on them. "Green Card".
And - all good things are three:
To the resurrection of 2009, the regulation adopted by Physiotherapietes to be a spider in the speaking room, a kitchen and two people.
This Regulation was missed by the Ministry of Health in this year by some measures - the coal obligation was disappeared.
A new category values socially responsible companies
Evaluation criteria are humanitarian, environmental, education or sport projects
In this year, a new year's fifth end of the economic period of competition (HN) is the category "the accountable company of 2010".
The principle of this competition is to promote firm and fair emphasis.
"We would like to support these companies that are aware of the impact of your undertakings to the environment and support socially accountable initiatives", says Patrik Bartholdy, the regional manager of the Mobilfunk Company Vodafon, the designer and guarantee of this competition, as well as the competition "Rebell of the year".
For the first year of these specific subcategories of the Main Vodafon company of the year, companies reported to which the success is not the only long-term goal.
The story of each of them is extremely inspired and cut enough substances for a separate article.
Although they are disabilized in the matter of their diametral activity, their efforts have a common nervious support and acknowledgement.
This is an example of persons responsible for personal problems or health of their own employees.
Among the fourteen finalists of all the Czechs, for example, the practical software company and Netera, which promotes non-formal sport teams among their employees, which then participate in numerous tours in different sports types.
Another example of a comprehensive company from the Pardubice region is the company of Isolit-Bravo, which has been a principal fund for children detained for seventeen years.
A paper manufacturing of Podćbrady is also predominantly concerned about her health-related employees who produce 70 percent of their authorities, for which it has been appreciated with the title "Administration Managing Competences of the Mediterranean Region"; in the competition of Vodafone company of the year, the third part of this region was designed.
In the Region of Olomouc, the bookmark MiRyz Soft, which introduced a flowing and also a period of 35 hours per week, and this was without proper payment.
The jury also honored the fact that the company is buying a pre-development in the Czech producers, supporting citizen initiatives in their environment and working after environmental principles.
"We are seeking to recycling as much as possible to keep the consequences of our undertakings and administration for the environment possible," said her business leader Miluše Ryznarová.
The competence of the IT responsibilities login from the Ustí Naad Labo is backed to the health of its employers and therefore has taken them to all notes of the ergonomic Sessel and keyboards, and also promotes them in their employees' households and business activities that Cartering Services are ordered by a home-defended workshop.
"We also support the "Mens in Not", which provides concrete assistance to the green Rome community", says Ondćej searchý, representative of the company.
Lastly, the activity of the cleaning mark "Praní a čištãní" is also referred to in the Carlsbader Region, which contributes to their employees in the form of extra banks insurance.
"We will grant our employees' contributions to the deployment, the workweg, the increased qualification and the vacation", says Josef Strapáč by the Baumark Czasch from Bruntal, the winner in the Mediterranean Czech region.
To the category of responsibilities, the year’s competence company was automatically informed all creditlists of the competition of Vodafone company of the year that responds to the questions of the questionnaire submitted and sent it later until 15 August to the Institute.
The questionnaire has been excluded by the agency of the evaluation.
"When the representatives of the lawyers have left the questions, they were excluded by the competition of the "competence of the year" under the main statutory company of the year, but they have not been disqualified."
"A separate registration is not only possible because it is only a subcategory of the main statutory company of the year", says Karel Goldman from the organised agent Bison & Rose.
Plesner ground fund - Police decisions in public description
In the building of the ground fund in Pilsen, the anti-corruption police took before the last days of festival.
The famous media owner and real estate village Luboš G. was carried out from the detectives in hands.
This was likely attempt to manipulate a exactly established public competition for the development of refunds in order to fill the principles offered by competition a concrete interest.
This should have paid for a half million.
"To this time, I can only confirm that the police follows a person because of the delicate delicate mask in a public competition," said Antony Eugeneá, the chief of the Pilsner State Administration of the Právo, could not provide further details in terms of the current investigations.
On 24 hours later, the police undertaking was resolved by the 46-year-old.
In the way he could manage the public competition, only can be speculated in view of the special official information.
The Lubomír's ground fund has added the question of Právo, which the police has actually taken conclusions at the Pilsner side of the ground fund and that during a public competition.
"It was about a client and mixed about one of our employees," she concreased.
In accordance with the correct title of “Administration for the offer of claims to translate basic materials under the law of the ground”, it would be done in cases where several applicants would demonstrate interest in the proposed basis.
"These persons offer a higher value of their refund claims to be compared by the transmission as the basic value. "
"In response to the proposed claim, the scope of the potential purchaser will be determined, and then the ground fund transmits the ground on the person with the highest offer," said the Fund's speaker.
Luboš G. clearly provided information on the invitation and since he had been a powerful person, because he had bought a number of refunds, he wanted to admit to a basic interest in the competition.
Obviously against a fifth deficiency.
This would also be a sufficient declaration why he had such a large amount of money at its determination.
Luboš G. had so good contacts on the Pilsner ground fund.
He also played in the Cause of the previous Foundation Chair of Václav Sankota, a role that has been pursued in criminal proceedings in restitutions which have already been dealt with positions on construction projects.
Luboš G. from the ground fund, for example, foundations designed to build public roads, said more precisely in the place where the construction of the planned planned to the Borské Pole region was planned.
Afterward he introduced this very favourable with the Master Council against a house directly in the historical center of the city, which overlooked the value of the foundations.
The Council’s House had at the same time a serious heart-sharing payment to the construction project not threatened by blocking the elements.
The housing costs of households rise around some hundreds of monthly
Budgets must be calculated not only with higher costs for all energy species, but also with higher water and water costs, and for television and certain waters.
Familys will have to take more than 100 krones from the portmony since January.
The road will be 4,6 percent of worse, gas is about 2 percent and more, in some cities, you will need to pay more for water supply and also protect the telecommunications.
Alongside the fuel temperature, the households are costing a few hundred krones more.
The Starkstrom prices have been reduced by all main providers, therefore the debt is the significant promotion of the stromer production from renewable sources, namely from photovoltaic plants.
Gas will only be slower, but that is exactly when people need to get out of the most and have the highest use.
So here is also to calculate some hundred krones more than a year.
During the fuel and gas in the whole Czechs, the prices for telecommunications from city are different from town.
Besides larger places, price increases are planned.
For example, the households in Pardubice and Hradec Králové must pay more than 50 krones from January to more than 1000 krones per year in Liberec.
The inhabitants of Prague backwards 9% higher water and water costs, and this is the case that the city increases the infrastructure measure.
If the wheat doesn't change, it's just 6,8 percent.
The price in Prague is, however, in comparison to twice, also continues to the lower.
In the northern area, where prices are now the highest, the water and water costs must increase by 7.4 per cent.
Enorme food increases are expected, for example, in 140,000 degrees of accommodation, which are deprived from January.
For example, the apartment of CPI Byty, which is in Ustí Labo 2500 apartments, has an increase in 100 percent from January.
Who does not agree with this ageing, the company will directly interest the company.
The regular money that you're still paying in approximately 300,000 apartments should be increased next year for more than 10 percent.
Czechy children drunk with television and Roman Bier is out - it's just doing too slow
Ferrett, Rom and Wodka, also a good whisky that has shot the father out of the housebar.
These are the beverages which have to be treated after the genius of Tschech teenagers under five and ten most frequently.
There are no exceptions for children that have to get their cats again in the hospital.
This includes the experiences of doctors that are compared with similar cases in the adoption of children's divisions of clips.
"Best or wine are completely out of the mode, because it's just a long time until you're driving."
"The current trend is clearly hard alcohol," said Právo Ludćk Pelikán, the Chief of the Child Division in the Mediterranean Clinic Hooovice.
"Whisky, if it's enough to escape a flat out of the housebar, and if not, at least television or Wodka.
"Wodka has the benefit that you can miss him with juice, then he doesn't hurt so strong," said the Chefarzt.
Motol Eva Jurinvá has right to speak in the special hospital.
"But most often it's about television or Roman."
"This is the today's alcoholdtrend, namely at basic schools."
"Slibowitz is also aware of the slibowitz that you're taking from home," she added Jurinova.
According to Chefarzt Pelikan, three-10-year-old trinkers are not long for exception.
Before the Clinic in Hoaovice, where he worked this year, he was working for ten years in the Pédiatrie Division of the Motol hospital, where the rescue-creased schools were delivered from Nah and Tele.
"A girl had to be hospitalized four times."
"There Karriere began with 12 years when she first began with 3,5 promille alcool in blood and still in combination with extase," the doctor described a particularly serious case.
"It was in the exhibition area in Holešovice on any of your Tanzparty."
"The interesting person was that her mother didn't even sure she didn't come home for 48 hours," the Chefarzt wondered.
The lacking interest of parents or their unbelievable tolerance is applicable as one of the main reasons for the growing alcoholism of children.
For a real independence in the real sense of the word, there is no experts according to children.
"Under alcoholism is a long-year chronic independence of alcohol and all related phenomenon and this is not the case of these children."
For those who renew alcohol, it is mostly a negative family-social background characteristic", says Chefarzt Pelikán.
The speaker of the hospital Motol, Ms. Jurinvá, was found to be around the middle of November about fourty-made children in the green department for children and youth.
However, only the cases with severe alcohol disappearance that needed a hospital stay are entered into statistics.
Injured children who are brought to the police after ambulance treatment by parents or, if appropriate, are not registered.
In addition to the cases in which children are only drinking a flat snap in the school bank, we consider Mr Pelikán's three-year-time amplitudes, which is a hundred-year-old appointment: Walpurgisnacht, Silvester and the end of school year.
"The latest name from two reasons - or from a jacket because of the bad witness or of joy on the holidays."
"In the Walpur magazine, I have also experienced seven dedicated children once in the season," said Dr. Pelikán.
A disagreed child who dragges the night under medicine is paradoxly better than a child who has only fighting with an unmatched chamber on the next day.
The pains of head at the morning after the dehydration and the glucose manager can be disagred in the hospital with an independent infusion with glucose and drugs that mixes the organism.
"They are clearly better on them, because after the "wrath" experience at the evening, they're moving with good lane, without that anything wearing."
"It's just something disappointed about where they are," Dr. Pelikán said, "when he needs the patients with at least a good lame by accounting them the costs it'll cost.
Because the transport with the saving car and the night in an achat bed is well and pleased at a few ten thousand kronen.
"Hein and again, I used this as a educational resource when I told the children directly at the visits, what has affected their reliability and that it can happen that she's gotta work all the holidays to get money for one such feet," said Dr. Pelikan.
However, his view is not to the hospitals in order to require the need for healing the children needed to be healed from the parents.
Two training flights L-159 first in foreign hand - in Spain
Two easy flights L-159 from the total five of the Tschech Defence Minister against the transport flight Casa C-295M are flood in the Spanish city of Sevilla, where the Spanish aircraft Casa - EADS seats.
It's the first time that there are machines of this type in possession of a strange army.
They were just to see managers or air shows in the foreign country.
This is about the flowable dose version L-159T1 operated by the Czech Army.
The remaining three aircrafts are only L-159.
These are now a conservator in the Aero Vodochody, the Omnipol company has taken her last week.
When she expresss the aircraft from Vodochody, Jan Pejšek is not yet known according to the Defence Minister.
The used flights L-159 were re-equipped from long-term aircraft and this without any other installations and investments in the department's resort.
"The two-sessions L-159T1 have been exchanged in the current state and view," said Pejšek of the Právo Zeitung.
He added that the army will not have to go out without twice battle flights, since the Ministry of Defence in May 2009 signed a 200 million contract on the conversion of four overflow L-159 to the second version.
A new aircraft has taken the arms in July, the second wants to take over until the end of this year.
Following Pejšek, EADS has ought to translate battery vessels into the equipment of one of the NATO countries.
"In the contract, it is clear that the EADS carriers of aircraft is L-159 and that they should serve them to training pilots of NATO countries.
"There is therefore the case of the applicant how he realizes the thing," made Pejšek.
The economic period (HN) had previously reported that the Spanish Government had no interest in the L-159.
The Taxi Trade of 5 L-159 against a vehicle Casa and the sale of additional aircraft for 3,5 billion Kronen in the past year was still granted by the Miek Topolanek Government.
The Ministry of Defence had not described any provisions for the sale but said directly to EADS.
The timely defence responded, this rate will support the future export of the L-159 foreign.
The Czech army bought Aero 72 machines from which they used only 24, the rest she wanted to expose.
On the other hand, the sale of Casa aircraft should also have a legal play.
The European Commission has denied the Tskchical Defence Minister at the European Court of Justice: the reason that the aircraft should be chosen by a whole European description and withdrawn by a single producer.
The army has already taken three aircraft Casa, which will last in four ten days on the Kbely Airport.
A long-sheet finger than ring finger means a lower risk to affect cancer
Mans whose screen fingers are clearly unlikely affected by prostatacrebs.
This is the surprise result of a study published in the middle of the British Journal of Cancer.
This must be along with the skill of the man's hormone Testosteron.
"Our results show that the relative length of fingers can serve as a simple test for the risk of prostatacrebs, and that is namely among men and sixty," said the co-autorin of the study, Ros Eeles, professor of the cancer research Institute at Warwick.
The finger could be able to assess what men should be subject to a prostatacreb steel, especially when genetic risks or other risk factors, such as family health loads, added Ele.
During the period 1994-2009, she followed her colleagues in Britains more than 1500 patients with prostatacrebs, but also 3000 healthy men.
In more than half of the students of the study, the test finger of the right hand was shorter than the ring finger.
For these men the same probability of prostatacrebs, such as for 19 percent of those men whose Ring and Zeague fingers were equally long.
However, the risk was about 33 percent, in men to sixty-six percent.
The relationship of the length of the two mentioned fingers, which are already formed in the prenatal age, clearly reflects the different ranges of gender hormones that the child was equipped in the marriage.
Mine Testosteron corresponds to a longer show finger.
Earlier research shows that the teststeron accelerates the growth of prostat actors.
Václav Pačes, Chief Tschech Genetiker and earlier President of the Academy of Sciences, said to him, if this study is well known, yet he noticed the relationship between the finger long and the cancer risk.
Czech in the snow - D1 and D5 are closed
Like the largest part of Europe, Tschechy also stands on Thursday's morning under a snowest.
On the streets and movements, the winter servicers were a lot of the whole night on the Achse.
The D5 carway between Kilometers 89 and 90 in direction Rozvadov is closed by some accidents of Lkws and Pkws and the D1 at Brno in Prag.

The generals hope that this new automatic weapon affects the external conflict with the Taliban and causes the powerful relationship to their benefits.
The new weapon is something like a supergenous canone.
Indeed, your projects will be given by Laser with a meeting security of only a few meters in the target.
The specific heats of Kaliber 25 mm that have been developed for this weight and contained high explosive glucose materials are practical as small granates.
The thresholds can be programmed so that they can not only explode on the goal but at a popular point of their Ballistic aircraft.
This means you can use it against a enemy who prevents itself behind a wall or in the protected grave.
From above, it is not usually protected, so it can easily place it out of feed.
According to Richard Audett, who participated in the development of the XM-25, the new warrant is the first infantry weapon that uses "intelligent" technologies.
"The soldier is taken in the meaning of this way: he is watching the goal and sending a Laser Street that determines the delivery, so he has a precise visa point to which he corrects the increase wind, then it only needs to be depressed.
"Let's say, you've eating 543 m."
"If you're pressed, the weapon opens and appears the weight on the disappearance of 543 meters at least one or three meters.
400 jobs are delayed
The Conzern Fujitsu moves its release to Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
In July the next year, 400 employees will be located in the Astro Park of Marienbader place at Bad Homburg in the Astro Park.
The Japanese Conzern Fujitsu moves its release to Bad Homburg to Frankfurt.
As participated on computers and their maintenance in the middle of July 400 women and men are engaged in their workplace from the arrival home at the Marienbader location in Bad Homburg in Astro Park, which is a great office complex on the Leyoner Street in Frankfurter city of Niederrad.
A speaker of Fujitsu explained, in mid-termly, there should be further 100 jobs of the concert that are distributed to the region.
The offer was extremely attractive, as well as the large space buses in the Astro Park of the working ways of employees.
Also in Bad Homburg, Fujitsu was only Mieter.
Bernd Wagner said: "We found a central location with excellent infrastructure."
The exceptional accession to airports is just important for a global company such as Fujitsu.
The new movement of an important company within the region shouted joy at the winners and disappearance at the losses.
Frankfurter Economic Deputy Markus Frank (CDU) said that a "Global Player" was again won.
This is a "grown location knowledge".
Fujitsu passes to the city, the accommodation is an important immunity for Niederland.
Bad Homburger Oberbürger Michael Korwisi (The Green) declined the decision of Fujitsu.
The city is early informed by the business guide on the intention.
"We of course offered our help to the company," said Corwisi.
However, the festival contacts could not change the difficulties of the computer producer with the owner of the real estate at the Marienbader place.
Lastly, economic reasons would have given the explanation.
Now it is about to prevent a long level of discipline in this kind of prominent place.
"I hope the owner and owner of the building is cooperative."
The Fujitsu house was used in the Council House and the nearest "Cleine vertical" belonged to the remaining buildings at the Marienbader place ten years ago to the most overwhelming construction projects of the City.
As a common project of the city and a private project developer, a new city centre was designed between the Bahnhof and the Council House, which was due to the massive construction of the former parts used as a parking area and the height of the buildings for critics.
2001 the advertising and Rating companies Feri, the software manufacturer for travel distribution systems, the start Amadeus, and the computer producer still related to Siemens Fujitsu are homes.
The building used by Fujitsu was bought by the Frankfurter Deutsche Immobilien-Chancen Group together with the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and a year later sold the Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid.
The Fujitsu Consulars in Tokio are the third largest IT producers of the world.
It provides firms for example computer and servers and also provides the necessary service.
However, Fujitsu is one of the largest in Germany, weitaus more employed in München.
From Bad Homburg, the filia company Fujitsu Technology Solutions in Frankfurt-Nederland enterprises that other daughter companies in this location should be Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS.
For this, Astro Park was mixed at 7000 square metres in the office building.
In the twenty-year-old complex, the name plays on its original basic risk, among others, the central electronic and electronic industry has been seated.
Amazon sperrt server - drugs against Assange
Wikileaks device increased in concern.
The Amazon Internet Service Browser has rejected the integration platform from its servers.
It may result in political pressure after publication 100 thousand secret diplomates.
Wikileaks-Grender Assange is well opening in England.
The Wikileaks Reference platform is always more than decisions in the United States.
The best Internet activities lost access to their current American server and are now looking for an Internet home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called other countries and companies to the Boykot of Wikileaks.
And the Wikileaks Greenship Julian Assange, which is on the list of interpol, should be held after a newspaper report in Britain.
"Am Amazon Server dismissed."
"Free Rede in the country of the Frees", the Enthusiasm's most activities by short-time message service Twitter on Wednesday (Orts time) included.
The Amazon Wikileaks' Internet Undertaking had recently rejected its servers the Wikileaks document.
The best of the Internet's activities were in the publication of the secret diplomatic despects on the Amazon Web Service (AWS) to enable the high access numbers to the documents.
By Twitter, Wikileaks continued to step: "Prima - our dollars are now released to employ people in Europe."
If Amazon has such a problem with the liberty, "They stopped to sell books."
Amazon has stopped the use of his server by Wikileaks after workers of Senator Joe Lieberman studies, the CNN teachers reported on the Office of Liebermans.
The Chairman of the Headquarters Committee for Headquarters had pushed Amazon with a Boykott, reported the British "Guardian".
"I would like to have Amazon's greater measure in view of previous publications of information classified by Wikileaks," said the Senator.
Dearman therefore called for the platform also in other countries to defend the use of servers.
"Wikileaks' illegal, unfair and unfair action sets our national security on the game and threatens about the Globus life," says it in a communication of the participative senator.
"It is a comprehensive company - whether American or foreign - Wikileaks should help in its efforts to disseminate stolen material."
Wikileaks-Grender Assange, which is searched for the defence of the authorities in Sweden, is on the list of interpol.
After a report of the London Journal "The Independent" the 39-year-old Australian in Britains, the exact place is known by Scotland Yard.
The Internet activity has always described the reports in Sweden as intrigue of his gentlemen.
Wikileaks speaker Kristinn Hrafnsson said in London, it was drugs.
"And there was a call after a murder of Julian Assange."
That's why he was fearing for his security, said Hrafnsson.
The Wikileaks grain will therefore be hidden.
Hrafnsson was evidently reacted to explanations from North America.
In America, the former republic Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, was invited to appeal and appoint the liabilities of the Wikileaks.
In Canada, one adviser of government heads Stephen Harper - clearly ironic - in the television, Assange should be "protected" and Obama could use "one drugs".
A slash taste was burned between the white house and the Assange.
The speaker of the American President Barack Obama, Robert Gibbs, called it "lightly and absurd," that Assange asked for the return of the Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton, if she was responsible for recently known spionage appeals to diplomates.
"I'm not really sure why we take care of the view of a type with a website", says Gibbs.
"Our external policy and the interests of this country are more important than its website."
The American Government now provides the protection of their databases to the test.
As a special adviser, the Vice Director of the Centre for Anti-Terror Masses, Russian Travers, was called the white house.
Traders are responsible to develop "necessity structural reforms" which have been necessary after the opening of the reports by Wikileaks.
The white house also wants to check the ways as the whole government has exchanged and protected information.
The American government also announced that they want to ensure the security of disidents and activers to ensure them in danger by the Wikileaks publication.
"We have all undertaken to contact them," said Philip Crowley's external speaker.
"We are ready to protect them if necessary."
The Eis University
The Gelato University at Bologna will prepare ice accounts for better annual time.
The Third Basic course for future gelationari has the greatest success and visitors from the whole world.
Where's the whole ice?
From the Gelatiere and from the Gelataio.
The gelatier, on German something differently of the ice container, makes the crome according to all the rules of the Italian Eismacher art.
Gelataio takes the iron clothes out of the kitchen, strikes them into the gun and sell them then.
To know this, you should not go to Anzola de Emilia in the province of Bologna.
But whoever wants to know more about ice, who does not come to the "Gelato-University" of the Italian company Carpigiani.
The Eis University has established the manufacturer of ice machines in 2003 to ensure that the icecrees from its machines are fully justified to the high Italian ideals.
The Third Basic course for future gelationari has the most success and visitors from around the world.
There are also many special courses around Schokoladeneis and Practices in the hatred ice.
Some are dreaming in the middle-life crisis of a new carrier, others simply seem on the glass of the iron.
This time there are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents from Brazil over Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, artist in California, loves the Slow Food movement and wants to offer a future European quality product in the Ice-Cream country.
Anke from Berlin is a company officer and wants to take something own in a nervous job after years.
Two young Egyptians dream to open a iron in Kairo.
A man of Malta and one of Brazil wants to improve the quality of ice creatures in their bars - and the Canadian homefrau Julia comes, because their children love the Italian icecrees.
Maestro Gelatine Luciano Ferrari first explains the ideal properties of the perfect race.
Decisively, it is not only a good mass, but also the believingness and the good consciousness.
Luciano forgets his education, however, not even the shot of the National and Southern Construction: "Itlandic Gelato is easy to be the best - and then is all Romantics there."
The first step to manufacture seems very simple.
Luciano kiss the founded milk, shoes, milk powder, sugar and stabilisators in a large mixer that has been equipped with an electronic program at 85 °C and then immediately choosed on four degrees.
Then he opens a hair on the machine, and out of a pastorized white base, based for all the milk sites.
Immediately the decent will be conducted with questions: can the icecreme only produce with natural substances without stability?
How can you leave your own experience loss?
Luciano warns to leave the newspaper to the Irre.
The one of the icecreme's "nour of natural ingredients" has thus been used stabilisators - mostly a natural product, such as gararker meal from the gararbohne.
Of course, weapon can also produce without stabilisator, only then it must be sold within one day, otherwise sweet it together, and the customer uses sweet ice corners.
Weight changes in the basic mass are allowed.
It's going to smile with the arromen.
For the lake in the ice, Master Luciano distinguishes between the additives that you buy in the Obst Division or the Sustainability of the Super market.
Furthermore, there are pools and pastures.
"The providers will all try to give you dozen aromatized additions."
"Do you just have to experiment."
Fruit with sugar and fresh fruits.
Or even in the icecree from the white base mass that is made with yellow crom and with cacaopulver based on all possible shoopack managements.
Now the curriculars can make the rail machines.
Luciano can produce four different types of Vanille, Schooled, Moka and Haselnuss, with or without oil in the basic mass, with more or less or less of Vanillearma or other natural approaches.
The same experiments will also be subject to the fruit villages.
More aromatics, more fruit devices - smoothly it is not better.
Haselnuss-eis does not smell unfortunately when it contains more heats.
The most loved Kiwii-Eis is the working group that uses more fruits, less water and little less stabilisator.
Firstly, a weakened mixed the smoke of a yellow, says Luciano.
Rail production is a recruitment: Weather pfirsich devices used with a lot of sugar, the sugar share must be reduced in the basic resumption.
For Citroneneis, a extraport is needed.
Luciano produces a device with which he determines the sugar content of the fruit sites (Winzers makes the oaks in the powder mass).
Happily easy tables the computers.
To be earned, no longer requires so many physical uses as previously.
Not only helps the device for the automatic production of the basic mass.
There is also a device in which the ice-machiness locked at the same time cromed and cuts on minimize temperatures.
All of the automatization for the suffering of little couples are not excluded.
The Brazilian Gustavo takes care of himself and his courses from top to downward with fruit pearls when he served the overdimensional stabmixer without control.
"In every course," Mr. Luciano said, "It's just a question of time until something happens."
Controllers in the light
The European Food Authority Efsa has been undermined by the industry experienced with plants.
This prejudice is now formulated by the expert group Testbiotech, which understands as an independent Institute for the impact of biotechnologie.
"It sounds like a disappointed theory, but we have it well documented," said Testbiotech-Chree Christph then on midday in Munich.
The Head of the Efsa Experience Group for Polynic plants, Harry Kuiper, and another Efsa experts have been under the Lobbyist Union for years.
It is paid by concerts like Monsanto, Nestle or Bayer.
Kuiper has cooperated mainly in the Ephesa test requirements for plants and then has been criticised in a clear interesting conflict.
Efsa's provisions are consistently with the position of themi documents and have to do so that the manual of the industry, actually controlled by the authority in the Italian Parma, should be controled.
It is already the second time that Testbiotech is an interesting collation.
So be a high-range Efsa manager recently without upgrading or transition time to the Swiss agricultural syngenta - and therefore changed the pages.
The Mediterranean Rundfunk (MDR) also included shortly personal links between the EU control Authority and Industrielobby, which has made the environment volume as well as the EU parliamentary.
However, the Efsa cannot recognize interest conflicts.
It is in a view that all serious data, even on those of the industry, as they are of higher quality, are in a view.
The experts working for Efsa do not require that they have no contacts on the industry.
But they should be opened.
Kuiper enjoys his work for the International Life Sciences Institute (Ilsi) in the United States.
This seems to be a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and policy, among others to assess the risk of biotechnology without lobby expenditure.
In this case, independent experts are criticised as then that people's changed plants are now allowed without any vegetation testing in animals and the reaction of plants on environmental influences will not be demonstrated.
"We want to know what, for example, makes people changed but on the country," says he.
Current practice is only isolated protein but not to test all the plants that do not provide any reliable results.
"When you don't seek the risks, how to find them then?" he asked.
This looks like Angelica Hilbeck.
Scientists are working since 1994 in the genetechnic and are currently active at the Technical High School.
Industry seeks to affect critical scientists in this area as in the United States now, more in Europe.
It is why there are no researchers who are not flowed with concerts.
Critical studies would normally not be published.
"Industry controls security research," means Hilbeck.
The ring of the stones
The Uis Gsell has also worried about 400 kilometres.
At Montaguesting, he was formed as Stuttgarnhof, the Tuba on the back.
It was Demo.
It's nice.
History is known: in September the baggers were pressed and began to break a large part of the north flight.
The Stuttgarten world was no longer the same: numbers of thousands demonstrated against S21, the Millennium Tire Division of the Bahshof.
When it came to the building, a large part of the flowers was in dreams.
Cerebrous in 6000, 7000 pieces.
Crailsheimer Muschelkalk, a yellow greber stone, between 1914 and 1920.
Gsell is a photographer in East filters, 43 years old.
He's sealed some of the paints.
"They stones are reliquies."
"You don't have to escape."
He swears: "A rock and poor stone, easy and ridiculous."
When he was hungry up, he shot up to cigarette.
He doesn't know what he's going to do with the brooks.
The stones have time.
Uli Gsell too.
The pillar of the Stutt Garder stones leads in a forest in tubtings to a former munition camp of the French army, where Manuel Rongen made his stone river.
The 44-year-old acts with old stones.
He's bought all of them in the residues in Stuttgart.
"It would be a shame that they would be shot to shame or escape in the depony," he said in his office, a wooden bucket that was once a wheat.
It was injured and threatened, he told him, as he was in the newspapers that he bought the rest of the northern flight from the owner.
But he spoke to the S-21 gentlemen for a day.
And he explained them that he couldn't have anything for the removal now.
And if it happens once then it would be the most famous if the stones would continue to use.
Around 200 S-21 gentlemen, one of the hard quarters in the middle of 80 kilo square, with a piece of prices 6.50 to 14 euros.
As anonyms, some also in hope to restore him in a reconstruction.
500 tonnes had bought red, 25 large Lkw loads.
Any half lays down in the forest, the rest is longer sold.
Garten owner, Landscape, household.
They came out of everywhere and had been shot out what the cold and the attachers could bear.
Stuttgarten stones of the steel have been converted in "Movie" or in limits of crowd feeds.
"If this stone is nothing special," says Rongen.
"It wouldn't be the political components."
He grows in his accommodation car, makes a tour through his 20 hectares of great kingdom.
Jura has studied and stopped, later biology, then he was interested for the computer and finally became stone-shake.
And the stone lovers.
It's 40,000 tons of stone.
From Germany he carries his treasures together.
He says he's the largest old steelman of the Republic.
He's fucking.
In the snow, they are artistically stinked with Sandsteine.
"They were one time to Dr. Marienbrücke," he said.
Elbsandstein, yellow, warm, he's hot.
"My favorite rock."
It's going through the forest.
He shows on a call: red Sandstein, the former part of the card railway.
And go on.
"Both Travern."
First of all, the quarters were of the tribe of the Stuttgarten Neckstadions.
Overall in the dark snow stones and stories, Cannstatter Travertin from the Stuttgarten Police Presidency, a royal granit from the Dom Sankt Blasia, from the Heilbronner hospital.
What work, what weirds, which weakness.
If the Rongen thinks how the stones previously shot by hand and have been moved with simple flats and oxen cards, he will be very honried.
"It would be a scandal if you'd be so angry."
He hasn't become a rich man.
But 14 people are working in the stones today, as well as in the forest of stone metres, a image hair, a smied, a glass browser and a garden building.
"We work hard, but it's satisfactory," said the restore.
First of all, he's gotta go to hell.
There are also stones to save.
High-Potental Talent Box
It's more rich Andrang on the buffet.
16 Students turn about sweet brush, soup and sweet.
The Technical University Braunschweig and the Autobauer Population Cars have invited machine construction and design students to a workhop.
In a kind of ideas, they will be able to meet the VW developers together on the car of the future - and fully next to the people's car.
In the street of the most slightest heads, many enterprises are in the neighbourhood, such as VW, on cooperation with universities.
Their mission: the most favourable solvents can be recorded early in the hearing rooms before they come to the labour market and be overcome from others.
And as the universities do not set up the performance of their students, it was trying to record the excepts in practice projects and to connect themselves.
On the second day of the workshop at the TU Braunweig, the car concerts are on the Talent.
A young lady from the personal distribution divides cottage writers, gumberry and cards with VW-Logo.
She tells the hoffnanced advocates of practical programmes and students jobs and shows them ways in the concerts.
Nico Selle of the TU Braunweig includes the project with VW.
He sees the benefits of both sides: "The students are in contact with the industry and gathering experiences."
"VW can meet students at the same time, closely interesting candidates and consider who comes as a employer in question."
Those cooperation, such shel, are not usually.
You'll be so offensive about students.
"It was the hard point more on the simple project," said Sheel.
The fight for the fresh Graduates will probably become stronger.
In many sectors, the enterprises can no longer seek their employees from a large shadow of candidates.
In particular, they need to be appreciated and particularly about high qualified work forces.
In particular, the solvents from the ingenieer designs are in an excellent negotiation position.
According to the German engineering VDI, more than 400,000 ingenieurs remained in October.
And so-called ingenie lucks will be increased according to VDI projects.
For the economic audit and consultation company KPMG, Roman Dyka is on the Talent jagd.
It organizes foreign recruiting events such as the KPMGRace, a kind of modern snapshot jet that the participants need to find their way on the basis of GPS coordinates.
Eight students want to send the company so in the next year to the U.S...
The participants can look at the KPMG family and meet the company.
Whoever may be able to decide in two settings in the front area.
Only the Crème de la Crème of the many candidates runs into the United States.
In the hair and stars around the high potentials to the universities, the dyka is always greater.
"We want to get away with the race from the mass."
"It was just a simple scener we were too little."
The Dytta Dyka seems to take account for talents.
"We have with all participants a similar action in the last year to contact."
"And ones are short before their end and want to visit us soon," he said.
Besides the direct cart on the campus, small and medium-sized enterprises are also classic with professionals on the pitch.
"We're trying to reach solvents on the teams."
"Etwa on the intersolar", reported Sitha Sstebe, staff manager at Solar Technology manufacturer.
The Business company works about 1500 employees in Germany.
Slowly knows about the survey problem.
Currently 35 places are described on the company site.
"It's just very difficult to set up a heavy position."
"This costs a lot of time and money," she said.
Another way is the contact on the Uni Professors.
Solarworld cooperates with various high schools, about the University of Freeberg.
"The professors show that you can do practices with us or write his diplom work."
Your public actions are not advised to the Solar Specialist.
This is why the company is trying to advertise with other opportunities: personal atmosphere, flower hierarchies and easy communications.
"There can not offer a big consorter often," says the staff leader.
The money plays at the job search is no longer extending the main role.
Flexable worktimes, children agency or good upgrade opportunities are other critical factors.
Solarworld, at a study of the Great Place to Work Institutes, visited the 55th place among the 100 best workers of Germany.
The Institute creates an annual top list of German workers.
This is the question of employees as satisfactory with their work and their work area and sees the framework conditions for employees.
Staff leader is also requested by the location of the searchers.
"I think the applicants are particularly looking for external assessments about a potential employer," she said.
Wolf Reiner Warler by the German Employer Branding Akademie requests companies who want to build a good call as employer.
He decided to make his customers more authenticity.
And that means, in terms of wars, especially internal measures.
"The best way to be attracted as employer, leads on their own employees," he says.
In Branchenjargon, the internal Employer Branding is also called employees' training in the own authorities.
"Free employees are the best messengers."
If you have a good manage of his people and identified them with the company, they would take all the way to friends and composers for their employees.
"That's like a game with bands," says warlers.
Obama stops new oilbourgs
Before the coast of the US-Bund State Florida in the Mexique Golf, it will not be given new oilbown in the coming years.
An appropriate prohibition has been allowed by the Government in Washington, so that its former plans are finally opposed.
Before the Atlantic coast, new disasters remain before the Atlantic coast.
This was part of the Internal Minister Ken Salazar on Wednesday.
Explosion of the Bohrplatform "Deepwater Horizon" in April.
Before the unfortunate that eleven workers costed life and the greatest environmental catastrophe of the United States, the President Barack Obama had signed on the pressure of the opposition and the industry to allow new burdens in the eastern part of the Mexicus Golf.
The respondents want to reduce the independence of oil supplies from the country.
He who leads the responsibilities for the heavy oilpest in the golf has not been completely clarified until today.
In the centre of the critics, the British Energy Concert BP is confronted with billion requirements.
A investigation committee at the Obamas Task Force should submit its results during December.
In October, the Interior Ken Salazar had raised the Bohrstopp made after the Explosion.
In the end, several oil-concerts were submitted as a result of requests for new bowry projects.
With enhanced controls and closer security provisions, Obama and Salazar want to exclude a new catastrophe.
Currently, the competent control authority has been reformed according to numerous crimes.
Parallel has announced Obama to close lukrative tax players for oil and Gascreens.
The industry now warns that the promotion in the Golf would be more strenger than that.
"The government's plans are the largest broadcasts for the growth of oil and gas industry", the result of a current sector survey by the BDO's BDO's adviserment - not before the bourge prohibition of mid-eight.
The American Energy Alliance also claims the uncertainty in the industry: "No one knows what will change exactly with the regulation."
Investment in new support projects would be increased to further, last of the growth.
Ogoniland is burned
The water in the rivers is dead brown, it rises as in the tanks: Millennium litres earned oil destroyed the nature in the Nigerian Ogoniland.
People live from dental, corruption and illegal oil.
Celestine Akpobari is fine.
"Don't put you away," the Ecoactivist cried to the journalists: "They will still get enough of oil before the lines."
The 37-year-old Nigerian has tried to clear a boy in the water's powder with the clothes of the water: in the rain water glass the scene is almost nice.
This under the surface is swearing rocky wood wave, it is not to see.
Before she gathered garnels here, he told Esther Badom at the Bodo-Jetty Flusses.
In addition, the flooding water is full of dead.
Five years ago, there are also in the largest greenland of roof oil.
Fishers from the nearly stretched street Bodo must now run six hours to reach in fiscal waters: the Ogoniland situated in the heart of the Nigerdeltas is one of the world's most worst regions.
On the journey, the mangroves carried out by the fluorescents will be the whole extent of heavying.
Instead of the light water, the motor bullet smooths the brawful breasts, who puts his hand in the water, gets dead fingers out.
The horrors of the mangroves are like black lactrines out of the ground, wearing together Palms with their weight.
Birds, such as they are in feed areas, are usually seeking forget: Once the outdoor gardens disappear, it is expanded in the former paradise of sense.
"What happens here is ecological war management," Celestine Akpobari is a close window: "We live in a permanent danger for health."
The balance of war is adopted.
The season of the Ogoni is a decade-based slaughter: here are more than 60 years ago the first explosors from Europe, organized here in the 80-year-olds with the later executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa of the first opposition, which the Shell Concers had to establish its production because it was dangerous for the oil worker.
Another today the company is returned to Ogoniland: During the delicate region of Switzerland's three-fold size of more than 5000 bowrels and 7000 kilometers of rock drives daily be paid more than two million fass of the black gold, the oil fields in Ogoniland are insufficient to the concert is the situation.
All of the hundreds of meters are designed to steel furniture, such as strange sculps from the water: "Christ beums" the heads of the bourgeois are too carefully named.
They are up to 50 years old, most of which are corrected in Mark Mark.
It's always like that to spread a so-called bourgeo, that's Acpobari, then a constant flower of rood oil into water.
More than two billion letters are made after experts in 50 years in the Deltas Ecosystem: Year the amount of oil, as they at the Havarie of the Supertanker "Exxon Valdez" 21 years ago in the sea before Alaska drang - one of the greatest environmental catastrophes in the history of humanity.
Whoever is responsible for the constant ECO GAU is responsible for this will be acted.
During the Shell Conzers Sabotage and the organised oil disappearing stage is responsible for more than 90 percent of the disaster, see environmental shopping creatures and lack pipelines as a principal causer.
Shell read in Nigeria significantly lower security standards than otherwise in the world usually, the US scientist Richard Steiner was sent to the Conzern 2008 before: All the ratios of defects to guides are "a lot more than where".
On a place that looks like a left, deadly damaged worker under free sky, looks out from the mangroven creatures: they are split and are shot up to half.
In one of the many fishermen that are partly connected to roars, parts are desirablely expanded on the ground, a fire burnts: an illegal small fridge.
In the fass, the rood oil is raised over the fire for a few hours, Michael, head of the group.
First, Benzin moves through the roads to the startup, after the end of the leading Kerosin and finally exits that.
So you produce Michael and four employees daily to four feasts Thisl to 300 letters: "This brings us 34,000 Naira" - about 22 dollars.
The Delivery inhabitants use chronic traicy in the largest earthquake of North Africa.
Nigeria has only one raffinerie.
The 40 euro center per litter can still provide the illegal cookings, because they receive their smooth substances in a slightly low.
He is "Bunkers", which run the pipeline network by Ogoniland: In this way the country's experts are lost at least 16 million litres of rood oil.
Only a dismissed small part of the provisoric trading material will be deleted illegally: the leone quota is filled with organized criminal networks that should also be political and high-range military in tanks and disappear in the world market.
The debate, whether the environmental catastrophe is more accurated to the overall population or to the lake production, holds the active acpobari for clean academic.
"If the oil companies were not accepted as a finger and would not have destroyed the living basis of the fishers, it would be neither Saboday, nor dental and illegal refrigerators."
In particular, the Ogoni’s relationship is destroyed, but the terms of the fact that only a decline of the concerts are in question: "Much as other nationalities, such as the Chinese, are better."
Michael's gonna be nervous.
"The highest time you're out," said the muscle oilman.
Every minute the soldiers can come.
If the illicit oil defenders takes into account the speciality of the war forces, they are not arrested but probably a hurtful loan.
The militarys also want to benefit from the country orders, such as all Nigerians, from the road.
"This crazy Zeug has brought our country into all regards of the dog," says Accpobari.
Detecting dangerous construction errors in A380 terms
A380 clearly has a great security problem.
In the investigation of a notified machine, there is a possible construction error that could lead to a "catastroptic tribes accident".
The Qantas aircraft is now the engine manufacturer.
The passagiers of the Noviet Qantas-Airbus at the beginning of November had clearly known much more luck than ever: the Australian air security Authority has established a great security problem in the trips of some A380 machines - and now warned about a possible construction error.
The potential defect would have serious consequences: In a oil connection, he could produce an encouraging and leakings, it was called in a opinion of the ATSB Authority published in this Thursday.
This could lead to "the catastrophale of triples".

The Australian aircraft has now introduced legal steps against the British tourist producers.
It has made an approximation with an Australian Federal Governance in Sydney, which allowed him other legal measures against the company.
Qantas-Chef Alan Joyce said that his aircraft would be requested for the interim case at the beginning of November.
At the edge of the motor, parts were removed and the trag surfaces were damaged.
Rolls-Royce made an oil burning as a cause for the damage.
Following the case, the world has to be exchanged to 40 tribes.
The Australians announced that further security tests were performed to the Superjum Boss that were equipped with the concerned tribes.
Security recovery is the result of cooperation with Rolls-Royce, said ATSB speaker Martin Dolan.
The security problem is to be sufficiently important to inform all concerned.
After the notice of the Qantas machine, the airline had held its A380 flows on the ground.
Singapore Airlines left about three of his eleven A380 forward on the ground.
The airhansa changed the tribes in A380 as a precautionary measure.

Inland snow cases solve transport chaos
Germany fully in white: Over the night is almost snow in the whole country.
In many streets, Chaos, Beeps and Flights falls out.
In cases of car accidents at least three people died.
The winter enjoys Germany: at the necessary temperatures, the whole Republic has been adjusted on Thursday - which leads to many types of movement chaos.
In the north and east, 15 centimeters are partly dinnered sneeches in the north and east.
On several cars and many roads, the transport is strongly limited.
On the A7 at Flensburg, the Winter service was in the long use, but it was not completed with the constant new snow.
Furthermore, there were strong beasts on the East Sea coast.
The Federal Sea vessel and Hydrographie (BSH) is expected at the East Sea coast of Schleswig-Holstein from the early day to water flows of 1,2 meters over the normal state.
In the screens, the snow relevance of the railways and the Federal Strategy had caused significant problems.
According to the non-terterranean meteomedia, Sächsian Swiss has thus shown violett-the highest degree.
Partly, there fell 30 centimeters of new, fresh and strong winds for disappearance.
There remained several cars and cars in the night.
The police authorities also reported a great decline on the streets.
On the A2, snow and wind led to smoke and steel.
The A4 and A9 of the black cases were affected in the turbines.
According to German Bahn, there are significant distortions in Sachsen, Sachsen content, tourings and northern Bayerns.
Snow on the glass, cut trees on the scene or destroyed leaders and pearls are the main challenges.
In Sachsen, television was required to be set from Leipzig to Nürnberg.
In the Thuring Chamber, a ICE had to stop his journey after München.
The 165 drivers were provided by firewasers and salvation helpers with wheats, foods and drinks in the winter.
Snow winds felt on the streets.
On large German airports, the snow wind leads to numerous aircrafts.
In München, a speaker of the airport center has already been reported some cancelation.
In Frankfurt on Main, 40 flights were thrown out in a fraport talker.
The winter service is long-term.
Available passagiers will only be paid at the airport, yet they're still ready for 400 field beds.
On many roads, it was already in accidents at middle and in accidents.
On the evening, a Lkw Fair came to the coast with a train on a train transition in Ostholstein around life.
The local manager was easy.
In the neighborhood of Nürnberg, the snow covered roads came to a similar accident: there was also a car hired on a train transition because the vehicle was stayed.
The driver came through life.
In the trip, four passagiers were lost - the street of Bayreuth to Nürnberg was therefore closed to the morning hours.
A 30-year-old woman died after she had slaughtered her car at A Fundburg on a glass road.

thousands of tours around all friends
More than 100,000 people in New Zealand have thought of the destroyed mountains who have been explained after several explosions in a mine.
The body still could not be covered because the security situation in the unfortunate is precisely precise.
It was about two weeks ago in the Pike River Mine near the city of Greymouth, a great explossion.
29 mountain workers aged between 17 and 62 years were defeated within days.
One song was left in the unfortunate fashion, but no song of survivors had discovered.
Based on the high concentration of donary gases and further explosions, there could not be no rescue forces from the security basis.
Following the second strong detonation, the authorities and experts had been found that there was no survival for the friends.
The body could not be covered until the time.
Now people and friends remembered the dead with a memory of the dead.
10 thousand people were gathered in a rare sunlight in Greymouth on the Netherlands southern island.
Three minutes they've disappeared.
To the honor of the destroyed mountains, 29 tables were made to see Helms, Lamps and the names of the friends.
Images and personal objects, including clothing vessels and superfrows, also found their place here.
In front of the governments of the country, the flaggs were at half.
New Zealand has decreased that the mountains would come back to the surface, the Neighbourhood Minister John Key said to the participants of the Gedenk Café.
"but they never came home."
He can't conclude the death of his son as long as he had not seen his body, said Lawrie Drew, whose son Zen was destroyed in the beach.
Besides the President of the Minister and members of the victim, several foreign diplomates participated in the monumental festival.
At the first explossion on 19 November, the mountains of the British and South African origin were also destroyed.
Rescue workers began to remove a fire in the interior of the coalberg work on the South Island.
When the explosive gas is disappeared, it will begin to recover the slight temperatures in the mine inside, President of police Gary Knowles to journalists.
To hell, wars!
Are you going to the artkin?
The Register Nikolas Winding Refn plays with his cheap epos "Walhalla Rising" old Genre Greens.
What public could the Danish Register Nikolas Winding Refn thought when he bowed "Walhalla Rising"?
A pleasant Wikinger cryer with only an eye (Mads Mikkelsen) frees from his peiners and puts closely over her overwhelmful forces - it's ideal for young male viewers on the search for blue action, just because our hero likes to be relaxed rabian roof methods and even if his enemies rise the warmth from the living body when he has a bad lame.
On the other hand, it says One, as he's actually named, the whole film on no word, and the other figures are higher than one or two series or a few qualitative death crystals.
Otherwise it is improved and in the green beautiful hill area of Shotland, which offers the Wikinger world from about a thousand years ago.
Ideal for adult Cineases with interest for existenceism and very quiet camera visits.
Great, if a movie has several target groups, it's not that if it's excluded by each other.
Regisseur Winding Refn applies for its wild and stolen drug-terlogie "Pusher" as a species of Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but it refuses to make his works more humor to the Mainstream or less brutality to the arthouse.
Most artkino-friends needed to disappear from the breathtaking brain mass and the warming.
The action factors die afterwards, when one of the free interpretative reasons is opened with a fortified Christian missionary to Jerusalem through the ship, and a future in flate and nebel, before the manager comes to America and continues to disappear there.
There is no wonder that "Walhalla Rising" in Germany hasn't found a kino lounge and now only appeared on DVD.
This is particularly because of the fair images, but also because it has been hidden from the prettenties to the bluttrist fassade a quite refining piece of kine, which has had some attention.
In this film, it is not about dialogue or stringent action, it's all atmosphere, a filmed fiebertraum.
And there are no entries from that for the supervisor.
Ren gets him a moment of relaxation and smells him with his needed images and the dark trance soundtrack fully slowly the kitchen, especially with the unfair hate that faces him out of the hearts of the figures.
Only a little blue boy who stands on the side, keeps himself as an unschuld, all the others are thrown by anger.
In all-mentioning of the unique hero, whose motive is never explained, but for the enemies and the past part of the war, sometimes the war of the hell, whereas the messenger of the Devil himself is.
He's meaning to lose, but may only for those without drunk.
"Walla Rising" is a rare movie that you can hate and wonder, to harm, respiration and steel.
A experience.

IAEA has new indications on a secret nuclear program in Syria.
However, the country is endeavoured to take position - it is still allowing controls.
On the north from 5 to 6 September 2007, at least four Israelian F-15 I flights have been a secret, warming furniture building in Syria.
It is located on the Upper of Euphrat; the next larger city, 30 kilometers, is Dair as-Saur.
Your name is used in documents of the International Atomic Energy Authority (IAEA) when it is about the reactor, the Syrian has well built with help from North Corea in the quarter, hid in a valley that comes from the flight.
According to a letter of the US secret CIA from April 2008, it would be appropriate to produce Plutonium from which at the end of April 2008 would also have built nuclear weapons.
For other purposes, the technology does not have the fifties.
The CIA presented a video presentation with wearing satellite images.
The computer animation has seen what components of the reactor should be before the destruction which is an accelerated copy of the North Korean model from the Atomic Centre Yongbyon.
She also put photos that showed the building out of the nearest or nearly the inner space.
The reactor was short before the operation, but not yet had been clothed with breastplates.
Today, more than three years after the bombardement, it's pretty well known than that time, yes, the roads were more than the time.
The former U.S. President George W. Bush discovered recently that the CIA was before the attack was sure that Syria in El-Kibar had built a reactor, but it had not seen the points of content that it had been given in the country "the active nuclear weapons".
Some secret officers in Europe are more careful and more than talking about a "pleasant reactor", even though they keep the CIA Presidency for "plausible".
You miss hard evidence, like the IAEA.
Asked as he was sure to have a response to a high UN-Diplomat in the summer only a stoner that IAEA has "when material to ask questions."
The shadow of the "unseen military palace" the Syrians made a close focus and planned the country green.
However, in June 2008, a IAEA team found under the former Chefins spectrum Olli Heinonen in the El-Kibar Spuren of Uran, which was produced by people.
In addition, the IAEA received a Member State of satellite designers from the time after the attack that the employees need to be expert than those presented by the CIA.
However, these acceptations are not to get on the market because the unknown commander, perhaps Israel, has bought it exclusively.
The IAEA may therefore not verify its reality independently.
Syria has always warned to never operate a secret atom program or has built a reactor.
The race of the Israelian arms, Damascus explained.
However, the IAEA, after the analysis of the part, was incredible.
Sother refuses Damascus to discuss - as well as the satellite images.
Furthermore, the controller's second inspection in El-Kibar and the access to the thirsts of the destroyed building.
But Israel also refuses to deceive.
"We will never comment it," the recently confirmed the official position at the time of the attack Ehud Olmert.
The investigation of the case since June 2008 has been unrealised and "effectively developed to a serious problem of credibility for the Authority", as a higher Western Diploma at the IAEA seat in Vienna is finally a serious disagreement against the IAEA treaty in the room on which IAEA is expected.
As a key to progress in the declaration, IAEA's views that there are three other institutions that have to be "in functional connection" with the mexial reactor, other than that.
The inspectors have not been opened until the time for which installations it is, nor what function they have or what they appear to be suspected.
According to the South Deputy Journal, they will be described inside Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskanariah, returned from nearly located cities.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (Isis) has identified these places and made a complex of building on satellite images at the massive, where it is most likely to be one of the suspected objects.
It may be in or directly close to a military support point - exactly with the IAEA Syrians' access to the three places.
In what it means, the Syrians feared a fishing exhibition - that IAEA will be forwarded by the United States to deal with military plants.
Since the nuclear detections were focused on the institutions by a tip of the US secret services.
IAEA has indicators, including satellite photographs, that between the three places and the quarter on the Euphrat material was exported and exported.
A high-western diplomate in Vienna said, at least one of the installations could "related to the Brennstoff production".
However, there are no indicators on sensitive activities, such as uranium or renewing; processes needed to build nuclear weapons.
The reactor type will be operated with uran that is not sufficient.
However, where the uran should come and then the plutonium for the bomb should be disappeared, these central issues have all a pleasure attempt.
It is also unlawful if the thresholds could be valuable mountains, where three places were dealed.
As if the hundreds of the car rentals were disappeared from the ground, no one wants to have information about where the damage was left.
The only few kilometres of el-Kibar situated on the other side of the Euphrat Salzmine al-Tibni, which studied Syrian as a campaign for radioactive mule, is incredible.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley has recently been connected to an analysis of satellite images for the remarked Magazin Jane's intelligence Review with the reactor.
However, it shows the fact that Syria has been in the three suspected land workers in front and removed large containers after IAEA has requested access.
This may be an accident, but it has missed little to raise the defence.
In addition, it is called in Diplomate Cross, IAEA has used some months to develop a plan for inspections there which is to allow Syria to create some of the military secrets - only the wandering shows how great the interest of the inspectors is.
Inde, Damascus also completed this proposal.
If the Western Diplomates in Vienna have been endorsed before a year, the reactor has already been destroyed, so the matter has not been higher trought, some U.S.B. Glyn Davies brings for a few months of particular inspections in the game, one of the worst funds that the Queens Atom authorities have to control.
IAEA-Chaef Yukiya Amano, who should propose these inspections, has already been "the option for which I am open" in the future, but he does not stop.
There is a high risk in this way: for one needs a majority in the IAEA Governor Council, and some 35 countries represented there are all others as a scaling.
To the other, how to think a diplomate says, "What is if they find nothing at the end?"
Love in War Times
Since Angelina Jolie started with her work in the summer, there's anger.
She wrote herself, a love story between a woman of Bosnia and a Serbian man.
Many more you don't know about it, but it's enough for unlawful.
Hartnichly, the female, a musulman, loved the jugoslawian crisis in her Serbian manager.
Bosnian women who were directly protested, and some of the dreams planned in Sarajevo have been sent to Hungary shortly.
In addition, the film is disappeared in Hungary and in the post production, but it is still protested in Bosnia.
Bakira Hasecic by the organization of Women's Women's Guidance Female Promotion wrote about UNHCR refugees' work at Jolie and requested a meeting with the player, has now reported a boss newspaper - Jolie is a member of the United Nations Refugee Work.
Diplomatic is not -- she offered the women a meeting in Hungary once weeks ago, what they rejected.
The meeting should be held in Bosnia, so Hasecic.
Love storys in the management camps did not give it, and Jolies stops the victims against their livestock enough about the dragon book.
Its organization recommended that Jolie as an ambassador, the Guardian reports.
What exactly did Jolie write for Szenen?
The Bosnia culture ministerial, who received her book to read, has divided a draggeous authorisation for Sarajevo, not really clear why Jolie did not even come.
The young autumn itself, after no political intentions with her movie, has worked with a lot of effort in the Jugoslawian conflict, to show the terrible consequences of the war and to give a voice to all sides involved.
However, she remains empty in the contents.
So a second synopsis on the movie, which then sounds very different: the loveds knew about it before the war breakfast and revealed, when she, bovine muslim, was disappeared in a Serbian camp where he worked as a wake.
What indeed seems significantly different when the variation "Administration sacrifices is burned in the Folter Knock".
The film of Jolies is actually starting before the war, so safe.
The pressure on them, so Jolie, is "unfair and based on fair information".
Now you can only provide the hackers of Hollywood peace: as they put the driving book, as many before, illegal networks.
Nothing like this way.
This night, finally, it's gone right around for the Irene.
No race of contempt.
For this, the home team dominates its guests from Sweden, Finland and the United States too much.
The fans smell before joy in sweet sweet music, they're stamping with the feet.
The Bailey pobbe in the southern cork, because the players throw over a three-meter distance in Bierbechers - and meet them.
"Bierpong" is called the weird spectrum, that there are 500 euros of winning pressure to Las Vegas for Bierpong World Masters in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this sweet drink game and the rescue informationist, that does not really get together.
And yet, the 26-year-olds are trying to assess himself from the huge question of what the future will be.
At his plan, it is not a game pair in Las Vegas, he will lead the contract in New Zealand in January.
"I have a lot of feeling about it," he said.
"It's so far away from home and I have no job there."
Always: Her friend waited at Auckland already on him - "It had shot, shot her wish as a evental manager, perhaps a good sign," said the young man.
Through the worse perspectives at home, two of the Tanners were looking for their luck in the outside.
His sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney, his brother Colin now has a position as IT adviser in London.
The boys go: How the tanners look on the island in many families.
100,000 Irelands will probably leave the country in the next time, say experts of the Economic and Social Research ESRI in Dublin.
Before 2015, they have even 2000,000 migrants.
For the small country, only 4,5 million inhabitants, a strong losses.
The prognostics are compared to a wage salary compared to those in which Ireland in the eighteen years.
After a decade of the disappearance that brought with him for Irene great welfare, the trists are now wide again.
In particular, the economic crisis assures the young, well designed Irelands, for which it was only mounted.
Work losses and social disasters appeared absurd in the trees years.
Everyone was used, money was in the overfluence.
However, three of ten women and men are under thirty without work.
In the Irish Times there are also the reader letters of young foreigners who cry: "All goes around in Ireland."
"It should be a stand against politicians and bankers - but who can go away and our country lose a whole generation."
"The last makes the light out."
Jura-Studente Leanne Caulfield, President of the Irish Student Meeting, sees a dark future, because the government is only an eyewit trip and the young people don't bid the future views.
"They are reducing the minimum solutions, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," says the 20-year-olds.
She observes how their combinetons take place from an unemployed practice to the next.
Their greatest concern, she says, if it's necessary to escape himself in four years.
"This thought is grievous and depriming."
As a result, men like Stephen McLarnon try to set the subject positive.
McLarnon organizes the "AbroadExpo", a mess that offers a roading service for the subject of work in the country.
"For professional deputy work is a great opportunity to make the first steps on the carrier", said the manager.
On his website, show photos of Surfer in Australia and Snowboarder in Canada.
The message is clear: foreign work is not a gallery service, but also brings freedom and fun.
How it feels to build something else, Seán O'Donovan knows for a half year.
Because there was nothing to do for the 29-year engineer in Ireland, he now worked with 15 Irish colleagues on the construction in Germany.
In the glass churches they're just moving up a moderate house.
In January, it goes to Hannover or Berlin, to the next project.
His home sees O'Donovan only rarely, because he makes extra stories to be able to pay the credit for his home home.
"The situation is already a little disappointed," he said, "and after a long time after the first time he acts on the weight of his house.
"I won money in Germany for a house in Ireland, in which I'm so good as never more."
He's going to break something and goes through the chosen rooms.
The small house is located in a fair living room with fixed gardens, in the entrance parks large, soft cars.
Commonly with a sister O'Donovan has bought the house for four years ago for 380,000 euros - 100 percent of credit.
"There were crazy times, there was a simple money without many questions," he said.
Did he fear that it might come with the credit?
O'Donovan translates a few times, calling a tea after, and says: "I have no children I need to spend, and I'm young; even if everything appears, I can start from new."
The buildinger doesn't like the event he's currently hearing.
"No one must hunger - but our situation is not so dramatic as in previous times here on the island," he says.
"A time to work outside, that's not the worst thing that can happen -- perhaps we feel like Irene alone."
He laughed and told his father who went to England in the last large economic crisis.
"After seven years he was back and the life went to Ireland, it's easy."
Cian Tanner likes this thought.
The future's open and simply see how it's going to live in other ways.
A couple of years work in London has already been behind, and why should he not even work well for him and his friend?
However, there is still a matter who is intrigued to him in these days: the feast on his 27th birthday in Dublin.
He's afraid it could be in a life-time park.
"Don't be too many emotions," he says and drinks a great cloke of his beer.
"It's a sense that sounds awkward."
"Let's like to call a journey, quite locker, with a few friends, a couple of drinks, a few games."
The Democratic Routine
Democracy movement in Latin America will be increased as the support of private enterprises.
Criminality is a greater problem than unemployment.
In many parts of the region, Brazil's influence is greater than the United States.
To these results, the Latinobarometer Survey published in 18 countries and was exclusively published in The Economist.
This survey is regularly carried out since 1995 and thus shows the change of views in this region.
Two facts fall in this year's survey from September and October, especially in the eye.
First of the good timing in Latin America
Secondly, the growing interest in democracy and their most important institutions.
In many countries in the South American Coast, the democratic movement has been strong (see table 1).
In Peru, for example, where the economy has increased approximately 6% since 2002, the number of democracy respondents increased from 40% in 2005 to 61% in this year.
In Mexico, where the economy recovered its strong impact in the past year, is to recognize such trends.
However, only half of the requesters in Mexico and Brazil, the most famous countries of the region, are convinced democrates which sends the regional average (see graph 2).
Ca. 44% of the requesters explained that they were satisfied with the democratic practice of their country. These are so significant as in the last year, but 25% more than in 2001 (Diagram 3).
Approximately 34% trusted the Congress of their country and 45% of their government. Both values are compared to those last year, but there is a significant increase in 2003 (17% and 24%).
The Latvian American economic crisis has been endeavoured in a decade of ten years ago.
This also has continued during the world economic crisis, it is likely that the Latvian American countries have experienced a short phase of recession and have reappeared rapidly.
In addition, the poor have been launched by a stronger social network.
(Nor reports of the United Nations Society Committee for Latvian America since this week, 2009 increased the poverty rate in Latein America only lower and was back to 32% in this year.)
However, there are strong changes from land to land (see graph 4).
Brazil's strong economy and the belovedness of the distinguent President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva is reflected in a wide range of progress.
In Mexico and the Mediterranean America, where the recession was stronger, and had taken violence crimes, this is less than the case.
For the second time, since the survey begins, many requests in Latin America in criminality in their country see a greater problem than in unemployment (see graph 5).
Ca. 31% indicates that either they or a family member in the last year have been victims of a crime. However, against 38% in the last year, the values are reduced and thus reached the lowest position since 1995.
The increased economic performance reflects the stronger support of private and market economy: approximately 71% of the requesters overregionally showed that the private economy for development is inadequate in 2007, 56% were in 2007 (see graph 6).
Ca. 58% explained that the market economy only could bring progress to the country compared to 47% in the last year.
Interestly, 62% of the requesters in Venezuela have maintained this view (and 80% are for a private economy), although their left President, Hugo Chávez, has made many private enterprises.
By 19% of the requesters (18% in the last year) Brazil has the largest weight in the region followed by the United States (9%, unchanged since last year) and Venezuela (9% compared to 11% in the last year).
The requests in Mexico and most of the Mediterranean countries have seen the most influent country in the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua of Venezuela.
A selection lock
No one was expected that the elections would be perfect on 28 November in Haiti.
But the facts oversee the fears of the electoral helpers to help the country.
Full electoral horns, more often defined voices, election appearances in the Rinstein, disappeared electoral and degraded locals were only part of the problems.
The electoral locals were opened with skillful reproach.
Many Haitians, among whom many of the earthquake had become injured in January, stripped the search for an option.
Some have finally been completely opened.
A twentieth presidency skills, including some complaints, requested the resumption of the election results.
In the whole country, it was partly forced protesters.
However, Edmond Mulet, Leader of the United Nations mission in Haiti, was the election "to well in many meetings".
According to an earliest explanation of observers of the organization of American States and the Caribbean Community "Do these irregularities, so they like to be seriously, the process is not necessarily invalid."
In other words, the show is on.
The electoral Authority, who is obliged to the unleavened President Rene Preval and its candidates, Jude Célestin, shall announce the provisional results on 7 December.
The expected steel selection is approximately in January.
There is still hope in the choice.
The two leading opposition scenes, the Rap Music Michel Martelly and the former first Lady Mirlande Mangat, have returned their initial iniquity class.
If Jude Célestin, who only finds low or not any authorisation, explained by the electoral authority to the sender of the election, could lead it to problems.
Following the Cholera epidemic and the fact that more than 1 million of the victims of the earthquake remained in cells, a few choice participation was feared.
On the day of the election, many Haitians were prevented by lacking organizations.
Shortly before election begins, approximately 250,000 instructions needed for the choice are not yet divided.
It's a lot on the game.
The donor countries consider a legitimate recognised government as an important step in reconstruction of Haitis.
The Haitians themselves are the same view.
Home in the middle
In the weeks after the sudden death of your husband, Argentina's President, Cristina Fernández, a bottle of sympathy, which has been 20 points to over 50% above. This is the highest value since its election in 2007.
However, if this is a reception in the next year, it depends on whether the relatively dark Cristina Fernández is a compromised preparatory as her lossed husband, her leader and political partner Niestor Kirchner.
The characters of this are not clear.
Néstor Kirchner, who also launched the economic policy after the election of her marriage, often set up budget plans that did not take into account tax income, economic growth and inflation.
This allowed the President's couple to provide additional revenues after its own goods.
On the paper, the Fernández Government was the majority of the Congress last year.
However, the opposition is divided and the death of Kirchner was led to further cereals after a heart infarct on 27 October.
Some registers from the series of the governors were found behind Cristina Fernández.
However, after chaotic meetings (in which a parliamentary killed another, and others had not taken into consideration the government of the Technology), the Congress was not to decide the budget for 2011.
"I will not discuss it," said the President.
The budget 2010 is also applicable for the next year, whereas the President has more opportunity to give money according to its own goods.
The economy is hot: it is likely to grow up to 9% in this year.
For example, 11.1% the official inflation rate is 11.1%, but numerous private equipment - and loans needs of companies - the value is at almost 30%.
Kirchner, who overlooked the office in 2003 when Argentina was protected by economic crises, explained the growth and poverty fight against its main objectives and not the inflation sense.
He refused cooperation with the IMF, scanned the private sector and smoking the National Statistics and Public Institute INDEC, which enjoyed the official inflation statistics.
Can Fernández now make a more modest way?
She invited the private economy and the company manager to discuss.
In accordance with official conclusions, loan increases in the next year should be limited to 18%.
The high world market prices for Argentina’s agricultural products have given the economy a strong relief.
However, the inflation was undermined by a large devaluation in 2002.
Cristina Fernández may want to recover financially to the rest of the world.
At the beginning of this year, the Government took a agreement with assets that rejected the previous debt of the country in 2001.
Now, Fernandez seems to disburse a agreement with the money buyers from Paris Club, which it debt about $6,7 billion.
The Kirchners had an audit by the IMF, as usually, always rejected.
However, in the last month, the Economic Minister Amado Boudou had known that the Fund would provide a new national consumer price index "technical support". It seems like this would be the first step to disappear INDEC.
It is not known whether Fernández will be politically active after the end of its official time without support by her husband.
If so, she needs support for the Mediterranean, the majority has enough of Kirchnerism.
When the Argentine returns from her summer holiday in March, the bottle of the symptom that has been brought to her will be rejected.
If she wants to get another choice, she must decide whether it is still and ready to make many political decisions to her husband.
Sweaker Applaus for China
The electors are slowly closed to a connection to the festival.
What does Taiwan hold by his grand brother on the side of the sea?
On November 27, more than 7,5 million electorists, which are 70% of all electoral officers to choose in the five towns, citizens and town offices. This is a wide assessment of President Ma Ying-jeou.
In addition to a participating free trade agreement, Ma itself is a iconic set of relations to the country. Its policy has changed the relationship with the Chinese mother country for the first time since 1949.
But you've got the test files, but just knapp.
Although its coomintang Party (KMT) represents three of the five citizens, she did not receive votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progress Party (DPP), which addressed a greater independence of Taiwan, almost 50% of the voices that KMT had received 45%.
In a presidential election, this would mean for mass problems.
Since its election two years ago, the vote share of its party was about 8%.
For the first time, the DPP was even joined with the KMT in the town devices.
During the election, it came to the usual precommissions in Taiwan, such as car convoyment with Krawallmachers, Flaggen-Sweden mass and only speeched twinners.
There was even the obligatory, mysterical murdering.
Sean Lien, the son of Leen Chance and President of the KMT, held a word on a KMT-chandidaten,
When a man of the multitude was shot in his face, the lion was shot and killed a surrounding survey.
Weirdly, it is not clear whether the saddle lies wanted to kill or a fight with the candidates.
Independent of this, the attack, according to Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, affects the election and pressed the DPP into a bad light, which the KMT has more voted.
Perhaps China was the largest winner of the campaign.
The relations with the festival have not been thematised.
Instead, the candidates discussed the plans of social accommodation and the creation of jobs.
The Thaians like their fatal independence and leaving China's military threat.
For this reason, the KMT does not like its relations to the Government in Peking.
However, this time, the DPP also encouraged to harm the anti-chinesic feelings too much.
She reacted on the new consciousness that Taiwan's economy cannot survive without China.
However, it is like to confirm that most of the Thaiians responds to its Chinese politics.
The Government in Peking will continue to pursue its strategy to turn Taiwan with economic income to the Community.
China immediately sent a subsidiary to Taipeh to prepare a meeting on investment security and medical cooperation.
Of course, it also wants a political integration, but the most important first.
It is better waiting for the elections of the 2012.
The DPP has found newly.
Two years ago, she was strongly disappeared: the former party manager Chen Shui-bian was seen because of corruption in prison.
During its presidency from 2000 to 2008, he closely introduced the absolute independence.
However, under Tai registry, a new generation of armed politicians and the DPP was designed to fight the voices of professional and youth.
Tsai found as Presidential candidate of the DPP, such as Su Tsengchangchang under Chen.
Your party now does everything to show that it is also in the way to build close relations with Peking.
Tsai plans a missing of ideas as a point of contact between the DPP and China, but this makes no prior discussions.
Tsai explained that its parties had a "fidable alternative" to a massive approach to China.
Chen seems very increased about this wealth.
From his cell, he explained that the candidates of the DPP would have made better to exist on Taiwan's independence.
He also urged the practical Su to monitor the presidential scenario.
The DPP also makes it difficult to select its possible candidates.
The MT should be undertaken by its own self-analyse.
Major values are bad, although the fast growth of the economic, the KMT candidates wanted to bring their election camp without it.
The main reasons for his disobedience appear unemployed, and the remaining further craft between arms and riches.
According to a KMT speaker, it will be designed to the local installations and to the local installations.
The strong impact of the DPP allows that Taiwan is only limited to reapproval.
At the same time, most Thaians see the economic cooperation with China as unbelievable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "It's no longer back."
Grammy names: The Jazz Sänger Esperanza Spalding was surprisedly described in the Newcomer category of the year
If you're on the question of a president, people will be remarked.
The President Obama himself asked Esperanza Spalding to reach the 2009 Nobel Price reduction. Now, the 26-year-old Jazz-Bastin and Sängerin were named overtime for the annual grammy in the Newcomer category of the year.
In view of the fact that Spellding has already been a star in the Jazz scene in 2008, the name appears a little unrealised, but it corresponds to the grammy regulation which a artist has been published by the album with which he was known in the wide public could have been exposed up at least three alphabets.
Her earliest album from 2010, "Chamber Music Society", is certainly a step forward. And with its appreciated voice and a good funeral for Pop, Funk and Latin music, you can compare spalding quietly with Norah Jones 2003, whose great success in 2003 as Jazz interpritin in this category of nomination Spraldings.
Furthermore, the album "Historicity" of Vijay Iyer Trios was named in the instrumental alben category. This love of the criticians experienced a river success.

Trombone Shorty, a raweful favorite from New Orleans and often guests in HBOs "Treme", was described in the category of Zeitgenous Jazz, in the other former Alben of Stanley Clarke, John McLoughlin and Jeff Lorber.
The Secret Society of the wild Steampunk Musicer Darcy James Argue has been aware of attention in the category Great Group. He is therefore a good example of the Billy Child's meeting with his Chamber Jazz and the democratic Dave Holland and his Oktett, whose Life Ablam "Pathways" is a democratic band leader.

Mochee in Temecula gain approval of the Planning Committee
The construction of a mochee in Temecula found after a five-year-old public hearing the unique adoption of the local planning committee.
Criticals have anticipated the project to promote terrorism and transportation.
However, in accordance with a statement from the Commission on middle evening, the new religious centre describes the local provisions and will be an eighth view.
"The project is supported by many good people - by Christians, Jews, Bahas, and many others," said Nael, President of the Islamic Centre of Temecula Valley on Thursday tomorrow.
"If the American makes me boasting."
"It shows the justice."
"It's just little worse," he added.
"It's just very laugh."
"In this kind, we live wonderful people."
The meeting began at 18:00 and the discussions for and against the construction of the center were almost to the north, and the voices on both sides were very widely divided by the Press-Enterprise.
The debate was continued on the page of the newspaper.
"There is no America any more," said a comment.
"It's another planet of mys, and the freedom status is dead in the sand."
"Amerika's over."
In other parts of the country, the Islamic centres have also been brought to Protesters, such as near Ground Zero, the scope of the terrorisms to the City of New York on 11 September 2001.

The new, approximately 2.300 m2 large mass in the Mediterranean style will have two mines and will be up to approximately 13m.
It must be a large basis at the Nicolas Road next to the Chaparral High School at about 17.500 m2.
Defenders are still able to impose the project at the city Council.
Micro-resistant microbie could allow new forms of life on the earth or otherwise
The discovery of an strange bacteria, which can live by Arsen, opens new opportunities for new forms of life on the earth and otherwise.
Although scientists discovered this unnormal bacteria here on the earth, their view is a sign that life is also possible without the elements of life.
"This organization has two possibilities."
"He needs the gun or phosphor or arsen."
"It makes something very special, although it is almost a kind of 'fremde' life," Paul C.W. said by the Arizona State University and Co-Autor of the Report that appears on Thursday in the online exhibition of the Journal Science.
Furthermore, six main elements were observed as not useful - carbon, hydrocarbon, smoke, sauce, phosphor and sulfur.
However, as scientists discovered, the bacteria grows in California Mono Lake even further when phosphor is replaced by arsen.
"There is asking what the other thing is possible," said the Co-autor of the report Ariel D. Announced by the University of Arizona.
The discovery is an important step in searching for external life, since scientific life and its forms must be recognized.
The study consists of microbos found on the earth.
The announcement of a press conference, in which no details were given to the discovery, provided too widely widespread speculations on the Internet that the report of the discovery of external life could be conducted.
This is not the case.
The discovery "describes that in other planet systems organisms with other elements of biochematic processes, and that the 'Standard elements' that our opinion is absolutely useful is not to be established", said Charles Cockell, Professor at the Planetary and Space Sciences Research Institute of Open University of Millton Keynes in the United Kingdom.
Cockel was not part of the research team.
"This work is a new newspaper because she shows that in basic biochemic processes and structures a element can be replaced by another", added Cockell.
This discovery was not likely.
Felisa Wolfe-Smon of the Astrobiological Institute of NASA, who led the study, elected Mono Lake on the basis of the high arsen content.
As Arsen and Phosphor are chemically equal, she agreed that microbos that are equipped may be replaced by the other.
"The jurisdiction of the arsens is particularly concerned that it is chemically similar to Phosphor."
"Therefore the organisms are difficult to distinguish one of the other."
"In addition, the difference is so large that Arsen operates differently than phosphor. It happens in our biochemic system where it is almost fucking everything", says Anbar.
The researchers set the Bakterium GFAJ-1 out a growing arsen concentration.
The microboy grows better in Phosphor, but it is also able to survive in arsens, shows that a arsen-based life form can happen, of course, on the earth or on another planet or moon, on which the arsen is more frequently present.
According to Jamie S. Foster, decentin for microbioology at the University of Florida, it is the idea that Phosphor can be replaced by arsens, not newly. But there was no more functional example.
Arsen came more frequently in the early years of the earth, she said, so the science has found that early forms of life have used it.
"There is the reason for the adoption that life can also have developed otherwise than in the early earthquake," Forster, who was not a member of Wolfe-Simon Research team.
Research work was supported by NASA, the Ministry of Energy and the National Health Authorities.
Exhibited exhibitions found in Compton
The remaining two of the four exhibitions that were stolen before a Belflower model were found in the Thursday's exhibition of Los Angeles County Sheriffs.
The four exhibitions - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh Corgis - disappeared on Sunday, as unknown in 2006 Chevrolet Express Valan, where the animals were undertaken before a Belflower Motel 6 night, so the authorities's audiences.
Two dogs were discovered in middle afternoon, and the last two last evening, said Steve Whitmore, a speaker of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"The good news is: the dogs are likely to go," so whitmore.
"They are in a good condition."
"They were returned to their legal owners."
Whitmore did not provide exact information on the foundation of the dogs, nor on the circumstances that have brought to their discovery.
"The Exhibitions are still running."
"We don't want to say more about it," says Whitmore.
"We follow some springs."
The dog owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, were not available on Thursday for exits.
They took their two dogs on middle afternoon in a district home in Downey in receipt.
Representatives of the Sheriff found the delivery car and the two dogs in different places in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old rude, and Didi, a 10-year-old Hungary - were not resolved by the Authority.
However, Corgis Bunny and Peter, Rickard and Peek, this week, in order of their Japanese owner, had been lost until midnight.
Peek and Rickard, who lived in Redding, took place this weekend because of the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach in the city, because Trace had to participate in the competition.
As Peek Times participated in the middle Thursday, the other dogs should participate in other competitions in other days before the AKC/Eukanuba show.
South-Kalifornia is a stop on the almost a month tour of the couple of dog view to dog view.
On Monday evening, Peek and Rickard were checked in the Motel.
They are often dinnered in Motels and park their delivery car before their room window.
They took three other dogs - a boxer wheel, a parson Russell Terrier and a Brittany - with in its hotel room.
The dickfast acitas and Corgis remained in the leefer car because it was cool there.
They left the window a breath openly, so the dogs had fresh air.
Peek and Rickard reported their cars on Sunday at 6:00 p.m.
Peek said to each one who could give a reference to the corgs to a finding loon. The animals were implanted to identification.
On Thursday, it was not yet found if a finding loon was paid.
The Lewe re-enforces the MGM structuring
After 18 months torbulations and uncertainties, MGM has finally obtained green light for a newgin.
A New Yorker Conkursator welcomed the "prepared" workshop to take the debts at $5 billion and the 86-year conversation company to provide the way for new films and television shows.
According to Thursday's discussions, the plan fulfils the requirements of the US Conkurs law so that the restart of MGM under the guide of Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, the founders of Spiyglas Entertainment, are not more in the way.
The amount of employees is estimated from over 400 to approximately 320.
For MGM, Chapter 11 is in force only when JPMorgan Chase has completed a planned allocation of $500 million for the financing of the new MGM productions.
A Consortium of the Investment Bank, which itself includes $75 million, is the company.
The restructuring of the studio began in May 2009 with the mandate to the Investment Bank Moelis & Co, the company management, fighting with payments of $300 million/year to help solve their financial problems.
In August, the manager Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO at Enron and restructuring expert known by his activities at Krispy Creme Doughnuts.
The efforts of Moelis & Cooper to solve financial MGMs and pay the more than 140 providers of the studio have been longer as expected.
Following months after discussions, the parties decided to offer the company to buy.
However, the auction was only a few bikes and no one wanted to pay $2 billion requested by the believers.
In the morning of this year, the MGM team started with the restructuring plan which was signed after monthly debates and internal conflicts end October endly signed by the believers.
When MGM has overlooked the competition in the next weeks, Moelis and Cooper will receive a good for their work at several million dollars.
The share for Moelis & Co. which have already received $1.2 million is $9.5 million.
Cooper that has been paid for the management of the company a monthly $375,000 receives a " success bonus" of $4 million.
Barber and Birnboum planned to restart the production with MGM. In this year the studio brought only a film and created a yearly plan with seven or eight films that should come to the knoos at the beginning of 2012.
Moreover, they plan two films after "The small Hobbit" in Co production with Warner Bros.
The studio needs a separate allocation between $265 million to $275 million for its financial share in these two films that should be included under the region of Peter Jackson.
The investor Carl Icahn, which has funded approximately 18% of the MGM dances, tried to a fusion of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, whose greatest actionnaire.
However, the latest negotiations between the two enterprises have not resulted.
Tech Todays keep your gifts in balance
The favorite of this year under the gifts is the iPad, probably followed by a Microsoft Kinect Video Console. Both games can travel a huge lounge in your gift.
A iPad costs so much as five BMX wheels for $99, while the price for a kinett game is approximately 10 classic spring lines or approximately 48 Double Play Down.
But you can enjoy your gifts.
Recently, I visited the search for three electronic games under $80,3 national players - a Wal-Marke, a "R" Us and a BJ's Wholeale Club.
I was immediately understood that Moores had entered into force. This year the technology games are more efficient and costs at the same time less than in the last year.
And though less new players appear with their own website, it is the most famous of this kind, webkinz and Club Pengun, a wide offer.
The market is always more button-clothing players, and many contained re-payable accus.
There are some recommendations.
(Alles do not indicate otherwise, all the prices of the "R" U.
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for children from 3 years) are bluefigurs, both large as sea-sweeners that canch a note when you press on their building.
Once pressing is a note, more times pressure can play a song.
More Sing-a-ma-jigs songs in Harmonie.
Warning: If you have started the pressure once, you can't stop anymore.
The Dance Star Mickey (Fisher Price $60, for children from 2) is the best choice.
Based on the developed Elmo Live Technology in the past year, the animatoric poppe Wechsel games like "Simon says" and by the newly reluctive locking tools, it manages the Moon Walk.
Children who test the device uses Mickey as a tank teachers. However, your parents are evaluated about the lack of smooth relief.
If you are a child of the 80s, you certainly remember Alphie, one of the first computerized learning games.
Now he's back there (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for children from 3), with a whole question card with a car to a training hour, with a owner with car correction function as a teacher.
If you don't like to trust your child your smartphone, three independent alternatives are here.
MobiGo from VTech ($60 for children from 3 to 8) is the most comprehensive and useful solution, equipped with a qvaluy tastature. The games contained there are not so slow as the leapster Explorer ($70, for children from 3 to 12), which is firstly reformed by Leapfrog with a new lighter screen.
No of the versions is compatible with old cases.
iXL from Fisher Price ($90 for children from 3 to 7) used for games and eBooks a similar system iTunes, and through the SD card card work can also be considered family phosos.
Lastly, there are still scrabble Flash ($30 from Hasbro, for children from 8). The five blocks are not greater than a steel wooden shot and have a own LED screen.
The game is about to assemble the blogs in words before the time ends. It's great for an improvised booking law lawyer.
Always more games have a type of online connection.
Only after the offer in the players, Webkinz and Club Penguin are the most important.
To store your kid on the club of Penguin, you can buy a disney Club Pengun 2" Mix'N Match Figuren Packet ($5 for children from 6 to 12) which contains a museum with a secret code.

It's glad to send him out of a garden.
And he holds some out.
Our dog fell from the kitchen and even survived some time in the moul of our dog.
Police units in China will be sweet
As a formal officer Tang Shenbin moves on a strong place, he checked his nervous submissions and shared it with military authority and warranted commands.
He wanted his female members of the Chengguan - China's rough watchers of the struggle order, feared and respected for their voluntary razies and their haging to violence - imposing the viewers.
"Where stand!"
"Climb out!"
"Speak them," he shouted to them, "What beautiful girls are that!"
Four girls, unfortunately growing from the teenager age, with white hands and identical olive green gardens and hoses standed straightly.
Four black pumps standed in a simple set.
Four ordinary hairs are perfect on the hair kept with blue-weiß.
"To see them averagely," Mr Tang notes little appreciation.
"Modles are nice."
Many governments have already tried to put the picture of China inspectors in the city.
In a city, all new candidates have to have a high school.
The province Guangdong brought a light blue unit instead of the green.
Wuhan in Middle-China replaced violence by low-sharing: 2009, following 50 officers, a non-good-profit car, and stirred the operator until he was packed after half hour and left the place.
Xindu, a city centre in Chengdu with 680,000 inhabitants, wants to change the image basicly.
Since 2003 13 women increased the stedical police leaders. They were specially elected because of their view, their good figur and their youth.
They need to provide the massive police a female aspect.
However, unfortunately, Scarlett Johansson would not be able to improve the bad image that the Chineses have from this city command.
With right, the criticians.
Otherwise than the police, these officials may only implement the stedfast laws with the hand of payers or other administrative punishments.
However, the Chinese media show a different image.
In January 2008, the officers in the province of Hubei had a survey to death when she filmed it with her phone, as they had a protestation against a mullhold.
In the past year, a school manual was stored and published on the Internet. It is described how criminals can be verified without blood control.
In this year, a Shanghai’s winter of water meloon was taken after a hand-mentioned manner with five servants of brain abuse.
A huge video game for violence that can be downloaded from the Internet shows exposed officials in China at an attack on roads.
"Chenguin fears the government", the National Journal of China Daily, last year, after further conflicts on tactics.
The newspaper required a "really green smoke".
Sceptiker find this approach clearly insufficient.
When the Distrik was looking for eight female recruitments in October, he made a editorial in the Beijing Evening News the question whether women had to be real tasks or only as an optical delay.
Probably both.
According to post notes, women were searched for a good figur and "harmonic faces" aged 18 to 22.
They should be overwhelmed - over 1,5m or 5 feet, 2 2/2 tickets.
Employment relations end with achievement of the 26th year of life.
According to the officials, the activities for women are to be strengthened over 25 physically.
"The most important is her image," he gave an unnamed District officer at the almost government site Rednet.com.
"Of the candidates get the job, first depends from their external appearance, like size, weight, faces, etc."
Then the temperature and "remember qualitys".
"Weak chengvans are like flowers," he said and added, "They have other obligations.
Zheng Lihua, a member of the city manager of the Distrikt, would not accept this description,
He added, however, that in China size provisions in positional notices for both genders are inevitable.
The same shall apply for equal faces.
If this is a good appearance, it is override in China.
But people with disabilities or physical disorders do not need to be recovered.
"We are unfortunately unable to use the lambs or bucklegs here," Mr. Zheng.
"The image wouldn't be good."
Liu Yi, who is paid on the baoguang plate near a closter, is 22, has a plot and a well-formed mouth.
It is not recommended as sexist that such a great value is put on its appearance.
"Do you think I'm seeing this uniform sexy?" she asks her with ironic views.
Her colleague with the Greeks, 21-Yu Yang, commented, "We have the task to represent the image of the city."
According to their information, they do not suffer the short position because they had more enormous carrier plans, as simply to shot the guests through the gases to disappear them on the business.
Every morning, the strife is along with about 12 roads, who try to sell a lot of flowers and topowers before they will continue.
"Sir Wang, get out of here."
"We have told you that so often!" said Frl. Xu a hair who had been laughing to foot, and then his nest cut on a road cart had left timely in the steel.
According to the officers, the activity is more than a monotone.
"It's almost every day the same", says Huang Jing, 20 who studies in the free-time distribution.
"All Routine."
A reason is that women's officers do not have to confiscate the goods of the traders, such as their male colleagues.
They can only tackle criminals to report them to their male prosecutors.
This will be protected from public efforts which are often exposed by officials in China.
In this year, hundreds of Kunming inhabitants, the capital of the province of Yunnan, after the tribe cured, would have killed a hamper.
More than a twentieth policeman and Chenguan officers, 14 government vehicles were cut off or covered in a band.
Xindu remained from such violence discovered.
However, injuries are not excluded.
Only two blocks away from the quiet Baonguang plate, where the female officers were paid at this morning, gathered more than 50 people on a road neck.
The officers had conformed a motor race that was recovered in a workplace instead of reforming the provisions on the citizens.
The owner's crying cells and Mordio.
After 15-minutes, the officers moved the way to their vehicles and continued with the motor road and his owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a co-ordinator of the male street, left back. He drew his white name ship to stay anonym.
As their colleagues play the coordinators - men more than 40 - a reintegrated role.
But they were not able to present a cleaner image.
"Main, we're going to be angry."
"Matchtimes also physically," says Mr. Li naked.
"The most time people are taking the fight."
Auditor of State does not appeal Senator Ensigno
The lawyers of the Minister of Justice have spoken to Senator John Ensignors of the accused who, after his business, had a former electoral officer and his attempt to deliver their husband a lobby activity against him, have known the advocates of the Senator on Wednesday.
This decision concludes the most serious legal proceedings against Senator Ensigno, the Republican of Nevada. To the Skandal, providing a landscape for lock cells and his carrier, he became the possible presidential candidate of the Republic for 2012.
As Senator Ensign's office known, he was encouraging the sentence after a year's investigation.
However, the Ethic Committee of the Senate could still deal with a discipline.
The Minister of Justice was informed that investigations against Senator Ensign were introduced and that there are no further complaints in this matter.
The Minister of Justice did not express himself on the case.
The judgment was a surprise for many Ethic complaints outside the Ministry of Justice, and your view was sufficient evidence that the Defence Prohibition had missed.
Interviews, E-mails and other documents which were opened in New York Times for the first time in October 2009 gave a statement to the conviction that Ensigno Douglas Hampton, one of his electoral help, had been able to sell a luxury retail for a business with Hamptons Ehefrau Cynthia.
Cynthia Hampton was active during a election campaign Ensigns as a Teacher.
Ensigno took contact with some political friends to provide Hampton work. According to the documents and hearings, he overlooked for them after Hamptons Lobby work.
Since Hampton was still in Ensign's elector team shortly, he was not taking any lobby work for his former employer or the whole senate for a year.
According to the Experience of Ethik Expertenders, the unrealised agreement between Ensign and Hampton, who had been aware of the company, against the prohibition of the drought-lobbycracy.
According to the published Indians, "related to a debate and the disaster against the Drehur Statistics", Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes the defence of customers who stand in the government visa.
During the Ministry of Justice, it was not officially aware of the reasons for the decision in the Ensignment, Mr. Brand and other Ethics said that the Minister was very careful in the adoption of political complaints after a number of dealers followed by the media with great interest, including the decision that the complaint against the former Senator Ted Stevens has been sentenced by a fault of the government manager in the past year.
The State Deputy "to be obviously terrified", said Melania Sloan, President of the Association "Citencias for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington" (other organization, whose goal is the fight of corruption in Parliament and government crisiss in the United States), a group of legal advocates who made different complaints against Mr. Ensignors.
"There is fundamentally that high government officials can now say that the laws do not apply to them," added.
Paul Coggins, the Chief Defender of Mr. Ensign, said in an interview, he received a call for a Monday and another on the next day that the ministry would not make a complaint against his clients.
Mr. Ensignors Defender had cooperated with the law lawyers in order to convince them that the Senator, as he reiterated his office in a statement in the middle of Thursday, reiterated “in accordance with the law”.
Mr Coggins, the legal arguments he had proposed to explain more accurately.
"I am not likely to go to the details of conversation between the Minister of Justice and me. It is only said: We believe that we have taken the right decision," he said.
Last month, the Federal Selection decided to establish submissions because of a separate case by the Ethic Group after paying $96,000 by Mr. Ensignors against the Hamptons against the Federal Selection Act.
The Election Committee said that there was no sufficient evidence that the money was another than a gift.
NV Energy, a large company in Nevada, who longly supported the Senator, was one of the companies in which Mr. Hampton found Mr. Ensign Lobbyisten's assistance.
One email of December 2008 said that after the company had continued as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensings Stabschef, John Lopez, had an appeal with Mr. Hampton, in which he shared him that he was in the Interior Minister for a case "anklopfe".
Mr. Ensign was also distributed with Mr. Hampton and another client from Nevada, Allgiant Air for a summer and asked the ministry of transport to agree with a meeting in the name of the air society after Mr. Hampton had established the Lobby work.
In the last year, Mr. Ensignors was deployed by his electoral electoral, and he made his position in the seat where he had been in the course of the Republics at fourth places.
After he had no longer been opened a few months, Mr. Ensignors said two weekly reporters that he understood a third office time in the Senate.
In the advertising that Mr. Anonymous is no longer the goal of police research, his pressing speaker, Jennifer Cooper, the Senator hopes that the Ethic Committee is very quickly implementing the example of the Minister of Justice and its comments.
"Senator Ensign is glad to continue its hard work in the service of people in Nevada," she said.
Cheshire Call takes attention to Twitter
A half half of them went away into the trial hall.
In a minute they disappeared their reports on green witnesses on Twitter.
At the end, the defence, there were more than 140,000 Twitter reports on the process of management and beds, kids covered in a house that was rising in flamen.
On Thursday, the process of attentively pursued by Steven J. Hayes, who was accused to have been killed three members of Cheshire, Connecticut, will find an official end if the judgment on the death sentence that the jury has spoken.
However, Mr Hayes advocates have already requested the court to submit the reasons for an appeal and the courts will be employed for years.
One of the most provocatory reasons is that, through intensive reporting on the process, also through the extensive use of Twitter by average reporters - to a "Cirsatmosphere" and a so far widely widespread reduction of the leading details, so that the jury has influenced in an inevitable way by public deployment.
This could allow the appeal management to work on whether new technologies are necessary in the courtroom.
"So that I have experienced it during this process, I think it is really a danger when the infringement of the new technologies in the court hall affects the right of each individual on a fair process," said Thomas J. Ullman, Mr. Hayes Major Defender.
The Chairman, Jon C. Blue of the Chief Room Order, whose last week the requests were decided shortly and advised, when he said that the new media would be "controlled carefully" and that there was no evidence that the jury of sufferings would be conducted.
But this was not the last word in this matter with security.
Since the decades, the Court of Justice has found that the reports on the famous cases have made a doubt of the fairness of a process.
In his historic decision of 1966, the Supreme Court of the United States sent the sentence against Dr. Sam Sheppard, an osteopath of Cleveland who had to kill his wife and said in his decision that it would have given a "carneval atmosphere in the Court" because of the new media.
Some believe that the television series and the game "To the flight" is based on this crime.
Some judges say that the Court's complaints, which Mr. Hayes has considered an average century later, could follow the argument that new rules were made necessary to regulate communication paths from the Court of Justice, which were still uninterprettable at the time of Dr. Sheppard.
"There is a good reason about the impact of the new media in processes which are followed by a wide public," said John J. Donohue III, professor at Stanford Law School, who has studied the deathstrafe in Connecticut.
Professor Donohue said that some appeal officers could have been indicated by the idea that the restriction of an active communication from the Court of Justice could make the processes more fair.
The accession of Twitter is only one of many who are the lawyers of Mr. Hayes to discuss for years and therefore leave a sentence.
For example, the defenders said that Mr Hayes could already have been condemned when the judge Blue had not allowed them to test the potential jury reactions by showing them a green tax photos during the jury selection.
Some of the jury have said, photos of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48 years old, and their tumors, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years, would have fulfilled them with a shopping.
The defenders say that they would also put the constitutionality of the death penalty constitution, and argue that the judge has, of course, undertaken a jury who had been a criminal of the State prosecution and that he would have been inevitable pressure on the judgment when he had taken the uncertain decision to release the jury over the weekend.
The jury were not isolated.
However, their arguments on the impact of the outcome reporting report may be the greatest interest on it.
In a complaint they had sentenced the past month, they found that the case had dominated the messages in Connecticut and had been discussed during the election camp for the Office of the Governors and the American Senate of the Canadians.
They argued that the new media continued to simplify the flames of the emotions on the case.
"On such daily anrange of the media pioneers, cameras and reporters outside the Court of Justice," the lawyers said, "which still is still in New Haven and may still not even land."
Your focus on the report reporting by Twitter is contrary.
In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that these direct messages were resumed as a shorter reports are a technician view that the reports on future processes were refunded.
However, some lawyers said that appeal officers would often confront the argument, social and technical changes were required by the courts.
Mr. Hayers' lawyers strengthen this statement.
In their imprisonment, they addressed the decision of the Principal Court of 1966, in which Dr. Sheppard was endorsed because of the report refund and made clear that the new media required new rules.
"This case," she wrote, "represented Sheppard against Maxwell of the 21th century."
Can we connect the division?
After a campaign of shopping and negatiality, this week has been little disappeared in Washington.
Is it the Ome of a real two-party cooperation or a moment of the illustration before you come back to the fight of the parties in the capital city?
The meeting between President Obama and the Summit of the Congress did not work on the major questions that were taken during the sudden. "Lame duck session", the meeting at the end of a government period in which no decision has been taken.
After all that you hear, there was no public discussion between two different sides nor a view of their shared responsibilities but more than an empty episode of a partial point meeting.
The public meeting of the Deficit Committee of the President on Middle Easter was civilized, notwithstanding the political differences that continue between members.
It seems to be clear that a close interaction of a period of months allows mutual respect to which the ideological climate continues to separate the members from each other.
It's pretty enough to say it's been broken a new medicine of cooperation.
The two sides are now in a test phase where one of the other characters of cooperation and compromising preparation are requested, while you are attempting to disappear the borders of public opinion and the duration of the electors after a new party war management.
Therefore, the meetings on the Sunday themselves and its estimation were limited by the participants to a minimum of requests or accused.
The philosophic differences between Obama and the Republicians are too high and too deep, as it could be expected to a rapid change of the atmosphere that had been predicted in the past two years.
It does not exist about taxes, dependents, health or expectations, both sides are mile away from each other.
Lastly, the November selection of Washington has set at least mild for a short time.
"No question that the tonn case has changed," Pete Wehner said, a official representative of the Bush Government, who is now working for the "Ethics and Public Policy Centre".
"It's uncertainly by choices.
The elections will increase partly sufferings that are resolved.
And that's good."
In some questions, particularly those in the agenda of the "lame duck session", the Republic and Democrats have no other choice to find a solution.
Bush's tax rates end the end of the year, and nobody is worried about it.
Both sides want to find a way to maintain some or even all, whether it is now past or long.
It is also a compromise to wait for the increased unemployed employees, while only because the republics are not able to allow themselves to believe that the favourable tax rates for the riches, while they are unemployed workers.
Following the meeting on Sunday in the white house, the optimism increased in these questions during the "lame duck session" some and at the same time can be ratified by the new START Treaty.
However, William Glaston of Brooking's Institution warns that successful cooperation in urgent issues of the lame duck session should not lead to a sustainable cooperation of the parties if the new 112th Congress is called in January.
Instead, he says, it is a phase of non-convention that is likely even uniform.
"After the things which have to be done, this short-term psychology will be killed in confrontation," he said.
Weather is also skiptic - and this scepsis is divided by many - the liberty of real cooperation.
"I see many things from today to 2012, as a pre-catch, or shadow boxes, for the main arrival of 2012," he said.
The reasons for this have many to do with the emphasis of the new republic majority in the white house and with the teparty electors whose education was well-being.
As the republic leaders also like to be high to know that they need to try to reduce the expenditures of the government and to keep the health reform without force.
These stakeholders will already be clear in the first reactions on the recommendations of the Deficit Committee, which holds tax reform and removal of certain taxes, and the increase of the pensioner and the expenditure of State expenditures.
The Vice-President Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles have taken one of the most difficult jobs in Washington, according to their own appreciation, so it is very concerned that the deficit demand for the public agenda can not be ignored.
But they need within the Commission 14 of the 18 votes to make their plan of official recommendation and to fight very much so that they can only be closed to this number.
The largest contradiction is found in the elected representatives of the Group, as in financial questions, at least today, only little play space or little sympathy for compromises.
Galston says two steps in the fight between the white house and the Republicians in the Congress.
The first fight will be held in the form of participation stakeholders in the next year when the Republic of Obama requests the State Budget, taxes and health systems, then followed by a stage of greater two-party cooperation.
What will be done to this change?
The public opinion.
It is demonstrated that, despite the participation of the current choice, most of the Americans still want to work together, the two parties.
If confrontation leads to a sackgase as happened in 1995, both parties must take carefully on the public reaction.
Whoever is always condemned for losses will change the course and need to seek the compromise.
This may actually be a optimistic view.
Participation and polarization today are larger than in the middle of the 1990s, and they seem to be a greater ideological climate between Obama and the Congress Republics than that of time between President Bill Clinton and the Republics.
At the same time, the activeists of both parties 2010 see as a relaxed pre-heading game for a successful weitaus election in 2012.
This can be seen by many Americans who are taking place this week will be welcomed by many Americans.
However, on both sides it will require much more attempt to find a common nenner in the questions that are divided by the two.
The US Document is portrait by Moscow as a port of corruption
The control of the city is located in the hands of the "Climatecracy" and it gives a part of the protective taxes that she assembled to the crown. In February, it reported the American news in Russia in a Memo.
Although the police and the State Security Service expressed high protection lawyers so that they can keep their deep standards of life in Moscow, it means.
They gather money not only from legitimated business, but also of organized criminal bands.
Each burden of the Office - what the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called as "Vertical of Authority" - takes part of the money that the leader walks up above.
The Memo sent to Washington on his homepage on the Sunday of WikiLeaks, under the name of the Ambassador John Beyler.
The Memo is based on sources whose names were edited.
It was written during Yuri Luzhkov and Moscow, and it accused him of corruption.
He was satisfied in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there is no evidence that it would be found in the interim time.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who has a well-known manager, have always revealed for years of corruption prejudices, and he has gained numerous delays against these accuses.
In September, he explained a Russian televisor when he was asked after a documentation suggested that he was corrupted: "It's crazy, it's ridiculous, it's crazy."
> Incrediblely a large number of Russians believe that their society is corrupt.
But it is not usually that, as it was done in the report of the newsletter, individuals are named, and it is not obvious that this is a diplomate of a foreign country.
"The direct connection of the Government of Moscow with criminality has led to describe some of them as "which" and to conclude that the government is more like a climiscrat as a government, so the Memo.
"Criminal elements enjoy a "Cryshna" (un determination from the world of crimes / Mafia, which means "Tach" or protection), which is based on the police, the State Security (FSB), the Service Survey Authority (MVD) and the Office of the State Assistant, as well as through the whole Moscow Government Office.
Some people have discovered a three-level structure within Moscow's criminal world.
"Luzhkov stands on the top place."
"FSB, MVD and the military stand at the second level."
"Later, the ordinary crimes and the criminal inspectors are followed at the bottom level."
"This is an incompatible system in which criminal groups in some areas close a lie because the city does not provide any help."
The report further says that the FSB has paid money from the largest companies and that the police arrests small business officers.
A source, that means, "considers that Moscow's business managers understand that it is best to get the protection of the MVD and FSB (and not from the organized crime), because they have not only more weapons, resources and power than criminals, but also because they are protected by law."
"For this reason, protection is no longer asked by criminal gangs as previous."
The Memo notes that, while the collection of money is comprehensive, the protection itself is not very different; even those who pay, sometimes are arrested.
Those who do not pay their business will be very fast closed, because of one or other.
Medvedev has spoken several times about fighting corruption, but has noted at the same time that he has only made little progress.
The Memo of the message contains descriptions of men with kitchen who probably were full of money in the crowd.
"In his fight against corruption, Medvedev must leave the offices," said Georgy Satarov, Director of Inde, a Moscow Expert Committee, recently in an interview.
"But he's part of this officekration."
"It is no part of the political class because a political class in Russia no longer exists."
Without political, without opposition, without separation of violence, he says, corruption is uncertainly.
The country, so estimates Indem, costs the russ corruption over $300 billion per year.
In 154, the country includes a new investigation on the global recognition of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (LD countries are led by "the least corrupt" to "the most corruption".
The enthusiasm of the Memos of the American news that happened after Moscow's time later will be solved with security miscarried within the Russian government, although Luzhkov can be accused for Moscow errors, it may also be an opportunity to say that the creaml is solving the problems.
In an interview with Larry King for CNN, Putin stated that the WikiLeaks document could be a flower and reacted warmly on the enthusiasm that American diplomates called him Batman and Medvedev Robin.
"The truth is that our interaction is an important factor of the internal policy in this country," he said.
"But to be honest, we wouldn't expect this with such arrogancy, with such pressure and in such unethic way, you know."
Khmer Red Veterians to confront with the past
In a weakly visited classroom with smoke and abusive walls, the Director of the Adjourner of Veng High School reminds the man who built him, the next Khmer Red Leader Tak.
"All here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader, and he took care of his people," said Serng Cor Ma, 42 years.
By his Brutality during the Khmer Red Herrschaft is known as "the Slavery", the commandor remains in this former Khmer Rouge-Hochburg, in North West Kambodschas, where he built hospitals and bricks, which has developed the infrastructure and where thousands of former soldiers still live.
However, this year, 12 years after the Capitulation of Khmer Rouge against the government, the applicants are requested for a long year in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local fashion of truth and repair allowed the victims to confront the public with those who first supported the regime.
In June, the government distributed a school book, which the first time the children of former soldiers tells the history of the Khmer Rouge.
And in July, a Community officer of the United Nations and Kambodschas first condemned a former member of the Khmer Rouge, when it was the former chief of the famous Tuol Sleng Folter Chamber, King Khek Iev, better known than duke, 35 years of prison.
With each of these developments, the fear of the Khmer Red Veteran Alnlong Vengs increased its efforts to facilitate and reintegrating in the Kambods society.
"It's still awareness and fear in the former Khmer Red, but they have no power to do anything," said Chhang Youk, head of the Kambodschas's documentation centre, an independent organization that seeks the regime.
"For she was the life under the Khmer red, but the regime has become a symbol of evil."
"It's specifying themselves families."
During the Khmer Red Herrschaft in Kambodscha, between 1975 and 1979, 1,7 million were evaluated or died in diseases, transformation or hungry.
In 1979, the Poland-Id Governments fled the overlook of the regime and its military to the Kambodsian borders to Thailand.
There they spread up until December 1998, when the last movement was captured, unruly.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the Guerilla War from their Basis in the West of the Mounts and Dschungel of Kambodscha, Ta Mok reached the next generation in Anlong Veng.
But in the middle of the 1990s, as a United Nations peace agreement has led to the first democratic elections of the country, large groups of Khmer Red Armies began to overcome the government, which led to the capitals of Ieng Sary 1996 and Nuan Chea and Khieu Samfan 1998.
Pol Pot died in 1998 with a natural death and Ta Mok, which had not provided, was arrested by government forces at the Dangrek mountains in 1999.
He died in 2006 in the prison of Phnom Penh, where he was waiting for his process.
When their gods had no longer protected them, most of the old Khmer red arms fled into the destroyed army of the rural Kambodshasa and many helped the movement in nostalgic memory.
Even though some few electric officials of the Khmer Khmer had visited their local government posts because they had lodged their weapons, the simple soldiers of poor, unformed farmers remained.
"They people have only been very little benefited from the capitalation," said Sok Leng of the Centre for Justice and Renforcement, which holds throughout the Kambodsha, even in Anlong Veng, public forests
"They are heavy in the utopic agricultural technology of the Regime."
"They have grown without any profession."
Its Lim, 55 years old, who was engaged in 1974 as the teenager of the Rhhmer Rouge, was fighting in the thungel about an enclosing veng before he departed in 1998 to lead a life as a poor traveler.
"The life under the Khmer Red was good," he said.
"Ta Mok has given everybody to eat."
"But now the life is hard because we need to worry about yourself."
The Running Khmer Rouge Court has also been concerned about this.
At the beginning of the next year, the court will try to appoint Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife as well as Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge Minister, before the court.
The Court's order is to condemn the senior leaders and those who are mainly responsible for the civilians, but it is not said whether it will be conducted further on these four cases.
This has little helped the wormest in Anlong Veng.
The current media speculation has been focused on In Chaem, 64 years, which was during the Khmer Red Governance in the late 1970s of Distriktchefin in the province of Manteay Meanchey.
In 2007, she told the documentation centre of Kambodscha that she led the construction of the trapeang Thma Damms, a project that probably died for thousands of workers.
On one hot evening, the Chamber from the work on the fields came back to their wood house at a smoke road outside Anlong Veng.
When the sun had long shadows on the stormed grass it ended in the chame to discuss their past at the Khmer red.
If the court was invited to her, she would refuse to go, she said.
"Kambodscha lives in peace and stability," she said.
"If there were no more persecutions, it would be war here."
Prime Minister Hun Sen, who has been laid down in 1878 by the Khmer Rouge, also warned that the situation would be uncertain, the court would appeal more conscious, although the experts and historics discuss this.
"Kambodscha must bury a lounge and bury the past," said he.
But the confrontation with the past is what Kambodscha needs to do to go forward, said Chhang Youk from the documentation centre.
"Respring with the Khmer-times means the composition of the broken pieces," he said.
"It's our obligation to put these broken parts together so as it can understand."
The Center had the first authorized school book on the Khmer Red, the 75-year-old "History of the Democratic Kambodsha".
It distributed the book in June in Anlong Veng as an annex to the history book for the High School of Education, containing less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge.
As often in Kambodsha the young people in Anlong Veng knows only little about the Khmer Red, although the city’s connections to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19 years, a student at the nearby Veng High School, said that the new school book helps students to understand an important part of their story.
But his parents reacted skiptic when he brought the book home to read it.
"My family learns many parts of the book and the court," he said.
"They are misstraint because they are not sure how many are judged by the court."
A such contradiction makes the provision process complex and complex, said Sok Leng.
But the public forums, school book and the court have reached and after influence," he said.
Still, the Khmer Rouge has a powerful relaxation here.
Upwards in the Dangrek mountains leads a super-covered and with plastic mould to a right of black red, covered with a red beach.
Paul Pots body was burned here after his death in 1998.
Noom Sothea, 31 years old, a telecommunicator on the street, said that she was not much knowing about the man who was burned here.
"But he has a strong spirit and many people go to pray to him," she said.
It was Nuom Sotheas birthday and later on the day she wanted to go to Poland's last restroom where she'd bear a bus of bearing bananas - in hope that he would bring her luck.
Belarusland is intended to collect non-emptive uran
In a surprise victory for President Obamas campaign on global security of nuclear materials, the Government of Belarus in Middle, announced that there will be no longer reached higher uran, which is a critical part of nuclear weapons.
In a common statement, after a meeting of the Minister Hillary Rodham Clinton with the Belarus External Minister Sergei Martynov was known in an additional article of the Security Division.
The U.S. Government had tried for years to convince the white country to gather up no longer reached uran, and it seemed to have reached a harm last summer.
However, officials of the US Government told Washington Post that two secret agreements had been met with Whiterussland in the past two months in order to remove an armed uran from a white-russe research station.
It prepared the funds for the convention in the middle of Tuesday to remove the rest of the material, according to an official employer, remaining due to the sensibleness of the subject anonym, approximately 500 per cent.
The Agreement seems to be one of the most important results of Obamas 'Nocalal Safety Group of the 47 Nations' of April which was excluded by Belarus.
And it was clearly good enough to ensure the invitation of the former Soviet Republic to the next Thursday 2012.
"I was really glad that they wanted a seat in the Nuclear Safety Chamber ( 2012)."
"It proves that it works," said Ken Luongo, President of the Global Security Partnership, a group to promote nuclear security.
Clinton called the Agreement on "the very important, important step" of Belarus.
Obama discussed in April 2009 in Prague to secure all precalable nucleal materials within four years.
Since the U.S. Government has helped six countries to disappear her high-related uran.
Belarus will be seven.
A half countries did it under the government of George W. Bush.
For the time of Obamas Nuklear Security Group, the Belarus Chairman Alexander Lukashenko declared that the nation will never be put up his uran.
"What keeps highly reached uran - hundreds of Kiloes, which is fundamentally weaponable, and less reached uran," said Lukashenko at that time.
"It's our raw material... we're not gonna make a smooth bomb and we'll sell nobody."
"We use it exclusively for research, that's all."
Nevertheless, Belarus is close to the United States a few months ago when it was interested in the meeting of an agreement.
The first stage to remove the Uran Whiterussland in October was particularly complex because the material was easy to say officials.
It was downloaded in a special course, which is more than 1.300 miles to a Russian factor for camping and disappearance, officials say.
The second stage was decided on Monday and was carried out according to the officials by aircraft.
The US government pays $14 million, with a major part of the money in the white-Special Research with weak-related uran, which cannot be used for nuclear weapons.
"There was extremely coordinated and decided to build confidence," held by Clinton's agreement, Andrew Beniawski said a representative of the Energy Minister who worked on the global danger.
James Martin Center estimated that in this year, at least 88 percent of the guns and hundreds of Pfund were highly sufficient.
Belarus will, in accordance with the Joint Agreement, solve its position until 2012.
The relations between the United States and the United States have been relaxed for many years, first line for Lukashenkos have been unfair human rights.
But the statement from the middle of October suggests a possible approach.
"The progress of these global security issues welcomes the United States of America and Belarus that a higher respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus is a central theme in improving bilateral relations and is essential for the progress of the country and its citizens," she explains.
None of the Spanish government against CIA flights
The Spanish government had no objection to the CIA flights with Taliban and Al-Qaida prisoners on Spanish State in Guantánamo, as a telegram of the U.S. Ambassadors in Madrid.
This reflects the documents made by Wikileaks and the daytime "El País" (for Kabel) further delivered. It will be added that the former government chain Mary Teresa Feresández de la Vega requested the Spanish government to be informed "for proof that foreign aircrafts that are overcome will be monitored appropriately."
In June 2006, after the publication of a report of the Council of Europe, in which the aid on human rights practices in a ducent countries, including Spain, was adopted, the former North American Ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega was discussed.
The government finance added that the Council 'hove Zapatter' report was taken in the area and confirmed that Spain has nothing to hide in this matter.
"The Vega has understood, Spain has no objection against the secret flights on Spanish State."
"You're just wanting to be informed" to not "un prepared surprise", reports Aguirre by Kabel.
The former Minister of Foreign, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, who argued that the spanish government, "this question is not a great attention, although the government has only little influences because they are in the hands of the judges."
In January 2007, the Officer Vicente González had understood that he would not block the right initiative to declassify the documents of the Spanish Secret Service Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on CIA flights.
"Their reports contain no charged or sensitive information," said the messager after a conversation with the State Officer.
Nevertheless, the United States were concerned about the "declared coordination between the Spanish State Officer and the German Members" than the declassified information of the CNI and the Ministry of Defence.
"This coordination between independent investigators will complement our efforts to discrete maintenance between governments," said Aguirre.
At a summer day in March 2007, in which the officials of the United States and the Spanish Minister Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba participated, the latter commented that "although the Spanish judges were strongly regarded their independence and the duties they keep appropriate," he gave his employees instructions "to avoid revolutionary comments in order to disappear the sponsory."
The Ambassador also expressed concern about the PP's progress in this matter.
"In its general pro-American Halting, we teach our experience that the PP will not have any doubt, by a note that the Government of Zapatters' acts of the United States, which could be made as possible human rights violations, tolerated or initially ignored, will be killed, even if these infringements could be negative to the United States Government."
The kid's promotion has been evaluated in the Internet about the "feed" of the mothership.
The young woman said about the child when it was dead and she had a blog: "Terror on Galician Art"
Monica Juanatey Fernández is on the Internet "Muki".
Under this name that she leads from little, it takes it with a cousin and at least a friend contact. Both of Noia, a village in the province of La Coruña, where she was born.
The communications are from 2008.
In order to understand them, you must know their love life that the ABC’s day rebuilding on the basis of witnesses of their family members.
The 30-year-old Gallic woman took a relationship with Iván Tuñez, a industry.
She kept a year.
Soon after she solved her relationship, she was known that she was pregnant.
He wanted to know whether the baby was of him, but his former gave him never a DNA analysis.
She was very short about another relationship.
The elector was Alberto, a young man of Lousame, a neighborhood.
She lived long with him.
César lived with them.
When the young woman went to the Balears to see herself on the labour market, the small remained with her partners that even joined Palma for a week.
But from the contents of their messages it can be closed that their love relationship is broken and divided.
In March 2008 she's just on Menorca and writes: "Alberto's very own and sweet because I'm coming to work."
"If I shared this, he found it well, but now he knows of course what it means to be alone with the boy all the day and not to be free to do and to let what he wants."
Afterward she told a communication she received on the phone: "I want you to return this month or allow me to come to a address that I can send you to the boy."
She said, "If he doesn't like that I leave the boy with my mother, I'll take him when I'm back."
In May, she said from the return to her village: "This week I'm going there, but I'm gonna stay there until 19, because I have to submit to a job if I don't want to lose it."
She explains she's taking her first birth if it's okay.
"It will be at which he must be, that means me. No way I will leave him back to someone else with my mother," a doubtful intention if you have their bad relationship.
In July there's another mail.
When she writes this, the boy who came to the island on the 1st month and was probably killed on the 10th.
"Onewhere, César is not satisfied, otherwise."
"Every, he's with me and the place he likes a little, but on the other hand, he's got to go to school every day."
She's talking about a move to Mallorca.
"That will he (the boy) visit a summer course, so I have less expenditures for children."
On 17th: Remembers and charts.
"A Riesenkus of Ceser, who asks me when you come."
"Alberto says he sent me some videos to the email.
On the 30th one, "The boy's gonna be fine. He's going to be a summer course to learn Catalan."
From Victor, her current partner, there is one: "He shows me money."
In the Internet, in Anime and Managelogs, there are communications from it.
She had even a own blog in MySpace, which is now closed, and she called "Muki, the prisoner."
"Terror the Galleg (Original)."
The last man who lived together with her, a sincere jagd survey explains to have a conscience because he feels faultful.
He can't understand that everything happened because she didn't tell him that she was the only mother.
Monica was yesterday transferred from the Centre of Justices to Menorca to the Province of Palma.
The defender, Carlos Maceda, explained that she could not remember the end of the ground, "and she didn't have the intention to add to the small damage."
But before, she had decided to shot Ceser in the bathroom and had shot his body in a kitlon.
Defence and government administration requested a psychiatric view.
Partido Popular gained 4 places in the Congress and PSC was lost 9
With the results of 28 November, the PP could play a vital role in the cities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
Following the important votes and Member States to the last regional elections, the PP has already been viewed on the elections of Parliament or not. Its expectations are more positive, because the number of votes that these parties offer to these elections is usually doubled as the elections in Catholic.
The Catalan People Party, 610.473 votes in the Parliament elections of 2008, and these figures were in the regional elections in 2006 only 316.222.
In the last Sunday, the PPC reported 384.091 votes.
If this increased tendency - results of the rotation of the GPC and the binding of the electority of the PP - should continue to pronounce the analysis of the PP that the PPC could resolve from 8 to 12 Congress Order, while also CiU has now been four (10) and the PSC would be removed at least 9 voters (of 25).
These calculations are the fundamental importance of Catalonians for PP and PSOE.
According to the analysis of the People Party, ERC would lose a Deputy - currently has three - while ICV holds its fellow Members or could be able to enter.
However, if the elector's calendar is maintained, the next date may be held with the municipal elections in the May 2011. The Volksparty (PP) can also be the language in the Waage to prepare the Socialist Presidency, in four provinces capitals and their majority in the Barcelone Council of Barcelona, one of the city managers with the greatest budget: 661 million euros for 2011.
Although nationalists and the People Party agree that the PSC can lose the cities of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where socialists or their traditional commitments (ERC and ICV) are not able to lose.
After the republic debacco, it is not obvious that this party will lose their participation in the Barcelone Council of Barcelona, where 5% of the voices are expected.
The PP has added an ensuring of its vote share in the four provinces capitals and could be the essential force in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
Nationalists are convinced to play the main roles in Tarragona's confusion. There they had before the current citizen, Josep Félix Ballesteros, together with PP.
The PP is only 500 voices behind the PSC. The citizen, Anngel Ros, has a good relationship with Mariano Rajoy, during the last election campaign they are once again.
In other important places, such as Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus, the People Party could describe an important advice.
The PP is currently present in 34 city managers and strives the education of lists in many places as possible.
The Catalonian cell was kept Al Qaida thousands of travelers
Besides the seven festivals in Barcelona, there were three more in Thailand
The seven police officers of the secretary office of the police Barcellona and the Nigerians formed those of Thailand controlled dschihadist cells, different Al Qaida groups, including the "motion to release Tamil Eelam" (LTTE) and "Laschkar e-Taiba" (Let) last was the author of the attentation in Bombay, who requested 106 dead - with pounds.
The Spanish Internal Minister shows these investigations a great importance that it is to ensure that the "Operation Kampai" is the Fabrication Device Al Qaidas worldwide "covered" and "for their ability".
In the two years in which the cells in Catholic were active, thousands of pockets were sent to Thailand where they were hungry and then to the groups of which the criminal galaxie Al Qaida had been sent to overcome their "counters" in order to overcome the borders of European and other West countries.
The discovered cell is not the only one of the dschihadistic network which has been active in Europe. Therefore other European police entities have contributed to research. It is not excluded that it will be similar attitudes in the EU's area in the next days, such as the past service was carried out in Barcelona.
In coordination with this operation (the Pakistanian Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Siticahar Ahmad, Mohammad Saddique Khan Begum, Tanveer Arshad and the Nigerian paternity Agunbiade) were done further in Thailand in which the Pakistanian Muhammad Athar Butt and Zeeshan Ehsan Butt were arrested as well as the Thaillands Sirikanlaya Kijjbation.
They had led from Bangkok cells in Spain and other European countries.
The Catalonian Network - a part of it was degraded in 2009 - particularly tourist passengers in accordance with the indications of the "International Islamic Front".
This means that the documents on the names of men of ages of 25 to 45 and have to be valid for several years.
In investigations, it is underlined that there are no links between the Catholics and the Attent in Bombay, although the author of this attent was "Laschkar e-Taiba", one of the groups of recipients who were stolen in Spain and then in Thailand.
Nevertheless, it should be recalled that some days before the Attent of Catalonia were sent from a money transfer undertaking several thousands of dollars that were used in the buy of prepaid cards for mobile telephones "invested" later by members of the "Commandos", which were prepared for the life of 106 people.
The police has taken a comprehensive documentation.
PP requests a number of tax agreements
The Chairman of the PPC, Alice Sánchez-Kamacho, took the opportunity to present Artur Mas personally their conditions for supporting his office as the President of the General Office, which did not distinguished from those already during the election campaign and will be given the priority of the economic reconstruction and the appointment of regionalism independence, such as a financial comparison that the regional leader would like to comply at the level of its mandate.
The Chairman of the Catholic People Party advised the security of Artur Mas, which you trusted the 18 Members that she had gained on the last Sunday - a number that is more enough to feel incompatible, because the candidate of the recent-regionalist party CiU has indicated that at least one of the opposition parties contains the vote at its office.
The future contributions to the regional authorities to the next Parliament's elections in the Congress depending on a possible difference with the PP, and the discussions that lead the mass with the remaining parties are about Catalonia.
With regard to the PPC party, it calls for the support of the Office's jurisdiction "all diskurs relating to the sovereignty and independence of Catalonians" as well as an agreement on the financial balance between the State and the Autonomen region - similar to the Baskland and the party of CU even a referendum.
Both political leaders are commonly that they make the building political device of the Regional Administration and want to establish the benefits and grant tax.
The PPC Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat are working with the details of the negotiations on the Office of Mass.
Mas has already occurred with Joaquim Nadal (PSC) who announced a hard opposition - and Joan Herrera (ICV). Today he is joined with Joan Puigcercos (ERC), Albert Rivera (Ciutadans) and Joan Laport (Solidaritat Catalana).
The former home confirms that the death cases are not to take place in "related measures"
The owner of the old home in Olot doesn't clos that her owner killed about eleven old people
The responsible of the old home La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) yesterday gave a press conference in which they discovered the crimes of Joan Vila Dilmés, who had added the work of at least eleven people who had been responsible for the institution.
The leader of the old home, Joan Sala, held in the leadership of his lawyer, Joan Cañada, to the court, and announced, "La Caritat wants to accurate the responsible (for the death cases)," but "the law and our competence of the duty have granted us to the process and the civil abuse."
The establishment must not only take a social loss because it had not been determined at time by the criminal acts of the complaint, but now also pay a high level of disappearance that is calculated by the lawyers of the family members of the victims.
Joan Vila Dilmé agreed that the first crime was returned in August 2009 and that he continued to murder.
The judge commanded the exhumation of eight body patients - former patients of the old home - as he thought that no doctor has been studied personally the losses, but the formalities have been developed because of their age and diseases.
The leader of La Caritat rejected this point around and explained that "the remaining measures could not be the reason for the cases."
The La Caritat's lawyer added that there were no individuals in the legal direction for the acts of another person than the accused.
The baptism already had been baptized as "Todesengel" at last eleven murder and explained that the first crime was tried on August 29, 2009 and had killed the second old woman later.
In this case, he killed a superdosis insulin, except for the first crime in which he had a mixture of different abuses.
Head of La Caritat explained that the access of the staff to the medicines is only difficult to control.
The insulin princes and the cocktail of medicinal cocktail set up in six of nine began crimes to release patients from death of their suffering.
But the results of the labor investigations will be explained whether Vila lies and has actually chosen a less grievous death for his first victims, or whether he had burned them from inside, as he had done understanding at three women who he killed between 12 and 17 October.
In La Caritat, the statements of the complaint do not have faith, not even what is the number of aggravated murder that could be overcome. This option is justified that Vila had done very different explanations before the court and that there is no sense to change his action by eight successful murders.
They say that they were available from this reason and to explain the reign range of these cases of justice.
European Central Bank (ECB)
The investors yesterday reacted on the damage of the president of the ECB Trichet who warned that the markets should not undermine our reaction duties.
The risks of the euro-Perifer countries have increased dramatically and the accents of the European Banks are more than 5%.
However, we should have the possibility that the ECB can tackle himself and that the euro has not been signed at points which are allowed for concern.
The events of yesterday are typically for an unfair market, which is recovered in the measure in which it has come again, however, due to the closure of shorter and high speculative positions.
The institutional investors will not perish his fear for a long time.
Today, a month ago, the European Central Bank invited us to make our licensing actions, as the ECB tomorrow in two years, and probably still some times in the future must be re-enginated.
The Federal Bank requested the plan to buy State debts, as they are ineffective, and the resumption of all extraordinary licensed measures, which should only be maintained unlimited access.
After the Ireland crisis, we hoped that the current liability measures are extended at least until March and that the four-yearly outlines will be kept with an unlimited access to the Quartal date to guarantee liquidity until at least June.
We also hope that the programme continues to buy obligations and will be given a strong sign.
If the created expectations will not be fulfilled, the excellent reaction of the markets of yesterday will be returned again and when it is strongly concerned that we take back our licensing measures, only God can help us!
As well as at the ECB session in May, where the bank was established to not take into account the purchase of State debts and the markets could retain this story tomorrow.
The ECB must be faithful and careful.
In May she showed the deafs and in middle, she said to have already been buying a lot, which caused a new combustion of the market.
Tomorrow, the authorisation of an annual State title in Portugal was quite low.
The Government's administration was only 500 million to 5,28%, compared to 750 million to 4,81% in the previous auction.
Nevertheless, the rates in Portugal falled around 30 base points in the whole currency and reflected the changes of markets according to the words of Trichets.
In Ireland, the numbers of the Criminal Law were published by Allied and the Bank of Ireland.
The sum is estimated to approximately 10 million short-term and possible more 15 000. It is time until February to establish private capital or to distribute these banks.
Although Ireland has been completely lost its credibility since it had not recognized the problem with stress tests in July, the numbers in the framework of the Rescue Plan are acceptable and helped to reduce uncertainty.
However, the Government must receive the parliamentary approval to its new budget, as it still does not have sufficient support, Ireland is also a source of uncertainty.
Angela Merkel has established its diskurs with regard to the meeting of the government heads and the Government on 14 December. It is asked for political unity to show that we play the same party together.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the other countries the new Sinfonia Beethovens.
The Spanish President presented the plan of action to be adopted on Friday by the Council.
Rental reform, transparency in the Autonom regions such as the financial institutions, the restructuring of the State Efficiency, Liberalization, Privatization and Training Actions. Actions in the ears of investors such as Vivaldis for four years.
The double effect of Zapater and Trichet explains why the Spanish boreas has made around 4,5 percent, doubles both as the rest of the European bars.
With regard to February, the reaction of the Government and the Spanish Central Bank was rapidly and convinced and we benefit from the surprise effect.
Today, there is an important authorisation of a three-yearly State offence that will take advantages from the Trichet Effect, and therefore we put on a strong demand that will be removed by all doubts of our debtability.
For Spain, the request of a assistance plan would be a self-offer.
We would receive the license that we don't need. The shadow has 40 billion euros, three times as much as in March. The rates are overwhelmed and the access to the markets would be closed freely.
Nevertheless, our strategy should refer to Motto Cäsar's wife: "There is not only the self, but also the jealousy."
Just hurting, we're creating it!
The Chairman of Eulen is a complaint on the request of his children to the Vega Sicilia Society
The sturm in the open conflict of the family Álvarez, owner of society Eulen and El Enebro, is not flat.
David Álvarez, a reasoner of the company gorgeous, will find the company's meeting of El Enebro, which will be held at the request of five of his seven children on 16th, noticed as he holds it for "solut fair". His children will try to receive a majority to control the managers of the company - Inhabitants of the Wedegas Vega Sicilia -.
David Álvarez and his sons, Jesus David and Mary Joseph, prepared the legal measures for a new justice captain in their war to control a part of the company.
It seems that the reasonant of the largest Holding for Business Services does not be ready to provide the controls of El Enebro's bodies.
The Board of Administration was issued by five of its seven children, which were appointed to the Acting Meeting of 18 January this year, which was already presented in the Register of Trade, to Members of the Administration Council.
The Society of El Enebro, who was invited by the judge of the Trade Guideline, point 2 of Madrid for the 16th, has issued a new Thursday on the Álvarez Family School.
The call for the judge to appoint the congregation is the only legal way to ensure the entrance of the company.
The latest strategy of Juan Carlos, Paul, Emilio, Marta y Elvira Álvarez Medicinal is designed by David Álvarez as a "sociated resources of the applicant - his five children - to announce through legal specificity, abusive mass and abuses of the jurisdiction of the 18 January.
This argument is the basis for the intention of the congregation to explain it as a "related none".
The same protagonists who call on discreet difficulties in June have already been successful to attend a congregation on the right way.
In El Enebro - Employment society and inhabitants of Bodegas Vega Sicilia, besides other property values - control David Álvarez's seven children 100 percent of the capital.
The reasoning of the Service Group requires the family logs the right of use over 51% of the capital.
This is the actual background of the matter on which the judge has decided to treat the complaint's complaint for which no date has been found.
Red Bull sees in the F1 with a secret wave of Siemen
The cars are improved with a software in real time.
Since Red Bull 2004, in the world of Formel 1 ended, their story in this reading university has been prepared in the speed of surprises and follow-up.
At the beginning, no one took the observation of the reluding and, although his part of the rising world during the last season, all at the hill of Ferraris of Ferrando Alonso were set at the end of November last.
Besides the ability of the German pilot and the world managers of Sebastian Vettel or the highest performance of the renault engine, the "screen wave", which the Multi Siemens Red Bull put into the hands, and so that a team of victory became ready.
Actually, it is a powerful software for simulation of processes to aim the German company in 2007, not with authors, on the market.
This, as PLM, has been used to develop Montagekets in manufactures around the world, energy works and high precise instruments.
A green reproduction or simulation of a product or process before it is actually built to avoid such errors and overflow costs.
PLM has facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, Sukhoi aircraft and the most famous use vehicles of Nissan.
Siegfried Russwurm, Head of the Industry Division of Siemens, explains that with the use of this software in form 1 - Fabrik Red Bull "in a few hours, almost in real time" the changes and improvements set on the roads and at the tests can be discovered and executed.
Russwurm indicates that 1992 worked average 10 technicians who could introduce at higher three or four improvements in a saison.
In Red Bulls team today, 180 high-qualified young people are working. With EDV performance plants, they lead analysis and all possible changes to the car.
The Siemens manager explained that the PLM software software is in a position to analyze and improve all parts of the red Bull's railway components, with the exception of the engine, which exclusively explains Renault.
Materials, fuel materials, aerodynamics and security elements are changed.
The changes can be transferred through continuing production services and high-tech clauses within less than 24 hours from the virtual reality of the simulator to the reality.
The only border that is set by this crazy technical performance is the 40 million dollars that can provide a form 1-team for its skills in a saison.
Red Bull has built its high technology factory for the development and production of his car rental in a 50 km from London.
It is about two buildings in which visits - especially by journalists - are strongly limited.
Everything happens there is Top Secret.
The authorities included 580 people, including two pilots, the World Vettel and Mark Webber.
But Red Bulls's true form 1 - Held is unfortunately the latest World Master Sebastian Vetell.
In addition to the large technological resources contained by the Energy Drink manufacturer in the services of its participation on the renaissure, further protagonists, whose support is unvaluable and whose knowledge is equal to zero.
The work technological technological, Steve Nevey, stressed that five years ago, it was possible to say that the progress made in the F­E for Renn Cars with 50 percent and the pilots were responsible for the rest of the pilots.
Today, the share values have changed. The technology makes 85 percent of the success while the contribution of pilots is estimated to 15 percent.
Nevey recognizes that Vettel and Webber can never be replaced by EDV because they are "not pre-exacable Gladiators".
HP is opened in two years with local suppliers
Hewlett-Packard (HP) dinnered her first exclusive load in cooperation with his Ront Reyes partner.
It is the first one of the sales networks available from twenty businesses, each 80 to 100 square metres, which is considered to open the multilingual in the next two years in Spain.
The company agrees this initiative with the 16 existing fields of sale in the multimarking company, such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Court English.
The Vice-President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, called for example the built load at the Gran Vía in Barcelona, ownership of Pont Reyes, working with HP for thirty-year-old years.
The northern American company group decides to establish 200 sales institutions in Europe, with 20 loans in Spain.
The first week in Bukarest, Romania, and Belgrade (Serbia). Barcelona is the third business.
Mrsera wanted not to ask the following news, but he didn't conclude that Madrid could be the next goal.
The Vice-President, who is also leader of HP Personal Systems, has ensured that the Philosophy for loading is always equal. It supports a local distributor with experience and expertise.
The northern American company group shall examine this and translates the exclusive loading allocation (with interactive products to be added), and all burdens will be considered equally in Europe.
In addition, HP is responsible for the training of the staff of loading.
Helena Herrero said that it was not about a Franchising System and that it would be decided with the exclusive sales network, "the customer service and the advice of small and small enterprises during the purchase and then, even to optimize the packages."
The load in Barcelona has a pioneer platform program that solves the technical problems of HP devices with guarantee.
A online service has built a connection to the technical centre in Maastricht (Hulland).
"In this way we can solve 10 minutes problems that sometimes take up to two days."
"This system has been developed in particular for small and small enterprises and private coasts because the large enterprises have already been their service contracts for technical customer service", said Helena Herroro yesterday.
Sabadell wants his rivals in three years a million customers 'looking'
He believes that 2001 will be a hard year for the banks, but first a new license and prophecy crisis and the end of the criminal war.
However, he is looking for an incidence of the rate margins that is trying to compare the banks with increased taxes and prices for payments.
Saddell is expected to initiate a million private coasts in three years - a still too existing fax.
Sabadell has found the way to create the next three years and to survive in a very complex economic environment.
The Bank will implement a new three-year plan for 2011.
The goal is not only to survive without taking public assistance from the FROB but also on the market shared by a million private quotas - 700 000 when you disappear with customers losing the bank - to increase the great challenge that this bank is before which it is, until now, is more careful than their private currencies.
In that year, it has added 250,000 private homes and 50,000 companies.
Your market share in private currencies is 3,5 percent, while business currencies rise more than 10 percent.
Another principle of the Budget Plan for 2011-2013 is the increase in productivity, externality, cost reduction. The challenges that the bank is addressed will be presented together with the annual conclusion report.
Only few banks will be able to fix and publish objectives in these difficult times, since the financial crisis worldwide has been paid to all bank plans.
Sabadell is concluded in this year with the Optima Leader plan set out four years ago. This was initially exposed for three years, but it was extended by the market situation for a year.
The customers who are left of the Sparcases are the main target of the Bank.
At one wedding organized by the APIE, Guardiola, in 2011 would be a "while" year "with larger reign".
The manager is out of it, Spain only comes "shorely" out of the crisis.
In addition, it would be "fair difficult", in two or three years, "developed" - based on the survival of banks.
Even though it is found that the war for Passiva, which is infringed by the cinsmarges, will have to pay for banks and space emissions for their emissions for liquidity as an compensation for low-border gains are already disappeared to the price of credits.
The topics of liquidity and financing are structural and they will press on credits.
"We have not disappeared the hair, but the interests are very high", said Guardiola.
Banesto has already set the order to its Philippian network to reduce the delivery of long-term loans and increase the interest difference (see Cinco Days of 22 and 27 November).
The manager also introduced the banks on the moment the state to "high the costs", but "in the memory of one of the competitive frameworks".
Saddell's Guideline is based on organic growth, even if the group, as always, does not exclude corporate businesses.
He does not make sure that "modern enterprises are needed in Spain."
"The next year will change everything," he assures.
He stresses that the need for capital is currently "norm growing" and does not conclude that some Spanish financial institutions will be browned in red numbers.
It is the view that the FROB may be able to replace the money market in capital roads.
After the assurance that Sabadell can also survive an early closure of the markets, he understood the argument of some bankers that have already prophesied a new licensing crisis.
It stresses that there is nothing to be possible, but, on the cases in June, it is possible to achieve short-term financing on refunds and to start the crisis.
ECSC concludes a second fuel steel of the Sparcases
The Director-General of the CECA José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday regreted the possibility that it could come to a fuel hall of the Sparcases and stressed the speed that the industry would be restructured.
When the concentration process started the Spanish spanish spanish, you would not participate in the first phase. They had the second round.
The Director-General of the Spanish Space Trade (CECA), José Antonio Olavarrieta, would not find this second round.
"I believe that the major part of the fusions is completed. The involvement of Cajasol in the Banca Cívica group cannot be considered as the second round, it was much more about adjustments."
"The greatest part is finished. It may be that we have seventeen or four ten, but all the important processes are already completed. They have been controlled by Banco de Spain, which has supported all actions."
At one of the operating managers and managers of Aragonians (ADEA), Olavarrieta found that the concentration process was "to fast completed and that we need to be satisfied with the peaceful end, which has not now been set in the framework of the business plans with Banco de Spain", he said.
"The transition of 45 Sparcases with average 28.000 million property file at 17 with each 75 500 million is a historical process. The number of financial institutions has been reduced by 62 percent and are now much greater than we have fulfilled the Baseer Agreement," he said.
Olavarrieta explained that it would be a number of unlawful views about the longness of the process that showed uncertainty and uncertainty, because "Banco de Spain encourages us to exclude peace right before the year."
The Director-General of the CECA, José Antonio Olavarrieta yesterday, assured that Spain has one of the most rigorous financing systems of Europe and the "plevel" of the world and added that those who are in aware of this "deepest knowledge".
The manager noted that we have taken place in the current economic context "no concern" about the situation of the financial institutions and the Sparcases that have been conducted a "more important" concentration process that will be completed as soon as possible.
He also recalled that the Spanish banks had been very good tested by the ECB in July.
Zapater and the red line of Germany
Berlin has decided for the support of the European Union, but at the same time has been established conditions for the whole European Union.
The market wages solved a double response to the Government.
On the other hand, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatter proposed new adjustments, initiated in tax measurements for small and small enterprises, regulation of time-employment companies, and the rise of 426 euros for unemployed unemployed funds until 49 percent of AENA, Barajas and El Prat, and 30 percent of the State lottery.
On the other hand, Elena Salgado supports the secret Government Chairman, with the assistance of the former Government President Felipe González, the criticism at the Canzelles Angela Merkel as a responsible for the current crisis.
How do these actions understand?
It is expected that the Merkel position is not an error of its public work.
Nevertheless, it is a new round in the difficult process of the new definition of the euro.
Germany has an essential new perspective for the creation of our future, which collapsed with the opposed traditions of a large part of his partners.
In view of the opposite in Europe, three possible ways are specifying from the crisis.
The first: a strong euro with Germany, Austria, the Netherlands and other countries should leave the southern euro.
The second: the recovery of the German mark - although the currently applies to Science Fiction - is supported by a major part of public opinion, approximately 50 percent of the population.
Third: a reconstruction of the euro in accordance with the German proposals, which means: more macroeconomic controls; close budget management; the extension of countries that are undertaken by the provisions; possible payment establishment of certain countries and the extension of the costs of potential adaptation to the private sector.
The German position is clear and has already been described for some time, so there is no explanation now.
First 2009, both IWF and the European Commission have created deficits and the German government took a constitutional reform to prevent this from 2016.
This was the first sign of the mutual jurisdiction between Germany's needed (stream tax plans and stability public finances) and the practices of his European partners, including France.
The second character sets the Middle European country as Merkel's decision to save Greece.
But it is the fact that the political consensus in Germany, the public and the public opinion absolutely published against a salvation of Greece.
Finally, in the last October days, Merkel is out of new position, and it is requesting a reform of the European Union agreement to enable the salvation of a country and at the same time the private suppliers to take part of the costs.
This position was expressed as an anti-European, as she had previously expressed the Irish crisis and all the follow-up.
But their proposal, if it's a bit, has been adopted, and in the next months, we will participate in the reform of the European Union, which will allow these measures from 2013.
Germany has led a red line that does not remember it over.
It says all - even if unlimited measures are now to be taken - it will no longer be given the form of the euro's functionality.
2013 will be the year of birth of a new currency area in which the countries concerned are hardly affected, to make it possible to explain payment unable and, in this case, the private sector must take a part of the costs.
Germany shows us that we need to take a hard growth course, with high-country and investment, consuming, improved productivity and competitiveness, and positive external sales.
The other alternative, covered by prosecution and construction with huge leathers in the payment balance, is not simply taken by Spain in Boom times.
The offer is clear.
And we would do worse about not understanding it.
It is not only that the State Difficulty will be on three percentages until 2013.
The requests are more warm.
And the worst thing we could do under these conditions is to be offended to us.
I hope that the current tournaments have more calm.
And that we use the possibilities that are commanded us to spring 2013.
It seems that Zapather has also understood this, and his double announcement (which promised reforms according to the interpretation with the large enterprises on the past Saturday, and the preaching new actions of yesterday) shows that, despite the criteria on Merkel, the Hypothesis, he has prepared its way in his own house.
But the red line street from Germany is there, and it doesn't seem to be changed.
Under the possibilities taken in consideration, we should not leave the euro area fullly stopped with few series countries.
In this case, Germany could still tell us that it has been warned to us.
Sports and regulations
Tricks such as Alonso and Ramos in the game against the Ajax shows the infection gain but not the will to overcome a sanction.
The negative of two players of the Real Madrid (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) was exclusive in the game on 23 November against Ajax in the Champion League in the Champion League, which has been paid a lot of tickets on whether it was not aggravated or not acted and whether both of the UEFA should be sanctified.
As usually known, the two players lost a few minutes before the player (of the team has already been clearly gained) time and played several fools so that the Shieds director showed them the second yellow map.
In this way, and since the real Madrid's group would take its group, the two players will fill the sanction prescribed at the next lineing game against the earlier and then without cards to the next game phase.
Finally, the Disziplinar Committee of the UEFA violated the trainer of the club, José Mourinho, with two games and the participating games with different money contributions.
The provokation of a yellow card under such or similar circumstances is not a new practice, it is more often to meet the world of football.
It is so far widespread that she is part of the Ethos, the unwrechable, but in this type of sports, it is.
Part of the coming debate on the case indicated is the fact that a team of the football Clubs Real Madrid (the team in his Hymne Edelmut and Honority, and in other occasions his players in similar cases) played the main roles, and added to the Dramatization by Mourinho, a episode more to his long history as theatral and provocative technology.
In any case, the debate concerns whether these acts are not exclusively prohibited by the Statutes against the principles of the sport, which means whether these acts are a regulation. In fact, this is a view to the status of the sports, but seems to be resolved.
In this case, the damage caused by the sportsgeist should be investigated.
The sportged defends the physical university of the counter players, a aspect that has not been threatened by these acts, because it was no aggressive game.
Another aspect of a green game is to prevent the traders to take a injustice benefit from the countermeasures.
The paradoxe of the processing of the real Madrid players is that it is not complaining what we usually understand under false game or regulation, because the change of the rules has not been completed in secret to avoid a sanction, but it should be as an accident as possible to be corrupted by the Headrichter.
The players waited and took the sanction joyfully.
Another question is what kind of advantage did the sugar traders out of the obvious foul.
This should be highlighted that the Rivale has not been brought in an unfair situation nor has been enriched advantages for the game played, since the apparent result of this action was that the own team had to continue with less players.
It is also no useful strategy for the next game, because the club does not have these players.
The benefit is evident that the players start the next game phase of the Champions League without cards that could lead their participation to a future game.
But it is a long-term benefit to a certain degree that the team may also disappear. Additionally, the players will get a sanction with this action and go to the second card cycle, in which they disappear through card-affecting a card less than in the first cycle.
This is not so clear whether it is really a benefit.
Lastly, such approaches are not against the sportsged who also includes strategic decisions to take greater benefits from the rules.
In this case, the players wouldn't want to make a sanction (these would be a clear case of regulation), they wanted to choose better when they were subject to this.
They have asked a strategic decision, without disappearing or fleing before her.
Although the boundary between the provision and the regulation is damaged, I think it is a clear case of consequence.
I impressed that the Polymic was deceived by two factors: because it was about two self-decisions and because of the type of regulation caused.
The damage that has been added to the principles of the sport by these actions is less ethical than much more ecosystemic.
Offers of service for customers for groups-weighting events in Barcelona
The Dictature of the calendar allows this year a lawine of reservations to the 16th and 17 December.
The feasts paying themselves are widespread. They do not want to give more than 20 to 30 euros.
As Turón and the Western Slots, there are also groups that bring to the host and free time of Barcelona sauber material. However, in the context of the economic crisis, they have a price of offers to the customers that makes the great mass: all of them want to provide between 20 and 30 euros for a sud or evening, confirm the private undertakings and commitments.
In order to make the book a little more complex, the calendar (Silvester flood on a Friday) has left all orders in the week of 13 December, with the result of a lawine of reservations of dinners at two stages (the 16 and 17.) and almost no orders in the week before.
Since 2008, when the bad time began, many enterprises have introduced the groups of groups from budget basis.
To do not need to comply with this tradition, many employees pay these from their own cup.
As the conjunctur also is always, it is requested low-style prices, confirms the President of the Guests of Barcelona, Gazze Farràs.
The representative of the Treasury Trade will not prejudice to what the festival will be issued in this month.
"The people take it twice before they reserve."
"You want to go out, but they look strongly at the prices," he notes.
The business will be good to "good quality of good prices with a good service," he adds and calls for us to remember that customers are flowing in crisis times, so prices are at the most strongest of 25 euros.
In a survey in various central restaurants, the evening of 17 December, the providers lead to the Collaps.
The Soteras Group said that the questions for this Friday will be put to bear less than 30 euros. The group has adapted its menus with full offers between 25 and 35 euros to the conjuncture site.
Another leading group, Andilana, who undertake 16 guests in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market, La Funda and other), has led the property of the calendar, even from the beginning of November.
"We have made the impossible to keep the previous year's prices with the menus for each crack from 19.95 to 30 euros," he said.
In the AN Group, El Mussol, Attic, Qu, and in total 23 locals, the optimism is not lost since the second quarter, the income will be rescued and well, even at a few days, if the concentrated intentions for the Christmas fight will be discovered.
Sources of the Entreprise Group have said that there will be a overactive day with friends who predominate Christmas.
The six group menus have been added a Christmas menu for 30 euros or more than pricehit. You have the impression that the customers are ready to give 10 percent more than in the previous year and want more details, such as Cava.
In some companies, you can see green proverbs, which is why the invitators are re-invited. This provides the impression that the groups are back in the disappearance.
For visits of the Dach Trade Facasarm (with combinations such as the Kneipe, Restaurant and Free Time Trade of Barcelona), it is reliable to the Vice-President Enric Gomá to see the end of the tunnel and notes that the reservations are totally "active" even though the customers exhibit "a maximum".
However, the pleasure on the feast hasn't been back, lest who pays.
The Pakistanian Nuclear Programme gives great concern in the United States
Islambad provides atomic arms "country than every other country".
Wikileaks’ enthusiasms confirmed relations between the Taliban and Pakistan.
The internet port of Wikileaks included the corresponse between the North American news in Pakistan and the US State Division, which prepares great concern for the Pakistan Atom programme.
On the border of the climbing and sustainable details that provide documents on the content of the conversations and the views of the emerging north American diplomates in Islamabad, they stress that the cooperation between two countries is not enhanced in nuclear security, but is "ack" and that the instability Asian country is more atomic weapons " to a faster rhythm that every other country".
In particular the properties of the Pakistanic Atom Programme - that the weapons are not gathered, but their detailed parts are learned to shoot their disappearance at possible attractions - prepared Washington without sleeping night.
The following risks contains the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report before visiting the former Leader of the National Security Council, James Jones, on: "The nearby certain atoms attracted by the Taliban, the circumstance of the digital material and the opportunity of transport of digital material".
The large number of persons implied in the nuclear scene and the rake programs will be considered not only by the United States but also by Russia to leave an expensive and reason for precaution.
"Pakistan has to set closely faithful staff for the monitoring of atoms; because of the low level of education and cultural organizations, the expert Yuri Corolev has more opportunities for persons working to reflect at nuclear or racket programmes," said the Russian Minister of Foreign and Cultural Services.
The new documentation encountered by Julian Assanges' Internetport is that the cooperation between the United States and Pakistan in nuclear distribution matters and the increased time that the Pakistan produces nuclear weapons.
In May, a office of the message that describes the communication with Pakistan as "favorable", explains: "Homeday there is no transparency; on the help offers we receive no answers or they will be rejected."
In another communication, Peter Lavoy confirms that the State Secret Service for South Asia, "with the economic catastrophe of Pakistan Atom weapons as soon as no other country produces."
The Ambassador Patterson requests Washington during a visit of the highest Heaven Head of Justice, General Ashfaq Kayani, "which the responsibility of "Pakistan's Army to establish its sustainable support for terrorist groups."
On the Jagd to Wikileaks Chief
Obama is a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism campaign to prevent new enthusiasms.
Interpol provides a red warning for persecution and resurrection of asylum.
Everything with Wikileaks and his reasoner, Jullian Assange, is a complex labyrinth, in which the contents are only difficult to explain.
Yesterday, Interpol gave a "round warning" to "Applause and persecution" from Assange.
However, it is not a traditional settlement.
It's not new, it's from 20 November.
It also has nothing to do with the last enthusiasm of more than four million diplomatic documents from the United States but with the accused of sexual abuse which the Australian has to be made in Sweden.
Moreover, the lawyer of the Resident of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, "the police knew where and how she could take contact with Mr Assange."
On 20th, the International Police Authority gave the regulation to the request of Sweden, but it was not recognized by the Swedish authorities until yesterday.
Thus are the things. The 188 Interpol countries are designed to identify and find "in order to determine and distribute it."
Although Interpol is not able to assess the determination of an individual affected by a red warning, many Member States consider red warning as a free letter for a warning, which is necessary to be carried out by the national police, particularly if they have a bilateral delivery agreement, such as the case of Sweden and England, whereas it is likely to be observed.
The action was taken by the Assistants who were published a letter in which they informed that the 39-year-old chief of Wikileaks is ready to answer the questions of the Swedish authorities by video conference.
They also recall that Asjong requested excursions from Sweden and compareded by the State avocate received by the Dinamanty Pavlovich security chapter of Stalin, the appropriate approval.
"That is like a jagd, not as a legal persecution", is dealt in the letter.
During the world seeks him - and his mother from Australia's iniquity, his son's unschuld, puts ashes to a unknown place, but not to hurt.
On Monday, he gave the leader of the journal Time per Skype from an unexpected place from an interview. At the conversation, he requested the return of the State Secretary of the United States, Hillary Clinton.
"If it is possible to demonstrate that it was responsible for the settlement of North American diplomates to spy out the UNO and that it has dismissed the international agreements signed against the United States," he said.
His opinion was driving by the Chairman of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who was condemned by the request to return as "right and absurd".
"I'm not sure why we should put the value on the view of a type with a website," he said to the sender CNN.
Obama itself has a high responsibility for the anti-terrorism campaign, Russian traders, with the prevention of new documents.
The attempt of the speaker of the President Barack Obama to consider less attention, in contrast to the views of the conservative politicians and commentors in these days.
The Congress Deputy Peter King, who will lead the presidency in the National Security Committee of the Deputy House, has requested the State Division to investigate the possibility to put Wikileaks on the list of terrorist organizations, "for their money, and to follow every one that supports or contribution."
Tom Flanagan, adviser of the Canadian President Stephen Harper, was still gone, and he had to say that the Assigation was to be called "assassined".
"Obama must turn him into a target board and use a non-managed airport or something like this."
He who didn't apologize was Mike Huckabee, the Baptist Minister, the former Governor of Arkansas and possible presidencyskandidat.
"Whenever it had been who had given information through the government, he is accused of the Council and everything that is not, it's too slowly punishment," he said to the poster Fox.
Puigcerkos is looking for an eye-winner to the Carod Native Peace in the ERC
The republic leader allows the party a secret vote on its continued action in the office.
Huguet suggests a more multi-alistic government and the end of the full congregation principle.
Joan Puigcerkos seems to have found a receptor to go out the way at the last of an internal recruiter after loss of 11 Members and half of the electoral votes.
The Participant is aware that his damage is not sufficient to the neighbouring of Josep Lluís Carod-Roviira, but he also knows that the impact of this sector is so degraded as your manager itself is not the same crime, such as other former structures.
This is why the leader of Esquerra is trying to gain the new criteria, which would ensure its position to the next communical elections.
At the beginning, he stated that more than 200 regional Council members of ERC could express themselves secretly on its stays in the office.
With election officers, not with hot hands.
If the carodists wanted to adjust a penalty table to the President, they could have to be afraid without repressives.
In fact, the chapter wants to avoid the impression of slaughter as well as the injury under his person.
In several interviews, he would not be confirmed with half of the voices, and he added a percentage of values, a result in "in white style" would not be well.
The Carod Foreigners request the President more than the party to be available to his office, and a non-profit manager, since Puigcercos is controled by the top body of the Congress.
However, since they do not have sufficient majority to seek residues, they will agree a plan from now to May.
To this end, they hope to participate in the preparation of the document on strategic orientation that the Guideline will be presented on 18th Council to vote.
Your intention is to bury for Puigcercos. In the contrary, this must promise to provide the Congress in the Herbst 2011, what the party is already holding for a fact.
The Participant of the CRC is the view that the “polyphonie” damages the stability and strives for all times to bring the organization into the possibility to wake its dream bottles behind the doors.
In this respect, the article that the original Conseller Josep Huguet signed in his blog symptomic.
In view of the Pigcerkos is an ideologist, the owner of innovated it for a fact that the Participant would "in exchange against various objectives".
He numbered five of those two in front of the.
First, the "mostructuring" of the condition, so that at least 90 percent of the parties are members, which means the integration of new faces from Carod's environment.
The second could be the big news.
Huguet suggests that the full meeting principle should finally assess the functionality of the RC.
This is a reform of the Statutes that will be able to stop the Congress with elected delegations.
From the completion of the full congregation model - an exception in the Spanish party system - is Puigcercós' team, which was fighting at the last two congress, as well as visited.
In fact, at the next meeting of 2008, a party was discussed with the review of the plenary principle of the meeting on a congress that should be involved in the reform of the Statutes.
This date is still out since the information of the internal rise in the past years was not ratified by the impact of this matter.
Now, without the critical sectors, the time could be reached in order to resolve this question and to close forever.

Legal conclusion Espinos: César Nava
The national leader of the PAN explained that the former Panist Participation Party had the right to refer to the National Order Committee and to request what the right to grant him.
The national leader of the PAN, Ceesar Nava Vázquez, assured that the exclusion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was right and the former party of the PAN had the right to refer to the National Order Committee and to ask what the right is to give him.
In an interview held before the execution of Gabino Cué Monteagudos as a Governor of the Federal State, he explained that the exclusion Espinos was a decision taken at the local level.
"It is an independent decision of the Order Committee in Sonra."
"Lord Espino has the right to refer to the Commission of the Orden of the National Council to adopt a decision by a competent body," he added.
On the other hand, he explained that it was not to think in 2012 and that an alliance to the presidential scene has never come on the negotiation table.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that national action was strengthened from the internal vote in the following 4 and 5 December, in which his followers were elected.
"These (a Allianz in 2012) is a subject which has never been on the negotiation table at least not until now. It was a prejudice to the community selection, he was successful and fulfilled," he performed.
The Panist leader explained that the PAN had been revealed by 71 years, so he said: "The internal competition is not afraid of us; in contrast, they enjoy and strengthen us," he commented.
He said that the Council would be unfortunately to the President of the National Action for the next three years. He therefore would overlook the "the ones who would decide the Council."
"I am very uncertain and open. I would be courageous to transmit each of the fifth offices of the Participants."
He pronounced the emphasis of the Party's opposition in the last elections of 4 July will be reflected in the next elections, although it is not time to think about 2012.
"There is to support the Governor Gabino Cué at his task."
In this connection, he stated that the three governments from alliances between Oaxaca, Puble and Sinaloa would take the fashion and observe all the country. Therefore, "level hopes and seeds will be placed in them and I am sure that Gabino is at the level of the requirements."
When he is asked about the criteria of the PRI to President Felipe Calderón for his discussion in the framework of his four-year government, César Nava called the attachers of the PRI to consider the six-year period of the former President Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"When the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should begin to defend them, they should finally come out of the pain," he confirmed.
It is the view that the inhabitants of the Federal Government expresses the expression that he could do in his questionary in the Auditorio National, because there is no or her promise and less a censor in this country.
Obama is in Twitter for the law for non-documented students.
"When you are for the adoption of the Dream Act, call your Senators and call on the adoption of this law," said the President of the United States in the popular social network.
Today, the President Barack Obama supported country mobilization to support the Dream Act - laws on legalization of undocumented students with a message on his personal blog in the Twitter social network.
"When you are for the adoption of the Dream Act - laws, then call your senators and turn to the adoption of this law," said Obama.
His short communication contains a Cyber link to a comprehensive document requested by the public to contact in accordance with its senators, as the provision of the law is directly improved.
"To your voice we waited, the time is coming to listen to you," he said.
The message was extended, after the 42 republic senators were designed to block all voices for each law, except the extension of tax extensions from Bush’s times and the financing of the Government.
An such block that has been announced by one of the 42 republic Senators, may affect the vote of the Dream Act and other projects such as the ratification of the new START Agreement with Russia against the dissemination of nuclear weapons.
On the blockades of the Republics of the Act Dream Act and other projects, the President Robert Gibbs said that, once the tax subject was removed, a period for the remaining projects could be established.
"I think we have a lot of time..."
"All we agree that taxation must be developed before the end of the year..."
"I think we can meet a agreement at the time, and then we can plan the end of the rest," said he.
The Chairman of the Democratic Most Democratic Most of Senate, Harry Reid, held on Sunday, would call the vote on the conclusions of the debate, so that the Dream Act, which could be adopted by the initiative on legalization of undocumentated students from the next Thursday on Senate, although the next week would be more likely.
The version of the Dream Act - Law or the Law of the American Traum would be about 800 000 young people who immigrated in the United States when they have not yet been sixteen years old during the last five years in this country and have been written to a higher educational institution or arms.
However, the defenders of the law need to adopt the initiative sixty votes, which have been demonstrated to the votes of a handy-mander of the Republic. At the same time, the organisations of the Presidents of this project are intensively affected by the adoption of the law.
The democrates of which most of them support the Dream Act have 58 seats.
However, one of them said, Senator Ben Nelson from Nebraska, he would vote and only a reply, Richard Location from Indiana, announced the law's support.
Therefore, the Defenders of the Thream Act must receive several republics on their side if other democrates should decide to return the initiative.
The most surrounded republics include Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, as well as Senator George Lemieux from Florida, who overlooked the mandate of Senator Mel Martínez.
Other Republics who supported the Dream Act in the past are Orrin Hatch from Utah and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they explained that it was no longer supported at another time.
Another republic who spoke for the law, John McCain, has not yet established his arrest.
Although the representative's house has another version, the analysis agree that the dream Act is in the Senate before the greatest obstacles.
Literature put finger into the wheel
The second round of 'The pleasure in the language' was a spacious step in which the participants made themselves strong for the narration.
"What's with the sex in the language I understand, but... the finger in the wheel? What is waiting for me?" asked the Scriptures Luisa Valenzuela, which should open the second round of 'Los placeres de la language', a Cyclus who celebrated the Spanish literature and then used the subtitle of their question (in another event, the round table was given to the sex in the language).
The finger in the whale... "Let us together in difficulties," the argentin writer shots to the public, which mainly gathered from young people who were in the international bookmaster in Guadalajara (FIL) to participate with this by Marisol Shultz, in Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero.
Luisa Valenzuela presented a text she attached Gonzalo Celorio, and the shot then marked as a great narration. Luisa tells in the first person and is the protagonist who is looking for finding what is a "Wunde" and is a doctor who does not answer, but indications for the leadership of her narration.
The infectologists convictes it: "It's not my strength, perhaps this is my wound."
Finally, after a frustrial approach to the traumatologs that cut it in the middle of the Gang, and that she explains that the wheat is not a scientific interpretation, the psychoanalytics is the secret: "The wheat is the real openness, the symbolic is the narrow."
The main figure of the narration is often easily easy and concluded that it "without the wrestness it has known that it is actually open and not exist." But she is convinced that the lips in the language and their cases are explored.
Valenzuela, the writers, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez also presented a comfortable narration that he called 'Lob of the exquisition', and in the fingers in the wheat not mentioned, but discovered.
With playings to the magisch realism, he told by a famous Zaubin, who had touched the clouds, a greatly pleasant men returned or renewed by a girl lost tugend. The narration made a cure and reported from America the great Roman, which was not at the beginning of his own chronists, and he seized Bernal Díaz del Castillo, which criticised the overfluence of the stories that were told by the Supreme.
"Cervantes, who all of us (the writer) discovered the predominant Witnesses who revealed into the stories that were present as true, but otherwise the story of America would never be told -- with the former power that even turned the shame feeling."
However, he has said, "If it is the depths and lies that makes the best things," and there is close to the reality and lies, where you don't know any more the narration where the physical literature reaches the gipfel.
It's actually called 'Tradition Cervantes'.
"With him we've tried to be what's going to tell."
When Mayra Montero was on the set, commented and lodged the writers the variety of the interpretations to which the invitation of the FI to the round table 'The fingers in the whale' had been invited.
Cuban and Puertorian attended its contribution to the great wound of the social violence that their country affects - as the whole Latin America - as a result of the fights on drug trade.
"I believe that good literature, good poesia, good songs, not in particular planned engagement", she explained, after she explained that literature of communication and binding is built between the author and the readers as in a "chemical reaction".
On the evening, the Spanish Dichter Luis García Montero decided, with its contribution also "the fingers of the involved writer in the wound of the writer".
He noted that in a rapid life world also the intellectual natures and controls of the consciousness on dogmatics, and it will be forgotten: "This is not a small one after any confirmation and a little yes."
"In possession of our thoughts and reality, we need to tell: And Nuanciers often means to put the finger into the wounds and to declare those who feel more well when they feel in form of cartels, black and white ideas, in predicted ideas without nuances, and also the powerfuls to reveal the world in black and white and play again the sense of the writing.
Romano fights for his first title
Rubén Omar Romano looks at three grounds in the end games, he lived up and abolish in his carrier, but three times he played decisive games.
In the duell between Santos Laguna and Monterrey at the end game, two different styles are also presented in the face of their respective trainers, and whose marked events are reflected in the results.
Rubén Omar Romano looks at three grounds in the end games, he lived up and abolish in his carrier, but three times he lived decisive games, and until now he kept himself well, why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentine played the Medaille to the second Champion, he left a step behind the victory and he wonderfully exposed the same team on the following end games.
The Stantistic Strategy reached the first end game as trainer at the Turnel Open 2002, when van Morelia had the thresholds in the hand with which he reached a large downgrade against Toluca with 4-2; later, when 'Clausura 2003', he reached the decisive duell that he also lost with 3-1 against Rayados.
Besides Santos Laguna on the Toneo Bicentenario 2010, where they played against Los Diablos, Rubén had to re-entain a backward, since the game with 2-2 to Los Choriceros was unnecessed after 210 minutes of playing, but at the eleventh meter he came forward with 3-1 and got two opportunities to retain his title, but last three of his players had recently chosen the eleven steps and the game.
Rubén had already lost two end games with the diablos Rojo and one with Monterrey, his great rivale. Therefore he would not even be persecuted from the unfortunate and released from the evil sauber to make the first time a title, although he confirms that the most important game is for him.
"I want to be Champion, I don't want to break statistics, that's for a club, for my appointment, and therefore the title will come to me, but whatever happens before, is the most important", commented the taxman when you ask him about the lost end games.
The last end game has remained strongly in memory, he assures to have learned many of them: "The only teaching we can go out of it is that until the Guiderichter does not stop the end, we can't feed, we are prepared to the line, the players also, because the last time we were prepared with two eleven metres already prepared, and I think that there is a teacher until the game is not finished, there is no reason for the feast."
To know that this series could be decided by elfmetrine shapes, it does not be aware of him, because he trusts his players: "Man never wants to come to the Elfmetre, you want to exclude in the regular game time, but sometimes there is no alternative and you must be prepared to be prepared in the previous tourns we were prepared, but we are unfortunately prepared a bad game, sometimes due to nervosity or the heavy efforts to keep the title already in the hands, which leaves us something for this game, and we hope that this time will not happen."
It is in Romanso power not only to be the second Champion and first cost the rest that the title is with him.
The U.S. amends the rules for the relevance of a visa
Persons have to submit before their conversation in the consultation with the Service Services on the visum request; costs are so fastened time.
Since 10 January 2011, the procedures for demanding a visum are changed in the United States and the Consulates' message.

Those who want to extend their visa should not lead a conversation in the consultant, only at the next ASC, where they are present and taking their fingerprints.

NASA declares the Fund for Foreign Life
The North American Space Reise District introduced a press conference in order to provide a fund tomorrow, which will have the impact on the search for lives in all.
The National Air and Space Aviation Authority (NASA) of the United States provides tomorrow, Thursday, astrobiological discovery that could confirm the theory of the External Life.
The Fund will be presented tomorrow at a press conference at the NASA seat in Washington by experts of astrobiology experts, which is a science, the origin, the development, the distribution and the future of life in the University.
In the opening of the press conference, NASA assured that it would provide "one supervisional fund for the search for external life" which solved speculations in experts of other countries.
The discovery could indicate that it is in feeding environments that you have been able to exist in inhabitable, human creatures. It was abolished that the hypothesis could be transformed as humans, if they improve their life conditions.
It is a microbow found on the basis of the Mono Lake National Park in Yosemite, California. She lives there in a environment that has been retained to give up for all the earthly forms of life, since the sea is strong.
In any way, the microobie uses the arsen as a survival resource. In view of this ability, it increases the opportunities that it is on other planets that could not be available on our protected atmosphere, a similar life.
When these organisms change the arsen of substance, the astrobiologs are shown that "is actually another life form, a second form of life that distinguishes from us."
The room journey is known tomorrow, Thursday, at the press conference, to the real reign of its fund.
At the conference, the geobiologin Pamela Conrad participate in the possibility of life on the sea, and the Biologe Steven Benner, one of the scientists, which Titan (the greatest Mond Saturns) is under the question of whether his chemical composition of the earth looks.
Gesta PRD, PT, Convergence and Patrón form an opposition block
With the reform of the Congress law, the two-party system will be denied, they shall condemn.
The 60th Legislation period had started, and there was an opposition block introduced by the Members of the PRD, PT, Convergence and Jesus Manuel Patrón Montalvo, which was presented as an independent one. The fours put the following: the income of the 'Sweiparty System' in the room.
Before the start of the introduction session in the 60th Legislative period, Felip Manzanarez Rodriguez of Convergence, Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza by the PT, Javier Corvera Quevedo by the PRD and Patrón Montalvo against the reform of the organisation, as they would therefore be excluded.
With this reform, they reiterated that a 'Down Participation System' would be introduced, because there would now be two persons who would be the same number as parties controlled by the Congress.
These four colleagues, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinators of the PRD, were the only ones who set the presidency sent by the Panist Salvador López Brito and Luis Antonio Cárdenas Fonseca in his own ownership as a Vice-Chairman.
Corvera Quevedo explained that the PRI and PAN parties had institutionally introduced their political position.
He stated that they would talk to the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme and that they went out of their political will, and if they had not had it, they would again be undertaken by two parties, which would end the opposition coalition.
"To this I come (the Opposition Coalition), this is what I see, because we will be excluded from all distinctions that do not even consider the view of the others."
Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez of Convergence explained that it would be agreements with PRD, PT and Patrón and that there would therefore be a pluralist group.
It can't be allowed, he continued that the Congress after he was monopolistic now should be "doopolistic".
"It's not the spirit of the law reform that in the Congress a eternal double system will rule."
"For the beginning, this group starts with five Members and talks with other colleagues and colleagues to make them more," said the Convergence member.
Ezequiel Reynoso Esparza from the PT played on PAN and PRI that the Congress has now changed in a 'pay' for two.
"There was only a party, now they share it to second."
Patrón Montalvo requested the Members to respect and to give them their place to the negotiations.
"The five who are currently seen as in different groups have decided to agree to take our place into the negotiation table, because because it has been made reform by the others and extended, we have remained outside and we have not agreed with this reform."
More than 200 000 Peso for "the Lieferantin"
The city manager of Mazatlan pays a further ship to the surrounding owner of the company for electronic material.
Another shock about something more than 200 000 Peso in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the city manager.
The amount paid in the second half year to the owners of the company for electronic material is 1 200 000 pesos.
According to the page for more transparency of the City manager, it was issued to a amount of 200.144.56 Peso, which was issued by number 9258447 in the past 16 November with the "Creation of open accounts".
The Teacher Luis Miguel López Moreno had already anticipated that more money from the municipality would go to this delivery. It is observed by the Upper Auditary of the State because they were sold to overcome prices.
What is not mentioned, the total amount that you are still debt to her and then the number of shoes that are eligible to Camacho Palazuelos.
"Nothing was bought with her, it's just paying the debts, just as well as the other providers," he said in an interview.
The latest ships are "saving" in the last quarter of the year "earlier: 24 September, two of October 15, 19, 29 of October, and the last day of 16 November.
Although the provider is not yet published in the Official Journal, as it is prescribed by law if a ASE company is presented in order to prevent other administrations to provide their services, the treasurer has ensured that their services would not be taken again.
After the period of Noroeste on 25 July, the trial of the City Administration to his suppliers was published, it was recognized that before, from March 2008 to 9 July 2010, the three-year-old officer of Jorge Abel López Sánchez had paid the community over 10 million Pesos with 42 Schecks to Camacho Palazuelos.
There were also business with Jumapam where they entered Schcks in the value of more than 3 million Peso.
Tourist places must be improved
Tourist companys delay the accident of the foreign tourist as a result of the bad situation of Glorieta Sánchez Taboada in Mazatlan.
After the tour of a foreign tourist in the influence of the Gloriata Sánchez Taboada, the tourist breach of Mazatlan requested the authorities, the areas that are in a bad state and a bad image on the Port City to look special attention.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, Chairman of the Hainler Union of the Zona Dorada, recalled that in different opportunities it was requested to create the travel target and to transform the bad conditions of tourists in new opportunities or roads.
He said that the bad state of the roads and roads would have been negative because the tourists would come to the storm and see the eruption where they would take the nearly lodged wounds to the backs.
"The politicians don't know what it means to close one day and they do not think how much money we lose. For otherwise they wouldn't work the construction in this way. "
The hotel owner José Ramón Manguart Sánchez said that the tour of the tourist had made attention to the lack of prevention and the remaining maintenance process from the city.
"The community must take its responsibility and avoid what is happening again. How should she do that? Now, by preventive control instead of determining everything in the afternoon," he said.
"We are expected to have a clean city. For not only because it is a foreign movement area, it must be kept in mind, also inhabitants have a right to a healthy living room. The city manager needs to change its strategy to get the city in a good state."
"There are other places that are unresolved and unprofitable," he said, "come played the Escudo and the Venadito of Mazatlan."
"Today, we need more than only advertisement to blow tourists. It must be ordered a good product, a city that cleansses their streets and roads, and keep tourist attractions constantly in shopping," he added.
"It was not enough attention to these actions and this kind of cases makes the blow that is clear for all: a maintenance is urgent."
Raúl Llera Martínez, Subsecretary of Promotion Touristics, expressed how important it was to save the tourist places of Mazatlan, because they would not be used correctly and put an evil image.
He mentioned a number of places that should be brought together with the city to Prederman. The city should be priority to set up for foreign transports, ordinary and attractive.
"Certainly, Mazatlan offers many stories and cultural places that are first stored and cleaned to make them attractive for foreign transport and to bring them to the inventor with which we take this trip target.
IP requires the results of the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE, suggested that the Members should take the great responsibility to give a form for a better synthesis that is before many challenges.
The company industry of Mazatlan calls for a fair Parliament, free of discussions, with the parties and the government, because Sinaloa has been addressed and is faced with great problems.
Tomorrow, the 60th parliament has been included. It is closed from seven political forces, 19 Members of the PRI, 13 of PAN, three Party New Alianza, two by PRD, one by PT, one by Convergence and another by PVEM. This makes 40 people.
The new members of the State Congress will be expected that they make a clear job, the society and the different social groups are obligation to feel aware of a responsibilized parliament and that they are not recovered of the same model of participity and Patrialism.
Eduardo Dávalos, President of the CCE Corporation Council, suggested that the new Members should take the great responsibility to give an improved synthesis before many challenges.
"We hope that the Deputy Members really do their right to act free of discussions between the parties, as it is usually that they take agreements with which they represent their own interests, in which they turn into the coherence of the governments and the leaders of the parliamentary groups."
He said that she should demonstrate her commitment to the establishment of the necessary presss to the deterioration of the current government.
"We are concerned that they work a faithful work and take themselves before all things for society and their groups, because they were the inhabitants of Sinaloa who spoke their confidence at the last elections."
José Ramón Manguart Sánchez, Chairman of the Hotel Related Tres Islas, considers one of the great challenges that are against 40 people's representatives, whether it is the leading and the common work for the economic growth of the State, as it is now most complex.
"The most important is that it makes the economic growth, investment incentives and infrastructure actions, which will be able to promote the creation of jobs."
With regard to the foreign transport sector, he requested the new Members to promote the Ministry of Foreign Transport the necessary value of the State budget.
"I understood that it is the ministry with the twoest resources, which is incompatible with an important economic activity that brings the dimensions and investment into the country and is directly competitive to the agricultural industry."
The tourism projects must be provided for money to support State security and the alkohol law which has not been renewed in previous legislative periods must be placed on the latest.
The Holy King is searched
Puppen, cars, drivers and other player want the children of the Coonado Valenzuela family to be sure.
For parents, the next third day, it will be difficult to satisfy these desires, because the household does not be more and not less than twelve persons and one bottle.
Nevertheless, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, José Alfredo, Mary Guadalupe, Isajah, José John and Miguel do not hope that Malkio, Caspar and Balthasar can't give them the player and clothes that they call so.
The family has a variety of houses in the village of Salvador Allend. They live from the hand in the mouth, because the father has no work.
"Matchtimes are harsh times mentioned because my husband has no job. But we sold managers and cartoffs... I'll go with the views of sale on the road," said Cactana Valenzuela Andrade, the mother of the little ones.
The four-year Adelaida would like a poppe or a road while her old sister Isabel wanted a Barbie poppe.
The 10-year-old José Alfredo wants to have a "monster car" for some months, and for the eight months of old brothers, Jesus puts Citana clothes in the size of a year.
'(José Alfred)' said to me, 'I would like this monster,' but I answered him, 'Let' wait, boy,' because it was very so much,' Cuttina remembered hardly.
For the elderly children who were in school, they would be clothes and shoes ideal.
The eleventh year Mary Guadalupe has the size of 12; Isaiah has the size of 10, while the eight-year-old Miguel size 8.
The 14-year-old José Juan felt tennischuhe. A couple in size 5 1/2 or 6 would be very helpful.
If you want to help complete the dreams of the songs of the family Coronado Valenzuela, you can take part in the "Capital King" campaign by paying a player or bar in the receipt hall of the Noroeste.
14 Modal drugs arrested
In the middle of the event of a production and sale network of Cannabis was taken through the ten home investigations in the administrative region of Strategy.
Fourte persons were arrested and have been put to various complaints.
The household research played in Sherbrooke, Orford and Stoke, which should serve the previous drug production.
"From about 750 cannabis plants, four kilometres of hashish, barriers and equipment that served the production have been confiscated," Louis-Philippe Rule, an expert of the security policy of Quebec.
In total, eleven males and three women were arrested, of which two of the men who were the head of drugs were headed out of Sherbrooke.
The arrested persons have to appear at hours after their arrest before the Court of Justice in Sherbrooke.
They may be accused of the production of Cannabis, whose own property for sales, the complot, and the service of crimes.
These household investigations had been carried out by a long-term delivery activity that went over a year.
"The information received from the public hand has been allowed to carry out these conclusions," said Mr. Rule.
For the 70 police officers of the Regional Supply Unit Estries of the Security Police of Quebec, the Sherbrooke Police Service and the Police Authority had participated in this police operation.
The secret immigration could be pursued without problem
The draft of law of conservatives, which are in accordance with the Government, will regulate the problem of ships loaded with secret immigrants, will be taken into consideration after the three opposition parties have known in the middle of summer that they could not respond to the proposal.
"I'm taking an impression against this charter."
"I hold with a party who has put you feet at your feet," said Michael Ignatieff, Chief of the Liberals, after the end of the Weekly Caucus Session before the assembled advisers.
The Liberals reaffirmed that the design of law, allowing each person to be identified by the transport of illegal immigrant marine until a year, is detrimented as proposed by the Canadian Constitution of Justice and Freedom.
Gilles Ducepe, Chief of the Block Québecois, decided that it could not support the legislative project because he refers to the wrong target group.
"We are concerned and it seems to be all of the opposition parties, so we will be waiting for what the government is undertaken," said Mr. Ducepe.
The critics concerning the immigration question of Olivia Chow, NDP, have demonstrated the criticians of the hand that call for their party not to be strong enough against the secret migrants.
"The Neo Democrats are aware of that action against the blind passagiers, and we are attempting to transmit another law-development, C-35," made Chow.
We are therefore not anticipating the law-development of the conservatives because he seeks the fault of refugees and keeps children arrested at least a year," said Chow.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, accused the opposition parties to play with the policy and to ignore the will of the Canadians.
"The Canadians are endorsing the deputys that they do not tolerate this kind of secret immigration, these criminal actions concerning the Canada and the country acting as a foot-apartment."
"You're expected that Canada's hard steps are overcome," the Minister Kenneys reaction.
"The Government has not announced any confidence statement concerning its laws draft that the country could lead to elections that the Government had rejected.
However, a conservator has expressed the QMI Agency, that the Government would call a question, so that each opposing Member immediately explains the electoral.
The new unit does not find an unity
Despite the announcement of the possible creation of a new one standing on the fight against corruption and collection following John Charest, many observers continue to continue the education of a Public Research Committee on this subject.
Robert Dutil, Minister of Public Security, said that this idea is not yesterday: Quebec would have consulted the New York Department of Investment on this subject last January.
The metropole has since 1870 about a standing unit against corruption.
However, the announcement of Middle's preaching has more than one.
It should be said that this measure was not the least discussed by the President Robert Dutils in the meeting of the Czech Police Committee on 29 October last year.
It was not also missed that Stefane Bergeron, criticians and member of the party Québécois, this announcement in public security as "out the hair beaten caninchen" as well as "in a drink-based solution".
Minister Dutil had turned back to those who fear that political power had too much influence on the investigation.
"They will see the result when we're going to announce it," he welcomed to confirm.
"Man is aware of this problem."
According to Rejean Parent, the President of the CSQ, nothing can replace the implementation of a public survey.
"More Mr. Charest is concerned that the education of this Research Committee is to prevent, so the people like you and I think he has something to hide," he said.
"The only resources to be able to form a research committee is the return of Jean Charest," said Yves Boisver, Decent for Ethics and Political Systems at the ENA (Agency School for High Administrators).
In order to exit from this sackgase, the Quebec proposes to establish a specific mandate for the financial verification control to enable them to make such research on corruption and secret discussions.
"You should be able to expand the mandate of the test control," decided.
He also believes that the quebec of the verification control could establish the same power as the Commissioners, which you would also allow people to exert.
The education of a standing unit is not the only project in the load of the Government Charest.
The Quebec will also request Ottawa to amend the criminal law to be better introduced on this type of crimes.
This question is from the Chief Officer of the Operation Marteau, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that the jurisdiction in this type of crime is not clear.
Vic Toews, State Minister for Public Safety, confirmed his colleague of Justice, Rob Nicholson, at the time with certain news on this folder.
During the printing time 2001, which involved the groups of motor policeists, 131 persons were arrested, although the criminal law was not advertised.
Ottawa has pursued the law against Gangsterium.

Double admitted to the part
The Quebecer Rundfunkmoderator Stéphane Dupont, before the Canadian Surveillance Council for Rundfunk Standards (CCNR) has introduced a part of its contradictory explanations on social concerns and Haitians, as well as because of his exceptional reaction on Funk.
The CCNR considers that Mr. Dupont and its CHOI 98.1 Team had the right to explane their own views, however, some exemptions “no information on social care and unrealised negative figures of the Haitianians had also contained a sort of inherent remark, which is not adequate to the explanated day.”
The Board also concluded that a debate on self-assassination containing the distribution of the name of two persons who have started a self-assassin against the code of the round transmission.
The CCNR had received several complaints on the comments issued during the period 2008 and 2010.
The first availability was introduced by a complaint of the "Common Front of the assistant social du Québec".
The active organization had noticed the amounts referred to in the sentence.
The moderns should mostly share solidly as irregular events.
With regard to the subject of self-military, the Moderator Stefane Dupont had the opinion that the self-military was an expression of feasibleness.
Most of the Board of Supervisory Members had concluded that the reported message was that self-assassin should not be considered as a solution of life crises.
"The majority of the Board of Surveillance takes into account that the consequences of the inquiry 'douont le midi' would have affected a sensitive subject in family-related and suitable manners."
So he was not accused with any taxi against his person.
The last struggle focused on the earthquake in Haiti.
Stefane Dupont and Jean-Rene Dufort had provided a media-effective talk of the fight that a lot of reactions had been called.
The CHOI model has declared not to have paid for Haiti's assistance, since you were not safely knowing whether the needs would also receive the amount of money.
The Board of Opinion considers that these comments were not missile characteristics, however, their collective effect represent an unrealised negative indication of the Haitian.
"I've already earned my thirty-shirds of suspension in this case."
"My act is pregnant for one half years," the Moderator said.
In all decisions, the Board of Surveillance includes the distribution of an unhould expression.
In all cases, the CHOI-FM has acted on the side of its obligations.
The consequences for the road-function factor, among others, which had to share its decisions once during the main time of three days, are low.
A king of the King Fu in Montreal
Nacereddine Zemmal, Montrealer Algerian origins, has made a very special course.
The Athlett, which is split in "Sanda" (Voll contact Kung-Fu), in the Kickboxs and in the Thaiboxs, is now looking for new challenges on the tatami and in the Box rounds of the world.
"I have started fighters like Kung Fau and Kickboxs in Algerian 12 years ago," Zemmal said in Metropol since 2008 to develop himself among the Profess.
I personally seek the battle of allories, since those who have the ground campaign, how to present him the mixed coasts of war, don't like, fighting in North America are rare."
Recently, the worker of his character was a security officer, as well as the company of the UPS, with its bad news, in which he was in Edinburgh, Scottland, a world ministry of the Amateure two gold meals from the World Carate and the Kickboxing Association (WA) was held between 23 and 30 October.
"I got the victory in the categories of the full contact of Kickboxens and the Thaibox," he said.
"I'm prepared for the world pool in San Shou in China."
"The wars were invited from every category who had been placed at the last worldgethership among the four first ones."
"I'm buried a baby in Toronto Bronze in 2009."
"2005 I've become in Vietnam. "
"2007 I ended the tourier in China at the fifth place, while I became in Toronto Dritter in 2009," he added.
"It's valuable that I have made progress at each weather campaign."
"To this rhythm I'll be this time or next year!"
"San Shou" or "Sanda" are highly disciplines from China, where feedings and feet are authorised as well as land wheats.
The two battles usually play on a platform, rarely in a Box round.
The most renowned box fight that has been issued from this kind of war sports is the American vietnamian origin Cung Le, known in the world of the fight coasts.
If Nacer Zemmal remains only one event in his carrier, he would securely call his presence here at the Super tourier "King of Sanda", the Super Bowl of Kung Fu.
"It is the highest and highest in China," said the sympathy pofundsker.
"It's a little like the equivalent to the stadion Lumpinee (the largest station of Thailand)."
"It was a super-explosion."
In the half-final of his category (80 kg) he won his first fight before he lost in the end.
"The one who tried me was a prophecy," he analyzed.
"There are four centers per category (80 kg, 85 kg, 90 kg and 95 kg).
"The winners of the half-final meet each at the end of their category."
"They then the winners of each category offer the stars to smile a single champion, the King of the King-Fu."
450 million in contracts without description
Hydro-Québec has granted 450 million dollars to contracts for the water power project Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle Recupert.
In the middle of this lawine, more than 100 contracts, a consortium consisting of the company BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor, which has received the most important part of the project leading to a sum of $295 million without a description.
This Consortium, named "Energy gerance", was established in 2004 as a comprehensive statement of the decision of Hydro-Québec, the private sector’s responsibility, this important, hydro electrical project at a total of $5 billion.
At the beginning of 2005, the Consortium "Energy gerance" met the luxury treaty without having given public description.
The Québécois Party provides a serious ethical problem that causes the risk of competitive disappearance and price increase.
"This is a new way and way of a carded game and enhances the competitiveness."
"It means that there are newly covered games instead of secret kind and ways to be conducted in open form," said yesterday Sylvain Simard, Member of the PQ, at the press conference.
On the early afternoon, Simard had put the question before the National Assembly, because it seems hard to be seen as the interest of public can be served in this way.
The Minister of Resources, Nathalie Normandeau, had reacted on the next afternoon, expressed she often in Abrede that it had been treated for a card game.
"I staying faithful to my line," she revealed, strengthening the PQ has been "againly passed" and it was "pay her."
She said it was "see the ministry," that the PQ was excused.
The model of the Consortium is a worldly current practice.
It is usually a timely time-limitation that allows two or more enterprises to present their expertise in terms of a mandate to a comprehensive project.
The "Eastmain" project shows a high level of complexity regarding its working measure.
The construction procedure is on the ground and must be established up to 2012.
However, the treaty was forgotten without the possibility of a competitive camp; it had already been negotiated.
Furthermore, the model of the consortium in Quebec itself in relating to relatively simple projects is no longer exclusive.
As noted the newspaper "Le Devoir" last week, the model used in the field of the construction and consultation of the Consortium's case of government communications is used.
A short overflow of the Quebecer company registry allows it to nominate more than 200 contacts that appear from some of the permanent time.
In this way, for example, the company Dessau works in partnership with the majority of its nuclear competitors, with which CIMA+, Génivar, SNC-Lavalin, or also roche and tecsult number.
Another link, and there are several decades, leads to one and the same legal person, that is the Dessau.
What the Consortium of Energy gerance requested, the Minister of Normandeau stressed that "the Territory of Baie James is subject to a special work force dynamic and that Hydro-Québec has taken account of this fact since the 70s."
Real Laport, the great employer of the Société de la Baie James (SEBJ), made a declaration that the Nase on the Fact has made a complaint to the Treaty on the Governance of the Convention.
"If you make a description and there's just a few suppliers, your prices will be faster."
"You have two possibilities: or you take the people who are on this Mart and say to you, you will have a satisfactory agreement to a good price."
"The idea is, however, that not the price is decisive, but the skill of the persons", confirmed laport.
This intended contract "Energy gerance" is part of a long list of contracts received over $50,000 from the Québecois Party.
The contracts were approved by the hydro-Québec or the SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcel record.
According to the review, the newspaper "Le Devoir" reported more than 100 ingenieurs and advice contracts, companies or their filials, including resource laboring between 2002 and March 2010.
SNC-Lavalin had 22 contracts received, Génivar had 16 received to Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10, without compensating their participation to “energy gerance”.
All these treaties are negotiated.
They are totally at $449,783,344, excluding the Treaty with "Energy Gerance" of $295,131,564.
Sylvain Simard has allowed the four companys who formed the consortium (BPR, Dessau, SM and Axor) to be known by the "Parti libéral du Québec".
The Minister of Normandeau had allowed the PQ to be related to the company they "financed" before they precised that it was more than their leading forces.
Barometers acknowledged consumption - The "Green" label is not reliable
Green, but uncommon skiptic.
The Quebecer consumer has little confidence to the main actors of sustainable growth, but even not less than the marks designed or the eco-country labels that should control its choice.
Damage, although it is in a medicine-effective university, where it is only likely to say about information for a responsibilities of the consumer: the Barometer responsible consumption has a lack of credible information, a irrelevance that makes considerable as a breach of his commitment, as showed the first reading that was stopped yesterday.
Although they have anticipated the consumption of the so-called contract products in 2010, the Quebecers appear to be those who try to sell them little credit.
Two thirds of the Quebecer population have to doubt the environmental commitment of firms, as well as the green enterprises, the measure tool of which is responsible for the consumer centre of the University of Sherbrooke.
Another conclusion: half of the consumer is dubbious of the reliability of the official certificates, which are added to the damage of the products, but also of the credibility of the products and brands that declare as an environment, the barometer.
According to the same pattern, the diskurs of political people are seriously taken to this issue of only 14.6% of the Quebecer population.
The information concerning the responsibilities of the consumer seems even important to stimulate this consumption, which is currently alone a third of the Quebecer consumers.
In fact, empty and doubtless characters of the information have been killed by 46% of the consumers.
This is after the highest price of the products the second, according to the barometers.
A third of the quotas of the given performance of the green products and services that are aimed at putting them on the hand is misstrained.
According to another communication, the half of the consumer had already changed its natures in 2010 and previously changed the mark of one or more products to express their conviction.
According to Barometers, they also prefered 61% purchases in their city quarters and benefited the purchase of food built in their region.
Green and responsibilities - the index of the global recognised consumption had reached a 64 of the maximum value of 100 - the Homo consumus of Quebec likes to present himself as King of the Recycling, which is trying to reduce its samples left in the environment by taking care of the protection of the animal.
However, social and ecological conscience seems to be stopped before his car, so the barometers have indicated: just 28% of the Qubecers have used public transports in 2010, or have benefited the risk centres to demonstrate their environmental interest.
The achievement and the road railways were also encouraged by 39.1% of the participants of this comprehensive behaviour, which provides the clinical perspectives.
State duties for the extension of eXcentris
The Quebecer Government, requested by the Société Anus, and by the company Parallèle to participate financially in the removal of the kno complex eX center, explains that cooperation was agreed, but only in the form of a competitive loan.
The developer company Anus, and the Parallèle company, which had been a stage of seven million dollars from the Advocate Minister for the transfer of Daniel Langlois, had been a composer eXcentris on the Boulevard Saint-Laurent Bulevard to transmit this again its actual cineastic function.
However, the Government agreed to participate in this matter, however, in their own conditions.
Instead of the expected spending, the Quebecer Government offers a loan in less than the initial higher, which could call for an existing solution to benefitable conditions in life, at least in view of the sources that are encountered from the State currency.
A first action plan and a request by 12,8 million have already been revealed from Quebec, since the bits were recognized so far as highly below.
A proposal together with a plan of action was already sent by the President of the "Société de Development of cultural enterprises" (SODEC), François Macerola, Minister St-Pierre, which leads the eXcentris Act.
A few days ago he had given her a last report.
However, the SODEC was transmitted on Wednesday.
Parallèle and Angola have now been answering to this until 31 December.
Anyway, it seems that the privileges of the State Defence are truly reduced to the side.
Remember that the Quebecer owner Community of Kinos and Kino composed of a direct State investment in support of the transfer of eXcentris by providing the argument that the Castle Minister has not provided any financial assistance for real estate projects which he did not have reached other kinos.
In contrast, many other market operators of the segment have granted significant, economic aid.
Kinochef Daniel Langlois, after the funded construction of the Kino, had presented the author of Kenkino in the elections of his kno-complete, which could justify the exemption after the State Czech.
The lack of knoxals that show independent films is more clear than clear in Montreal, and eXcentris knew to keep its client at the star.
The Société Anus, and the company Parallèle with Christian Yaccarini at the spring, on the side, control a private financed campaign, which has a total of $700,000 to cut the purchase.
Since spring 2009, only one leinwand continues to show films in eX centers, namely Le Parallèle.
The goal of the future buyer is to reveal the three knocks on February 27, the next year with the presence of the very available film of Xavier Beauvois "Thes and the deux".
But Christian Yaccarini has not received the newspaper "Le Devoir" and is ignored what he and his group keeps of the corrected proposals you have made to them.
Secret of the complex property Canada
The new, American diplomate guides that were spread by WikiLeaks have been acknowledged the secret of what the United Nations considered under the minority complex of the Canadians against the Americans; but with the same slaughter, they were opening the overall feeling of recently open to Canada.
Therefore, the American diplomates are appreciated that the Canadian elector has not had the Canadian-American relations, and they believe that the visit by President Obama would help the conservative government to carry out its budget in 2009!
The four new communications between the American news in Ottawa and Washington, which have been distributed yesterday, provides more ploting details than the blow substantive content you have to knabb.
One of the reporting connections of 22 September 2008, which was in the period in which the federal electoral site was in full range, reported on which point the United Nations has no longer participated in the issues discussed by their political heads.
To the great success of David Wilkins, established in Ottawa, American messengers.
Mr Wilkins offers various statements to this situation.
"In the Canadians nearly inhabiting minority complex, the Canadian, political leading forces may be more than to speak about internal issues of the everyday, as the United States to draw the black Peter in this election (as the 1988 campaign on Free Trade) ".
The United Nations, as follows, are "the language goliath of this choice: all present, but potentially to speak of him."
The ambassador understands that "aboriginal style" is less, since the two countries have intensive political and economic relations.
"Logly," he assess, "the possibility of a candidate, a party and a lot more of a party to lead such essential relationship that the elector has as a key factor in the meaning."
The other expression of this sense of importance was read by Terry Breese, business managers in Ottawa, sent to prepare the President Barack Obama at its first visit in Ottawa.
"Their travel will help to ensure the continued government in the confidence of the Federal Budget begin of February, in which Canada will give its first deficit after more than one decade, which is based on a programme of survival at the level of $30 to 40 billion," says Brise.
Nevertheless, it said that the Government had to hold the Parliament meeting before Christmas in order to prevent the coalition's coalition from the Parliament and would affect its opposition parties on the quality of the proposed testing programme.
Another, from January 2008, dating and follow-up of the ambassador Wilkins, a compliance with Washington's always negative image that the United States expanded by CBC, Dramatic Serbians.
The ambassador is concerned about postings such as Border, Little Mosco on the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which little sub-style playings can be observed in Maher Arar, the "No-Fly List" or also delays for the purpose of muscle processes of the CIA.
Another new report reports out how Hillary Clinten at its French offices Bernard Kouchner asked at its first bilateral meeting, then whether Europe is ready to take some prisoners from Guantánamo.
Mr Kouchner must have responded to the question, however, on the basis of a individual "all" decision.
At the end of the meeting, it describes that the State Secretariat composed a paper in the point Omar Khadr, a 15-year-old Canadian Muslims.
"The State Secretary has agreed to see the acts again."
Finally, we notice that the guests are achieved with regard to the WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, an old and Stephen Harper's very close adviser, had explained that the "umm of" should be brought for this massive leck.
He was referring to Mike Huckabee from the United States.
World-wide plan to renew illumination
The UNO yesterday in Cancun has proposed a plan for renewing household, trade and industry in 100 countries with regard to the achievement of the reduction of the trail gas (FCKW) which is nearly a third of the additional reduction that needs to be realised to stabilize the earthquake to 2020.
This ambitious plan takes its position in steps of the concrete major projects to implement the UNO in Cancun to comply with the independence of sustainable reduction obligations of industrial countries.
Following the yesterday plan, the main problem in the form of the 1,8 billion tonnes (Gt) would be avoiding the FCKWs based on the earth if the white-flower bottles, which are still presented to a monopol of 50 to 70% on the market, by fluorescent or better, by lightdiods (LED).
The lighting is responsible for 8% of the global emissions.
This corresponds to an equivalent of 70% of the expenditure of the world's flood park.
In Kopenhagen last year, the large shipments of gases such as the United States, China, Europe, and others, including Canada, were committed to voluntary reduction plans that should overcome the global FCKW emissions of 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
However, from this balance you still have to be able to stabilize the climate increase of 2 degrees of Celsius to prevent that this is not out of control.
In the white bridges, 95% of the energy form of warm, and the remaining 5% produces the light.
With the compact fluid bulbs, the energy consumption reduces 75%, with the new LED LED lightings, these energy requirements are reduced to the double.
The compact fluid bulbs keep at the scene between 6000 and 100,000 hours.
The new LED lights, such as those who produced Philips this week, have participated in the UNO study, have been a life expectation of 25.000 hours and consumed 80% less than a white wine, which provides an integration of the opportunities of the exchange plan that would be used in 100 countries.
Besides the fact that Iese is completely renewable gloves, only very little warm, they can also operate with a regular stage.
And they do not contain any Quecksilber.
Several specialists have shown that booking of compact fluorescent cards, as they contain Quecksilbers and therefore need to be specialized, what is not always possible in developing countries, except producers are available to an acceptable site.
However, the main source of Quecksilber emissions on the planet does not provide the containers of compacking fuel, but mostly the coal power tools that are essentially extracting more kecksilbers to produce electricity disappeared by the white winters.
Even in the United States, these coal power tools are 25,000 tons of Quecksilber annually.
The report provides details of the benefits that each country would develop through this international programme.
Indonesian, for example, a milliard of dollars annually when buying electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, which means an equivalent of 3,5 coal power forces whose construction of India would cost 2.5 billion.
Elfendbeast is expected to announce the election results
UNO Secretary-General Ban Ki-monon requested the "indirect" publication of the results of the Presidency election of the Elfense Coasts.
"The Secretary-General underlines the need for the independent election committee to receive their work and to provide the provisional results without further deployment," said a Pressman of the United Nations Chapter.
"He calls for all parties and institutions of the Elfense Costa in order to demonstrate their responsibility and to include each initiative to connect the provisional results."
Despite the seventh printing of certain foreign governments, the Commission elected the Deadline, which was determined on middle-to-night, three days after the election on Sunday, without a publication of the results.
Circa forty-minutes before the board, the President of the CEI had confirmed in the television that the Commission would continue to announce the results.
During the middle of the world, the CEI will finally call on the name of the victory of the second electoral group under the Laurent Gbagbo and its opposite Alassane Ouattara.
However, the Gbagbo Lager does not comply with the cancelation of "belggerian" stipulations in the north of the Constitution Council, which had been provided by the ex-rebelling Layer of the new Forces (FN) during September 2002.
Pascalemi N'Guessan, head of the Presidency campaign of the Elfenbein Coast, confirmed that the manager followed by the FN practical managers in order to prevent the electors in the north of the country's election, had rejected the applicants of the President to choose.
The whole election could be can be canceled if the documents introduced by Gbagbo are taken into account by the Constitution Council.
However, the Gbagbo continents now think that the High Court of Justice is not neutral, since Paul Yao N'Dré is leaded to a politically connected with Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, a man of the north, who extends each connection to the ex-related Rebells, has decided the delay in the connection of the election results as "unacceptable" and requested Gbagbo to respect them, even if he has not gone so far to request the victory.
His candidate Party confirm Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results, as he knows that he has lost; and bring a complaint before the Constitutional Governance, after the election committee to publish the results, it is illegal.
The second round of the presidency elections on Sunday was kept for the reinforcement of a country's agreement and rehabilitation process which had been paid over two parts over the year.
However, the United Nations had warned the politicians of the Elfenbecue coasts that they could be kept responsible for them in the case of possible explanations.
Laurent Gbagbo had the first election meeting on 31 October with 38% of the votes against Alassane Ouattara, which had been the public support of the former President Henri Konan Bedié (25% in the first round) as a peakkandidat.
Unemployment rates in France remained in the third quarter

Alexandre Guerini applaudis and arrests
In contrast to Alexandere Guérini, 53, Head of a disappearance manager and brother of the President of the General Council of the Boches-du-Rhoône Region (PS), it was introduced a procedure for approval and was introduced in the pursuant to a public and liabilities procedure in the prison of Luynes near Aix-en-provence.
Alexandere Guerini was appealed by the submission of society, deployment of general goods, Hehleri, Middle Agency in Corruption, unlawful Technology and weapons, so its legal manager.
"Alexander Guerini campsite prepared and planned to explain to all questions that will provide him the State authority, instead of extending the most heavy feedings."
"It's easy to submit to him a number of criminal complaints, a different thing is to prove them," said his lawyer Florence Rault of the AFP (Agency France Presse) before the hearing of his mandate.
Mr. Guérini, brother of Jean-Noël Guérini, the first man of the PS (Parti Socialist) in the Department, was worthy to allow the judge to come to the hearing of his lawyer a memory to his justification.
A member Guerinis, Philipe Rapezi, was also accused and arrested in the middle of the village.
According to the lawyer of Lucien Simon, her mandate never had done anything else than his deponition he had to lead.
With regard to the business skills or the target location of the fund that is related, Simon would never have known.
In this case, Daniel Pinna, the former Director of the Public Balance Service of Aubagne, was also appealed in the middle of Summit on the subject and compliance, however, under the appointment to keep the protagonists of this law.
"My mandate could provide statements to the facts that were provided to him."
"The Heads of State has noticed to betray him his freedom," said his lawyer Yann Arnoux.
Four other persons were invoked and in the middle of Sunday decided from the court, including two of them under legal supervision, the Chief-President Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, a comprehensive manager of the detection company Marseille Provence Metropole (MPM), is pursuant to "unlawful influence and passive Technology".
Two State officers of the Aubagne, Michele Duval and Christophe Bringuier were also arrested, one on the basis of the title "Interlation and Delivery of General Guitan by a public service" by the other means of "Administration in the detention of public money".
The vital fellowship of Alexandere Guérini, Jeannie Peretti, was appealed by the "Healleri and Employment of Society".
To those who were against the guerinian, Stefane Bruengo-Girard, recently arrested because of a similar business-related machine from public hand that Corsika had affected.
The persons suspected their society to be able to kiss from "hohe" combustion flowing money.
The investigation against X concerning mobilized drugs in the delivery of public imprisonment, particularly in the removal, is carried out by anonymous writing in the acts of several open delivery procedures in April 2009.
The investigation is particularly focused on the conditions of the adjudication and the operation of a deponition in La Ciotat, which are also disappeared from the area of Aubagne, as well as from certain cities in the steadfast zone of Marseille (MPM).
Business Clotilde Reiss: The Elysée-Palast overcomes its middle function for Syria
In more than six months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the Clotilde Reiss, a young French researcher who was held in Iran through the “Spionage”, the French public in Atem, translated the diplomation in alarm preparation and accentated the disappointment of relations between Paris and Teheran.
This is all among the attention of the United States Diplomates.
The American documents received by WikiLeaks and give some reasons for this crisis.
It describes how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans who went to give these advice to the transition with their own crises of "assets" in Iran (a small group of Wanderers).
They point out how the French responsibilities have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young French is not the release of Majid Kakavand, a prisoner in France and the American justice has been searched for the use of the Iranian Nuclear Programme.
Finally, they set the way with which the French presidency has tried to manipulate the media for the purpose of making this idea believed that the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad has played a central role in release of Clotilde travel in a green light.
He hadn't done anything in this regard.
The title "Iran: French comments on the kind and way of transition with collections" in Paris on 12 August 2009.
François Richier, Elysée Adviser in Strategy Questions, is engaged in the guide of Patrice Paoli, Director of the Quai d'Orsay for North Africa and the Middle East with the American Diplomatin Cathleen Allgrone.
They explained her the French method.
They called to the Americans to put everything in order to resume their own citizens who would have been strongly arrested in Iran.
"As weeping," they said, "littled and clearly and without underlace" the words "Grundman Rights", "unjust," "fortunate release" in the media.
This is necessary to bring the Iranian regime into a case which is very sensitive to its image.
"Don't make it more than you ask the Iranians to do that."
Since "Stillweights solves nothing", the discussions on inadmissible ways that Iran are "master in Ausweich managers".
Mr Richier adds that the determination of foreign countries is a "graffy, iranian tactic" to be: "Assemblement for political repression."
He announces the release of Clotilde travel from the prison (which should come on August 16, when she fled to the French message) "forward the payment of a large amount of money to Irane" (230,000 Euro Kaution).
And he allows the elysae anti-ziper elysa others, a phenomenon that will "sweet."
The Iranians could arrest one of the others of about 1,800 French State citizens who live in Iran.
28 August 2009.
Clotilde journey has been released from prison 12 days ago, but continues to be arrested in Iran.
A information was carried out in a course: the Irane Majid Kakavand, whose delivery by the United States on the basis of illegal trade with a sensitive electronic material to Iran, has been deleted after the decision of a judge in Paris.
The American news is, as many other observers, questions about this huge co-incidence.
For Washington, the illegal iranian networks of the acquisition by the material intended for the Nuclear Programme, the release of Majid Khakavand is bad news.
France took a coffee trade in the buy?
The release of the Iranian against those of the French?
In addition to a new education with Kathleen Allgrone on 4 September, François Richier ensures that this is not the case.
The Elysée, so he says, was not only "wholy surprised by the decision of the judge," but also tried to resolve herself.
"He has given a rain exchange between the French president and the French Minister of Justice" (Michele Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot change the right decision."
Mr Richier also wants to point out that Majid Kakavand continues under the "strenger" supervision of the French secret service.
The Elysée adviser selects a phone number again, then informs the American diplomatin, Iranian "based at present in the buildings conducted by the Iranian message."
During the guard of Clotilde journey in Iran, Elysée does not believe to make his efforts, through defeats and the media organised "First Research" the Syrian President Bachar Al-Assad plays a "power" and "influential media role".
The Americans have not observed this activity without Ironia and believed that manipulation brings fruit, since several articles reflect the official French version.
One of the date telegrams of 25 August 2009 described "the media blow of the French authorities".
To which it is based so much "Thank Test" against Mr Assad, the message of Paris is questioned.
"In the light of their statements of full lobby, the French authorities are secreted that they only have a pretty idea of what the Syrians have done in fact."
The document therefore contains the reasons that the Elysa has brought to deal with this fiction.
He analysed the intensive efforts of communication "the aims to confirm Sarcocy's opening policy against Syria,"
In 2008, a policy launched, which has been adopted by "pleasing critical votes in France and foreign" as a pleasant and unfair.
"The syrical role on constructive" trys to lead Paris "Syrien to the eyes of which illustration can be achieved by playing a constructive role in the region."
The goal is also: "Saving the route between Syria and Iran."
The American news knows that from a good source.
On August 11, François Richier had announced her: "We do not know whether the Syrians were always done."
"But we have thanked us even though we were all with them."
"That should at least be a vengeance with the Iranians."
Clotilde Reise returns on 16 May 2010 to France.
Nicolas Sarkozy recommends it in Elysée.
In a communiqué, he thanks the President of Brazil, the Senegal and Syria for their "active role for the liberalization of our country."
No online games for young Koreans to North
The South Korean Government will adopt a law called "the Aschenbroll", which will be allowed to youth to play after the North Online Game by ensuring their access to the Government's responsibilities.
A legislative design that is to call for the online player to provide youths under 16 years after midnight the access to these games will be presented to the Parliament in December by the representatives of Kultus and Family Ministers.
"Much children play these games all night and then have difficulties with learning in school and also to lead a normal life every day."
"We believe that this law is necessary to ensure their health and right to sleep", said Jo Rin, with this law-in-law Ministerial Officer of the French Presse Agency France Presse.
The online games will then be available from 6:00 tomorrow.
The producers had a long year to prepare for the application of the law, as precisely.
The Government also urged the supplies of the producers to ask for daily access to these games to deploy the young people whose parents ask for this purpose, to add the responsible.
It will also be those who want to be available to provide grass programs that allow you to limit the time used on the Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "related" countries, and the newspapers regularly report from different, intensive Internet uses.
In addition, the country is an unfavourable Champion in global online-weapon-weapon.
In November, the South Korean faced four goldmedalenes in the World Cyber games.
World Ministership 2018-2022: FIFA recognizes the designer country
On the basis of corruption-related corruption, the Executive Committee of the FIFA on Thursday calls for the expert countries of the World Sexualities 2018 and 2022, a higher political choice in which the wheel of influence and the lobbying of the technical criteria are delayed in the background.
However, one thing is safe: the edition of the FIFA's Queen Disputy will be held in Europe, their traditional highburg (4 candidates: England, Russia, Spain-Portugal, Netherlands).
The 2022 Ausgabe will then be some more extreme; the International Food Paint will be able to continue to gain new territories (Katar, Australia) in the United States or in Fertle East (Japan, South Korea) in 2010.
The list of personalities to belong to the delegation (David Cameron, Prince William, José Luis Rodriguez Zapather, José Scrates, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Katar, the Belgian and Dutch Government Chief, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) provides the measure of the economic and political impact of a world ministry.
Thus, the machines behind the cups have stopped up to the last minute.
In other words, it is difficult to create a heroarchie of the candidates.
Following the Evaluation Report of the FIFA, the English, Spanish and Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) acts are more important than their competitors.
However, these considerations will not be so grave for the 22 members of the Executive Committee at the time of the election.
The Sunday Times, which had been held with the creation of the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temrii and Amos Adamu) at the beginning of the enthusiasm, would well be able to destroy the opportunities for their own country, the way of the football, only one time the world's mastership, in 1966.
The BBC had re-earned the nerboes on Monday by exhibiting a documentary report, which took three influential members of the Committee, namely Ricardo Teixeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa lifeou.
The reason is enough to strengthen the FIFA and bring the English responsibilities who had first operated intense lobbying in these past weeks.
The Governing Head of Lounge was a re-examination of his advancer Tony Blair skills, which had provided the Olympic Game Organization in 2005 for London.
Would this intensive use be sufficient to assess the picture of England before the Committee?
Nothing is less safe because the Duo Spain Portugues are not missing to trips with his already established stages, its expertise (WM 82 in Spain, Olympic games 92 in Barcelona, EM 2004) and its football culture.
However, economic and financial terms of the two countries could fight their ambitions.
The possible repressivities against the Englands and the doubts about Solvenz of Spain and Portugal allow the possibilities of Russia, which, despite his skills in the directory (Stadies, hotels, transport) to grow to the weight of outdoors.
However, the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided to approve the observations of the English press "unfair competition in the preparation of the vote" by the Commission members.
"It's going to make it dry, you're trying to compromitt it," putin felt.
For 2022, the United States appear to be strengthened by the experience of 1994 to be logical favorites.
The first economic worldwide, seats of the FIFA-Haupts, the country seems to show a long list of advantages towards Japan and South Korea, which separately created a very beautiful project.
However, these new candidatures appear to be pleasing for two countries who had cooperated in 2002.
Another threat: the WM 2026 WMs, which allows Asian opportunities at 2022.
With Australia and Katar, who had taken all registers with the expectation of futuristic stades, the FIFA follows its extension in the direction of new areas, but these two countries make a greater risk as awareness.
Australia could have leaded the sensitive nerv of the FIFA-related Nerv by the European countries, even as Japan and South Korea.
Second mandate: Publicity
De Gaulle had really been shot.
Mitterand had to believe he was stubborn.
Valéry Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac did not show the latest shots.
And Nicolas Sarkozy is still less than these.
A mandate in Elysée calls the next.
The current State Chief will therefore be candidate in 2012.
But the publicity stands on the side of the mystery, which holds the presidency function, not well to face.
So you have to do so as if the doubt is firmly.
In the one, as well as in the other meaning.
In 2006, the applicants James Chiracs provided that a third mandate was not excluded without to believe it.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy promised to take his decision "irgendwann in the Herbst of 2011".
That he would allow the perspective of "two mandates" at the Headquarter before the UMP parliamentarians to announce the properties of "two mandates", then he would have spread a little reliability.
Was that the official announcement of his candidate?
Whatever is done.
The President just recalled that the Constitution change of 2008 was only due to two years of office.
He made a determination, no announcement.
It is not the first time that he mentioned the presidential choice of such meetings in a humorous tongue.
"You have the worstest case with me seven years, or at least," he explained them in July 2009.
On a new in May 2010: "I don't believe that I'm not thinking about the phase then."
His words of the previous ones do not make him more to the candidates than the first day; but not less.
They should call comments, then from a double reason.
The acceleration of the trail around the candidature with the PS on one side.
However, it is not the adoption of competition with segolène Royal, which Nicolas Sarkozy seeks to demonstrate himself.
On the contrary, it is its clear candidature in 2012, which encourages many of the PS members as previously adopted in the fighting event.
The bad surveys on the other side.
At the first time, the electors of the right would provide a candidate of François Fillon from Nicolas Sarkozy (46% against 44%, according to the BVA-L'Express survey).
"We have a candidate, and there is no other discussion with the UMP," replyed directly and precisely the environment of the Prime Minister.
"If he could find a ground as possible, he would not be candidate," shared Jean-Pierre Raffarin.
"He will continue to be able to hurt," corrected Alain Juppé, who has discovered himself with the publicity.
Euro: the ECB is intended to maintain their purchases of State papers
The last meeting of the Central Bank Council of the ECB should provide opportunities for how to get out of the crisis or at least announce a large number of inconventional actions of monetary policy to come to the end of the year.
The crisis of the European State Prosecution is obliged to doubt that the Central Bank in Frankfurt cannot make it unfortunately, even today, more intense situation on the European markets in order to not denial its destruction.
Political costs would be too high.
The French Financial Minister Christine Lagarde had welcomed a press conference, which was adopted by the ECB, the active role for the solution of the State Budget of Europe.
She didn't want to say whether it is the view that the Central Bank could do more, for example, through the acceleration of its programme of purchases of public licenses.
"I have my views for my European trade partner (...)."
John-Claude Trichet, the President of the ECB had not shown in Brussels its hearing by the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Committee not very relaxed about its projects but is much more pleased to demonstrate that the programme of purchases of State cases on the second market would be "developed" and that we would be seen at the meeting on Thursday on the same day.
Only certainty: the ECB will not change its guide in 1%, to the lowerest level since May 2009.
In practice, the complaints of the ECB Chamber were doubled to approximately 1,35 billion euros last week.
And according to the discrimination of certain traders, she should have operated new buys to Irish and Portuguese State Acts yesterday.
Overall, the Eurosystem's central banks have bought from May 2010 to 67 billion euros.
In the middle of the carriers, the anticipation of a further pursuant to the currency will not be deleted in any case (see page 29).
The people's officers have no significant change.
If the contracts from over three months are already disappeared from the ECB Arsenal, the latter will be to create the unlimited resource reservations of frequency, including over a period from a week to three months.
People's workers have already been encouraging this measure for a few months.
"I can't imagine that the ECB will change its programme as an important manner."
"Of otherwise, she would risk to provocate new shifts in short terms," said Michael Schubert, a citizen of the Commercebank.
"The first quarter of 2011 seems to be more likely for the history of the first quarter of 2011," anticipates Norbert Berems, a peoplesman at Sal.
OK home.
In the field of their interventions on the market of the prosecution of State, the ECB is to impose such a compulsory in compliances that live the market, Norbert Berens adds.
In view of the relevance of the explicit position of the European Banks on the markets of the State Defence in the Eurozone, the Central Bank has no choice to maintain its presence on the market.
"There must take to the places of the lacking investors and act in this way to prevent the pre-covernance of the payment payed to the worst States," a major manager.
Indeed, if the rates on high-level flight are set, the States would still prevent more to reduce their debt or only to stabilize.
This is the price for the protection of the euro.
The government of Berlusconi is in Italy in Deckung
After a week-in-lawful start for Italy, the situation has been a little relaxed at last with the 10-year-old decrease.
Return to the painting style.
At the end of the meeting with the Economic Minister, the Presidents of the Region, Giulio Tremonti, had qualified the situation as "indignable" and have heard him with a "unpreaded" weekend, which the concerned was immediately demented.
On Sunday, any time, the series with the German currencies had reached its record of 210 basic points and the prices of the contracts on the detection of the competitive risk were at 263 points which had been highlighted in Rome.
Silvio Berlusconi, at the Council of Ministers, indicated that the Discrimination of Spain was at 400 base points.
But his right hand, Gianni Letta, had expressed himself as a "shake" of the "marturing bulbs" and a possible risk of enhancement from Ireland.
"The good news is that Italy is the third population of the euro area, not as Greece or Ireland."
"The bad news is that Italy is like Portugal", says Irwin Stelzer, Hudson's Hudson Institute.
It is clear that the problem is the absence of economic growth and the income tax rates that bring the State into danger, not to be able to discover its financial needs.
The last Brussels prognoses were a warm duke for the government.
A future growth of Italy is expected from 1,1% in 2011 and from 1,4% in 2012, although the budget for the examination is estimated by 1,3% in relation to 2% in 2012.
In these provisions, the EU Commission calculates, the budget performance will be measured in the next year even 4,3% of the PIB (excluding the pre-developed by the Governments) and 3,5% in 2012 (except 2,7%).
This is why the deployment of a new budget collective that could be set after feasts to a sum of 7 billion euros.
"If it is necessary, new steps should be taken," my economic auditer Olli Rehn.
At the time, Italy will take support of international institutions.
"The basic feasts of Italy's economy are okay and its accounts are regulated which we have recovered for a long time," Arrigo Sadun assures Italyn troops of the International Monetary Fund that has been trusted at the IWF with Italy.
"In the moment there are no problems, nor short-term, nor long-term view, since Italy, despite its high debt, (119.2% of the BIP in 2011, A. R.) smaller stabilization forces are requested than other countries," observed Pier Carlo Padoan, Chief of the OECD.
Stay the question after political disappearance.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will be seen against a missile complaint of the Chamber, which could be organized by the elections before the end of March.
It is therefore a little good period for a decision regarding a serious crisis before.
Europeans think about the construction of anti-critical measures after
Christianine Lagarde had expressed it yesterday in the framework of a press conference in Paris: "I believe you have shown it on Sunday afternoon, as well as on the evening: the Europeans are clearly holding together, are ready and engaged to defend their currency as well as their currency area."
Although it was relatively complete - the driving of the interests of the European States obligations was water on the movements of governments and the ECB.
However, from a normalization initiative can not be the speech.
The Rating Agency had announced the Standard & Poor's standard that it could resume the debt mark in Portugal, which might be the most effective objective of the speculators today.
"What in May is a real lack of clarity and political comprehensiveness that is particularly on the bank systems," the view of the External BNP Paribas.
In particular, "the political time is far more slow than the markets".
The European countries, both this climate and the danger that is prevented, are likely to intensify the discussions to strengthen the existing anti-crisis actions.
The informal consultations between the most financial ministries concerned and, in other words, are governed well with their faces of the G20.
This is also in relation to the meetings of Eurogroups and Ecofin the beginning of the next week.

What the EU Stability Fund applies, its executive Director Klaus Regling has already started in Singapour on Sunday its Asian tour to inform the investors in Fert East on the developments of the crisis in Europe.
If the goal of his visits is not expressly foundation, he will certainly prepare the terrain.

Portugal and Spain, the countries in the first set, are sending themselves to translate structural reforms, particularly in the field of labour market organization.
Reforms that are to be achieved in the span actions, but effects in close futures.
Lissabon and Madrid described another way when this Greece and Ireland did.
Although the one, as well as the other, is to avoid each price of needing to provide international assistance before they have put their own budget correction and have decided through unfair structural reforms that have returned their trust to them for a time.
The European Capital Officers reiterate the available options to facilitate the normalization process of the markets of public debts.
Axel Weber, who was on 24 November on the transition in Paris, had first made the idea that if the 750 euro mobilized by Europe and the International Monetary Fund would not be enough, the Union would not take it again to take into the own table.
The people of Barclay's Capital, on the market of the European State Prosecution, urged that an extendion of the 100 billion euros would be extended, "properties" in the form of a direct liability prize.

Snow and glass: 24 apartments in Alarm level Orange
The snow episodes still follow themselves, especially in the secondary transport networks of Britain and are moving to affect different economic activities.
Forty-fourth departments are now present in alarm level orange based on the drought snow and glass risk.
The regions of Eure, Eure-et-Loir, Deux Sevres and Vienna are already reaching 20 apartments from mid-term after midday and two, the Dordogne and the garden, then later night.
According to Meteo France, the intense snow viewers touch the north of the garden and the Chartens, it is easy on the Ele-de-France.
The departments concerned will also be expected to disappear from 2 to 5 cm, including from 7 to 10 cm and 1 to 3 cm, even to 5 cm in the Paris region.
The regions of Charente, Charente-Maritime, Costes d'Armor, Finistère, Gironde, Dordogne, Poitou and the regions of Base-Norway, Ile-de-France and Limousin.
The black cases are vital enough to demonstrate traffic preventions and affect certain economic activities, Madeo France says.
In the region Côtes d'Armor, several regional tracts for swimming transport of more than 7.5 tonnes, including Guingamp-Lannion and Saint-Briuc-Loudéac.
The transport situation of secondary transport networks in Britain is very difficult, and the use of some TER travel buses was split all the day.
In Picardie the school movement for Thursday was raised.
There were no specific restrictive measures for the use of sugar transport on the middle of the grounds.
The prefector "requests the drivers to higher pressure on the roads and the appropriate adaptation of their car maintenance."
The General Directorate-General for Zivile Airway (DGAC) invited the airlines to strike on Thursday 25% of the Paris Airport Roissy and 10% of the flights launched by Orly's expected snow cases.
The DGAB recommends the aircraft to contact its airline.
Gatwick airports in South London and the airport in Edinburgh, Shotland, have been stopped until Thursday morning.
Metro Grande Paris: First financial scenes
Since the debate on the modernization of the transport economy on the Ele-de-France is full, it goes in milliards.
At least in the discussions.
In particular, the 23 billions of Metro Grand Paris are calling for the Metro Grande Paris to be built by the Société du Grand Paris.
In order to lead the building of the SGP to the way, the State has produced a capital allocation of 4 billion euros.
In theoretical scheme, this is the sum that the SGP would then allow the markets to grant a part of the financial sums to their twice.
Today, it was finally arrived to first high accounts.
The 2010 Supplementary Budget of the 2010, transmitting the Financial Committee of the National Assembly, contains the measures provided to take the first part of these money.
It is about two measures: the creation of a special tax for the conclusion and a higher taxation of the offices in the France.
First, that's what you decided in article 15 of the law-development, it is "levantest of the public law-development Société du Grand Paris".
The product of this tax is 117 million euros per year.
Secondly, a new regulation of already existing undertakings is: "for modernization of them, to increase the product resulting from its product and to transmit this increase in society of the Grand Paris".
How much would it take?
A race.
This sum is not mixed in the text.
From the four billions you're far away.
"The tax resources will be made to be added to the 4 billion euros of the capital allocation which will be brought by the State and will be provided by the Grand Paris Society and after the project," the explaining provision is to be taken.
The SGP does not find this system insufficient.
"As the moment you have income (two taxes, etc.), you can discover the projecting over three years and then be created from four billions.
"This is notified in the Budget and then".
The SGP suggests that 2013 will be started to notify four billions for the Budget 2014.
This measure of which 4 billions can be searched for a long time, is a risk, a legal movement, a parliamentary debate.
The first public meeting will be held on 7 December.
Racing hacker and emistic spione
The WikiLeaks Business has a double importance.
On one side, she has discovered herself as a clear scandal, a scanning that is only a scanal in the Store Seenness that rules relations between States, citizens and presses.
On the other hand, it advises deep changes at international level, and gives a prejudice to the future dominated by regression.
But let's go on the line.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is the confirmation of the fact that each act created by a secret service (one of your x displaced nation) is exclusively from a periodic settlement.
The "external", American enthusiasms about the sexual natures of Berlusconis is nothing eligible more than what you've been read over months as well as in each x stay magazine (excl. those whose owner Berlusconi is) and the terrified charitable profile Gaddafis bottles bottlers of cabaret artists have been already long.
The rules that the secret folders can only exist from news already known are essential for the dynamic of the secret services, and not only in this century.
If you go to a library that is ejective, you will recognize that every work (from the gray, the mystery of Renes-le-Chateau, the Temple or the RosenCreuzers) is reacting what is already written in previous works.
It is not only that the author orculte texts would not publish research (although he doesn't know where the news would be found about the non-exist), but because those who are present to the Okcultism are nothing else than believed what they already know and confirm what they have already learned.
This is also the success mechanism of Dan Brown.
Even the secrets.
The informant is fault, and faul (or limited spirits) is also head of the secret service (or otherwise he could be whatever, for example, Redaker at Libation), who only considered true what he recognizes.
The Top Secretariat's information about Berlusconi, which had sent the American news to Rome to the State Departement, were the same as those who had published the newspaper before.
So why was such a resurrection for the enthusiasms of these folders?
On one side, those who knows what everyone has already been formed knowing, and even though the news - at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the government heads are able to call each other or to take a aircraft to meet themselves at the evening - have lost their diplomatic function and have changed, except for some small representations, in Spionage Centers.
Any favorite viewer of subscription films knows this very precisely, and it doesn't happen from severity that you do this to ignore.
However, the fact that it is public to reply, the task of self-heality is to be made and served to put the American diplomation into a bad light.
In second place, the idea that a x-born hacker can borrow the secrets of the most powerful world's world's world's most secrets, brings the significant angry against the prestigious of the State Defence.
Furthermore, the scanal brings less the victims, more than the "covery" in Bedrine.
But let's show us the deep nature of what has happened.
Earlier, at Orwell’s time, all the powers were able to add like a Big Brother, who controlled every guest of his substanties.
Orwell’s prophecy would have been able to correctly determine where every movement can be controlled by the phone, every operated transaction, the visited hotel, the chosen autoway and so further; the citizen would be the whole victim of the power.
However, if you start in front of what is today that even the secret cripters can not be able to disappear on the control of a hacker, the control will be sent to be one-one and will be narrowed.
The power controls every citizen, but at least every citizen, or at least the hacker, chooses as a rush of the citizen, can bring the secrets of power into experience.
How can it be kept a power that is no longer in the way to get true of their own secrets?
It's true, Georg Simmel already said that a real secret is an empty secret (and an empty secret can never be disappeared); it is also true that every knowledge of the character of Berlusconis or Merkels is a secret in the reason of a secret of the secret, because it is the public sphäre, but in the style of WikiLeaks, it is clear that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets, meaning to surround her every power.
WikiLeaks did neither Sarkozy nor Merkel injustice, but acts of Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this restriction added to such power?
It is obviously that the States in the future will not provide any more online information - that would be an extension made on the streets.
But it is so clear that it is forbidden to hope to keep confidence reports on the phone secret.
Nothing is easier to find out whether and when a captain moves into a aircraft and contacted one of his colleagues.
How could certain relations be undertaken in the future and only for some ears?
I am very sure that my presence is at the moment after science and romantics, but I can see that it is necessary to propose the governments to be secretly and in a way to be moved to uncontrolous marshalls, to hide their communications anywhere else than in the blue memory, and also the few written information they have received.
The information would be learned in a single copy of concluded samples: in the reason, the Watergate spectrum had less success as WikiLeaks.
I had the opportunity to write that the technology today's advanced as a cancer, that's the point.
A century after the dry telegraph revolutioned the communication, the Internet reconstructs a telegraph with (telephone) Drah.
The (analogs) Video catalogues had allowed the film researchers to execute a film band for bands by leaving on the backs and all secrets of the mounting, while the (numerical) CDs today could not allow anything other than roll from chapter, so in macroports.
In three hours from Rome to Miland, this is required by aircraft including three hours.
It is therefore not extraordinary that policy and communication technology return to car and horses.
A last observation.
In previous times he tried to understand what the press was mixed for secrets between the messages.
Currently, it is the message that requires confidence information of the press.
Climate: How France enjoys its financial advice
A year after the Copenhagen Treaty, it is time to investigate the maintenance of the fastest financial statements (as known as "Fast Start" or pleasant financing) realised by the developing countries.
And now the green French beautyers have been discovered.
With the Copenhagen Treaty, the developing countries have bound to prepare $30 billion between 2010 and 2012.
The EU has promised 7,2 billion euros over three years, France 1,26 billion euros (t.e. 420 million per year).
In addition to the opening of the COP16, the EU has taken all registers to convince their partners of the fact of their engagement on the Fast Finances: detailed progress report of their Member States, press conference, great neighbourhoods, browser distribution.
Transparency is valuable, and grade is estimated for their real value: developing countries and civil society are pleased to see if all developed countries have made the same precise level at the same level.
The EU announces liberalization in 2010, 2.2 billion euros, which brings the right way to respect their commitment of 7,2 billion in 2012.
But if you look at the detail, the things are a little complex.
This money should be "new and additional" in accordance with the Copenhagen Treaty to ensure that an additional use was introduced without to achieve public development aid.
Unfortunately, there is no consensus about what means "new and additional".
During the EU Commission proposed harmonisation, certain Member States, including France, have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses the right which he looks as the best.
For example, the EU Commission has been a good value for those in 2009: international financing will be maintained and has been provided in the context of the "Fast Start" financing over three years.
Other countries have chosen similar proper values, or for a year or for conditions of public development aid.
In this regard, France was considered that the funding of "new projects" in 2010 was "new and added".
Otherwise expressed: there are no right values for the expenditure of the previous year or at a global level of public development aid.
Concreet said, the total total of the French support of the developing countries can remain steadily (or taking) - France has the obligation to maintain its obligation in respect of the 'new and additional' financing.
Another, decisive element is the encryption in separates and loans.
Moreover, there is no rule, and everyone chooses his wheel mode.
Some, such as France, are 1 € as equivalent to €1 paid.
Apparently, this is only difficult to degrade: the mourning is not comparable.
If the use of loans for certain rentable investments (firstly linked to the emission finalisation projects that can be justified) can be justified on the most effective technology, the euro should be detrimental to present as an equivalent for an euro paid, and only the costs of the tax paid for the capital country should be accompanied as an engagement (e.g. the equivalent of the interest rate).
But France has nothing else in the meaning of the following consideration: it is "revised" its commitment of 420 million, taking 91.5% loans (389.8 million euros) and spends 8.5%) 36.1 million euros - see also the EU document to convince themselves.
France is the only EU country that grants are largely implemented.
Germany requests 46%, while Denmark, the Netherlands or Slovakia (including others) to 100% dependent on their obligations.
Otherwise, if the overall majority of the European Union does expenditure 1€ to meet its obligations, France is only 10 cents, and then understands a comparable use.
Big Hokuspokus!
In general, France covers a dual financing in its fast-start finance: a part of the further development of the action on the time and the other part of the reality of the financial use.
France is able to believe that it has expired 420 million "new and more" in accordance with its promises and is divided to 36.1 million euros.
Manipulation of the Ministry of Finance (as probably it seems that it was Bercy who did the Arbitrage) could be a double negative effect; once EU-interest (for the other Member States continue with the SSB if it's enough to facilitate) and then in the negotiations that have not been completely tackled...
The chapter of the satisfactory funds is only a small issue of relative short time compared to the totality of climate discussions.
But the troops might be too much in the UNFCCC machine.
We hope that this will not be the case.
Like it is always, it is inadequate to learn his lessons from this first year.
Firstly, France could an exchange of its type of retail for the years 2011 and 2012, in the spirit of respect for its obligations and the compensatory justice with the other countries of the European Union.
In particular, France could lead the discussions on the status of the long-term financing (and other, decisive and currently discussed subject): the question of "respectability" or the type of booking of its duties is not to be issued.
France could change its position to continue in terms of combat questions as it is in other things.
The hope is therefore on the new ministry of the environment of Kosciusko-Moriet, which will meet the next week in Cancun.
A surprise announcement on the Fast Star France and its vision of the "Reconciliability" as well as the use of loans would result from nature from the international confidence base that is necessary for further discussions.
Alarm - Pestizide included by children
A child of 10 years takes place over the day 81 different chemical substances, which has been published in this middle of the Generations Futures (the former movement for the protection of the rights and the respect of future generations).
The agreement explains that its results "with the low number of analyzed tests, no statistics meaning, but the illustrational characters of the problems treated," usually had bought the usually in four, from a ten-year-year-old child to the mass-times, more in the Supermas markets in Ocean and Paris.
These typical meal times - including official recommendations of five fresh fruit and fruit, three milk products and 1,5 litres water per day - were studied as well as laboratories' ships in search for chemical substances, pesticides, summer beds and other shopping materials.
Tellerbilanz is low-minded: 81 chemical substances, including 42 as possible or likely creab-related instruments and 5 as a safe carogen classified, as well as 37 substanties with Endokrini, according to several Institutions, such as the International Krebs Research Centre.
"If in the nearly total of cases, legal limits are not overwrite for any chemical, individually included, it is not very good that the reality in which the consumer may be construed with creative substances or substances with endokrini, the career is noted very well," notes the agreement.
Besides the breakfast, only the butter and the tea with milk are already more than ten of the possible residues and three safely demonstrated as carcinogens, as well as more than twenty residues that can affect the hormon system.
The apple was imported from Brazil as an interim measured time for the study shows springs of six chemical substances, including a gangzid prohibited in France.
The same shall apply to the green bottles of Kenya, which included in the middle of the summer, in which the study has established a closely prohibited insect in the EU.
Furthermore, the hacksteak, which was thunfish out of the book, even the baggage and the caugumm of pestziden and other chemical substances.
The analysis of Nitrates and Chloroforms have brought the presence of nitrates.
At dinner, the lake stack was defined with 34, chemical residues on the "pleasingest" and even the plastics used for the refrigerator in the microowle was not charged.
The final risk of this "saadstoff cocktails" for the consumers "actually undervalued", is the study.
The "Alliance Europe Ecology Les Verts" (EE-LV) has proposed its 'consideration of the situation' to introduce a morarium on the use of pesticians to stop the "sumption of civilization diseases".
In July, a study of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) had identified the presence of 365 different pizzas identified in the fruit and vegetables that are consumed in Europe, including 76 feeds.
